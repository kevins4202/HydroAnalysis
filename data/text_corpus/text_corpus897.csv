4485,vast areas of wetlands in the athabasca oil sands region alberta canada have been disturbed for mining and other resource extraction activities in recent years these disturbed areas have become a focus for reclamation activities to improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of constructed ecosystems it is important that we study the production of as well as the inputs and outputs of dissolved organic carbon doc in the system the aim of our study was to investigate the hydrological doc fluxes into a constructed fen in 2015 and 2016 2 and 3 years post construction respectively relative to internal doc production and to assess the potential importance of each source for doc export using doc concentration and quality parameters our results show that while runoff added a small amount of doc in both years doc concentration within the fen is driven largely by increased vegetation production with doc increasing in the years since construction the measured quality indices suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β a all showed that doc present in the system is likely more recently produced and plant sourced there was also little evidence that precipitation and runoff inputs from hillslopes impacted the quality of doc present in the fen while doc export from the fen was minimal as this constructed wetland continues to mature it is important that monitoring of doc continues in order to understand the trajectory of biogeochemical dynamics of the system following vegetation establishment as well as changes under potential future climatic variations keywords dissolved organic carbon humification index fluorescence index freshness index suva254 constructed wetland 1 introduction peatlands within the western boreal plains wbp account for up to 50 of the landscape cover vitt et al 1996 however approximately 950 km2 of the wbp has been disturbed within the athabasca oil sands region aosr through surface mining activities alberta environment and parks 2020 currently there is a requirement for companies extracting bitumen to return the land to equivalent capability alberta government 2013 reclamation following such disturbances requires reconstruction of the landscape as mining completely removes surface vegetation and soil while significantly changing surficial geology price et al 2010 this results in a landscape no longer functioning as it once did in order to rectify this wetland construction has been attempted across the aosr raab and bayley 2013 however efforts to construct peatlands are a relatively recent development due to the hydrological complexity and the long time needed for development of peatlands price et al 2010 in 2013 a fen and surrounding watershed was constructed at a site near fort mcmurray alberta canada to test peatland reclamation the goal of this project was to return ecosystem functions that were present in pre disturbance peatlands and to create a system that allows for peat accumulation and the return of the carbon sink capabilities as dissolved organic carbon doc production and export are important components of peatland carbon balance improved understanding of these processes is critical for evaluating the function of the constructed watershed although previous research from this site has shown than doc concentrations in the fen were initially low khadka et al 2016 the production and export of doc from the watershed is not yet fully understood and are likely to change as the vegetation communities hydrology water chemistry and environmental conditions develop over time dissolved organic carbon is defined as carbon in organic molecules that can pass through a 0 45 μm filter thurman 1985 peatlands have high rates of doc production due to their anoxic organic soils that result in slow microbial decomposition of organic matter moore and dalva 2001 doc production can also be increased by higher rates of plant productivity as plant root exudates are an additional source of doc doc production is impacted by many environmental variables including water table depth strack et al 2008 ion availability kalbitz et al 2000 and temperature freeman et al 2001 the structure of doc is dependent on its source as well as the amount of degradation it has undergone robroek et al 2016 there are various spectrophotometric and fluorescence indices that can be used to provide information on the quality of doc and whether it derives from the breaking down of older organic matter or whether it is newer more labile doc from fresh vegetation inputs relevant doc absorbance indices include the absorbance ratio e2 e3 ratio of absorbance of light at 250 and 365 nm and the specific uv absorbance suva higher suva can indicate more aromatic doc compounds weishaar et al 2003 while the inverse occurs with e2 e3 with high values indicating low aromaticity and low molecular weight absorption of light at shorter wavelengths ultraviolet is more common within carbohydrates whereas conjugated systems such as alkenes and aromatics absorb light within the uv vis spectrum 190 780 µm peacock et al 2014 fluorescence is the emission of light that can be measured as electrons return to ground state from an excited state when exposed to a photon valeur 2001 common doc fluorescence indices include the fluorescence index fi humification index hix and freshness index β α the humification index hix has been previously used in aquatic bourbonniere 2010 and terrestrial kalbitz et al 2003 landscapes to determine the degree of humification of organic carbon sources the fluorescence index fi can be used to indicate the degree of microbial or terrestrial contribution to the doc pool with lower fi values indicating microbial influence and higher fi values indicating greater terrestrial inputs cory and mcknight 2005 the freshness index β α has also been used to indicate the relative age of organic compounds with β referring to the amount of recently produced autochthonous organic matter and α being associated with older allochthonous organic matter wilson and xenopoulos 2008 these absorbance ratios and indices are useful tools to determine sources of doc to the peatland and potentially determine peatland development and trajectory within constructed wetland complexes dissolved organic carbon concentrations and quality are important to monitor together as this interaction can have variable effects on carbon losses and the fate of doc in downstream ecosystems the amount of doc export can vary between hydrological sources but it will also change within each source depending on the volume of water transported and doc molecular weight and chemical composition large precipitation events that result in large volumes of surface runoff often represent a significant portion of the doc output in boreal ecosystems eimers et al 2015 and can mobilize a greater array of doc compounds however snowmelt and the spring freshet can have highly variable contributions across upland and wetland environments as snowmelt can account for a greater proportion of annual doc export in forestlands compared to wetlands laudon et al 2004 this relationship has also been shown to vary inter annually jager et al 2008 determined that snowmelt represented a larger proportion of doc export in dry years compared to wet years when the contribution to runoff in response to rainfall events increases though there is strong evidence that dry conditions increase degradation of organic material strack et al 2008 this also results in less surface runoff and an overall decrease in doc export during the dry period jager et al 2008 davidson et al 2019 although doc export may then be elevated upon subsequent rewetting strack et al 2015 dissolved organic carbon production can also increase following peatland construction through the dewatering transportation and placement of donor peat that results in the breakdown of organic matter this soil disturbance also eliminates systematic layering within the peat profile resulting in a greater distribution of small pores as the pore structure typical of the upper layer in undisturbed peatlands is not present nwaishi et al 2016 this new peat structure limits water and doc transport rezanezhad et al 2016 and compounds the effect of limited mobility for larger doc molecules however systems that promote surface runoff reduce the amount of water interacting with the soil reducing dissolution of large complex doc compounds strack et al 2011 therefore it is important to determine which process is dominant whether it is surface flow or groundwater flow during outflow events the relative contribution of doc sources is difficult to predict when working in natural systems and may be more unpredictable when assessing disturbed restored or constructed environments assessing doc dynamics can become more complex when considering hydrological inputs and outputs from wetlands the magnitude of which may have significant impacts on the doc budget of a system early post construction doc dynamics have been quantified within the constructed fen khadka et al 2016 however the importance of doc inputs from external sources i e runoff groundwater precipitation to the fen have not been investigated additionally it is unknown whether these external sources are important for export doc quantity and quality this study aims to quantify hydrological doc fluxes from the catchment into a constructed fen relative to internal doc production and will assess the potential importance of each source for doc export using doc concentration and quality indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in a constructed watershed 56 55 944 n 111 25 035 w approximately 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta it consists of an upland fen system surrounded by three previously reclaimed hillslopes and one natural hillslope the constructed fen known as the nikanotee fen is 3 ha while the entire watershed encompasses 32 ha fig 1 measurements were made in the third and fourth year post construction between may and august 2015 but only in july and august 2016 due to the horse river wildfire that occurred in may 2016 and limited access to the study site until july the constructed fen is composed of 2 m of peat collected from a fen dewatered for two years prior to extraction placed on 50 cm of highly permeable petroleum coke and 50 cm of tailings sand daly et al 2012 construction was completed in january 2013 while vegetation planting did not finish until july 2013 vegetation planted on site was predominantly carex aquatilis juncus balticus with moss layer transfer quinty and rochefort 2003 and bare control cover types also included typha spp spontaneously colonized the site covering between one quarter to one third of the fen area by 2016 seedlings used for vascular establishment were propagated in a commercial nursery borkenhagen and cooper 2019 donor material used for the moss layer transfer was collected from a rich fen 10 km from the site and applied in july 2013 at a 1 10 area ratio of donor to constructed site borkenhagen and cooper 2019 at the north east edge of the constructed fen is a spillbox that conducts surface flow from the fen to a storage pond down gradient of the fen fig 1 south of the fen is a transition zone between the fen and upland delineated by the presence of the petroleum coke layer that extends approximately 100 m beyond the margin of the fen at the base of the tailings sand both the transition zone and the upland further to the south act as recharge zones and are covered with 30 50 cm of lfh i e forest floor mineral mix overlying up to 3 m of tailings sand sutton and price 2020 the tailings sand and closer to the fen the petroleum coke layer conduct water towards the fen a geosynthetic clay liner underlies the fen and tailings sand upland daly et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2017 the upland has a 3 basal grade to direct water towards the fen price et al 2010 in the fall of 2013 the surface of the lfh mineral mix was furrowed perpendicular to the direction of slope to detain surface water and thereby increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff recharge basins lfh mineral layer removed 400 1500 m2 located south upgradient of hummock landforms fig 1 were also incorporated into the southern upland to promote water detention and infiltration in tandem with the furrows kessel et al 2018 the upland vegetation comprises primarily forbs and grasses of which 66 were native species gingras hill et al 2018 water percolates through tailings sand producing a relatively saline groundwater source average 2013 2016 electrical conductivity ec 2700 µs cm 1 kessel et al 2018 kessel et al 2018 showed that recharged groundwater mobilized salts through the tailings sand towards the underdrain and upwards into the fen peat because of the essentially impermeable geosynthetic clay liner all water losses from the system are represented through evapotranspiration and surface outflow from the spillbox surrounding the fen and upland are three reclaimed slopes comprising 50 cm of peat mineral mix on 100 cm of a secondary capping layer low sodic soil ketcheson and price 2016 the peat mineral mix is created using peat that has been over stripped and mixed with the underlying glacial mineral sediments meiers et al 2006 the east slope 8 1 ha was reclaimed in 2007 and revegetated in 2008 the southeast 8 2 ha and west 2 4 ha slopes were reclaimed in 2011 and revegetated in 2012 ketcheson and price 2016 2 2 precipitation precipitation was measured using a te525mm te525m tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronics usa located within the upland one manual gauge was placed on each of the north end of the fen the west and east slopes and two were placed in the upland manual gauges for measuring precipitation were used to collect water samples from each rain event when sufficient sample was available water from the manual gauge in the fen was used otherwise samples from the east and west slope gauges were combined to create one sample gauges were flushed with de ionized water di between events to limit algae and microbial growth however concentrations occasionally exceeded the expected range 1 3 mg l 1 fraser et al 2001 due to algal growth in this case doc concentrations from precipitation samples at the nearby poplar fen 8 4 km were used instead spectrophotometric indices were collected for precipitation samples however fluorescence spectroscopy was not measured due to limited water available for sampling 2 3 surface water one flume was placed on each of the east west and southeast slopes fig 1 the east and west flumes were placed mid slope while the southeast flume was placed at a higher position due to limitations from erosion through the peat mineral mix caused by high flows from that hillslope in addition three enclosed runoff collectors fig 1 were placed mid slope on the east and west slopes and upper slope on the south east slope in 2016 to mimic slope positions of the respective flumes their placement was outside the catchment boundary of the flumes fig 1 enclosed runoff collectors were also placed in the transition zone within the upland in an east west transect flumes and collectors were constructed using metal siding that was dug into the ground 5 cm and cemented in place using quikrete hydraulic water stop cement fig s1 the flumes drained into a 23 l bucket that had a v notch outflow a calibration curve was created and used to estimate discharge based on the height of water above the notch a well with a pressure transducer schlumberger mini diver or an odyssey capacitive water level logger was placed in each flume bucket to monitor within event runoff at a 15 minute time interval runoff collectors from enclosed plots also drained into 23 l buckets following runoff events the volume of water within each bucket was measured buckets were covered with an opaque tarp to limit the impacts of ultra violet radiation on doc quality and concentration and to prevent changes in volume through direct precipitation inputs doc samples were collected within 24 h following the end of the precipitation event contributing area to flumes was estimated by completing topographic surveys on each hillslope using a topcon hiper gl rtk gps system tokyo japan issues with pressure transducer function resulted in large portions of the seasonal runoff being missed in both 2015 on the west slope and west and east slope in 2016 as such the west east and upland runoff was estimated using runoff collectors in 2016 to estimate runoff in 2015 a multiple linear regression was used in which runoff depth was plotted against precipitation p size and maximum p intensity west slope r2 0 91 or average p intensity upland r2 0 4 for runoff collectors in 2016 these relationships were then used to estimate runoff depth on contributing areas in 2015 west upland doc samples were collected from flumes and runoff collectors in 2016 and average doc concentration for each event was applied to runoff volume across each contributing area to estimate total doc mobilized in 2015 buckets below flumes consistently contained algae introducing potential error to doc concentration measurements therefore the average seasonal doc concentration in 2016 on hillslopes and the upland was used to estimate 2015 doc fluxes as there was no correlation between concentration and runoff depth across all contributing areas 2 4 groundwater ten piezometer nests were sampled from across the constructed fen targeting the layers within peat 30 50 90 150 cm and the petroleum coke layer 275 cm that conducts groundwater to the fen all piezometers were constructed from pvc pipe 2 54 cm inner diameter with a 20 cm slotted intake and wrapped with filter sock groundwater flux was calculated using darcy s law 1 q q a k sat dh d l where q is the specific discharge m s 1 q is the volumetric discharge m3 s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the flow face m2 and dh dl is the hydraulic gradient i e the change in head dh divided by the change in length dl between the measurement points unitless specific discharge fluxes to the fen through the petroleum coke underdrain were estimated using the vertical hydraulic gradient between the piezometers installed in the coke layer beneath the fen and the water table in the fen for each nest in the fen on each measurement date once weekly using eq 1 ketcheson et al 2017 groundwater entering the fen in the transition zone from tailings sand directly to peat i e horizontal flow was estimated to be 4 6 mm in 2014 or 1 5 of the total groundwater input sutton and price 2020 and therefore was considered negligible hence the flow face used for flux calculations is the fen area and total distance is fen peat depth nwaishi et al 2016 reported that the peat displayed isotropic ksat but had layered heterogeneity through the profile so the equivalent vertical hydraulic conductivity through the system of layers within the peat deposit kz was estimated at each nest using the harmonic mean that considers the weighted influence of each layer freeze and cherry 1979 2 k z d i 1 4 n d i k i where d is the total thickness of the peat deposit 2 0 m and di and ki are the thickness and saturated hydraulic conductivity of each peat layer respectively field measurements of ksat were conducted using bail tests within piezometers in the fen following the hydrostatic time lag method hvorslev 1951 all nests had triplicate manual measurements of ksat at 50 90 and 150 cm depths in 2015 and 2016 with the 30 cm depth added in 2016 piezometer slots represented the center of each peat layer used to estimate kz refer to ketcheson et al 2017 for more details regarding hydraulic conductivity estimates and groundwater flux calculations 2 5 doc concentration and chemistry analysis water samples were extracted from piezometers once each month during the growing season in june august 2015 and july august 2016 for doc concentration and spectrophotometric samples in july 2015 piezometers within the tailings sand below the fen were also sampled for fluorescence spectroscopy all piezometers were purged minimum three well volumes 24 h prior to extraction all samples were extracted using a 12 v peristaltic pump with vinyl tubing and each soil type had designated tubing to minimize contamination all tubing was flushed with de ionized water prior to sampling samples were taken from 10 nests that covered the central e w transect through the fen and the peripheral n s transects along the east and west hillslope for water samples collected from all study locations a volume of water 50 ml was collected into a clean reservoir for in field measurements of environmental variables electrical conductivity ph temperature an electrical conductivity ec and temperature t probe thermo scientific orion conductivity and temperature probe and a ph probe thermo scientific orion economy series ph combination electrode were inserted into the collected volume ec probes were calibrated monthly to 1413 μs cm and ph probes were three point calibrated to a ph of 4 7 and 10 before every daily use after the above procedures another water sample was taken in a clean 60 ml high density polyethylene vial and 40 ml amber borosilicate vial and stored in a cooler until they were returned that day to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c for samples collected on hillslopes if a secondary volume was not available the initial collected volume was used for doc analysis samples were filtered within 24 h through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters then decanted into 60 ml vials for doc concentration and spectrophotometric analysis and 40 ml borosilicate vials for fluorescence spectroscopy analysis samples were analyzed using a perkinelmer uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 35 to measure absorbance at 250 nm 254 nm and 365 nm wavelengths the concentration of doc was determined using a shimadzu toc analyzer environmental sciences program university of calgary by the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method and analytical error was 0 2 mg l 1 as toc was determined on filtered samples this represents doc in 2015 a 20 subset of samples was selected to measure doc and values were then correlated with absorbance at 250 nm a250 to estimate doc for all samples peacock et al 2014 separate correlations were constructed for each potential doc source with r2 0 75 in all cases groundwater doc 79 137 a250

mcmaster university on a horiba jobin yvon aqualog machine aqualog using recommended manufacturer calibrations and software corrections for inner filter effects the samples were kept out of the light and were allowed to reach room temperature prior to analysis quartz cuvettes were used to run the samples through the aqualog the cuvettes were first soaked in 50 nitric acid and bathed for 24 h then thoroughly rinsed in deionized water prior to sample analysis the fluorescence index cory and mcknight 2005 was used to determine if the dissolved organic matter was terrestrially 1 6 or microbially derived 1 6 3 a t a n e x c i t a t i o n o f 370 n m emission a t 470 n m emission a t 520 n m the freshness index wilson and xenopoulos 2008 was used to indicate the relative proportion of recently

suva 254 absorbance a t 254 n m cm 1 d o c m g l 1 100 c m m 1 e2 e3 helms et al 2008 was used to assess the relative molecular weight of the organic structure present in which a high e2 e3 value indicates a low molecular weight 7 e 2 e 3 absorbance a t 250 n m absorbance a t 365 n m 2 6 fen doc storage total doc stored within the fen was calculated using average doc concentration within each layer in the peat as delineated by piezometer depths the mid point between each piezometer screen depth determined the boundaries of the depth over which doc concentration was applied as such the ranges for doc mass calculations were 0 40 40 70 70 120 and 120 200 cm porosity as determined by ketcheson et al 2017 was used to calculate the volume available for water storage porosity from 0 to 50 cm 0 92 was used for piezometer depths of 40 and 50 cm porosity for 50 200 cm 0 87 was used for all other depths average doc concentration from each sampled depth at all piezometer depths was used as there was no spatial relationship of doc concentration across the fen the depth of water within the peat column was set at 1775 mm and was used for both years as measured water table changes between years did not vary from this value by 10 and to limit bias of water table change on doc storage estimates the change in fen doc storage δ fen storage was then calculated as the difference between doc storage on the last and first day of sampling in each study season 2 7 doc export and balance to determine the contribution of doc production within the fen compared to external inputs the fen doc production was determined using 8 net fen doc production fen storage docp p docrslope rslope docgw gw docq q where docx is the doc concentration in each water source p is precipitation rslope is runoff from constructed hillslopes and uplands gw is groundwater flow into the fen and q is outflow from the v notch weir 2 8 statistical analysis r version 3 5 2 r core team 2016 was used for all statistical analyses all variables were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test prior to analysis log transformation was performed when data did not meet the requirement for normality a linear mixed effect model function lme in the package nlme pinheiro et al 2015 was used to test the effect of runoff source on doc concentration and quality where the sampling cycle was treated as a random factor to account for repeated measures another linear mixed effects model was used to test for differences between treatments and depths within the constructed fen with the sampling cycle once again used as a random effect when there was a significant effect a tukey post hoc analysis function glht package multcomp hothorn et al 2008 was used to assess differences between locations multiple linear regressions were used to model runoff depth based on precipitation intensity average for upland maximum for hillslopes and precipitation size as described in 2 3 surface water a significance of p 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 input of doc into the nikanotee fen during the study period in 2015 may 1st august 20th the total rainfall was 107 mm which is less than the average amount of 245 mm for this time period 1981 2010 fort mcmurray a station environment and climate change canada 2017 in 2015 the maximum precipitation intensity measured was 8 6 mm hr 1 while in 2016 the maximum value was 9 4 mm hr 1 additionally though the exceedance curves follow a similar pattern there were a greater number of total observed events in 2016 therefore there were a higher total number of high intensity precipitation events in 2016 average standard deviation doc concentration from rain was 4 7 1 5 mg l 1 thus the amount of doc that fell on the fen over the study period was 0 50 g m 2 in july and august of 2016 precipitation totalled 103 mm average doc concentration was 4 41 0 78 mg l 1 thus the doc that entered the fen through rainfall was 0 45 g m 2 in 2015 and 2016 the suva254 of doc in precipitation was 3 3 1 0 and 3 0 0 7 l mg 1 m 1 and e2 e3 values were 3 65 1 85 and 2 93 0 49 respectively data for manual piezometer measurements in 2016 were not collected before july 1st therefore groundwater flux estimates in 2016 are restricted to july and august groundwater inputs in july and august to the fen were larger in 2015 compared to 2016 in 2015 from a nest located centrally in the upland fig 1 the water table was at least 25 cm higher within the upland than in the fen at the beginning of may reaching a maximum of 55 cm by day 230 fig 2 this difference is reflected in the vertical hydraulic gradients seen within the fen fig s2 following ground ice melt the gradient between the upland and fen increased fig 2 therefore the vertical hydraulic gradient increased upwards through the fen peat fig s2 in 2015 increased vertical gradients coincided with an increase in upland water table after day 180 in contrast in july and august of 2016 the difference in water table between the fen and upland was smaller and was more variable fig 2 following a precipitation event on day 213 the water table increased within the fen and was at the same level as that observed in the central upland piezometer this small difference in water tables was reflected in the small vertical hydraulic gradients in the fen measured in 2016 fig s2 values measured were all near zero limiting groundwater inputs to the fen through july and august hydraulic conductivity did not significantly change from 2015 to 2016 at 50 90 and 150 cm fig s2 and therefore groundwater flux into the fen was dependent on the vertical hydraulic gradients total groundwater input over the study periods in 2015 and 2016 was 38 mm 112 days and 8 mm 51 days respectively doc concentration in the petroleum coke layer in 2015 and 2016 did not significantly differ though concentrations were generally higher in 2016 fig s3 total doc inputs through groundwater were 1 3 and 0 6 g m2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively e2 e3 also did not change seasonally or between years though suva254 decreased in 2016 indicating less aromatic doc was transported towards the fen table 1 fig s3 when measured in july average standard deviation values for fi β α and hix in groundwater samples in the petroleum coke layer were 1 72 0 02 1 23 0 03 and 0 58 0 01 respectively table 1 in 2015 the west slope produced the largest depth of runoff at 3 8 mm fig 3 a followed by the southeast slope however in 2016 the southeast slope had the largest runoff depth at 6 9 mm in both years the upland and east slope produced very little runoff 2 mm when runoff depth was normalised to fen area in 2015 the southeast slope produced the most runoff at 7 4 mm fig 3b the normalised values for upland and east slope runoff were 1 7 and 0 1 mm respectively in 2016 this pattern continued as the southeast slope had the largest runoff depth when normalised to the fen area and the east slope produced the smallest amount of runoff as doc concentrations did not vary between contributing areas table 1 the southeast slope had the largest doc flux followed by the west slope upland then east slope in both years fig 4 however as the southeast slope is located at the south end of the system and the east and west slopes have portions of their delineated border shared directly with the fen fig 1 it is difficult to quantify the total amount of doc that reaches the fen from each area though doc concentration did not vary between contributing areas doc quality was significantly different between locations specifically between upland and hillslopes for spectrophotometric indices suva254 lme f3 63 6 7 p 0 0005 and e2 e3 lme f3 63 6 8 p 0 0004 were significantly lower and higher in the upland compared to southeast and west slopes respectively e2 e3 was significantly lower on the east slope and though not significant still suva254 was also higher compared to the upland fluorescence spectroscopy indices also display significant differences across locations fi lme f3 41 10 8 p 0 001 and β α lme f3 41 13 1 p 0 001 were greater in the upland relative to values on the west and southeast slopes table 1 3 2 doc export from the nikanotee fen in 2015 the majority of discharge occurred during the first two weeks of the field season coinciding with the post snowmelt freshet culminating in 7 mm of surface runoff lost through the v notch weir fig 5 doc concentrations ranged from 20 to 77 mg l 1 and there was no significant relationship between discharge rate and doc concentration however within the spring freshet doc concentration was generally higher during low flow events the majority of doc lost through the study period was exported during spring freshet transporting 0 5 g m 2 of doc out of the system there was a secondary discharge event at the end of july that coincided with a large precipitation event this resulted in the remaining doc exported totalling 0 7 g m 2 released during the 2015 growing season in 2016 as the spring freshet had been missed there were limited outflow events captured however two were observed at the end of july and mid august maximum discharge rate was 0 4 l s 1 with both occurrences of outflow corresponding to large precipitation events fig 5 during these events doc concentration increased as discharge rate decreased fig 5 although there were comparable doc concentrations observed during the 2015 spring freshet the total doc exported during july and august 51 days was only 0 1 g m 2 less than observed 0 26 g m 2 over the same time period in 2015 doc quality in discharge exhibited no trends in 2015 table 1 suva254 consistently ranged from 2 to 3 l mg 1 m 1 regardless of discharge rate e2 e3 also exhibited the same pattern as it ranged from between 7 and 8 despite changes in discharge only three samples were analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy one sample collected on may 29th had a hix value of 0 68 fi of 1 6 and β α of 0 99 the two remaining samples were obtained july 23rd and 24th the average standard deviation hix increased to 0 80 0 01 while fi and β α decreased to 1 51 0 02 and 0 76 0 01 respectively in contrast in 2016 as discharge decreased following precipitation events e2 e3 and suva254 decreased and increased respectively the range of values for suva254 also increased to 3 5 l mg 1 m 1 and e2 e3 decreased to 5 this indicates that exported doc increased in size and aromaticity from 2015 to 2016 table 1 in contrast fluorescence spectroscopy indices displayed minimal variability during both outflow events 3 3 doc concentration quality and net production within the nikanotee fen mean doc concentration measured in fen piezometer at 50 cm depth increased from 30 2 9 3 to 38 3 12 8 mg l 1 between june and august in 2015 and 36 9 14 1 to 43 5 13 3 mg l 1 between july and august in 2016 the doc concentration was highest in the near surface peat depth within the peat profile had a significant impact on doc concentration lme f7 51 1 4 24 p 0 001 in 2015 all depths in the peat profile had significantly higher doc concentrations than in petroleum coke or tailings sand within the peat profile near surface 30 50 cm had significantly higher p 0 01 doc concentrations than at 150 cm fig 6 in 2016 depth again had a significant impact on doc concentration lme f6 63 5 98 p 0 001 the total mass of doc in june 2015 was 55 4 g m 2 increasing to 77 7 g m 2 by august 2015 in 2016 the total mass of doc in july was 61 7 g m 2 increasing to 84 4 g m 2 by august the overall doc concentration storage value in the fen was 38 2 7 7 and 38 6 7 4 mg l 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively table 2 doc quality also varied through the fen profile having characteristics that indicate it was less aromatic lower suva254 smaller higher e2 e3 and more microbial sourced higher fi in mineral layers relative to peat layers in 2015 the profile at the nikanotee fen showed no seasonal change in suva254 and e2 e3 in 2016 there was a significant increase in suva254 from july to august lme f1 133 6 44 p 0 012 this was due to an increase at 75 and 90 cm depths fig s4 however e2 e3 did not show a corresponding change in values β α lme f5 57 11 56 p 0 001 fi lme f5 57 13 6 p 0 001 and hix lme f5 57 11 3 p 0 001 varied significantly with depth β α and fi were significantly higher p 0 001 in mineral layers relative to peat samples while hix was significantly lower in mineral layers p 0 001 however all fluorescence indices were similar within peat layers net doc production in 2015 and 2016 was 20 9 5 0 and 21 6 4 1 g m 2 overall inputs to the fen decreased in 2016 due to the limited groundwater inputs although this could be impacted by the shorter measurement period as runoff and precipitation were comparable to 2015 outflow also decreased though inputs and outputs had little effect on the total doc within the fen as the dominant doc input was through internal production table 2 net doc production did not vary between years as the seasonal increase in doc concentration through the fen profile did not change significantly from 2015 to 2016 however it is important to note that the net doc production in 2016 was calculated based on data for only july and august and excluded may and june therefore it is likely that net doc production in 2016 was actually greater than in 2015 4 discussion since its construction in 2013 doc concentration in pore water in nikanotee fen has increased from 30 4 mg l 1 in 2013 khadka et al 2016 to 44 6 mg l 1 by 2016 in 50 cm piezometers overall spectrophotometric properties of this doc indicate that it now contains more low molecular weight and less aromatic compounds table 1 our results indicate that while doc was being added to the system as runoff from the surrounding hillslopes and through groundwater the main contributor to the growing doc pool in the fen was internal production at the same time developing soil properties and plant communities throughout the watershed affected the sources of water and doc to the fen 4 1 transport of doc into the nikanotee fen doc concentration in precipitation was slightly higher than the range 1 3 mg l 1 previously reported for boreal ecosystems fraser et al 2001 moore and dalva 2001 in 2015 4 67 mg l 1 and 2016 4 41 mg l 1 precipitation had comparable suva254 and low e2 e3 values relative to what is seen in the fen indicating that doc in precipitation is dominated by large non aromatic compounds likens et al 1983 however though the size of doc compounds differs in precipitation compared to the fen individual inputs of precipitation are unlikely to change fen doc quality as the mass of doc within the fen is dramatically larger than the addition through precipitation doc exports from hillslopes and runoff were much larger in 2016 compared to 2015 this is likely due to the difference in the precipitation intensity between years as precipitation intensity was higher in 2016 and the total number of high intensity events was greater there was more overland flow overland flow was also observed within this watershed in 2013 and 2014 ketcheson and price 2016 with the east slope producing 1 and 6 mm compared to 52 and 73 mm on the west slope in 2013 and 2014 respectively within the present study surface runoff on the southeast and west slope also exceeded that on the east slope this was likely due in part to differences in infiltration rates ketcheson and price 2016 vegetation cover was more extensive and mature on the east slope and this has been shown to promote infiltration in reclamation soils thompson et al 2010 doc concentration did not vary between slope locations though runoff depth varied between contributing areas indicating that construction materials and or time post construction do not impact doc in solution for surface runoff but has an overall impact on doc transported to the fen however doc quality was affected by post construction conditions doc on the west and southeast slopes appeared terrestrially sourced based on low fi values johnson et al 2006 observed limited interaction of water with soil components during overland flow particularly as runoff increases decreasing dissolution of doc from soils therefore doc from the southeast and west slope is more characteristic of doc terrestrially produced at the surface rather than those produced from sub surface processes the upland and east slope displayed fi values closer to 1 6 indicating a mix of terrestrial and microbial influences this may be due to the longer time since reclamation for the east slope relative to other slopes and the upland allowing greater establishment of microbial communities and greater soil water interaction through macropores created by rooting systems wilcox et al 2015 the upland had the highest fi values indicating the largest proportion of microbially sourced doc as the upland has had the shortest time post construction to establish the vegetation community has also had the least amount of time to develop and therefore may have produced a less terrestrial signature though all runoff is assumed to reach the fen from all contributing areas in the fen doc budget it is not likely the case and a large portion of the runoff will be directed through the upland while this limits the direct contribution from those slopes their doc may also take on a quality closer to that of the upland through mixing of slope sources prior to reaching the fen groundwater represented the largest hydrological input of doc to the nikanotee fen in 2015 but only contributed 1 2 g m 2 however the amount of water entering the fen in 2015 and 2016 38 mm and 8 mm respectively was much smaller than reported by ketcheson et al 2017 in 2014 177 mm thus displaying important inter annual variability groundwater doc concentrations were comparable to other boreal peatlands waddington and roulet 1997 though not significant there was an overall increase in groundwater doc concentration in 2016 but decline in doc input that was likely due to the lower water table in the upland compared to 2015 this indicates that the doc flux towards the fen is more dependent on the volume of groundwater discharge to the fen than variability in doc concentration khadka et al 2015 found that very little doc was produced from the upland tailings sand however as a large mass of tailings sand is present within the upland it is possible that dissolution into percolating water may cause an accumulation of doc in groundwater over time spectophotometric indices of groundwater doc indicated that it was low molecular weight with low aromaticity fig s4 we interpret this patten as indicative of adsorption of larger molecules to mineral soils during transport 4 2 doc concentration and quality within the nikanotee fen dissolved organic carbon concentrations across both years within the fen were higher than to those measured by khadka et al 2016 in the first two years post construction and similar to nearby reference fens davidson et al 2019 however it is unlikely that doc is sourced through comparable processes at nikanotee fen and reference fens all indices indicated that the doc within the fen is smaller more recently produced terrestrially sourced and less recalcitrant compared to natural sites davidson et al 2019 the low suva254 values indicate doc with a low aromaticity while the high β α values highlights the doc has been recently produced this is a characteristic of plant sourced doc as root exudates and fresh litter will typically result in doc with a less humic character than microbially sourced doc khadka et al 2016 predicted that the doc sourced within the fen would shift from microbially produced to plant sourced as vegetation cover established vegetation productivity has increased since construction with above and below ground biomass increasing over time borkenhagen and cooper 2019 messner 2019 following planting in july 2013 aboveground biomass was 395 g m 2 by august 2014 and increased to 532 g m 2 by 2016 with belowground biomass reaching over 1500 g m 2 in 2016 messner 2019 the large increase in doc concentration and shifts in doc quality from 2013 to 2016 is likely linked to this productivity it has been shown that post restoration responses of doc quality indicated higher e2 e3 and lower suva254 values compared to nearby unrestored sites strack et al 2015 attributed to greater vascular plant cover and increase in root exudates microbial activity may also be promoted due to the rhizosphere priming effect kuzyakov 2002 and could explain why the doc quality within the fen appears more plant sourced given that the quality indices within the fen appear largely plant sourced for example low aromaticity suva254 3 l mg1 m 1 there is little evidence that the doc sources from hillslopes and groundwater have made a measurable impact on doc quality additionally the input of doc concentration from the hillslopes is small compared to the pool of doc present within the fen and therefore it is of little surprise that they have little impact on the quality of the doc yet the hillslope effect on local conditions in the transition zone and mineral peat interface may play a role in microbial community structure a phenomenon that requires further investigation overall the difference in quality of the doc in the fen combined with the estimated internal production value of 20 g m 2 further supports an internally produced plant sourced doc pool 4 3 doc export from the nikanotee fen precipitation events coupled with high water tables significantly increased outflow thus doc export from the fen however dry conditions became more important once the discharge from snowmelt had dissipated additional doc was likely exported with snowmelt in early spring prior to our study period but would be limited by frozen soils that reduce the interaction of water with the peat davidson et al 2019 outflow events from june august of both years were a result of large precipitation events whereas almost all outflow in may 2015 was due to the spring freshet the water table from june to august of 2015 commonly fell below the height of the v notch and precipitation had less of an impact on discharge compared to that in a wet year this trend was amplified in 2016 despite a greater precipitation input in 2016 there was less outflow due to depleted water storage within the fen from 2015 to 2016 this has been observed in other boreal peatlands where there is a lag between annual precipitation inputs and changes in water storage devito et al 2012 groundwater can be an important vector for export of doc from peatlands waddington and roulet 1997 olefeldt et al 2013 however the nikanotee fen is designed to isolate the system from groundwater losses groundwater movement occurs upward through the fen peat and thus contributes to surface water discharge the small groundwater input from the upland was insufficient to raise the water level within the fen to generate doc export for much of the 2015 and 2016 study period as groundwater input was limited to 38 mm in 2015 it is unlikely that the doc brought into the fen from groundwater impacted the amount of doc exported this is supported by doc quality data although suva254 and e2 e3 values in groundwater samples were comparable to doc quality observed in the outflow in 2015 all fluorescence spectroscopy indices differed markedly between groundwater and outflow samples groundwater doc quality also differed from that at the outflow in 2016 suva254 values decreased from 2015 indicating a lower degree of aromaticity reinforcing doc transport data that suggests groundwater transport represents a small portion of the fen doc budget and subsequently has little impact on doc export therefore although doc is transported to the fen via groundwater the small volume of groundwater results in it contributing very little to the doc that is exported it will likely take multiple years for doc from groundwater to reach the outflow and any specific quality signature will be lost by mixing with the large pool of doc produced within the fen when comparing doc quality at the outflow to runoff all indices fall within comparable ranges table 1 as samples on hillslopes were only collected in 2016 this is the only year being used for comparison to outflow suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β α values from runoff were all similar to values observed at the outflow specifically surface runoff also represented a negligible input of doc to the fen relative to the net doc production within the fen this is in part due to the alternative potential pathways for runoff prior to its arrival at the fen as the southeast slope has no direct contact with the fen and is directly upstream of a recharge basin most of its surface runoff percolates to groundwater storage kessel et al 2018 on the east and west slope only a small portion of their boundary is shared with the fen so much of their surface runoff was directed through the upland where it was detained by furrows eventually recharging the upland aquifer consequently the volume of runoff thus doc from the upland and hillslopes was small and it is unlikely that any runoff has a significant impact on doc export the outflow doc quality may have changed from 2015 to 2016 due to the volume of discharge as opposed to the actual doc quality within the fen in 2015 the majority of export occurred during the spring freshet during which time the surface was largely frozen as the fen is also proximally closest to the spillbox relative to other locations within this catchment water is channeled directly from the fen to the outflow point as such 3 4 years post construction doc export from the catchment is dominated by doc sourced from vegetation growth in the fen however the proportion of each doc input may change over time particularly as vegetation growth and community structure stabilize 5 conclusions this study investigated the input output and production of doc in a constructed fen watershed in the athabasca oil sands region alberta canada results indicate that while a small amount of doc was added to the fen itself through runoff each year the growing pool of doc within fen pore water is coming from internal production through increased vegetation productivity doc concentrations within the fen have increased in the four years since construction and are now at similar levels to nearby reference sites however the doc quality indices measured in this study suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β a all indicate that the doc in the system is more recently produced and it is likely that the majority of doc is plant sourced rather than older microbially produced doc furthermore there was little evidence to support that runoff from the surrounding hillslopes and precipitation inputs have an impact on the quality of the doc within the constructed fen finally doc export from the system was minimal due to the nature of the constructed site created to isolate the system from groundwater losses as the system continues to mature it is important that monitoring of doc concentration and quality is continued to understand how the biogeochemical and hydrological conditions of this watershed will adapt to both localised

4485,vast areas of wetlands in the athabasca oil sands region alberta canada have been disturbed for mining and other resource extraction activities in recent years these disturbed areas have become a focus for reclamation activities to improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of constructed ecosystems it is important that we study the production of as well as the inputs and outputs of dissolved organic carbon doc in the system the aim of our study was to investigate the hydrological doc fluxes into a constructed fen in 2015 and 2016 2 and 3 years post construction respectively relative to internal doc production and to assess the potential importance of each source for doc export using doc concentration and quality parameters our results show that while runoff added a small amount of doc in both years doc concentration within the fen is driven largely by increased vegetation production with doc increasing in the years since construction the measured quality indices suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β a all showed that doc present in the system is likely more recently produced and plant sourced there was also little evidence that precipitation and runoff inputs from hillslopes impacted the quality of doc present in the fen while doc export from the fen was minimal as this constructed wetland continues to mature it is important that monitoring of doc continues in order to understand the trajectory of biogeochemical dynamics of the system following vegetation establishment as well as changes under potential future climatic variations keywords dissolved organic carbon humification index fluorescence index freshness index suva254 constructed wetland 1 introduction peatlands within the western boreal plains wbp account for up to 50 of the landscape cover vitt et al 1996 however approximately 950 km2 of the wbp has been disturbed within the athabasca oil sands region aosr through surface mining activities alberta environment and parks 2020 currently there is a requirement for companies extracting bitumen to return the land to equivalent capability alberta government 2013 reclamation following such disturbances requires reconstruction of the landscape as mining completely removes surface vegetation and soil while significantly changing surficial geology price et al 2010 this results in a landscape no longer functioning as it once did in order to rectify this wetland construction has been attempted across the aosr raab and bayley 2013 however efforts to construct peatlands are a relatively recent development due to the hydrological complexity and the long time needed for development of peatlands price et al 2010 in 2013 a fen and surrounding watershed was constructed at a site near fort mcmurray alberta canada to test peatland reclamation the goal of this project was to return ecosystem functions that were present in pre disturbance peatlands and to create a system that allows for peat accumulation and the return of the carbon sink capabilities as dissolved organic carbon doc production and export are important components of peatland carbon balance improved understanding of these processes is critical for evaluating the function of the constructed watershed although previous research from this site has shown than doc concentrations in the fen were initially low khadka et al 2016 the production and export of doc from the watershed is not yet fully understood and are likely to change as the vegetation communities hydrology water chemistry and environmental conditions develop over time dissolved organic carbon is defined as carbon in organic molecules that can pass through a 0 45 μm filter thurman 1985 peatlands have high rates of doc production due to their anoxic organic soils that result in slow microbial decomposition of organic matter moore and dalva 2001 doc production can also be increased by higher rates of plant productivity as plant root exudates are an additional source of doc doc production is impacted by many environmental variables including water table depth strack et al 2008 ion availability kalbitz et al 2000 and temperature freeman et al 2001 the structure of doc is dependent on its source as well as the amount of degradation it has undergone robroek et al 2016 there are various spectrophotometric and fluorescence indices that can be used to provide information on the quality of doc and whether it derives from the breaking down of older organic matter or whether it is newer more labile doc from fresh vegetation inputs relevant doc absorbance indices include the absorbance ratio e2 e3 ratio of absorbance of light at 250 and 365 nm and the specific uv absorbance suva higher suva can indicate more aromatic doc compounds weishaar et al 2003 while the inverse occurs with e2 e3 with high values indicating low aromaticity and low molecular weight absorption of light at shorter wavelengths ultraviolet is more common within carbohydrates whereas conjugated systems such as alkenes and aromatics absorb light within the uv vis spectrum 190 780 µm peacock et al 2014 fluorescence is the emission of light that can be measured as electrons return to ground state from an excited state when exposed to a photon valeur 2001 common doc fluorescence indices include the fluorescence index fi humification index hix and freshness index β α the humification index hix has been previously used in aquatic bourbonniere 2010 and terrestrial kalbitz et al 2003 landscapes to determine the degree of humification of organic carbon sources the fluorescence index fi can be used to indicate the degree of microbial or terrestrial contribution to the doc pool with lower fi values indicating microbial influence and higher fi values indicating greater terrestrial inputs cory and mcknight 2005 the freshness index β α has also been used to indicate the relative age of organic compounds with β referring to the amount of recently produced autochthonous organic matter and α being associated with older allochthonous organic matter wilson and xenopoulos 2008 these absorbance ratios and indices are useful tools to determine sources of doc to the peatland and potentially determine peatland development and trajectory within constructed wetland complexes dissolved organic carbon concentrations and quality are important to monitor together as this interaction can have variable effects on carbon losses and the fate of doc in downstream ecosystems the amount of doc export can vary between hydrological sources but it will also change within each source depending on the volume of water transported and doc molecular weight and chemical composition large precipitation events that result in large volumes of surface runoff often represent a significant portion of the doc output in boreal ecosystems eimers et al 2015 and can mobilize a greater array of doc compounds however snowmelt and the spring freshet can have highly variable contributions across upland and wetland environments as snowmelt can account for a greater proportion of annual doc export in forestlands compared to wetlands laudon et al 2004 this relationship has also been shown to vary inter annually jager et al 2008 determined that snowmelt represented a larger proportion of doc export in dry years compared to wet years when the contribution to runoff in response to rainfall events increases though there is strong evidence that dry conditions increase degradation of organic material strack et al 2008 this also results in less surface runoff and an overall decrease in doc export during the dry period jager et al 2008 davidson et al 2019 although doc export may then be elevated upon subsequent rewetting strack et al 2015 dissolved organic carbon production can also increase following peatland construction through the dewatering transportation and placement of donor peat that results in the breakdown of organic matter this soil disturbance also eliminates systematic layering within the peat profile resulting in a greater distribution of small pores as the pore structure typical of the upper layer in undisturbed peatlands is not present nwaishi et al 2016 this new peat structure limits water and doc transport rezanezhad et al 2016 and compounds the effect of limited mobility for larger doc molecules however systems that promote surface runoff reduce the amount of water interacting with the soil reducing dissolution of large complex doc compounds strack et al 2011 therefore it is important to determine which process is dominant whether it is surface flow or groundwater flow during outflow events the relative contribution of doc sources is difficult to predict when working in natural systems and may be more unpredictable when assessing disturbed restored or constructed environments assessing doc dynamics can become more complex when considering hydrological inputs and outputs from wetlands the magnitude of which may have significant impacts on the doc budget of a system early post construction doc dynamics have been quantified within the constructed fen khadka et al 2016 however the importance of doc inputs from external sources i e runoff groundwater precipitation to the fen have not been investigated additionally it is unknown whether these external sources are important for export doc quantity and quality this study aims to quantify hydrological doc fluxes from the catchment into a constructed fen relative to internal doc production and will assess the potential importance of each source for doc export using doc concentration and quality indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in a constructed watershed 56 55 944 n 111 25 035 w approximately 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta it consists of an upland fen system surrounded by three previously reclaimed hillslopes and one natural hillslope the constructed fen known as the nikanotee fen is 3 ha while the entire watershed encompasses 32 ha fig 1 measurements were made in the third and fourth year post construction between may and august 2015 but only in july and august 2016 due to the horse river wildfire that occurred in may 2016 and limited access to the study site until july the constructed fen is composed of 2 m of peat collected from a fen dewatered for two years prior to extraction placed on 50 cm of highly permeable petroleum coke and 50 cm of tailings sand daly et al 2012 construction was completed in january 2013 while vegetation planting did not finish until july 2013 vegetation planted on site was predominantly carex aquatilis juncus balticus with moss layer transfer quinty and rochefort 2003 and bare control cover types also included typha spp spontaneously colonized the site covering between one quarter to one third of the fen area by 2016 seedlings used for vascular establishment were propagated in a commercial nursery borkenhagen and cooper 2019 donor material used for the moss layer transfer was collected from a rich fen 10 km from the site and applied in july 2013 at a 1 10 area ratio of donor to constructed site borkenhagen and cooper 2019 at the north east edge of the constructed fen is a spillbox that conducts surface flow from the fen to a storage pond down gradient of the fen fig 1 south of the fen is a transition zone between the fen and upland delineated by the presence of the petroleum coke layer that extends approximately 100 m beyond the margin of the fen at the base of the tailings sand both the transition zone and the upland further to the south act as recharge zones and are covered with 30 50 cm of lfh i e forest floor mineral mix overlying up to 3 m of tailings sand sutton and price 2020 the tailings sand and closer to the fen the petroleum coke layer conduct water towards the fen a geosynthetic clay liner underlies the fen and tailings sand upland daly et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2017 the upland has a 3 basal grade to direct water towards the fen price et al 2010 in the fall of 2013 the surface of the lfh mineral mix was furrowed perpendicular to the direction of slope to detain surface water and thereby increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff recharge basins lfh mineral layer removed 400 1500 m2 located south upgradient of hummock landforms fig 1 were also incorporated into the southern upland to promote water detention and infiltration in tandem with the furrows kessel et al 2018 the upland vegetation comprises primarily forbs and grasses of which 66 were native species gingras hill et al 2018 water percolates through tailings sand producing a relatively saline groundwater source average 2013 2016 electrical conductivity ec 2700 µs cm 1 kessel et al 2018 kessel et al 2018 showed that recharged groundwater mobilized salts through the tailings sand towards the underdrain and upwards into the fen peat because of the essentially impermeable geosynthetic clay liner all water losses from the system are represented through evapotranspiration and surface outflow from the spillbox surrounding the fen and upland are three reclaimed slopes comprising 50 cm of peat mineral mix on 100 cm of a secondary capping layer low sodic soil ketcheson and price 2016 the peat mineral mix is created using peat that has been over stripped and mixed with the underlying glacial mineral sediments meiers et al 2006 the east slope 8 1 ha was reclaimed in 2007 and revegetated in 2008 the southeast 8 2 ha and west 2 4 ha slopes were reclaimed in 2011 and revegetated in 2012 ketcheson and price 2016 2 2 precipitation precipitation was measured using a te525mm te525m tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronics usa located within the upland one manual gauge was placed on each of the north end of the fen the west and east slopes and two were placed in the upland manual gauges for measuring precipitation were used to collect water samples from each rain event when sufficient sample was available water from the manual gauge in the fen was used otherwise samples from the east and west slope gauges were combined to create one sample gauges were flushed with de ionized water di between events to limit algae and microbial growth however concentrations occasionally exceeded the expected range 1 3 mg l 1 fraser et al 2001 due to algal growth in this case doc concentrations from precipitation samples at the nearby poplar fen 8 4 km were used instead spectrophotometric indices were collected for precipitation samples however fluorescence spectroscopy was not measured due to limited water available for sampling 2 3 surface water one flume was placed on each of the east west and southeast slopes fig 1 the east and west flumes were placed mid slope while the southeast flume was placed at a higher position due to limitations from erosion through the peat mineral mix caused by high flows from that hillslope in addition three enclosed runoff collectors fig 1 were placed mid slope on the east and west slopes and upper slope on the south east slope in 2016 to mimic slope positions of the respective flumes their placement was outside the catchment boundary of the flumes fig 1 enclosed runoff collectors were also placed in the transition zone within the upland in an east west transect flumes and collectors were constructed using metal siding that was dug into the ground 5 cm and cemented in place using quikrete hydraulic water stop cement fig s1 the flumes drained into a 23 l bucket that had a v notch outflow a calibration curve was created and used to estimate discharge based on the height of water above the notch a well with a pressure transducer schlumberger mini diver or an odyssey capacitive water level logger was placed in each flume bucket to monitor within event runoff at a 15 minute time interval runoff collectors from enclosed plots also drained into 23 l buckets following runoff events the volume of water within each bucket was measured buckets were covered with an opaque tarp to limit the impacts of ultra violet radiation on doc quality and concentration and to prevent changes in volume through direct precipitation inputs doc samples were collected within 24 h following the end of the precipitation event contributing area to flumes was estimated by completing topographic surveys on each hillslope using a topcon hiper gl rtk gps system tokyo japan issues with pressure transducer function resulted in large portions of the seasonal runoff being missed in both 2015 on the west slope and west and east slope in 2016 as such the west east and upland runoff was estimated using runoff collectors in 2016 to estimate runoff in 2015 a multiple linear regression was used in which runoff depth was plotted against precipitation p size and maximum p intensity west slope r2 0 91 or average p intensity upland r2 0 4 for runoff collectors in 2016 these relationships were then used to estimate runoff depth on contributing areas in 2015 west upland doc samples were collected from flumes and runoff collectors in 2016 and average doc concentration for each event was applied to runoff volume across each contributing area to estimate total doc mobilized in 2015 buckets below flumes consistently contained algae introducing potential error to doc concentration measurements therefore the average seasonal doc concentration in 2016 on hillslopes and the upland was used to estimate 2015 doc fluxes as there was no correlation between concentration and runoff depth across all contributing areas 2 4 groundwater ten piezometer nests were sampled from across the constructed fen targeting the layers within peat 30 50 90 150 cm and the petroleum coke layer 275 cm that conducts groundwater to the fen all piezometers were constructed from pvc pipe 2 54 cm inner diameter with a 20 cm slotted intake and wrapped with filter sock groundwater flux was calculated using darcy s law 1 q q a k sat dh d l where q is the specific discharge m s 1 q is the volumetric discharge m3 s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the flow face m2 and dh dl is the hydraulic gradient i e the change in head dh divided by the change in length dl between the measurement points unitless specific discharge fluxes to the fen through the petroleum coke underdrain were estimated using the vertical hydraulic gradient between the piezometers installed in the

zone from tailings sand directly to peat i e horizontal flow was estimated to be 4 6 mm in 2014 or 1 5 of the total groundwater input sutton and price 2020 and therefore was considered negligible hence the flow face used for flux calculations is the fen area and total distance is fen peat depth nwaishi et al 2016 reported that the peat displayed isotropic ksat but had layered heterogeneity

conductivity of each peat layer respectively field measurements of ksat were conducted using bail tests within piezometers in the fen following the hydrostatic time lag method hvorslev 1951 all nests had triplicate manual measurements of ksat at 50 90 and 150 cm depths in 2015 and 2016 with the 30 cm depth added in 2016 piezometer slots represented the center of each peat layer used to estimate kz refer to ketcheson et al 2017 for more details regarding hydraulic conductivity estimates and groundwater flux calculations 2 5 doc concentration and chemistry analysis water samples were extracted from piezometers once each month during the growing season in june august 2015 and july august 2016 for doc concentration and spectrophotometric samples in july 2015 piezometers within the tailings sand below the fen were also sampled for fluorescence spectroscopy all piezometers were purged minimum three well volumes 24 h prior to extraction all samples were extracted using a 12 v peristaltic pump with vinyl tubing and each soil type had designated tubing to minimize contamination all tubing was flushed with de ionized water prior to sampling samples were taken from 10 nests that covered the central e w transect through the fen and the peripheral n s transects along the east and west hillslope for water samples collected from all study locations a volume of water 50 ml was collected into a clean reservoir for in field measurements of environmental variables electrical conductivity ph temperature an electrical conductivity ec and temperature t probe thermo scientific orion conductivity and temperature probe and a ph probe thermo scientific orion economy series ph combination electrode were inserted into the collected volume ec probes were calibrated monthly to 1413 μs cm and ph probes were three point calibrated to a ph of 4 7 and 10 before every daily use after the above procedures another water sample was taken in a clean 60 ml high density polyethylene vial and 40 ml amber borosilicate vial and stored in a cooler until they were returned that day to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c for samples collected on hillslopes if a secondary volume was not available the initial collected volume was used for doc analysis samples were filtered within 24 h through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters then decanted into 60 ml vials for doc concentration and spectrophotometric analysis and 40 ml borosilicate vials for fluorescence spectroscopy analysis samples were analyzed using a perkinelmer uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 35 to measure absorbance at 250 nm 254 nm and 365 nm wavelengths the concentration of doc was determined using a shimadzu toc analyzer environmental sciences program university of calgary by the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method and analytical error was 0 2 mg l 1 as toc was determined on filtered samples this represents doc in 2015 a 20 subset of samples was selected to measure doc and values were then correlated with absorbance at 250 nm a250 to estimate doc for all samples peacock et al 2014 separate correlations were constructed for each potential doc source with r2 0 75 in all cases groundwater doc 79 137 a250

mcmaster university on a horiba jobin yvon aqualog machine aqualog using recommended manufacturer calibrations and software corrections for inner filter effects the samples were kept out of the light and were allowed to reach room temperature prior to analysis quartz cuvettes were used to run the samples through the aqualog the cuvettes were first soaked in 50 nitric acid and bathed for 24 h then thoroughly rinsed in deionized water prior to sample analysis the fluorescence index cory and mcknight 2005 was used to determine if the dissolved organic matter was terrestrially 1 6 or microbially

layer in the peat as delineated by piezometer depths the mid point between each piezometer screen depth determined the boundaries of the depth over which doc concentration was applied as such the ranges for doc mass calculations were 0 40 40 70 70 120 and 120 200 cm porosity as determined by ketcheson et al 2017 was used to calculate the volume available for water storage porosity from 0 to 50 cm 0 92 was used for piezometer depths of 40 and 50 cm porosity for 50 200 cm 0 87 was used for all other depths average doc concentration from each sampled depth at all piezometer depths was used as there was no spatial relationship of doc concentration across the fen the depth of water within the peat column was set at 1775 mm and was used for both years as measured water table changes between years did not vary from this value by 10 and to limit bias of water table change on doc storage estimates the change in fen doc storage δ fen storage was then calculated as the difference between doc storage on the last and first day of sampling in each study season 2 7 doc export and balance to determine the contribution of doc production within the fen compared to external inputs the fen doc production was determined using 8 net fen doc production fen storage docp p docrslope rslope docgw gw docq q where docx is the doc concentration in each water source p is precipitation rslope is runoff from constructed hillslopes and uplands gw is groundwater flow into the fen and q is outflow from the v notch weir 2 8 statistical analysis r version 3 5 2 r core team 2016 was used for all statistical analyses all variables were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test prior to analysis log transformation was performed when data did not meet the requirement for normality a linear mixed effect model function lme in the package nlme pinheiro et al 2015 was used to test the effect of runoff source on doc concentration and quality where the sampling cycle was treated as a random factor to account for repeated measures another linear mixed effects model was used to test for differences between treatments and depths within the constructed fen with the sampling cycle once again used as a random effect when there was a significant effect a tukey post hoc analysis function glht package multcomp hothorn et al 2008 was used to assess differences between locations multiple linear regressions were used to model runoff depth based on precipitation intensity average for upland maximum for hillslopes and precipitation size as described in 2 3 surface water a significance of p 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 input of doc into the nikanotee fen during the study period in 2015 may 1st august 20th the total rainfall was 107 mm which is less than the average amount of 245 mm for this time period 1981 2010 fort mcmurray a station environment and climate change canada 2017 in 2015 the maximum precipitation intensity measured was 8 6 mm hr 1 while in 2016 the maximum value was 9 4 mm hr 1 additionally though the exceedance curves follow a similar pattern there were a greater number of total observed events in 2016 therefore there were a higher total number of high intensity precipitation events in 2016 average standard deviation doc concentration from rain was 4 7 1 5 mg l 1 thus the amount of doc that fell on the fen over the study period was 0 50 g m 2 in july and august of 2016 precipitation totalled 103 mm average doc concentration was 4 41 0 78 mg l 1 thus the doc that entered the fen through rainfall was 0 45 g m 2 in 2015 and 2016 the suva254 of doc in precipitation was 3 3 1 0 and 3 0 0 7 l mg 1 m 1 and e2 e3 values were 3 65 1 85 and 2 93 0 49 respectively data for manual piezometer measurements in 2016 were not collected before july 1st therefore groundwater flux estimates in 2016 are restricted to july and august groundwater inputs in july and august to the fen were larger in 2015 compared to 2016 in 2015 from a nest located centrally in the upland fig 1 the water table was at least 25 cm higher within the upland than in the fen at the beginning of may reaching a maximum of 55 cm by day 230 fig 2 this difference is reflected in the vertical hydraulic gradients seen within the fen fig s2 following ground ice melt the gradient between the upland and fen increased fig 2 therefore the vertical hydraulic gradient increased upwards through the fen peat fig s2 in 2015 increased vertical gradients coincided with an increase in upland water table after day 180 in contrast in july and august of 2016 the difference in water table between the fen and upland was smaller and was more variable fig 2 following a precipitation event on day 213 the water table increased within the fen and was at the same level as that observed in the central upland piezometer this small difference in water tables was reflected in the small vertical hydraulic gradients in the fen measured in 2016 fig s2 values measured were all near zero limiting groundwater inputs to the fen through july and august hydraulic conductivity did not significantly change from 2015 to 2016 at 50 90 and 150 cm fig s2 and therefore groundwater flux into the fen was dependent on the vertical hydraulic gradients total groundwater input over the study periods in 2015 and 2016 was 38 mm 112 days and 8 mm 51 days respectively doc concentration in the petroleum coke layer in 2015 and 2016 did not significantly differ though concentrations were generally higher in 2016 fig s3 total doc inputs through groundwater were 1 3 and 0 6 g m2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively e2 e3 also did not change seasonally or between years though suva254 decreased in 2016 indicating less aromatic doc was transported towards the fen table 1 fig s3 when measured in july average standard deviation values for fi β α and hix in groundwater samples in the petroleum coke layer were 1 72 0 02 1 23 0 03 and 0 58 0 01 respectively table 1 in 2015 the west slope produced the largest depth of runoff at 3 8 mm fig 3 a followed by the southeast slope however in 2016 the southeast slope had the largest runoff depth at 6 9 mm in both years the upland and east slope produced very little runoff 2 mm when runoff depth was normalised to fen area in 2015 the southeast slope produced the most runoff at 7 4 mm fig 3b the normalised values for upland and east slope runoff were 1 7 and 0 1 mm respectively in 2016 this pattern continued as the southeast slope had the largest runoff depth when normalised to the fen area and the east slope produced the smallest amount of runoff as doc concentrations did not vary between contributing areas table 1 the southeast slope had the largest doc flux followed by the west slope upland then east slope in both years fig 4 however as the southeast slope is located at the south end of the system and the east and west slopes have portions of their delineated border shared directly with the fen fig 1 it is difficult to quantify the total amount of doc that reaches the fen from each area though doc concentration did not vary between contributing areas doc quality was significantly different between locations specifically between upland and hillslopes for spectrophotometric indices suva254 lme f3 63 6 7 p 0 0005 and e2 e3 lme f3 63 6 8 p 0 0004 were significantly lower and higher in the upland compared to southeast and west slopes respectively e2 e3 was significantly lower on the east slope and though not significant still suva254 was also higher compared to the upland fluorescence spectroscopy indices also display significant differences across locations fi lme f3 41 10 8 p 0 001 and β α lme f3 41 13 1 p 0 001 were greater in the upland relative to values on the west and southeast slopes table 1 3 2 doc export from the nikanotee fen in 2015 the majority of discharge occurred during the first two weeks of the field season coinciding with the post snowmelt freshet culminating in 7 mm of surface runoff lost through the v notch weir fig 5 doc concentrations ranged from 20 to 77 mg l 1 and there was no significant relationship between discharge rate and doc concentration however within the spring freshet doc concentration was generally higher during low flow events the majority of doc lost through the study period was exported during spring freshet transporting 0 5 g m 2 of doc out of the system there was a secondary discharge event at the end of july that coincided with a large precipitation event this resulted in the remaining doc exported totalling 0 7 g m 2 released during the 2015 growing season in 2016 as the spring freshet had been missed there were limited outflow events captured however two were observed at the end of july and mid august maximum discharge rate was 0 4 l s 1 with both occurrences of outflow corresponding to large precipitation events fig 5 during these events doc concentration increased as discharge rate decreased fig 5 although there were comparable doc concentrations observed during the 2015 spring freshet the total doc exported during july and august 51 days was only 0 1 g m 2 less than observed 0 26 g m 2 over the same time period in 2015 doc quality in discharge exhibited no trends in 2015 table 1 suva254 consistently ranged from 2 to 3 l mg 1 m 1 regardless of discharge rate e2 e3 also exhibited the same pattern as it ranged from between 7 and 8 despite changes in discharge only three samples were analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy one sample collected on may 29th had a hix value of 0 68 fi of 1 6 and β α of 0 99 the two remaining samples were obtained july 23rd and 24th the average standard deviation hix increased to 0 80 0 01 while fi and β α decreased to 1 51 0 02 and 0 76 0 01 respectively in contrast in 2016 as discharge decreased following precipitation events e2 e3 and suva254 decreased and increased respectively the range of values for suva254 also increased to 3 5 l mg 1 m 1 and e2 e3 decreased to 5 this indicates that exported doc increased in size and aromaticity from 2015 to 2016 table 1 in contrast fluorescence spectroscopy indices displayed minimal variability during both outflow events 3 3 doc concentration quality and net production within the nikanotee fen mean doc concentration measured in fen piezometer at 50 cm depth increased from 30 2 9 3 to 38 3 12 8 mg l 1 between june and august in 2015 and 36 9 14 1 to 43 5 13 3 mg l 1 between july and august in 2016 the doc concentration was highest in the near surface peat depth within the peat profile had a significant impact on doc concentration lme f7 51 1 4 24 p 0 001 in 2015 all depths in the peat profile had significantly higher doc concentrations than in petroleum coke or tailings sand within the peat profile near surface 30 50 cm had significantly higher p 0 01 doc concentrations than at 150 cm fig 6 in 2016 depth again had a significant impact on doc concentration lme f6 63 5 98 p 0 001 the total mass of doc in june 2015 was 55 4 g m 2 increasing to 77 7 g m 2 by august 2015 in 2016 the total mass of doc in july was 61 7 g m 2 increasing to 84 4 g m 2 by august the overall doc concentration storage value in the fen was 38 2 7 7 and 38 6 7 4 mg l 1 for 2015 and 2016 respectively table 2 doc quality also varied through the fen profile having characteristics that indicate it was less aromatic lower suva254 smaller higher e2 e3 and more microbial sourced higher fi in mineral layers relative to peat layers in 2015 the profile at the nikanotee fen showed no seasonal change in suva254 and e2 e3 in 2016 there was a significant increase in suva254 from july to august lme f1 133 6 44 p 0 012 this was due to an increase at 75 and 90 cm depths fig s4 however e2 e3 did not show a corresponding change in values β α lme f5 57 11 56 p 0 001 fi lme f5 57 13 6 p 0 001 and hix lme f5 57 11 3 p 0 001 varied significantly with depth β α and fi were significantly higher p 0 001 in mineral layers relative to peat samples while hix was significantly lower in mineral layers p 0 001 however all fluorescence indices were similar within peat layers net doc production in 2015 and 2016 was 20 9 5 0 and 21 6 4 1 g m 2 overall inputs to the fen decreased in 2016 due to the limited groundwater inputs although this could be impacted by the shorter measurement period as runoff and precipitation were comparable to 2015 outflow also decreased though inputs and outputs had little effect on the total doc within the fen as the dominant doc input was through internal production table 2 net doc production did not vary between years as the seasonal increase in doc concentration through the fen profile did not change significantly from 2015 to 2016 however it is important to note that the net doc production in 2016 was calculated based on data for only july and august and excluded may and june therefore it is likely that net doc production in 2016 was actually greater than in 2015 4 discussion since its construction in 2013 doc concentration in pore water in nikanotee fen has increased from 30 4 mg l 1 in 2013 khadka et al 2016 to 44 6 mg l 1 by 2016 in 50 cm piezometers overall spectrophotometric properties of this doc indicate that it now contains more low molecular weight and less aromatic compounds table 1 our results indicate that while doc was being added to the system as runoff from the surrounding hillslopes and through groundwater the main contributor to the growing doc pool in the fen was internal production at the same time developing soil properties and plant communities throughout the watershed affected the sources of water and doc to the fen 4 1 transport of doc into the nikanotee fen doc concentration in precipitation was slightly higher than the range 1 3 mg l 1 previously reported for boreal ecosystems fraser et al 2001 moore and dalva 2001 in 2015 4 67 mg l 1 and 2016 4 41 mg l 1 precipitation had comparable suva254 and low e2 e3 values relative to what is seen in the fen indicating that doc in precipitation is dominated by large non aromatic compounds likens et al 1983 however though the size of doc compounds differs in precipitation compared to the fen individual inputs of precipitation are unlikely to change fen doc quality as the mass of doc within the fen is dramatically larger than the addition through precipitation doc exports from hillslopes and runoff were much larger in 2016 compared to 2015 this is likely due to the difference in the precipitation intensity between years as precipitation intensity was higher in 2016 and the total number of high intensity events was greater there was more overland flow overland flow was also observed within this watershed in 2013 and 2014 ketcheson and price 2016 with the east slope producing 1 and 6 mm compared to 52 and 73 mm on the west slope in 2013 and 2014 respectively within the present study surface runoff on the southeast and west slope also exceeded that on the east slope this was likely due in part to differences in infiltration rates ketcheson and price 2016 vegetation cover was more extensive and mature on the east slope and this has been shown to promote infiltration in reclamation soils thompson et al 2010 doc concentration did not vary between slope locations though runoff depth varied between contributing areas indicating that construction materials and or time post construction do not impact doc in solution for surface runoff but has an overall impact on doc transported to the fen however doc quality was affected by post construction conditions doc on the west and southeast slopes appeared terrestrially sourced based on low fi values johnson et al 2006 observed limited interaction of water with soil components during overland flow particularly as runoff increases decreasing dissolution of doc from soils therefore doc from the southeast and west slope is more characteristic of doc terrestrially produced at the surface rather than those produced from sub surface processes the upland and east slope displayed fi values closer to 1 6 indicating a mix of terrestrial and microbial influences this may be due to the longer time since reclamation for the east slope relative to other slopes and the upland allowing greater establishment of microbial communities and greater soil water interaction through macropores created by rooting systems wilcox et al 2015 the upland had the highest fi values indicating the largest proportion of microbially sourced doc as the upland has had the shortest time post construction to establish the vegetation community has also had the least amount of time to develop and therefore may have produced a less terrestrial signature though all runoff is assumed to reach the fen from all contributing areas in the fen doc budget it is not likely the case and a large portion of the runoff will be directed through the upland while this limits the direct contribution from those slopes their doc may also take on a quality closer to that of the upland through mixing of slope sources prior to reaching the fen groundwater represented the largest hydrological input of doc to the nikanotee fen in 2015 but only contributed 1 2 g m 2 however the amount of water entering the fen in 2015 and 2016 38 mm and 8 mm respectively was much smaller than reported by ketcheson et al 2017 in 2014 177 mm thus displaying important inter annual variability groundwater doc concentrations were comparable to other boreal peatlands waddington and roulet 1997 though not significant there was an overall increase in groundwater doc concentration in 2016 but decline in doc input that was likely due to the lower water table in the upland compared to 2015 this indicates that the doc flux towards the fen is more dependent on the volume of groundwater discharge to the fen than variability in doc concentration khadka et al 2015 found that very little doc was produced from the upland tailings sand however as a large mass of tailings sand is present within the upland it is possible that dissolution into percolating water may cause an accumulation of doc in groundwater over time spectophotometric indices of groundwater doc indicated that it was low molecular weight with low aromaticity fig s4 we interpret this patten as indicative of adsorption of larger molecules to mineral soils during transport 4 2 doc concentration and quality within the nikanotee fen dissolved organic carbon concentrations across both years within the fen were higher than to those measured by khadka et al 2016 in the first two years post construction and similar to nearby reference fens davidson et al 2019 however it is unlikely that doc is sourced through comparable processes at nikanotee fen and reference fens all indices indicated that the doc within the fen is smaller more recently produced terrestrially sourced and less recalcitrant compared to natural sites davidson et al 2019 the low suva254 values indicate doc with a low aromaticity while the high β α values highlights the doc has been recently produced this is a characteristic of plant sourced doc as root exudates and fresh litter will typically result in doc with a less humic character than microbially sourced doc khadka et al 2016 predicted that the doc sourced within the fen would shift from microbially produced to plant sourced as vegetation cover established vegetation productivity has increased since construction with above and below ground biomass increasing over time borkenhagen and cooper 2019 messner 2019 following planting in july 2013 aboveground biomass was 395 g m 2 by august 2014 and increased to 532 g m 2 by 2016 with belowground biomass reaching over 1500 g m 2 in 2016 messner 2019 the large increase in doc concentration and shifts in doc quality from 2013 to 2016 is likely linked to this productivity it has been shown that post restoration responses of doc quality indicated higher e2 e3 and lower suva254 values compared to nearby unrestored sites strack et al 2015 attributed to greater vascular plant cover and increase in root exudates microbial activity may also be promoted due to the rhizosphere priming effect kuzyakov 2002 and could explain why the doc quality within the fen appears more plant sourced given that the quality indices within the fen appear largely plant sourced for example low aromaticity suva254 3 l mg1 m 1 there is little evidence that the doc sources from hillslopes and groundwater have made a measurable impact on doc quality additionally the input of doc concentration from the hillslopes is small compared to the pool of doc present within the fen and therefore it is of little surprise that they have little impact on the quality of the doc yet the hillslope effect on local conditions in the transition zone and mineral peat interface may play a role in microbial community structure a phenomenon that requires further investigation overall the difference in quality of the doc in the fen combined with the estimated internal production value of 20 g m 2 further supports an internally produced plant sourced doc pool 4 3 doc export from the nikanotee fen precipitation events coupled with high water tables significantly increased outflow thus doc export from the fen however dry conditions became more important once the discharge from snowmelt had dissipated additional doc was likely exported with snowmelt in early spring prior to our study period but would be limited by frozen soils that reduce the interaction of water with the peat davidson et al 2019 outflow events from june august of both years were a result of large precipitation events whereas almost all outflow in may 2015 was due to the spring freshet the water table from june to august of 2015 commonly fell below the height of the v notch and precipitation had less of an impact on discharge compared to that in a wet year this trend was amplified in 2016 despite a greater precipitation input in 2016 there was less outflow due to depleted water storage within the fen from 2015 to 2016 this has been observed in other boreal peatlands where there is a lag between annual precipitation inputs and changes in water storage devito et al 2012 groundwater can be an important vector for export of doc from peatlands waddington and roulet 1997 olefeldt et al 2013 however the nikanotee fen is designed to isolate the system from groundwater losses groundwater movement occurs upward through the fen peat and thus contributes to surface water discharge the small groundwater input from the upland was insufficient to raise the water level within the fen to generate doc export for much of the 2015 and 2016 study period as groundwater input was limited to 38 mm in 2015 it is unlikely that the doc brought into the fen from groundwater impacted the amount of doc exported this is supported by doc quality data although suva254 and e2 e3 values in groundwater samples were comparable to doc quality observed in the outflow in 2015 all fluorescence spectroscopy indices differed markedly between groundwater and outflow samples groundwater doc quality also differed from that at the outflow in 2016 suva254 values decreased from 2015 indicating a lower degree of aromaticity reinforcing doc transport data that suggests groundwater transport represents a small portion of the fen doc budget and subsequently has little impact on doc export therefore although doc is transported to the fen via groundwater the small volume of groundwater results in it contributing very little to the doc that is exported it will likely take multiple years for doc from groundwater to reach the outflow and any specific quality signature will be lost by mixing with the large pool of doc produced within the fen when comparing doc quality at the outflow to runoff all indices fall within comparable ranges table 1 as samples on hillslopes were only collected in 2016 this is the only year being used for comparison to outflow suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β α values from runoff were all similar to values observed at the outflow specifically surface runoff also represented a negligible input of doc to the fen relative to the net doc production within the fen this is in part due to the alternative potential pathways for runoff prior to its arrival at the fen as the southeast slope has no direct contact with the fen and is directly upstream of a recharge basin most of its surface runoff percolates to groundwater storage kessel et al 2018 on the east and west slope only a small portion of their boundary is shared with the fen so much of their surface runoff was directed through the upland where it was detained by furrows eventually recharging the upland aquifer consequently the volume of runoff thus doc from the upland and hillslopes was small and it is unlikely that any runoff has a significant impact on doc export the outflow doc quality may have changed from 2015 to 2016 due to the volume of discharge as opposed to the actual doc quality within the fen in 2015 the majority of export occurred during the spring freshet during which time the surface was largely frozen as the fen is also proximally closest to the spillbox relative to other locations within this catchment water is channeled directly from the fen to the outflow point as such 3 4 years post construction doc export from the catchment is dominated by doc sourced from vegetation growth in the fen however the proportion of each doc input may change over time particularly as vegetation growth and community structure stabilize 5 conclusions this study investigated the input output and production of doc in a constructed fen watershed in the athabasca oil sands region alberta canada results indicate that while a small amount of doc was added to the fen itself through runoff each year the growing pool of doc within fen pore water is coming from internal production through increased vegetation productivity doc concentrations within the fen have increased in the four years since construction and are now at similar levels to nearby reference sites however the doc quality indices measured in this study suva254 e2 e3 fi hix and β a all indicate that the doc in the system is more recently produced and it is likely that the majority of doc is plant sourced rather than older microbially produced doc furthermore there was little evidence to support that runoff from the surrounding hillslopes and precipitation inputs have an impact on the quality of the doc within the constructed fen finally doc export from the system was minimal due to the nature of the constructed site created to isolate the system from groundwater losses as the system continues to mature it is important that monitoring of doc concentration and quality is continued to understand how the biogeochemical and hydrological conditions of this watershed will adapt to both localised environmental conditions as well as larger climatic variations in the future credit authorship contribution statement sarah irvine conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft scott j

4486,the probability of drought duration is a key for drought management literature survey shows that drought duration has been assumed to follow the geometric distribution i but it yields zero probability of a drought with duration equal to zero which however is not consistent with reality this shortcoming served as a motivation to derive a new distribution for the probability of drought duration using an independent bernoulli process and a markov dependent process it was found that the drought duration followed the geometric distribution ii results of the derived distribution were in agreement with those of a simulation study results four examples from yellow river basin in china were used to illustrate the application of the proposed distribution keywords hydrological drought drought duration probability distribution return period drought analysis 1 introduction drought greatly impacts the economy environment ecosystem and living standard there have been severe droughts in recent decades including 2010 2011 east africa drought 2011 texas drought 2012 u s central great plains drought 2012 2015 california drought hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 to name but a few drought has the characteristics of high occurrence frequency long duration and wide spread the length of the drought duration has severely affected crop growth industrial production urban and rural water supply it also caused ecological problems such as water shortages and desertification increasing thence drought duration plays a key role in early warning to mitigate drought impacts hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 hao et al 2014 in hydrological engineering practice the run theory advanced by yevjevich 1967 has been extensively employed for defining drought and its characteristics including duration over different periods year month and week sharma and panu 2015 2017 tabari et al 2013 drought has since been characterized probabilistically hershfield et al 1972 mishra and singh 2010 sen 2015 considered uncertainty inherent to drought evolution and discussed analysis and modeling of temporal drought regional drought and spatiotemporal drought one common way to define drought duration and deficit volume is by the threshold level approach liu et al 2016 sharma and panu 2012 based on the studies by feller 1968 and schwager 1983 the return period of a run event has been computed salas et al 2005 salas and obeysekera 2014 tarawneh and bdour 2016 fernandez and salas 1999a fernandez and salas 1999b discussed the return period and risk of failure of runs of independent bernoulli trials and runs of markov dependent trials using a compound renewal model loáiciga 2005 calculated multiyear drought recurrence in the upper santa ynez river basin drought is multi attribute characterized by several non independent random variables shiau et al 2006 shiau and modarres 2009 shiau 2003 reasoned that a multivariate distribution would better represent drought than a univariate distribution and calculated bivariate return periods kim et al 2003 kim et al 2006 and lall et al 1996 employed a nonparametric kernel estimator to estimate the return periods of univariate drought as well as bivariate droughts copulas have recently been used to construct multivariate probability distributions of drought song and singh 2010 tsakiris et al 2016 vergni et al 2020 sometimes two or more distributions can fit the drought data well zuo et al 2017 employed copula functions to derive a conditional probability distribution of meteorological characteristics and hydrological droughts and constructed links between these two drought types montaseri et al 2018 thought traditional analyses assume that drought durations would be independent series unconnected drought runs udr this method may neglect the short term extreme droughts within a long term udr they treated drought durations as a combination of short term connected drought runs cdr and used duration and severity to describe the agricultural drought events finally copula was applied to evaluate udr and cdr the results indicated that the bivariate drought duration and severity analysis has significantly improved traditional approach meteorological drought and hydrological drought are two common types of drought they may be inherently correlated series and have a certain time tag zhu et al 2017 employed copula functions to derive a conditional probability distribution of meteorological characteristics and hydrological droughts and constructed links between these two drought types the case of the yellow river basin yrb of china shows the potential of the models the case of the yellow river basin yrb of china shows the potential of the models cavus and aksoy 2020 pointed out that precipitation deficit is more useful and physically meaningful than standardized precipitation index spi in water resources management based on the total probability theorem they proposed a novelty severity intensity duration frequency curves the critical drought concept the largest drought severity in each year extends the drought indices although a number of papers have been published in the drought indices little work has been carried out for the present scenario of climate change das et al 2020 employed a time varying parameters gamma distribution considering location parameter as climate indices covariate and copula functions to build a non stationary evaluation model of the drought characteristics under climate change the cases of two himalayan states in india indicate that the drought index and the copula based models have robust and effective characteristics in the changing climate in the past decades increased attention has been to develop drought monitoring however the drought spatio temporal dynamics requires in depth research in the future diaz et al 2020 built a new method of the spatial tracks and paths of drought which can enhance spatiotemporal monitoring of droughts wang et al 2020 used standardized streamflow index and precipitation evapotranspiration index to evaluate the hydrological drought and meteorological drought in the yellow river basin of china and indicated that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought in the yrb since drought is often perceived as a seasonal event frequency analysis of a seasonal drought length appears more significant in practice even though weekly monthly and annual drought lengths have been derived cancelliere and salas 2004 sharma and panu 2013a 2013b 2014 literature survey shows that assuming a stationary and independent process a geometric probability law has been used for modeling drought duration şen 2015 hershfield et al 1972 1 p l k p k 1 1 p k 1 2 where p is the probability of a drought event and k is the duration of the drought event assuming that x 1 x 2 x n is a stationary markov chain drought process the probability distribution of its duration k has the same form as has a stationary and independent process akeyuz et al 2012 2 p l k p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 where p 00 is the conditional probability occurrence of drought x t given that drought x t 1 occurred eq 1 and eq 2 are the probability mass functions pmf to describe the probability of drought duration sen 2015 presented some proofs for eq 1 and eq 2 but on examination following problems are discovered for convenience of description we denote eq 1 as geometric distribution i in this paper the probability distribution expectation variance return period and shortcomings of a drought duration run length are given in appendix a from eq 1 p l 0 can be found as 3 p l 0 1 l 1 p l l 1 l 1 p l 1 1 p 1 1 p 1 1 p 0 the probability of drought duration l 0 adopted in eq 3 is not in agreement with the usual drought duration adopted in hydrology the reason for this is that l 0 is equivalent to a no drought event occurrence in other words for a given area if the probability of a no drought event is 0 then it can be concluded that the probability of the corresponding complementary event drought event is 1 thus eq 1 is an incorrect drought duration probability law similarly it is also found that the expectation of a drought duration e l 1 1 p yields e l 1 when p 0 for a drought event with duration 0 the result shows that its expectation is 1 in reality the expectation of drought with duration 0 should be 0 these results also appear in dependent trials see appendix a 4 due to the above deficiencies in the existing probability distribution of drought duration it is necessary to derive another probability distribution for drought duration which should have strict mathematical bases and correct numerical characteristics and return periods formulae the objective of this study therefore is to propose a probability distribution for drought duration l derive its statistical properties and test the expression of return period of drought duration to achieve this goal this study uses stochastic process theory and monte carlo techniques to find the probability of drought duration l with integer state furthermore according to the definition of run we extend the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence and propose a probability distribution of drought duration with an independent bernoulli process we also find a probability distribution for drought duration with a markov dependent process monte carlo experiments show that these models are correct finally we present the formulae for return periods of drought duration the proposed models are illustrated using four examples from yellow river basin china the results obtained would be useful for drought analysis 2 theory and methodology for an independent bernoulli process given a probability p of a drought event if 1 p represents an integral state outcomes then monte carlo simulation can be used to generate all sample realizations based on the property of a stationary stochastic process one can derive the probability mass function pmf of a run length for an independent bernoulli process with integral state outcomes and then extend it to the pmf of a run length with a non integral state consequently the pmf of a run length for a two state markov dependent process can be derived 2 1 probability distribution of drought duration of independent bernoulli process 2 1 1 probability of run length of a sample consider a sample from independent bernoulli trials 1111122211111221121221222212121112111 it is easy to see that the probabilities of state 1 and state 2 are 22 37 and 15 37 respectively the sample has 17 runs of state 1 and state 2 using the probability multiplication theorem the probability for a run length k can be computed as 4 p l i k n l i k g n i 1 2 0 1 2 3 5 i 1 0 1 2 3 4 i 2 where l 1 and l 2 are the run lengths of state 1 and state 2 respectively n is the size of the sample g n is the total number of runs of state 1 and state 2 in the sample in this case g n 17 including 9 runs of state 1 8 runs of state 2 they form the run sample space of the sample from geometric distribution i the probability of a run length is calculated as 5 p l 1 k n l 1 k 9 k 0 1 2 3 5 6 p l 2 k n l 2 k 8 k 0 1 2 3 4 therefore there is a significant difference in probabilities of a run length calculated from geometric distribution i and eq 4 table 1 shows the calculated probabilities p l 1 k and p l 2 k using eq 4 from table 1 one can see the following relationship for a sample of given independent bernoulli trials k 1 5 p l 1 k 2 17 2 17 1 17 4 17 9 17 p l 2 0 k 1 4 p l 2 k 1 17 1 17 2 17 4 17 8 17 p l 1 0 and k 1 5 p l 1 k k 1 4 p l 2 k k 1 5 p l 1 k p l 1 0 p l 2 0 k 1 4 p l 2 k 1 the last relationship satisfies the condition m i 1 pi 1 and indicates the probability of run length of a sample and eq 4 is validated 2 1 2 probability distribution of run length eq 4 gives the probability of a run length for a sample of independent bernoulli trials and is one combination of values of the trial a run length probability should be an average probability of all combinations of state 1 and state 2 of the trials let us consider an independent bernoulli trial of size n each trial has 2 possible outcomes denoted as state 1 and state 2 the corresponding runs are denoted as state 1 run and state 2 run respectively p 1 2 is either the probability of outcome of state 1 or state 2 let s start by investigating what happens when we do n trials for n 1 one can get two samples 1 2 in the case when n 2 there are 2 2 samples 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 in the same way for n 3 there are 2 3 samples 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 so for the trial of size n there are 2 n possible samples which contain combinations of outcomes of state 1 and state 2 from eq 4 p j l k the probability of state 1 run length l k in the jth sample can be expressed as 7 p j l k n 1 j k k 1 n n 1 j k n 1 j 0 n 1 j k n j where n 1 j k is the total number of state 1 run lengths l k in the jth sample n 1 j 0 is the total number of state 1 run lengths l 0 in the jth sample n 1 j 0 k 1 n n 2 j k n 2 j k is the total number of state 2 run lengths l k in the jth sample the run length probabilities p l k can be simulated from 2 n samples of size n and can be calculated using eq 7 as 8 p l k 1 n j 1 n p j l k 1 n j 1 n n 1 j k n j where n is the total number of n 2 n samples sample space for example considering n 3 state 1 run length probabilities p l k are shown in table 2 from table 2 one can get that the total number of runs in the sample space is equal to g n 16 the average probability in the last row in table 2 holds the condition m i 1 p i 1 namely k 0 5 p l k 1 and shows p l 0 0 5 p l 0 is just equal to the probability of occurrence of state 2 event in a similar vein table 3 presents the state 1 run length probabilities p l k for different sample sizes n and p 1 2 visual inspection of this table shows that the state 1 run length probabilities p l k are all constant when sample size n 11 in general state 1 run length probability p l k can be found to be 9 p l k 1 2 k 1 1 2 p k 1 p k 0 p 1 2 if one considers state 1 run length as drought length given p 1 2 eq 9 shows that the drought length follows the p k 1 p distribution not the p k 1 1 p distribution in eq 1 the differences between eq 1 and eq 9 are given in table 4 it is clear that the error becomes larger with the decrease in drought length under p 1 2 thus eq 1 is not satisfactory for selecting the distribution of drought length the numerical simulation of state 1 run length probabilities under p 1 3 p 1 4 and p 1 6 are presented in tables 5 7 which show that the run length probabilities become constant with the increase in sample size n continuation of simulation in the same way tables 5 7 lead to a general expression of state 1 run length probability p l k as 10 p l k p k 1 p k 0 the above discussion presents the state 1 run length probability of an integer state event sequence in fact this case can be thought of as an event occurrence with 1 p state and we can extend the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence to prove eq 10 the following is considered let x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of n identically and independently distributed random variables parameters x 0 p and q are defined in the aforementioned method from the definition of deficit run length state 1 run length i e a succession of deficit events preceded and succeeded by surplus events with the number of similar events in the deficit run referred to as deficit run length a deficit run length l k event can be written as 11 l k x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 from eq 11 it can be seen that x i x 0 is required and the probability of a deficit run length l k can be obtained as 12 p l k p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 p x i 2 x 0 p x i k x 0 p x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 q p k q q p k 1 p if k 0 eq 11 becomes l 0 x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 the probability of deficit run length l 0 can be expressed as p l 0 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 q hence eq 10 and eq 12 have the same results and the general expression of state 1 run length probability p l k in eq 12 is correct now considering eq 10 further we can get 13 k 0 p l k k 0 p k 1 p 1 p k 0 p k 1 p 1 1 p 1 this shows that eq 10 holds for the condition m i 1 p i 1 from eq 10 it is seen that p l 0 q 1 p l 0 means that a surplus x i x 0 event occurs this is also equivalent to the event of l 1 l 2 l n surplus run length state 2 run length occurrence as mentioned above the probability of x i x 0 event occurring is 1 p q these evidences show that eq 10 is correct we denote this model as geometric distribution ii for the sake of convenience we denote state 1 run length as run length in this paper we employ geometric distribution ii as a drought duration distribution and investigate its run length distribution and corresponding statistical characteristics using monte carlo simulation table 8 gives simulation probabilities and theoretical probabilities of state 1 run for various values of p and run length k in this case n 10000 the number of simulated samples n sim 1000 it is found that the probability values given by geometric distribution ii in general are in close agreement with simulation probability values which further validate eq 10 the cumulative distribution function cdf of a run length can be expressed as 14 p l k l 0 k 1 p l 1 p 1 p l 1 k 1 p l 1 p 1 p 1 p p l 1 k 1 p l 1 1 p p 1 p k 1 1 p k in the same way one can get 15 p l k l k p l 1 p 1 p l k p l let i l k and introducing this quantity eq 15 becomes 16 p l k 1 p i 0 p i k 1 p p k i 0 p i 1 p p k 1 1 p p k from eq 14 and eq 16 it is seen that p l k p l k 1 and p l 0 1 these results indicate eq 10 is correct 2 1 3 expectation and variance of a run length the expectation and variance of a run length are derived as follows 17 e l p 1 p 18 v a r l p 1 p 2 the detailed derivation process is given in appendix b 1 2 1 4 estimation of parameter of a run length distribution three of the most popular methods of parameter estimation are the method of event occurrence method of moments and maximum likelihood estimation given a truncation level x 0 x 1 x 2 x n can be classified as two distinct independent events surplus x i x 0 and deficit x i x 0 it is assumed there are n 1 events of x i x 0 and m runs of x i x 0 events which are denoted as l 0 l 1 l 2 l m 1 l i is the ith run length of x i x 0 event i 1 2 m 1 l 0 is the run length of x i x 0 event each of these methods is given in appendix b 2 2 1 5 empirical estimation of frequency of run length empirical estimation of the frequency of run length of a x i x 0 event is expressed as 19 p l k n 1 n k g n where g n is the total number of run lengths of x i x 0 g n k 1 n n 1 n k n 1 n 0 n 1 n k is the total number of run lengths k k 1 of x i x 0 in a sample size of n and n 1 n 0 is the total number of run lengths k 0 of x i x 0 in a sample size of n i e the total number of run lengths k k 1 of x i x 0 in the sample size of n n 1 n 0 k 1 n n 2 n k 2 1 6 estimation of return period of a run length 2 1 6 1 return period of a run length k the return period has two common definitions fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b bayazit 2001 one is defined as the average number of trials required to the first occurrence of an event that is greater than or equal to a particular critical event an alternative definition refers to the return period as the expected value of the number of trials between any two successive occurrences of events that is greater than or equal to a particular critical event two types of return period of run length of x i x 0 event are presented in appendix b 3 the sample return periods for run lengths k 1 2 8 and p 1 2 are respectively shown in table 9 the last row gives the corresponding theoretical return periods given by eq b 19 and shows that these sample return periods and theoretical return periods are in close agreement when sample size n is large based on bernoulli trials feller 1968 gave two approximations of return period formula for x x as follows 20 e n 1 p z z 1 1 x x z 1 p e w 1 p r 1 p p r where z 1 x 1 p p r 1 1 x 1 p p r e n is the expected value of the number of trials between any two successive occurrences of events x x e w is the average number of trials required to the first occurrence of an event x x feller s return period expressed by eq 20 can be calculated easily supplementary tables 1 7 compare feller s return periods and one given by eq 20 for q 0 3 0 1 0 9 and x 1 1 20 from supplementary tables 1 7 it can be seen that the difference between e w and e n of feller 1968 improves rapidly with x for a given q however there are significant differences between feller s return periods and one from eq b 19 the reason is that feller 1968 and eq 20 do not have the same run definition sen 1991a pointed out that feller s run definition is not well suited for application because it does not say anything about the start and finish of the run for example a run length of 5s s denotes success may be preceded and succeeded by other s sen 1991a in this paper we adopt yevjevich s 1967 run definition i e a run is defined as a succession of similar events preceded and succeeded by different events with the number of similar events which in turn is referred to as run length sen 1991a it makes a distinction between the start and finish of the run therefore a given run length occurrence may include the one defined by feller this causes the return periods significantly greater than ones defined by feller in supplementary tables 1 7 2 1 6 2 return period of a run length k or longer the expected number of runs of length k or longer is 21 n k p l k n l n p k 1 p the return period t l k of length k or longer can be computed as 22 t l k n n k 1 1 p p k using monte carlo simulation supplementary table 8 shows the sample return periods of a run length k or longer under p 1 2 it is seen that the last row of theoretical return periods calculated by eq 22 are essentially in agreement with the sample return periods when sample size n is large to further test the validity of eq 22 monte carlo simulation was used to compare the sample return periods and theoretical return periods of a run length k or longer for giving p visual inspection of supplementary table 9 shows the following significant points for a bernoulli process 1 for a given p the return period increases with the increasing drought duration particularly the increase in the value of drought duration causes more severe long return periods to occur when p 0 5 and p 0 5 2 according to the two definitions of return period fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b salas et al 2005 it is clear that there are essentially agreements among these sample return periods there is an increasing trend in the differences between sample return periods and the above derived return periods but the differences relative to the return periods are very small and 3 results indicate a close agreement between above derived return periods therefore it is concluded that the model is appropriate for representing the return period of run length of a bernoulli process fig 1 shows the return period of run length corresponding to p 0 3 0 1 0 9 2 2 probability distribution of drought duration from markov dependent process 2 2 1 run length probability distribution the markov dependent process which has two states and a homogeneous transition probability matrix is one of the simplest models the two states are commonly used to describe dry or wet year below or above a critical level let a truncated level x 0 be given and let x 1 x 2 x n denote a markov chain hydrological process in which state 0 represents a deficit x i x 0 event and state 1 defines a surplus x i x 0 event the transition probability matrix of the markov chain is represented by p 00 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p 01 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p 10 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 and p 11 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 of course the elements of the transition probability matrix follow p 00 p 01 1 and p 10 p 11 1 additionally p 0 p x i x 0 and p 1 p x i x 0 represent the unconditional probabilities of deficit and surplus events then p 0 p 1 1 using the same methods as the probability distribution of drought duration of independent bernoulli process the sample size n 10000 and the number of simulated samples n sim 1000 of the markov dependent model are generated for autocorrelation coefficient r and various p 00 supplementary figures 1 9 show the simulation probabilities and theoretical probabilities of state 0 run of these simulated samples err1 and err2 are the differences between simulation probabilities and geometric distribution i probabilities and between simulation probability and geometric distribution ii respectively supplementary figures 1 9 show that state 0 run length probabilities p l k can be found to be 23 p l k p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 based on the definition of deficit run length a deficit run length l k k 1 event from eq 11 can be written as p l k p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 x i x 0 p x i 2 x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i k 1 x 0 x i k x 0 p x i x 0 24 p 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 where the deficit run length k 1 if k 0 eq 11 becomes 25 l 0 x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 using eq 23 the probability of a deficit run length l 0 can be given as 26 p l 0 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 x i x 0 p x i x 0 p 1 p 11 p 1 p 11 from eq 24 and eq 26 the general probability formula of a deficit run length l k can be expressed as 27 p l k p 11 k 0 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 using eq 27 theoretical probabilities pmf of state 0 run for various values of r p and k are calculated and shown in supplementary figures 1 9 it can be seen that the theoretical probabilities of run length of markov chain models are in good agreement with simulation results for various values of r p and k this indicates that eq 27 is the correct expression now considering the condition m i 1 p i 1 of eq 27 further we get k 0 p l k p l 0 k 1 p l k p 11 k 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 28 p 11 p 10 1 p 00 k 1 p 00 k 1 p 11 p 10 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 p 11 p 10 1 this shows eq 27 holds for the condition m i 1 p i 1 p l 0 p 11 0 we recall the traditional probability formula of a deficit run length l k bayazit 2001 29 p l k p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 it is seen that the condition m i 1 p i 1 of eq 29 i e 30 k 1 p l k k 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1 p 00 k 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 1 from eq 29 p l 0 1 k 1 p l k 0 the result is obvious that the probability of deficit run length with 0 adopted in eq 29 is not consistent with the reality the cumulative distribution function cdf of run length can be expressed as 31 p l k l k p 10 p 00 l 1 1 p 00 p 10 1 p 00 l k p 00 l 1 k 1 let j l k l j k therefore eq 31 becomes p l k p 10 1 p 00 j 0 p 00 j k 1 p 10 1 p 00 p 00 k 1 j 0 p 00 j 32 p 10 1 p 00 p 00 k 1 1 1 p 00 p 10 p 00 k 1 k 1

markov chain is commonly calculated by the maximum likelihood estimator fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b let n ij be the number of transitions from state i to state j i 0 1 j 0 1 the elements of transition probability matrix can then be written as 37 p 01 n 01 n 00 n 01 p 10 n 10 n 10 n 11 p 00 p 01 1 p 10 p 11 1 assuming that p p x i x 0 and q p x i x 0 1 p represent the unconditional

bayazit 2001 two types of return periods of a run length event are derived as follows 2 2 4 1 return period of a run length k for a two state markov chain of size n with the conditional probability p 10 and p 00 the expected length is given by eq 34 the occurrence of the expected value of the total number of any run length n l is equal to 40 n l np e l np p 10 1 p 00 n p 1 p 00 p 10 the expected number of runs of length k is 41 n k p l k n l p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 n p 1 p 00 p 10 n p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 the mean interarrival time return period t l k can be computed as the ratio of the total length of the sample to the expected number of runs of length k 42 t l k n n k n np p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 1 p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 2 2 4 2 return period of a run length k or longer the expected number of runs of length k or longer is 43 n k p l k n l p 10 p 00 k 1 n p 1 p 00 p 10 n p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 the return period t l k of length k or longer can be computed by 44 t l k n n k n np p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1 p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 3 relations between properties of run length distributions derived from independent bernoulli and markov dependent processes if x 1 x 2 x n is an independent bernoulli series p 10 p p 00 p p 00 k 1 p p p k 1 p k the pmf in eq 27 reduces to that of a run length of independent bernoulli series p l k p k 1 p given by eq 10 the cdf of a run length expressed as eq 32 and eq 33 becomes that of drought duration of independent bernoulli series p l k p k p l k 1 p k shown by eq 16 and eq 14 the expectation and variance of a run length of markov dependent trials in eq 34 and eq 36 reduce to those of a run length of independent bernoulli trials e l p 1 p v a r l p 1 p 2 shown by eq 17 and eq 18 similar to the way mentioned in the section the return period estimation of a run length from eq 42 and eq 44 can be changed as t l k 1 1 p 2 p k and t l k 1 1 p p k these are the same as the return period estimation of a run length for independent bernoulli trials given by eq b 19 and eq 22 3 data and case study in order to illustrate the proposed drought distributions annual runoff and three monthly runoff series of the main stem of yellow river china were selected as the area of study for application the data were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission the case study sites are shown in table 10 to remove the seasonal effect three monthly runoff values were reconstructed 45 k i j p i j p i σ i where k i j is the new value for the ith month and the jth year j 1 2 n i 1 2 12 n is the number of years of the series p i j is the runoff for the ith month and the jth year p i is the runoff mean for the ith month σ i is the runoff standard deviation for the i th month the autocorrelation coefficients acfs of these k i j data are summarized in table 11 except for san menxia and lanzhou sites the rest of sites had very low serial correlation coefficients ρ 1 thus the independent bernoulli process eq 10 was used to calculate the probability distribution of drought duration of minhe and longmen sites eq 23 of markov dependent process was employed to compute the probability distribution of drought duration of san menxia and lanzhou sites a drought event was defined as the period during which k i j was below the predetermined truncation level 0 the truncation level can be taken as a constant during the period of records using the methods of event occurrence and maximum likelihood estimation parameters estimated are given in table 11 for the four cases the computed and observed probability values are shown in fig 2 it is clear that the geometric distribution ii fitted was in good agreement with observed data 4 discussion 4 1 pmf of run length the pmf of a run length was also derived from the run definition consider a markov dependent process given in table 12 a run length k event occurrence needs the following steps 1 at t 0 one gets x 0 1 2 at t 1 under the condition x 0 1 x 1 0 is obtained 3 at t 2 under the condition x 1 0 x 2 0 is obtained in the same way at t k 1 under the condition x k 1 0 one also gets x k 0 and 4 at t k 1 under the condition x k 0 one gets x k 1 1 this yields a run event l k x 1 0 x 0 1 x 2 0 x 1 0 x k 0 x k 1 0 x k 1 1 x k 0 then the probability of run length l k can be expressed as p l k p x 1 0 x 0 1 p x 2 0 x 1 0 p x k 0 x k 1 0 p x k 1 1 x k 0 46 p 10 p 00 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 if the series is independent eq 46 yields 47 p l k p k 1 p 4 2 empirical probability of a run length according to the geometric distribution i the pmf of run length p 00 k 1 p 01 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 has its empirical probability 48 p l k g k k 1 g k this is the empirical probability of run length k 1 which is not considering the run length k 0 in a sample from eq 11 the run length k 0 is equivalent to the occurrence of the x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 event from eq 11 the number of x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 occurrences is n 11 thus the number of run length k 0 occurrence g 0 can be written as 49 g 0 n 11 therefore the empirical probability of run length of the geometric distribution ii can be written as 50 p l k g k k 1 g k g 0 g k k 1 g k n 11 sen 1991b stated that the number of upcrossings and downcrossings differed at most by one n 10 k 1 g k by making use of this conclusion of sen 1991b eq 50 can be simplified as 51 p l k n 10 k 1 g k g k k 1 g k g 0 n 10 n 10 n 11 g k k 1 g k p 10 g k k 1 g k it can be said that the relationship of empirical probability of a run length between geometric distribution i and geometric distribution ii is 52 p l k p 10 p l k where p l k g k k 1 g k is the empirical probability of run length of geometric distribution i eq 48 indicates that the empirical probability of run length of geometric distribution i has overestimated values thus eq 50 is recommended to calculate the probability of run length for the independent bernoulli process and the markov dependent process supplementary figures 1 9 show the application of eq 50 4 3 average run length consider a sufficiently long sample of size n of a markov dependent process let n ij be the number of transitions from state i to state j i 0 1 j 0 1 it may be interesting to examine the expectation of run length of markov dependent trials e l given by eq 34 53 e l n 10 n 10 n 11 1 1 n 00 n 00 n 01 n 10 n 10 n 11 n 00 n 01 n 01 n 10 n 1 n 0 n 01 where n 0 and n 1 are the number of states 0 and 1 respectively n 01 and n 10 are the numbers of upcrossings and downcrossings p 10 n 10 n 10 n 11 1 1 p 00 1 1 n 00 n 00 n 01 n 0 n 01 since sen 1991b stated that the numbers of upcrossings and downcrossings differed at most by one they can be taken as equal in practice by making use of this assumption eq 53 can be expressed as 54 e l n 0 n 10 n 11 n 0 n 1 with the conclusion from sen 1991b n 01 n 10 eq 54 leads to e l n 0 n 01 n 0 n 10 e l of the geometric distribution i can be derived as follows let n 01 be the number of upcrossings of a sample or the number of events from state 0 to state 1 another method to calculate e l is n 01 e l n 0 np 1 p 00 e l n 0 namely 55 e l n 0 np 1 p 00 n 0 n 1 p 1 p 00 p 1 p 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 l 0 1 2 n for the geometric distribution i of independent bernoulli trials one obtains n 01 e l n 0 n p 1 p e l n 0 56 e l n 0 np 1 p n 0 n 1 p 1 p p 1 p 1 p 1 1 p l 1 2 n for the geometric distribution ii of markov dependent trials one obtains n 01 e l p 10 n 0 namely np 1 p 00 e l p 10 n 0 57 e l p 10 n 0 np 1 p 00 p 10 n 0 n 1 p 1 p 00 p 10 p 1 p 1 p 00 p 10 1 p 00 if an independent bernoulli series exists eq 57 leads to 58 e l p n 0 np 1 p p n 0 n 1 p 1 p p p 1 p 1 p p 1 p 5 conclusions correct assessment of the probability of drought duration is pivotal for drought management and mitigation the geometric distribution has two forms i e geometric distribution i and geometric distribution ii literature survey shows that drought duration has been assumed to follow the geometric distribution i our study finds that drought duration follows the geometric distribution ii rather than geometric distribution i this conclusion is completely different from the existing geometric distribution i reported in the literature using stochastic process theory and monte carlo technique it is shown that drought duration follows the geometric distribution ii from the probability of run length of a sequence of integer state events two new types of drought length distributions were derived these distributions have extended the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence and are different from the existing drought length distribution geometric distribution i based on an independent bernoulli process and a markov dependent process monte carlo simulations show that new types of drought length distributions are consistent with the rule of run occurrence these new types of drought length distributions also provide the correct probability computation of a drought duration equal to 0 there are significant differences among two return periods given by feller 1968 and those derived in this paper the reason is that the definition of feller 1968 does not say anything about the start and finish of the run therefore the two return periods given by feller 1968 cannot calculate the return period of a drought duration our applications show that there is a good agreement between empirical probabilities and theoretical ones results of this study will be useful in drought analysis although the distributions derived in this paper are for hydrological drought they can be applied to other types of drought probability measures however it is necessary to further understand and describe the probability of drought events under climate change this is an ongoing work credit authorship

statistical properties of droughts the geometric distribution i has been widely employed şen 2015 the geometric distribution has two common types https en wikipedia org wiki geometric distribution one is expressed by eq a 1 that describes the probability distribution of the number l of bernoulli trials needed to get one success where l has the set 1 2 3 a 1 p l k p k 1 1 p k 1 2 where p is the parameter of the geometric distribution i in literature it represents the probability of a drought event and k is the drought duration of the drought event the other one is the probability distribution of the number y l 1 of successes before the first failure supported on the set 0 1 2 3 a 2 f y p y y p y 1 p y 0 1 2 both eq a 1 and eq a 2 are called the geometric distribution for the convenience of description eq a 1 and eq a 2 are denoted as the geometric distribution i and the geometric distribution ii respectively two different geometric distributions are recognized let x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of size n if a truncated level x 0 is given one can get two distinct independent events surplus x i x 0 and deficit x i x 0 respectively the probabilities of these events can be denoted as p p x i x 0 and q p x i x 0 1 p a deficit run that consists of k events x i x 0 preceded and succeeded by one or more events x i x 0 will be used to review the characteristics of the geometric distribution i appendix a 2 probability distribution of a run length of an independent bernoulli process considering an independent bernoulli process the probability mass function pmf of geometric distribution i is given as eq a 1 the cumulative distribution function cdf of a run length can be written as şen 2015 bayazit 2001 a 3 p l k l 1 k 1 p l 1 1 p 1 p k 1 a 4 p l k l k p l 1 1 p

period t l k of length k or longer can be given bayazit 2001 respectively as a 16 t l k 1 p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 a 17 t l k 1 p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 appendix a 4 shortcomings of geometric distribution i describing drought duration probability geometric distribution i is commonly used for analyzing the statistical properties of drought events examining its pmf given by eqs a 1 and a 10 and the expectation of eqs a 5 and a 13 the shortcomings of geometric distribution i when used to measure the drought duration probability can be enumerated from eq a 10 the same result as p l 0 from eq a 1 can be obtained as a 18 p l 0 1 l 1 p l l 1 l 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 0 the reason for p l 0 0 is that eq a 1 and eq a 10 only use its deficit runs as a run sample space to calculate the probability of each deficit run this point is further shown in the following a run sample space is comprised of its surplus runs and deficit runs each trial a surplus run or a deficit run has the corresponding possibility of occurrence with a certain probability l 0 means that a deficit run does not occur and a surplus run possibly occurs the probability of the surplus run occurrence is not equal to 0 for the expectation of a run length eq a 13 has the same result of 1 as that of eq a 5 when p 00 0 p 00 0 indicates that there is no deficit event occurrence for the given process and the expectation of a deficit run should be equal to 0 appendix b new probability distribution and characteristics of a run length b 1 expectation and variance of a run length for independent bernoulli process the expectation and variance of a run length are derived as follows b 1 e l k 0 k p l k k 0 k p k 1 p 1 p p k 0 k p k 1 b 2 e l 2 k 0 k 2 p l k 1 p k 0 k 2 p k 1 p k 0 k k 1 p k k 0 k p k b3 p l 1 l eq b 13 is the formula for parameter p estimation by the method of moments appendix b 2 maximum likelihood estimation for the run sequence of x i x 0 events l 0 l 1 l 2 l m 1 the likelihood function can be written as b 14 ln i 0 m p l i 1 p 1 p m p i 0 m l i taking the logarithm of eq b 14 one gets b 15 ln l n m ln 1 p i 0 m l i ln p differentiating eq b 15 partially with respect to parameter p and equating its partial derivative to zero result in b 16 p i 0 m l i i 0 m l i m 1 m i 0 m l i 1 1 m i 0 m l i l 1 l it is seen that parameter p estimated by the method of moments is the same as that by the maxi mum likelihood estimation appendix b 3 estimation of return period of a run length k for independent bernoulli process following bayazit 2001 two types of return period of run length of x i x 0 event are presented as follows consider a sequence of size n the expected value of occurrence of the total number of any run length l n l is equal to b 17 n l np e l np p 1 p n 1 p then the expected number of runs of length k can be written as b 18 n k p l k n d n p k 1 p 2 the mean interarrival time return period t l k can be computed as the ratio of the total length of the sample to the expected number of runs of length k b 19 t l k n n k 1 1 p 2 p k the validity of eq b 20 is demonstrated for different simulation sample lengths in this section appendix b 4 expectation and variance

4486,the probability of drought duration is a key for drought management literature survey shows that drought duration has been assumed to follow the geometric distribution i but it yields zero probability of a drought with duration equal to zero which however is not consistent with reality this shortcoming served as a motivation to derive a new distribution for the probability of drought duration using an independent bernoulli process and a markov dependent process it was found that the drought duration followed the geometric distribution ii results of the derived distribution were in agreement with those of a simulation study results four examples from yellow river basin in china were used to illustrate the application of the proposed distribution keywords hydrological drought drought duration probability distribution return period drought analysis 1 introduction drought greatly impacts the economy environment ecosystem and living standard there have been severe droughts in recent decades including 2010 2011 east africa drought 2011 texas drought 2012 u s central great plains drought 2012 2015 california drought hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 to name but a few drought has the characteristics of high occurrence frequency long duration and wide spread the length of the drought duration has severely affected crop growth industrial production urban and rural water supply it also caused ecological problems such as water shortages and desertification increasing thence drought duration plays a key role in early warning to mitigate drought impacts hao and aghakouchak 2013 2014 hao et al 2014 in hydrological engineering practice the run theory advanced by yevjevich 1967 has been extensively employed for defining drought and its characteristics including duration over different periods year month and week sharma and panu 2015 2017 tabari et al 2013 drought has since been characterized probabilistically hershfield et al 1972 mishra and singh 2010 sen 2015 considered uncertainty inherent to drought evolution and discussed analysis and modeling of temporal drought regional drought and spatiotemporal drought one common way to define drought duration and deficit volume is by the threshold level approach liu et al 2016 sharma and panu 2012 based on the studies by feller 1968 and schwager 1983 the return period of a run event has been computed salas et al 2005 salas and obeysekera 2014 tarawneh and bdour 2016 fernandez and salas 1999a fernandez and salas 1999b discussed the return period and risk of failure of runs of independent bernoulli trials and runs of markov dependent trials using a compound renewal model loáiciga 2005 calculated multiyear drought recurrence in the upper santa ynez river basin drought is multi attribute characterized by several non independent random variables shiau et al 2006 shiau and modarres 2009 shiau 2003 reasoned that a multivariate distribution would better represent drought than a univariate distribution and calculated bivariate return periods kim et al 2003 kim et al 2006 and lall et al 1996 employed a nonparametric kernel estimator to estimate the return periods of univariate drought as well as bivariate droughts copulas have recently been used to construct multivariate probability distributions of drought song and singh 2010 tsakiris et al 2016 vergni et al 2020 sometimes two or more distributions can fit the drought data well zuo et al 2017 employed copula functions to derive a conditional probability distribution of meteorological characteristics and hydrological droughts and constructed links between these two drought types montaseri et al 2018 thought traditional analyses assume that drought durations would be independent series unconnected drought runs udr this method may neglect the short term extreme droughts within a long term udr they treated drought durations as a combination of short term connected drought runs cdr and used duration and severity to describe the agricultural drought events finally copula was applied to evaluate udr and cdr the results indicated that the bivariate drought duration and severity analysis has significantly improved traditional approach meteorological drought and hydrological drought are two common types of drought they may be inherently correlated series and have a certain time tag zhu et al 2017 employed copula functions to derive a conditional probability distribution of meteorological characteristics and hydrological droughts and constructed links between these two drought types the case of the yellow river basin yrb of china shows the potential of the models the case of the yellow river basin yrb of china shows the potential of the models cavus and aksoy 2020 pointed out that precipitation deficit is more useful and physically meaningful than standardized precipitation index spi in water resources management based on the total probability theorem they proposed a novelty severity intensity duration frequency curves the critical drought concept the largest drought severity in each year extends the drought indices although a number of papers have been published in the drought indices little work has been carried out for the present scenario of climate change das et al 2020 employed a time varying parameters gamma distribution considering location parameter as climate indices covariate and copula functions to build a non stationary evaluation model of the drought characteristics under climate change the cases of two himalayan states in india indicate that the drought index and the copula based models have robust and effective characteristics in the changing climate in the past decades increased attention has been to develop drought monitoring however the drought spatio temporal dynamics requires in depth research in the future diaz et al 2020 built a new method of the spatial tracks and paths of drought which can enhance spatiotemporal monitoring of droughts wang et al 2020 used standardized streamflow index and precipitation evapotranspiration index to evaluate the hydrological drought and meteorological drought in the yellow river basin of china and indicated that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought in the yrb since drought is often perceived as a seasonal event frequency analysis of a seasonal drought length appears more significant in practice even though weekly monthly and annual drought lengths have been derived cancelliere and salas 2004 sharma and panu 2013a 2013b 2014 literature survey shows that assuming a stationary and independent process a geometric probability law has been used for modeling drought duration şen 2015 hershfield et al 1972 1 p l k p k 1 1 p k 1 2 where p is the probability of a drought event and k is the duration of the drought event assuming that x 1 x 2 x n is a stationary markov chain drought process the probability distribution of its duration k has the same form as has a stationary and independent process akeyuz et al 2012 2 p l k p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 where p 00 is the conditional probability occurrence of drought x t given that drought x t 1 occurred eq 1 and eq 2 are the probability mass functions pmf to describe the probability of drought duration sen 2015 presented some proofs for eq 1 and eq 2 but on examination following problems are discovered for convenience of description we denote eq 1 as geometric distribution i in this paper the probability distribution expectation variance return period and shortcomings of a drought duration run length are given in appendix a from eq 1 p l 0 can be found as 3 p l 0 1 l 1 p l l 1 l 1 p l 1 1 p 1 1 p 1 1 p 0 the probability of drought duration l 0 adopted in eq 3 is not in agreement with the usual drought duration adopted in hydrology the reason for this is that l 0 is equivalent to a no drought event occurrence in other words for a given area if the probability of a no drought event is 0 then it can be concluded that the probability of the corresponding complementary event drought event is 1 thus eq 1 is an incorrect drought duration probability law similarly it is also found that the expectation of a drought duration e l 1 1 p yields e l 1 when p 0 for a drought event with duration 0 the result shows that its expectation is 1 in reality the expectation of drought with duration 0 should be 0 these results also appear in dependent trials see appendix a 4 due to the above deficiencies in the existing probability distribution of drought duration it is necessary to derive another probability distribution for drought duration which should have strict mathematical bases and correct numerical characteristics and return periods formulae the objective of this study therefore is to propose a probability distribution for drought duration l derive its statistical properties and test the expression of return period of drought duration to achieve this goal this study uses stochastic process theory and monte carlo techniques to find the probability of drought duration l with integer state furthermore according to the definition of run we extend the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence and propose a probability distribution of drought duration with an independent bernoulli process we also find a probability distribution for drought duration with a markov dependent process monte carlo experiments show that these models are correct finally we present the formulae for return periods of drought duration the proposed models are illustrated using four examples from yellow river basin china the results obtained would be useful for drought analysis 2 theory and methodology for an independent bernoulli process given a probability p of a drought event if 1 p represents an integral state outcomes then monte carlo simulation can be used to generate all sample realizations based on the property of a stationary stochastic process one can derive the probability mass function pmf of a run length for an independent bernoulli process with integral state outcomes and then extend it to the pmf of a run length with a non integral state consequently the pmf of a run length for a two state markov dependent process can be derived 2 1 probability distribution of drought duration of independent bernoulli process 2 1 1 probability of run length of a sample consider a sample from independent bernoulli trials 1111122211111221121221222212121112111 it is easy to see that the probabilities of state 1 and state 2 are 22 37 and 15 37 respectively the sample has 17 runs of state 1 and state 2 using the probability multiplication theorem the probability for a run length k can be computed as 4 p l i k n l i k g n i 1 2 0 1 2 3 5 i 1 0 1 2 3 4 i 2 where l 1 and l 2 are the run lengths of state 1 and state 2 respectively n is the size of the sample g n is the total number of runs of state 1 and state 2 in the sample in this case g n 17 including 9 runs of state 1 8 runs of state 2 they form the run sample space of the sample from geometric distribution i the probability of a run length is calculated as 5 p l 1 k n l 1 k 9 k 0 1 2 3 5 6 p l 2 k n l 2 k 8 k 0 1 2 3 4 therefore there is a significant difference in probabilities of a run length calculated from geometric distribution i and eq 4 table 1 shows the calculated probabilities p l 1 k and p l 2 k using eq 4 from table 1 one can see the following relationship for a sample of given independent bernoulli trials k 1 5 p l 1 k 2 17 2 17 1 17 4 17 9 17 p l 2 0 k 1 4 p l 2 k 1 17 1 17 2 17 4 17 8 17 p l 1 0 and k 1 5 p l 1 k k 1 4 p l 2 k k 1 5 p l 1 k p l 1 0 p l 2 0 k 1 4 p l 2 k 1 the last relationship satisfies the condition m i 1 pi 1 and indicates the probability of run length of a sample and eq 4 is validated 2 1 2 probability distribution of run length eq 4 gives the probability of a run length for a sample of independent bernoulli trials and is one combination of values of the trial a run length probability should be an average probability of all combinations of state 1 and state 2 of the trials let us consider an independent bernoulli trial of size n each trial has 2 possible outcomes denoted as state 1 and state 2 the corresponding runs are denoted as state 1 run and state 2 run respectively p 1 2 is either the probability of outcome of state 1 or state 2 let s start by investigating what happens when we do n trials for n 1 one can get two samples 1 2 in the case when n 2 there are 2 2 samples 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 in the same way for n 3 there are 2 3 samples 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 so for the trial of size n there are 2 n possible samples which contain combinations of outcomes of state 1 and state 2 from eq 4 p j l k the probability of state 1 run length l k in the jth sample can be expressed as 7 p j l k n 1 j k k 1 n n 1 j k n 1 j 0 n 1 j k n j where n 1 j k is the total number of state 1 run lengths l k in the jth sample n 1 j 0 is the total number of state 1 run lengths l 0 in the jth sample n 1 j 0 k 1 n n 2 j k n 2 j k is the total number of state 2 run lengths l k in the jth sample the run length probabilities p l k can be simulated from 2 n samples of size n and can be calculated using eq 7 as 8 p l k 1 n j 1 n p j l k 1 n j 1 n n 1 j k n j where n is the total number of n 2 n samples sample space for example considering n 3 state 1 run length probabilities p l k are shown in table 2 from table 2 one can get that the total number of runs in the sample space is equal to g n 16 the average probability in the last row in table 2 holds the condition m i 1 p i 1 namely k 0 5 p l k 1 and shows p l 0 0 5 p l 0 is just equal to the probability of occurrence of state 2 event in a similar vein table 3 presents the state 1 run length probabilities p l k for different sample sizes n and p 1 2 visual inspection of this table shows that the state 1 run length probabilities p l k are all constant when sample size n 11 in general state 1 run length probability p l k can be found to be 9 p l k 1 2 k 1 1 2 p k 1 p k 0 p 1 2 if one considers state 1 run length as drought length given p 1 2 eq 9 shows that the drought length follows the p k 1 p distribution not the p k 1 1 p distribution in eq 1 the differences between eq 1 and eq 9 are given in table 4 it is clear that the error becomes larger with the decrease in drought length under p 1 2 thus eq 1 is not satisfactory for selecting the distribution of drought length the numerical simulation of state 1 run length probabilities under p 1 3 p 1 4 and p 1 6 are presented in tables 5 7 which show that the run length probabilities become constant with the increase in sample size n continuation of simulation in the same way tables 5 7 lead to a general expression of state 1 run length probability p l k as 10 p l k p k 1 p k 0 the above discussion presents the state 1 run length probability of an integer state event sequence in fact this case can be thought of as an event occurrence with 1 p state and we can extend the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence to prove eq 10 the following is considered let x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of n identically and independently distributed random variables parameters x 0 p and q are defined in the aforementioned method from the definition of deficit run length state 1 run length i e a succession of deficit events preceded and succeeded by surplus events with the number of similar events in the deficit run referred to as deficit run length a deficit run length l k event can be written as 11 l k x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 from eq 11 it can be seen that x i x 0 is required and the probability of a deficit run length l k can be obtained as 12 p l k p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 p x i 2 x 0 p x i k x 0 p x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 q p k q q p k 1 p if k 0 eq 11 becomes l 0 x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 the probability of deficit run length l 0 can be expressed as p l 0 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 q hence eq 10 and eq 12 have the same results and the general expression of state 1 run length probability p l k in eq 12 is correct now considering eq 10 further we can get 13 k 0 p l k k 0 p k 1 p 1 p k 0 p k 1 p 1 1 p 1 this shows that eq 10 holds for the condition m i 1 p i 1 from eq 10 it is seen that p l 0 q 1 p l 0 means that a surplus x i x 0 event occurs this is also equivalent to the event of l 1 l 2 l n surplus run length state 2 run length occurrence as mentioned above the probability of x i x 0 event occurring is 1 p q these evidences show that eq 10 is correct we denote this model as geometric distribution ii for the sake of convenience we denote state 1 run length as run length in this paper we employ geometric distribution ii as a drought duration distribution and investigate its run length distribution and corresponding statistical characteristics using monte carlo simulation table 8 gives simulation probabilities and theoretical probabilities of state 1 run for various values of p and run length k in this case n 10000 the number of simulated samples n sim 1000 it is found that the probability values given by geometric distribution ii in general are in close agreement with simulation probability values which further validate eq 10 the cumulative distribution function cdf of a run length can be expressed as 14 p l k l 0 k 1 p l 1 p 1 p l 1 k 1 p l 1 p 1 p 1 p p l 1 k 1 p l 1 1 p p 1 p k 1 1 p k in the same way one can get 15 p l k l k p l 1 p 1 p l k p l let i l k and introducing this quantity eq 15 becomes 16 p l k 1 p i 0 p i k 1 p p k i 0 p i 1 p p k 1 1 p p k from eq 14 and eq 16 it is seen that p l k p l k 1 and p l 0 1 these results indicate eq 10 is correct 2 1 3 expectation and variance of a run length the expectation and variance of a run length are derived as follows 17 e l p 1 p 18 v a r l p 1 p 2 the detailed derivation process is given in appendix b 1 2 1 4 estimation of parameter of a run length distribution three of the most popular methods of parameter estimation are the method of event occurrence method of moments and maximum likelihood estimation given a truncation level x 0 x 1 x 2 x n can be classified as two distinct independent events surplus x i x 0 and deficit x i x 0 it is assumed there are n 1 events of x i x 0 and m runs of x i x 0 events which are denoted as l 0 l 1 l 2 l m 1 l i is the ith run length of x i x 0 event i 1 2 m 1 l 0 is the run length of x i x 0 event each of these methods is given in appendix b 2 2 1 5 empirical estimation of frequency of run length empirical estimation of the frequency of run length of a x i x 0 event is expressed as 19 p l k n 1 n k g n where g n is the total number of run lengths of x i x 0 g n k 1 n n 1 n k n 1 n 0 n 1 n k is the total number of run lengths k k 1 of x i x 0 in a sample size of n and n 1 n 0 is the total number of run lengths k 0 of x i x 0 in a sample size of n i e the total number of run lengths k k 1 of x i x 0 in the sample size of n n 1 n 0 k 1 n n 2 n k 2 1 6 estimation of return period of a run length 2 1 6 1 return period of a run length k the return period has two common definitions fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b bayazit 2001 one is defined as the average number of trials required to the first occurrence of an event that is greater than or equal to a particular critical event an alternative definition refers to the return period as the expected value of the number of trials between any two successive occurrences of events that is greater than or equal to a particular critical event two types of return period of run length of x i x 0 event are presented in appendix b 3 the sample return periods for run lengths k 1 2 8 and p 1 2 are respectively shown in table 9 the last row gives the corresponding theoretical return periods given by eq b 19 and shows that these sample return periods and theoretical return periods are in close agreement when sample size n is large based on bernoulli trials feller 1968 gave two approximations of return period formula for x x as follows 20 e n 1 p z z 1 1 x x z 1 p e w 1 p r 1 p p r where z 1 x 1 p p r 1 1 x 1 p p r e n is the expected value of the number of trials between any two successive occurrences of events x x e w is the average number of trials required to the first occurrence of an event x x feller s return period expressed by eq 20 can be calculated easily supplementary tables 1 7 compare feller s return periods and one given by eq 20 for q 0 3 0 1 0 9 and x 1 1 20 from supplementary tables 1 7 it can be seen that the difference between e w and e n of feller 1968 improves rapidly with x for a given q however there are significant differences between feller s return periods and one from eq b 19 the reason is that feller 1968 and eq 20 do not have the same run definition sen 1991a pointed out that feller s run definition is not well suited for application because it does not say anything about the start and finish of the run for example a run length of 5s s denotes success may be preceded and succeeded by other s sen 1991a in this paper we adopt yevjevich s 1967 run definition i e a run is defined as a succession of similar events preceded and succeeded by different events with the number of similar events which in turn is referred to as run length sen 1991a it makes a distinction between the start and finish of the run therefore a given run length occurrence may include the one defined by feller this causes the return periods significantly greater than ones defined by feller in supplementary tables 1 7 2 1 6 2 return period of a run length k or longer the expected number of runs of length k or longer is 21 n k p l k n l n p k 1 p the return period t l k of length k or longer can be computed as 22 t l k n n k 1 1 p p k using monte carlo simulation supplementary table 8 shows the sample return periods of a run length k or longer under p 1 2 it is seen that the last row of theoretical return periods calculated by eq 22 are essentially in agreement with the sample return periods when sample size n is large to further test the validity of eq 22 monte carlo simulation was used to compare the sample return periods and theoretical return periods of a run length k or longer for giving p visual inspection of supplementary table 9 shows the following significant points for a bernoulli process 1 for a given p the return period increases with the increasing drought duration particularly the increase in the value of drought duration causes more severe long return periods to occur when p 0 5 and p 0 5 2 according to the two definitions of return period fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b salas et al 2005 it is clear that there are essentially agreements among these sample return periods there is an increasing trend in the differences between sample return periods and the above derived return periods but the differences relative to the return periods are very small and 3 results indicate a close agreement between above derived return periods therefore it is concluded that the model is appropriate for representing the return period of run length of a bernoulli process fig 1 shows the return period of run length corresponding to p 0 3 0 1 0 9 2 2 probability distribution of drought duration from markov dependent process 2 2 1 run length probability distribution the markov dependent process which has two states and a homogeneous transition probability matrix is one of the simplest models the two states are commonly used to describe dry or wet year below or above a critical level let a truncated level x 0 be given and let x 1 x 2 x n denote a markov chain hydrological process in which state 0 represents a deficit x i x 0 event and state 1 defines a surplus x i x 0 event the transition probability matrix of the markov chain is represented by p 00 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p 01 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p 10 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 and p 11 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 of course the elements of the transition probability matrix follow p 00 p 01 1 and p 10 p 11 1 additionally p 0 p x i x 0 and p 1 p x i x 0 represent the unconditional probabilities of deficit and surplus events then p 0 p 1 1 using the same methods as the probability distribution of drought duration of independent bernoulli process the sample size n 10000 and the number of simulated samples n sim 1000 of the markov dependent model are generated for autocorrelation coefficient r and various p 00 supplementary figures 1 9 show the simulation probabilities and theoretical probabilities of state 0 run of these simulated samples err1 and err2 are the differences between simulation probabilities and geometric distribution i probabilities and between simulation probability and geometric distribution ii respectively supplementary figures 1 9 show that state 0 run length probabilities p l k can be found to be 23 p l k p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 based on the definition of deficit run length a deficit run length l k k 1 event from eq 11 can be written as p l k p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 x i 2 x 0 x i k x 0 x i k 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 x i x 0 p x i 2 x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i k 1 x 0 x i k x 0 p x i x 0 24 p 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 where the deficit run length k 1 if k 0 eq 11 becomes 25 l 0 x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 using eq 23 the probability of a deficit run length l 0 can be given as 26 p l 0 p x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 p x i x 0 p x i x 0 p x i 1 x 0 x i x 0 p x i x 0 p 1 p 11 p 1 p 11 from eq 24 and eq 26 the general probability formula of a deficit run length l k can be expressed as 27 p l k p 11 k 0 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 using eq 27 theoretical probabilities pmf of state 0 run for various values of r p and k are calculated and shown in supplementary figures 1 9 it can be seen that the theoretical probabilities of run length of markov chain models are in good agreement with simulation results for various values of r p and k this indicates that eq 27 is the correct expression now considering the condition m i 1 p i 1 of eq 27 further we get k 0 p l k p l 0 k 1 p l k p 11 k 1 p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 28 p 11 p 10 1 p 00 k 1 p 00 k 1 p 11 p 10 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 p 11 p 10 1 this shows eq 27 holds for the condition m i 1 p i 1 p l 0 p 11 0 we recall the traditional probability formula of a deficit run length l k bayazit 2001 29 p l k p 00 k 1 1 p 00 k 1 it is seen that the condition m i 1 p i 1 of eq 29 i e 30 k 1 p l k k 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1 p 00 k 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 1 from eq 29 p l 0 1 k 1 p l k 0 the result is obvious that the probability of deficit run length with 0 adopted in eq 29 is not consistent with the reality the cumulative distribution function cdf of run length can be expressed as 31 p l k l k p 10 p 00 l 1 1 p 00 p 10 1 p 00 l k p 00 l 1 k 1 let j l k l j k therefore eq 31 becomes p l k p 10 1 p 00 j 0 p 00 j k 1 p 10 1 p 00 p 00 k 1 j 0 p 00 j 32 p 10 1 p 00 p 00 k 1 1 1 p 00 p 10 p 00 k 1 k 1

markov chain is commonly calculated by the maximum likelihood estimator fernandez and salas 1999a 1999b let n ij be the number of transitions from state i to state j i 0 1 j 0 1 the elements of transition probability matrix can then be written as 37 p 01 n 01 n 00 n 01 p 10 n 10 n 10 n 11 p 00 p 01 1 p 10 p 11 1 assuming that p p x i x 0 and q p x i x 0 1 p represent the unconditional probabilities of deficit and surplus events respectively sen 1976 provided the following relationships 38 p 01 q p 1 p 11 39 p 00 1 q p 1 p 11 2 2 4 return period estimation of a run length following bayazit 2001 two types of return periods of a run length event are derived as follows 2 2 4 1 return period of a run length k for a two state markov chain of size n with the conditional probability p 10 and p 00 the expected length is given by eq 34 the occurrence of the expected value of the total number of any run length n l is equal to 40 n l np e l np p 10 1 p 00 n p 1 p 00 p 10 the expected number of runs of length k is 41 n k p l k n l p 10 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 n p 1 p 00 p 10 n p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 the mean interarrival time return period t l k can be computed as the ratio of the total length of the sample to the expected number of runs of length k 42 t l k n n k n np p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 1 p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 2 2 2 4 2 return period of a run length k or longer the expected number of runs of length k or longer is 43 n k p l k n l p 10 p 00 k 1 n p 1 p 00 p 10 n p p 00 k 1 1 p 00 the return period t l k of length k or longer can be computed by 44 t l k n n k n np p 00 k 1 1 p 00 1

length from eq 42 and eq 44 can be changed as t l k 1 1 p 2 p k and t l k 1 1 p p k these are the same as the return period estimation of a run length for independent bernoulli trials given by eq b 19 and eq 22 3 data and case study in order to illustrate the proposed drought distributions annual runoff and three monthly runoff series of the main stem of yellow river china were selected as the area of study for application the data were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission the case study sites are shown in table 10 to remove the seasonal effect three monthly runoff values were reconstructed 45 k i j p i j p i σ i where k i j is the new value for the ith month and the jth year j 1 2 n i 1 2 12 n is the number of years of the series p i j is the runoff for the ith month and the jth year p i is the runoff mean for the ith month σ i is the runoff standard deviation for the i th month the autocorrelation coefficients acfs of these k i j data are summarized in table 11 except for san menxia and lanzhou sites the rest of sites had very low serial correlation coefficients ρ 1 thus the independent bernoulli process eq 10 was used to calculate the probability distribution of drought duration of minhe and longmen sites eq 23 of markov dependent process was employed to compute the probability distribution of drought duration of san menxia and lanzhou sites a drought event was defined as the period during which k i j was below the predetermined truncation level 0 the truncation level can be taken as a constant during the period of records using the methods of event occurrence and maximum likelihood estimation parameters estimated are given in table 11 for the four cases the computed and observed probability values are shown in fig 2 it is clear that the geometric distribution ii fitted was in good agreement with observed data 4 discussion 4 1 pmf of run length the pmf of a run length was also derived from the run definition consider a markov dependent process given in table 12 a run length k event occurrence needs the following steps 1 at t 0 one gets x 0 1 2 at t 1 under the condition x 0 1 x 1 0 is obtained 3 at t 2 under the condition x 1 0 x 2 0 is obtained in the same way at t k 1 under the condition x k 1 0 one also gets x k 0 and 4 at t k 1 under the condition x k 0 one gets x k 1 1 this yields a run event l k x 1 0 x 0 1 x 2 0 x 1 0 x k 0 x k 1 0 x k 1 1 x k 0 then the probability of run length l k can be expressed as p l k p x 1 0 x 0 1 p x 2 0 x 1 0 p x k 0 x k 1 0 p x k 1 1 x k 0 46 p 10 p 00 p 00 k 1 p 01 p 10 p 00 k 1 p 01 if the series is independent eq 46 yields 47 p l k p k 1 p 4 2 empirical probability of a run length according to the geometric distribution i the pmf of run length p 00 k 1 p 01 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 has its empirical probability 48 p l k g k k 1 g k this is the empirical probability of run length k 1 which is not considering the run length k 0 in a sample from eq 11 the run length k 0 is equivalent to the occurrence of the x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 event from eq 11 the number of x i x 0 x i 1 x 0 occurrences is n 11 thus the number of run length k 0 occurrence g 0 can be written as 49 g 0 n 11 therefore the empirical probability of run length of the geometric distribution ii can be written as 50 p l k g k k 1 g k g 0 g k k 1 g k n 11 sen 1991b stated that the number of upcrossings and downcrossings differed at most by one n 10 k 1 g k by making use of this conclusion of sen 1991b eq 50 can be simplified as 51 p l k n 10 k 1 g k g k k 1 g k g 0 n 10 n 10 n 11 g k k 1 g k p 10 g k k 1 g k it can be said that the relationship of empirical probability of a run length between geometric distribution i and geometric distribution ii is 52 p l k p 10 p l k where p l k g k k 1 g k is the empirical probability of run length of geometric distribution i eq 48 indicates that the empirical probability of run length of geometric distribution i has overestimated values thus eq 50 is recommended to calculate the probability of run length for the independent bernoulli process and the markov dependent process supplementary figures 1 9 show the application of eq 50 4 3 average run length consider a sufficiently long sample of size n of a markov dependent process let n ij be the number of transitions from state i to state j i 0 1 j 0 1 it may be interesting to examine the expectation of run length of markov dependent trials e l given by eq 34 53 e l n 10 n 10 n 11 1 1 n 00 n 00 n 01 n 10 n 10 n 11 n 00 n 01 n 01 n 10 n 1 n 0 n 01 where n 0 and n 1 are the number of states 0 and 1 respectively n 01 and n 10 are the numbers of upcrossings and downcrossings p 10 n 10 n 10 n 11 1 1 p 00 1 1 n 00 n 00 n 01 n 0 n 01 since sen 1991b stated that the numbers of upcrossings and downcrossings differed at most by one they can be taken as equal in practice by making use of this assumption eq 53 can be expressed as 54 e l n 0 n 10 n 11 n 0 n 1 with the conclusion from sen 1991b n 01 n 10 eq 54 leads to e l n 0 n 01 n 0 n 10 e l of the geometric distribution i can be derived as follows let n 01 be the number of upcrossings of a sample or the number of events from state 0 to state 1 another method to calculate e l is n 01 e l n 0 np 1 p 00 e l n 0 namely 55 e l n 0 np 1 p 00 n 0 n 1 p 1 p 00 p 1 p 1 p 00 1 1 p 00 l 0 1 2 n for the geometric distribution i

forms i e geometric distribution i and geometric distribution ii literature survey shows that drought duration has been assumed to follow the geometric distribution i our study finds that drought duration follows the geometric distribution ii rather than geometric distribution i this conclusion is completely different from the existing geometric distribution i reported in the literature using stochastic process theory and monte carlo technique it is shown that drought duration follows the geometric distribution ii from the probability of run length of a sequence of integer state events two new types of drought length distributions were derived these distributions have extended the results of an integer state sequence to that of a non integer state sequence and are different from the existing drought length distribution geometric distribution i based on an independent bernoulli process and a markov dependent process monte carlo simulations show that new types of drought length distributions are consistent with the rule of run occurrence these new types of drought length distributions also provide the correct probability computation of a drought duration equal to 0 there are significant differences among two return periods given by feller 1968 and those derived in this paper the reason is that the definition of feller 1968 does not say anything about the start and finish of the run therefore the two return periods given by feller 1968 cannot calculate the return period of a drought duration our applications show that there is a good agreement between empirical probabilities and theoretical ones results of this study will be useful in drought analysis although the distributions derived in this paper are for hydrological drought they can be applied to other types of drought probability measures however it is necessary to further understand and describe the probability of drought events under climate change this is an ongoing work credit authorship

is expressed by eq a 1 that describes the probability distribution of the number l of bernoulli trials needed to get one success where l has the set 1 2 3 a 1 p l k p k 1 1 p k 1 2 where p is the parameter of the geometric distribution i in literature it represents the probability of a drought event and k is the drought duration of the drought event the other one is the probability

convenience of description eq a 1 and eq a 2 are denoted as the geometric distribution i and the geometric distribution ii respectively two different geometric distributions are recognized let x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of size n if a truncated level x 0 is given one can get two distinct independent events surplus x i x 0 and deficit x i x 0 respectively the probabilities of these events can be denoted as p p x i x 0 and q p x i x 0 1 p a deficit run that consists of k events x i x 0 preceded and succeeded by one or more events x i x 0 will be used to review the characteristics of the

describing drought duration probability geometric distribution i is commonly used for analyzing the statistical properties of drought events examining its pmf given by eqs a 1 and a 10 and the expectation of eqs a 5 and a 13 the shortcomings of geometric distribution i when used to measure the drought duration probability can be enumerated from eq a 10 the same result as p l 0 from eq a 1 can be obtained as a 18 p l 0 1 l 1 p l l 1 l 1 p 00 k 1 1 p 00 0 the reason for p l 0 0 is that eq a 1 and eq a 10 only use its deficit runs as a run sample space to calculate the probability of each deficit run this point is further shown in the following a run sample space is comprised of its surplus runs and deficit runs each trial a surplus run or a deficit run has the corresponding possibility of occurrence with a certain probability l 0 means that a deficit run does not occur and a surplus run possibly occurs the probability of the surplus run occurrence is not equal to 0 for the expectation of a run length eq a 13 has the same result of 1 as that of eq a 5 when p 00 0 p 00 0 indicates that there is no deficit event occurrence for the given process and the expectation of a deficit run should be equal to 0 appendix b new probability distribution and characteristics of a run length b 1 expectation and variance of a run length for independent bernoulli process the

written as b 14 ln i 0 m p l i 1 p 1 p m p i 0 m l i taking the logarithm of eq b 14 one gets b 15 ln l n m ln 1 p i 0 m l i ln p differentiating eq b 15 partially with respect to parameter p and equating its partial derivative to zero result in b 16 p i 0 m l i i 0 m l i m 1 m i 0 m l i 1 1 m i 0 m l i l 1 l it is seen that parameter p estimated by the method of moments is the same as that by the maxi mum likelihood estimation appendix b 3 estimation of return period of a run length k for independent bernoulli process following bayazit 2001 two types of return period of run length of x i x

number of runs of length k can be written as b 18 n k p l k n d n p k 1 p 2 the mean interarrival time return period t l k can be computed as the ratio of the total length of the sample to the expected number of runs of length k b 19 t l k n n k 1 1 p 2 p k the validity of eq b 20 is demonstrated for different simulation sample lengths in this section appendix b 4 expectation and variance

4487,the probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation for long durations during winter and spring seasons is important to develop the probable maximum flood for snowmelt driven regions since extreme floods are often characterized by snow accumulation and snowmelt processes rather than by a single rainstorm event although several studies have estimated the pmp for a single storm duration little attention has been given to the pmp estimation for long durations on the order of several months this study proposes a new framework using a numerical weather model nwm to estimate the long duration maximum precipitation mp during the winter season which is the first part of a two part effort to develop the pmp during the winter and spring seasons as a demonstrative case we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period october to march for the drainage areas of bonneville dam 621 600 km2 and libby dam 23 270 km2 in the columbia river basin dominated by atmospheric rivers ars in the proposed framework the historical ar events are identified based on the integrated water vapor transport thresholds used in the ar category scale the precipitation depths during the identified ar events are then maximized by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric moisture finally the design precipitation sequence is formed by substituting each historical ar event with the corresponding maximized ar event acting as the basis of long duration mp as a result the maximum 6 month winter period accumulated basin average precipitation depths long duration mp for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam are estimated to be 961 0 mm and 1101 7 mm respectively to the authors knowledge this is the first study estimating the mp for long durations on the order of several months and for very large basins above 100 000 km2 by using the nwm based approach keywords probable maximum precipitation pmp regional climate model rcm weather research and forecasting model wrf integrated water vapor transport ivt pacific northwest pnw columbia river basin crb 1 introduction the probable maximum precipitation pmp concept has been widely used as a design basis to estimate the probable maximum flood pmf wmo 2009 the pmp is defined as the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under possible meteorological conditions wmo 2009 since the pmp is a key parameter for estimating pmf the accurate estimation of the pmp is of considerable importance for the design and risk assessment of the potential failure of hydraulic structures traditional approaches to estimate the pmp can be classified mainly into two categories the statistical approach and the storm maximization approach the statistical approach is usually referred to as hershfield s method hershfield 1961 1965 which is based on the general frequency equation proposed by chow 1951 since hershfield s method requires only observed annual maximum daily precipitation data it has been applied in many regions of the world casas et al 2008 desa m et al 2001 rakhecha et al 1992 rezacova et al 2005 sarkar and maity 2020a 2020b sherif et al 2014 tajbakhsh and al ansari 2019 several problematic issues associated with hershfield s method however have been reported for instance koutsoyiannis 1999 argued hershfield s method might not provide the physical upper limit of precipitation but rather rainfall with a given significant return period nobilis et al 1991 argued that hershfield s method is inadequate for observed precipitation series with outliers furthermore hershfield s method may not produce realistic spatial variations of pmp since it yields only point values of pmp where the observed precipitation data are available and thus requires area reduction curves to adjust the point values to areas of various size wmo 2009 in the storm maximization approach the pmp is determined by the transposition and moisture maximization of historical severe rainstorms hansen et al 1994 this approach maximizes the historical storms by multiplying them by the ratio of p w m a x p w where pw is actual precipitable water in the atmosphere and p w m a x is maximum precipitable water estimated by maximum daily dew point temperature of the corresponding month wmo 2009 hence the storm maximization approach lies in the assumption that precipitation depth and pw are linearly related the storm maximization approach has been a widely recognized technique for the pmp estimation especially in north america beauchamp et al 2013 hansen et al 1994 rouhani and leconte 2016 rousseau et al 2014 the limitations of the storm maximization approach however have been discussed in several studies as it is insufficiently grounded in physics several studies showed using numerical weather models that the linear relationship between pw and precipitation depth might not necessarily hold in reality abbs 1999 rastogi et al 2017 zhao et al 1997 chen and bradley 2006 found that the pseudo adiabatic profile assumption which is used to calculate actual pw based on the surface dew point temperature or sea surface temperature could overestimate pw moreover pmp estimation under the hypothesis of stationarity is not valid under changing precipitation patterns led by climate change ben alaya et al 2020 chen et al 2017 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 gao et al 2016 ishida et al 2018a 2018b kunkel et al 2013 furthermore the two traditional methods mentioned above have limitations regarding the spatial extent of the pmp estimation the statistical approach is mainly applicable for watersheds with a drainage area less than 1000 km2 390 sq mi wmo 1986 2009 the storm maximization approach referred to as the storm separation method in hmrs is traditionally limited to areas of 25 900 km2 10 000 sq mi and durations of 72 h or less for generalized pmp estimates hansen et al 1982 1994 however the total drainage area of a dam located at the most downstream of many upstream dam systems such as the drainage area of bonneville dam in the columbia river basin crb can be much larger than 25 900 km2 10 000 sq mi the traditional approaches cannot be applied directly to the pmp estimation for such large drainage areas moreover even though the meteorological hydrological conditions of multiple dams are mutually dependent these traditional approaches need to estimate the pmp for each dam independently due to the areal limitation usace 2019 estimated the 72 hr pmp for many dams in the crb using the traditional storm maximization approach in their study the pmp for each dam s drainage area was estimated considering that each dam is meteorologically and hydrologically independent usace 2019 a numerical weather model nwm based pmp estimation approach has been developed to overcome the aforementioned limitations the nwm based approach estimates the pmp by numerically solving the nonlinear governing equations of the regional atmospheric processes hence the nwm based approach does not depend on the traditional assumptions such as the linear relationship between precipitation depth and pw and does not have a limitation on the spatial extent of the pmp estimation as long as the computational resources allow recently ohara et al 2011 proposed a nwm based pmp estimation approach which modifies the initial and boundary conditions ics bcs at the outer nesting domain of the nwm for maximizing precipitation the approach of ohara et al 2011 consists of a combination of the relative humidity maximization rhm and the geospatial atmospheric bc shifting following the general concepts of the traditional storm maximization approach hereafter the geospatial atmospheric bc shifting will be referred to as shifting in the rhm method the atmospheric moisture in the modeling domain is maximized by setting the relative humidity rh to 100 at ics and bcs of the nwms the shifting method spatially shifts the atmospheric bcs of the nwms so that target storms can be transposed to the specified watersheds in ishida et al 2015a b the severe historical storms over three watersheds in northern california were maximized using the shifting and rhm methods to obtain the pmp for a 72 h duration rastogi et al 2017 estimated the pmp for 6 to 72 h storm durations using the rhm method under changing climate over the southeastern united states toride et al 2019 developed a pmp estimation framework using the relative humidity perturbation rhp method which proportionally increases rh at ics and bcs of the modeling domain instead of setting rh at 100 in order to maintain the original structure of rh yang and smith 2018 toride et al 2019 applied the rhp method only at the model boundaries where vertically integrated water vapor transport ivt values are higher than 250 kg m 1 s 1 rhp ivt method to prevent unrealistic boundary conditions produced by applying the rhp method broadly across the boundary condition to storm free areas of the boundaries the rhp ivt method is detailed in section 3 of this paper although the nwm based approach does not have a theoretical limitation on the spatial extent of the pmp estimation few studies have focused on the pmp estimation for extremely large drainage areas above 100 000 km2 wmo 2009 using the nwm based approach it is of great interest to apply the nwm based approach to estimating the pmp for large drainage areas since it could be essential to evaluate the safety of hydraulic structures whose drainage areas are very large such as that of bonneville dam moreover even though the nwm based approach has been successfully applied to estimate the pmp with a single storm duration mostly hourly to daily scale durations little attention has been given to the pmp estimation for long durations such as seasonal scale durations on the order of several months the pmp estimation for long durations is crucial especially for snowmelt driven regions such as the crb u s weather bureau 1945 in snowmelt driven regions extreme floods are often driven by both snow accumulation and snowmelt processes rather than by a single rainstorm event it has been reported that extreme floods in the crb are strongly dominated by winter snow accumulation and spring melt hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 lee et al 2009 these snow accumulation and snowmelt processes usually last on the order of several months such as from the winter to early spring season therefore the long duration sequence of extreme precipitation or other atmospheric variables such as temperature is necessary for conducting the hydrologic precipitation runoff analysis to estimate pmf in snowmelt driven regions this extreme precipitation sequence is also needed for long duration water resource planning and management the approaches mentioned above cannot be applied directly to the long duration pmp estimation this is because extreme precipitation for long durations especially for large basins is often composed of a sequence of successive short duration storm events from different synoptic systems rather than from a single storm event liu et al 2018 wmo 2009 as a way of estimating the pmp for long durations wmo 2009 suggests the similar process substitution method in this method the storm processes with small rainfalls are temporally substituted with one or more storm processes with similar weather systems and large rainfalls to form a new sequence of ideal extraordinary storms this method however requires sufficient hydrometeorological data as well as theories and experience in mid to long term evolution of the regional weather systems to judge whether it is possible to reasonably link different storms together wmo 2009 hence the similar process substitution method is only applicable to a limited number of watersheds where sufficient observation data are available and highly depends on the subjective judgment of hydrometeorologists based on the above discussion a new framework to estimate the pmp for large basins and long durations during the winter and spring season is required for the extreme flood risk assessment in snowmelt driven regions this study proposes a new framework to estimate the long duration maximum precipitation mp during the winter season for large basins dominated by atmospheric rivers ars using the nwm based approach we call this effort a mp which is defined as a part of pmp due to the fact that in such a long duration flooding regime the ultimate pmp estimation requires the sequence of extreme precipitation during both the winter and spring season this study which is the first part of a two part effort to develop the pmp estimation during the winter and spring season focuses on the winter season mp estimation which addresses the ar induced extreme precipitation and snowpack accumulation during the winter season the second part of the ongoing effort not discussed in this paper will address the mp estimation during the spring season focusing on the spring rain on snow events and snowmelt process that often yields extreme floods in snow dominated regions as a demonstrative case we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period october march for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam in the crb the estimated winter season mp in this paper can be used later to develop the pmp during the winter and spring april june seasons we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period by maximizing all identified ar events belonging to the specified period in a target water year by optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric moisture in this paper the term optimization is used to describe the combination of the ar position and its atmospheric moisture that maximizes the precipitation depth during the target historical ar event as defined in

main tributary drainage areas fig 1 the columbia river cr is the largest river in the pacific northwest and fourth largest river in north america traveling over 2000 km 1 240 miles and draining roughly 673 400 km2 260 000 sq mi cohen et al 2000 u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2016 in the crb there are more than 250 reservoirs and around 150 hydroelectric projects providing 60 70 of the electrical needs in the pacific northwest region in the u s with 31 major federal dams including bonneville dam and libby dam u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2016 the total drainage area above bonneville dam is about 621 600 km2 240 000 sq mi and includes 11 watersheds upper columbia kootenai pend oreille middle columbia spokane yakima lower

2019 in this study we focus on the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam in the crb to estimate the long duration mp the crb experienced significant floods in 1876 1894 1948 and 1996 stanford et al 2005 the flood of june 1894 recorded the greatest flow discharge reaching 33 6 ft 10 m water level at portland flores and griffith 2002 willingham 2014 while the flood stage for the cr as measured near the port of vancouver was 16 0 ft 4 9 m national weather service 2019 the flood of june 1894 is regarded as one of the world s largest floods o connor and costa 2004 which was caused by heavy snowpack accumulated during the winter of 1893 1894 followed by a dry warm spring resulting in massive snowmelt nelson 1949 the second largest flow discharge in the crb was recorded for the flood of may june 1948 reaching 31 0 ft 9 4 m water level at portland mcgregor 2003 extreme rainfall on the snow which was accumulated in the winter and early spring and sharply increased the temperature in may and june produced this hazardous flood with the estimated damage of more than 100 million dollars rantz and riggs 1949 along the pacific northwest region where the crb is located ars play a critical role in transporting massive amounts of water vapor from the eastern pacific ocean contributing to the majority of wintertime extreme precipitation knippertz and wernli 2010 neiman et al 2008 warner et al 2012 ars are defined as long and narrow corridors of strong ivt ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 recent studies showed that the central crb is largely affected by the ar generated precipitation and floods barth et al 2017 rutz et al 2014 ralph and dettinger 2012 showed that ars fed more than 90 of the heaviest 3 day rain events in the u s west coast neiman et al 2011 reported that about 95 of the annual peak daily flow occurred with landfalling ars in western washington in this paper ivt is calculated by the following equation chen 1985 newell et al 1992 neiman et

identified using the threshold of ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 over the pacific northwest region rutz et al 2015 2014 2 2 model and data the advanced research version of weather research and forecasting model wrf version 3 9 1 was used for conducting numerical experiments to estimate the long duration mp in this study wrf is a fully compressible and non hydrostatic model using a terrain following hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate and an arakawa c grid staggering spatial discretization for atmospheric variables skamarock et al 2008 the model configuration consists of two nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions of 36 km and 12 km fig 2 shows the geographic coverage of the domains two way nesting was employed so that information from the inner domain was carried back to the outer domain both model domains have 40 sigma levels from the surface to 50 hpa the outer domain covers the west coast of north america from southern california to middle british columbia while the inner domain covers the whole crb for the initial conditions and boundary conditions in the wrf model this study used the national centers for environmental prediction s ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa twentieth century reanalysis version 2c 20crv2c compo et al 2011 this study also used the cfsr and 20crv2c for calculating ivt used in the ar event identification process detailed in section 3 2 the cfsr is a global reanalysis product generated by a coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation model by assimilating various observations saha et al 2010 the cfsr is available from 1979 to present at 6 hour intervals with 0 5 horizontal resolution and 40 vertical levels 20crv2c is a global reanalysis product generated by assimilating only surface pressures and using monthly sea surface temperature and sea ice distributions as boundary conditions within an ensemble kalman filter compo et al 2011 the 20crv2c is available from 1850 to 2014 at 6 hour intervals with 2 0 spatial resolution and 24 vertical levels in this study the reanalysis product was selected depending on the target water year cfsr for the 2017 water year and 20crv2c for the 1974 water year selection of the target water years is detailed in section 3 1 the physical parameterization schemes used in the model domains include the rapid radiative transfer model for general rrtmg short radiation scheme iacono et al 2008 the rrtmg longwave radiation scheme iacono et al 2008 the stony brook university microphysics scheme lin and colle 2011 the mellor yamada janjic planetary boundary layer scheme janjić 1994 the zhang mcfarlane cumulus convection scheme zhang and mcfarlane 1995 and the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 this parameterization configuration was selected following the conus physics suite which is available in the wrf version 3 9 except for the microphysics and cumulus convection schemes this study investigated the performance and sensitivity of the parameterization schemes for simulating the basin average precipitation and temperature in the crb resulting in the selection of the different microphysics and cumulus convection schemes from the conus physics suite to evaluate the selected parameterization configuration the simulated crb basin average precipitation was compared to the gridded parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 dataset the prism dataset provides the interpolated ground observed precipitation and temperature data over the u s with 4 km spatial resolution the prism dataset has a daily product from 1979 to present and a monthly product from 1895 to present thus the wrf simulation results were compared to the prism daily product for the 2017 water year and to the prism monthly product for the 1974 water year fig s1 shows the comparison of the daily crb average precipitation depth from october 01 2016 to march 31 2017 from fig s1 the daily crb average precipitation simulated with the selected parameterization schemes shows good agreement with the prism dataset r2 0 87 fig s2 shows the comparison of the monthly crb average precipitation depth from october 01 1973 to march 31 1974 in fig s2 although the wrf simulation tends to overestimate the monthly crb average precipitation depth it captures the temporal variation in the precipitation depth quite well r2 0 94 3 proposed framework for the long duration mp estimation during a winter season in this study a new framework is proposed to estimate the long duration mp during the winter season in ar dominant regions as follows step 1 select target water years based on the historical precipitation depth and average temperature over a specified basin step 2 identify historical ar events over a specified basin during the winter season in the target water years based on the ar category scale developed by ralph et al 2019 step 3 maximize the cumulative precipitation depths over the target drainage areas within a specified basin during the identified ar events by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture step 4 substitute each historical ar event with the corresponding maximized ar event to form the sequence of maximized precipitation events design precipitation sequence during the winter season step 5 develop the long duration mp estimation during the winter season over the target drainage areas by accumulating the design precipitation sequence formed in the above step 4 the procedure at each step is detailed below 3 1 selection of target water years in step 1 target water years for the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period october march are selected based on their historical precipitation depth during the winter season over the crb this procedure is based upon the hypothesis that water years with heavy precipitation during the winter season have high potential to produce the long duration mp table 1 which was created using the prism dataset shows the top 15 water years with respect to the accumulated crb average precipitation depths during the winter season for the period of 1928 2020 water years besides the precipitation depths table 1 shows the ranking of the time averaged crb average temperature during the spring season for the period of 1928 2020 water years in this study the 1974 and 2017 water years were selected to demonstrate the mp estimation for the 6 month winter season over the crb the 1974 water year was selected since it shows the greatest crb average precipitation depth during the winter season for the period of 1928 2020 water years table 1 the 2017 water year was selected because it also shows significant crb average precipitation depth during the winter season 4th largest with the highest spring season temperature among the 15 water years shown in table 1 it should be noted that water years with heavy precipitation during the winter season and high temperature during the spring season could be the basis of a pmp scenario during the winter and spring season in the crb where extreme floods are typically caused by the spring snowmelt process lee et al 2009 therefore the 2017 water year was selected considering the high spring season temperature although the mp estimation during the spring season is not covered in this study 3 2 identification of historical atmospheric river events in step 2 the historical ar events during the winter season in the selected water years were identified based on the ivt thresholds used in the recently developed ar category scale ralph et al 2019 this category scale classifies ar events into five categories primarily beneficial category 1 mostly beneficial but also hazardous category 2 balance of beneficial and hazardous category 3 mostly hazardous but also beneficial category 4 and primarily hazardous category 5 using the maximum ivt magnitude and the duration of the ar event at a given point ralph et al 2019 the ar event is defined in ralph et al 2019 by the period during which ivt at a given point location continuously satisfies the threshold ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 in this study the ar event period is defined by the duration that maximum ivt over the crb continuously satisfies the same threshold ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 the maximum ivt magnitude over the crb is also considered to identify the ar events belonging to the categories 2 5 which could be hazardous the following are the ivt thresholds that were applied to identify the ar events belonging to the categories 2 5 in ralph et al 2019 ar event duration 24 h maximum ivt over the crb 750 kg m 1 s 1 ar event duration 24 h and 48 h maximum ivt over the crb 500 kg m 1 s 1 ar event duration 48 h maximum ivt over the crb 250 kg m 1 s 1 the ivt over the region including north america and the pacific ocean was calculated using the reanalysis datasets cfsr for the 2017 water year and20crv2c for the 1974 water year the identified ar events during the winter season in the 2017 and 1974 water years are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively twenty four ar events were identified during the winter season in the 2017 water year and 16 ar events were identified during the winter season in the 1974 water year the ivt contours over the crb during the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year 1200 utc jan 12 1974 1200 utc jan 17 1974 are shown in fig 3 the ar event 12 b showed the greatest maximum ivt over the crb among all the identified events 1042 5 kg m 1 s 1 from the figure one can see how the ar event enters and passes through the crb with time 3 3 maximization of the identified atmospheric river events in step 3 the cumulative basin average precipitation depths during the identified ar events are maximized by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture the shifting and rhp ivt operations were simultaneously conducted for the optimization the rhp ivt method proportionally increases the rh at the modeling boundary where ivt value exceeds 250 kg m 1 s 1 as follows 2 r h m i n β r h 0 97 i f r h 0 97 r h 0 i f r h 0 97 where rh0 is the original relative humidity and β is a multiplication factor to determine the increment of rh in eq 2 the threshold is set to 97 in order to avoid immediate saturation at the modeling domain zhao et al 1997 hereafter the rhp ivt method with β 1 1 is referred to as rhp110 ivt rhp120 ivt with β 1 2 and so on toride et al 2019 the procedure for maximizing the identified ar events using the combination of the shifting and rhp ivt operations is detailed as follows step 3 1 apply the latitudinal shifting up to 5 in north and south directions at 0 5 intervals with rhp110 ivt shift rhp110 ivt to the ar events in this study the atmospheric boundary conditions were shifted with respect to latitude only the shifting with respect to longitude could render unrealistic atmospheric conditions over the crb due to the land sea contrast in the surface layer since the crb is located along the pacific northwest coast the latitudinal range of the shifting is limited to 5 in north and south directions so that the coriolis parameter component of the absolute vorticity of the system would not change by more than 10 percent hansen et al 1994 in this study the rhp110 ivt was first applied in order to investigate the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation increase to the increase in atmospheric moisture at each shifting amount step 3 2 apply the latitudinal shifting with rhp ivt with β ranging from 1 2 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals rhp120 ivt rhp130 ivt rhp140 ivt and rhp150 ivt to the ar events in this step the shifting amount was determined according to the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation increase to rh increase investigated in step 3 1 the increments of β were limited up to 1 5 since a large increase in atmospheric moisture may change storm evolution and structural properties ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 it was also shown that excessive rh increase does not necessarily lead to a rise in precipitation depths ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 in toride et al 2019 the 72 h pmp in the willamette watershed was obtained by the combination of shifting and rhp130 ivt although they investigated the rhp ivt with β up to 1 7 rhp170 ivt step 3 3 apply the latitudinal shifting at 0 1 intervals with the optimal rhp ivt found in step 3 2 to the ar events the latitudinal shifting amount was set up to 0 5 north and south of the north south location at which the ar event cumulative basin average precipitation depth became greatest in step 3 2 in other words this procedure aims to find an actual maximum basin average precipitation depth by a local search with finer intervals around the optimal north south location with the optimal rhp ivt found in step 3 2 in this study first step 3 1 was conducted for all identified ar events over the crb during the winter season in each target water year then step 3 2 and step 3 3 were performed for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively it is noted that each ar event simulation was initialized using the wrf restart files of the control simulation so that each ar event could be maximized based on the historical conditions 3 4 development of long duration mp estimation during the winter season in step 4 each historical ar event was substituted with the corresponding maximized ar event in order to form a sequence of maximized precipitation depths during the winter season in this paper the resulting sequence of maximized precipitation depths during the winter season is called design precipitation sequence this ar event substitution is based on the concept of the similar process substitution method in which historical storms with small rainfalls are substituted with one or more historical storms with large rainfalls wmo 2009 the design precipitation sequence was formed for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively in step 5 the 6 month winter season accumulated basin average precipitation depths were computed using the design precipitation sequence over the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively finally the maximum 6 month winter season accumulated precipitation depths were obtained as the long duration mp during the winter season for bonneville dam and libby dam 4 results 4 1 maximization of the historical atmospheric river events we first examine how each ar event is maximized through simultaneously optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric water vapor since the long duration mp is obtained as a result of maximization of each ar event figs 4 and 5 show the cumulative basin average precipitation depths during each ar event obtained by the control simulation shift rhp110 ivt experiment and the simulation with the optimal combination of the ar position and rh the optimal combinations of the ar position and rh are shown with the ar event names in the figures e g 5 0 s n rhp150 ivt represents the combination of 5 0 south north shifting and rhp150 ivt the figures also show the increasing rates in the basin average precipitation depths from the control simulation s results to the results of the simulations with the optimal combinations as shown in the figures the ar events with relatively high potential to increase the basin average precipitation depths can be identified it is found that the optimal combination for each ar event depends on the geographical characteristics of the target basin as can be seen from figs 4 and 5 15 ar events 62 5 in the 2017 water year and 10 ar events 62 5 in the 1974 water year are maximized by south shifting for bonneville dam s drainage area meanwhile 14 events 58 3 in the 2017 water year and 11 events 68 8 in the 1974 water year are maximized by north shifting for libby dam s drainage area moreover 23 ar events 95 8 in the 2017 water year and 14 ar events 87 5 in the 1974 water year are maximized by rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area yet 10 ar events 41 7 in the 2017 water year and 7 ar events 31 3 in the 1974 water year are maximized without increasing rh or by rhp110 ivt for libby dam s drainage area the relationship between the optimal combination and target basin can be more clearly found when focusing on specific events for instance the event 22 a in the 2017 water year is maximized by 3 9 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area but by 1 9 north shifting and rhp150 ivt for libby dam s drainage area fig 4 fig 5 shows that the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year is maximized by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area yet by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt for libby dam s drainage area to clarify how the optimal combination for each ar event is determined based on the geographical characteristics of the target basin or the event s properties we investigate the atmospheric fields of the maximized ar events by comparing them with the control simulation s results fig 6 shows the time averaged ivt fields and spatial distributions of the accumulated precipitation depths obtained by the control simulation fig 6a and d and the simulation with the optimal combination for the drainage areas of bonneville dam fig 6b and e and libby dam fig 6c and f during the ar event 22 a in the 2017 water year as can be seen from fig 6a this ar event initially hits the region around oregon to washington state and extends to the central crb in the control simulation fig 6d shows that the region with high precipitation depths such as the western crb corresponds to the strong ivt area in the case of the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area 3 9 south shifting and rhp150 ivt fig 6b and e the region with strong ivt is transposed to further south and becomes wider compared to the control simulation s result the region where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 extends to the southern crb as the ar system is transposed to the south fig 6e shows that the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area increases the precipitation depths especially in the southern part of the domain meanwhile this ar event is maximized by 1 9 north shifting and rhp150 ivt for libby dam s drainage area fig 6c and f in this case the intense ivt region is located slightly more north than the control simulation s result corresponding to the modest shifting amount fig 6c fig 6c shows that the optimization increases ivt intensity overall without changing the pattern of the ivt field much the region where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 covers more northern and eastern parts of the crb where libby dam s drainage area is located accordingly it increases the precipitation depths mainly in the northern part of the crb leading to greater precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area fig 6f fig 6 visualizes how the shifting amount and direction are determined to maximize the contribution of the ar event to the basin average precipitation over the target basin in the proposed method since the major part of bonneville dam s drainage area belongs to the southern crb while libby dam s drainage area is located at the north east of the crb the shifting amount and direction are determined based on each event s characteristics similarly fig 7 shows the time averaged ivt fields and the spatial distributions of the accumulated precipitation depths during the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year as can be seen from fig 7a this ar event hits the wide region ranging from northern california to washington state and covers a large portion of the crb in the control simulation the maximum ivt magnitude over the crb during this event period is 1042 5 kg m 1 s 1 table 3 in fig 7d the high precipitation depths are distributed mainly in the coastal area and the eastern crb as the ar event is optimized by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7b the strong ivt region is transposed to the south and the magnitude of ivt is intensified overall in this case almost the entire southern to central crb is covered by the region with ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 fig 7e shows the significant increase in the precipitation depths within the modeling domain especially at the eastern crb as well as at the southern coastal area the ar event optimized for libby dam s drainage area by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt also shows a similar geospatial position transposed to the south fig 7c the ivt intensity overall becomes lower than the ivt intensity of the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area since atmospheric moisture is not increased accordingly it shows lower precipitation depths specifically in the south west of the domain compared to the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7e and f interestingly however the precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area become slightly greater especially at the central part of libby dam s drainage area than the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7f this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 fig 8 shows the changes in the cumulative basin average precipitation depths through shifting and perturbing rh during the event 22 a fig 8a and b and event 12 b fig 8c and d fig 8a shows that the basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area increases as the atmospheric bc is shifted toward the south and peaks when it is shifted 3 9 south the basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area also monotonically increases with atmospheric moisture fig 8a similarly the basin average precipitation depth over libby dam s drainage area peaks when the atmospheric bc is shifted 1 9 north fig 8b importantly fig 8b shows that the ar event maximization by modifying the ar position and rh is a non linear process although the basin average precipitation depth shows a monotonic increasing trend with rh when the atmospheric bc is shifted around 1 5 2 5 north it gradually diverges from this trend as the atmospheric bc is shifted toward the south of the optimal shifting location fig 8b this nonlinearity emphasizes the importance of the simultaneous optimization of the ar position and atmospheric moisture also in the case of the ar event 12 b although the basin average precipitation over libby dam s drainage area increases with rh when the atmospheric bc is shifted 1 5 2 0 south the increment of the precipitation depth gradually decreases and turns to a decreasing trend as the atmospheric bc is shifted farther south this non linear change in the basin average precipitation depth with shifting and rh perturbation shown in fig 8d will be discussed in section 5 1 we also analyzed the change in pw versus the change in precipitation depths due to the precipitation maximization fig s3 and s4 show the relationships between the change in pw and the change in precipitation depths based on the maximization of the identified ar events in the 1974 and 2017 water years table 2 and table 3 for bonneville dam s drainage area and libby dam s drainage area respectively as we can see from fig s3 and s4 the relationship assumed in the traditional storm maximization approach which is the change in pw is consistent with the change in precipitation depth is not present in our simulations although investigating this relationship further is beyond the scope of this paper this finding could support the validity of the nwm based approach which maximizes precipitation by accounting for non linear atmospheric processes 4 2 development of the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period the design basin average precipitation sequence was formed by substituting each historical ar event with its corresponding maximized ar event fig 9 shows the design basin average precipitation sequence over bonneville dam s drainage area for the 6 month winter period similarly fig 10 shows the design basin average precipitation sequence over libby dam s drainage area as can be seen from these figures the maximized ar events result in significant changes in the basin average precipitation depths during the corresponding ar event period these figures show that the maximization process increases the precipitation peaks further such as the strong peaks in the middle of january in the 1974 water year when comparing the results for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 9 with those for libby dam s drainage area fig 10 the magnitude of the basin average precipitation change by the optimization is generally higher in the libby case than the bonneville case the change in basin average precipitation should be greater in a smaller basin than the change in a larger basin for a given amount of precipitation change in a basin due to the smoothing effect of the spatial averaging which increases with basin size since libby dam s drainage area is much smaller than that of bonneville dam fig 1 the basin average precipitation over libby dam s drainage area is considered to be more sensitive to the to the optimization induced precipitation change in a basin fig 11 shows the cumulative curve of the design basin average precipitation together with the control simulation s results the 6 month winter period accumulated basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area increases 172 7 mm 23 3 in the 2017 water year and 95 1 mm 11 0 in the 1974 water year from the control simulation s results over libby dam s drainage area it increases 304 9 mm 38 3 in the 2017 water year and 223 0 mm 25 5 in the 1974 water year from the control simulation s results the amount of increase in the accumulated precipitation depth becomes larger over libby dam s drainage area than bonneville dam s drainage area since the magnitude of the precipitation change is found to be larger over libby dam s drainage area as discussed above figs 9 and 10 from fig 11 the maximum cumulative basin average precipitation depth namely long duration mp for the 6 month winter season is estimated to be 961 0 mm over bonneville dam s drainage area and 1101 7 mm over libby dam s drainage area the sensitivity of the increase in the cumulative basin average precipitation depth to the ar transposition and rh perturbation was also investigated fig 12 shows the 6 month winter period accumulated precipitation depths when the ar events are transposed to the optimal location for each atmospheric moisture condition in fig 12 design represents the 6 month winter period accumulation of the design precipitation sequence as can be seen from fig 12 the latitudinal shifting accounts for the significant part of the increase in the basin average precipitation depth 63 6 of the total increase in the 2017 water year and 63 2 in the 1974 water year over bonneville dam s drainage area 80 5 in the 2017 water year and 82 4 in the 1974 water year over libby dam s drainage area since ars are narrow and long bands of strong ivt ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 the latitudinal transposition of ars to the optimal locations significantly contributes to the increases in the basin average precipitation depths the atmospheric moisture increase plays a relatively larger role in increasing precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area than libby dam s drainage area the relationship between atmospheric moisture and precipitation depth taking into account the differences in geographical characteristics of the target basins will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the 6 month winter period accumulated precipitation depths over the modeling domain in fig 13 design precipitation shows the spatial distribution of the 6 month winter period accumulation of the design precipitation sequence fig 13e and c show the spatial distribution of the mp scenario for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively fig 13 shows that the proposed approach can produce the extreme precipitation scenario not only over target drainage areas but over the whole modeling domain based on the mutual dependency of meteorological hydrological conditions of the dam systems over the domain the maximization of each historical ar event increases the cumulative precipitation depths without significantly changing the precipitation distribution pattern over the crb the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area intensifies the cumulative precipitation depths especially at the southern central crb where it reaches greater than 2000 mm fig 13b and e the optimization for libby dam s drainage area specifically increases the precipitation depths at the northern crb fig 13c and f as a result of optimizing each ar position and rh based on the target basins terrain characteristics the cumulative precipitation depth also shows various spatial distributions depending on the target basin 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 identification and maximization of the historical atmospheric river events this study identified the hazardous ar events by applying the ar category scale ralph et al 2019 to the entire crb all the identified ar events were then maximized by optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture as in toride et al 2019 as can be seen from fig 8 the maximization of each ar event shows that the basin average precipitation depth does not necessarily increase with atmospheric moisture which is consistent with the findings of other recent studies ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 fig s3 and s4 show that the change in pw and the change in precipitation depths due to the precipitation maximization are not necessarily consistent which agrees with the finding of rastogi et al 2017 furthermore the ar events with higher precipitation depths in the control simulation do not always provide greater increases in precipitation by optimization figs 4 and 5 which is also in agreement with the recent studies by ishida et al 2015a b toride et al 2019 our analyses on the ar event maximization show that the precipitation maximization process is grounded in the non linear relationships among ar position and direction atmospheric moisture content and the target basin s geographical characteristics for instance fig 7 shows that the cumulative basin average precipitation depth during the ar event 12 b over libby dam s drainage area is maximized by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt fig 7f nevertheless its corresponding ivt intensity fig 7c overall is lower than the ivt intensity obtained by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt fig 7b we could interpret this result as follows when the atmospheric moisture is significantly increased at the boundary where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 by the rhp150 ivt method as in the ar maximization for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7b and e the atmosphere can saturate more quickly after injecting the moisture into the domain this relatively immediate saturation causes heavy precipitation near the boundary where rh is increased fig 7e shows that heavy precipitation occurs around the south west boundary during the ar event 12 b that enters the modeling domain from the south west meanwhile this ar event losing some amount of water vapor due to heavy precipitation near the boundary cannot cause substantial precipitation to the basin far from the boundary unless it attains additional moisture this immediate saturation process could impact the precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area less since that is located at the north east of the modeling domain which is the opposite direction of the boundary where rh was increased meanwhile the moisture depletion process due to the terrain of the cascade range could be a more important factor for determining the contribution of ars to the precipitation depth over the upper inland basins such as libby dam s drainage area ars impacting the upper basins must have a trajectory that favors the ivt penetrating inland through mountain range gaps or the ar ivt being sufficiently strong and deep rutz et al 2015 therefore not only the distance between the boundary and target basin but also the ar trajectories or cascade range s elevation should be investigated in order to explain the mechanism of the ar induced precipitation maximization process investigation of this matter further is beyond the scope of this paper fig 8d also shows that the precipitation maximization process is grounded in the aforementioned non linear relationships between the nature of the ar and terrain characteristics since the relationship between the precipitation depth and rh gradually becomes reversed when the ar is transposed farther south similarly yang and smith 2018 reported that extreme rainfall does not show a monotonic increase with atmospheric moisture but also depends upon the pre storm conditions and complex terrain although investigation of the relationship between the landfalling ar nature and terrain characteristics of the target basin is outside the scope of this paper these findings highlight the importance of the nwm based approach which can account for the orographic uplifting effect moisture convergence and nonlinearity of the atmosphere as several studies have asserted abbs 1999 chen et al 2017 ohara et al 2011 5 2 development of the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period we substituted each historical ar event with its corresponding maximized ar event to form the design precipitation sequence during the winter season which acts as the basis of the long duration mp this sequencing process is based on the concept of the similar process substitution method wmo 2009 while the similar process substitution method temporally substitutes some historical storms with different historical storms to form a new precipitation sequence the proposed method forms a precipitation sequence by maximizing historical ar events in a target water year without combining different storms in fact fig 11 shows that the cumulative design precipitation depths increase with time while maintaining an increasing trend over the control simulation s results this indicates that the proposed method can maximize long duration cumulative precipitation depths based on the maximization of historical ar events over the target basin rather than creating and introducing new ar events to the basin besides as shown in figs 11 and 12 a water year with higher precipitation depth in the control simulation does not always provide greater increase in a 6 month accumulated precipitation depth by the maximization process although the 1974 water year shows 77 5 mm larger 6 month winter period basin average precipitation depth over libby dam s drainage area than the 2017 water year in the control simulation the 2017 water year reaches greater precipitation depth as a result of the maximization this finding is in agreement with the studies by ishida et al 2015a b toride et al 2019 clarifying that the maximization of the storm event with the largest historical precipitation depth does not necessarily yield the mp for a specified duration it is also in the agreement with toride et al 2019 that the latitudinal shifting accounts for the significant part of the increase in the basin average precipitation depth as shown in fig 12 to the authors knowledge this is the first study that estimates the mp for long durations on the order of several months it should be noted that we define the long duration mp as a maximum cumulative precipitation depth during a certain time period including several intervals between ar events thus it cannot be simply compared with the mp value estimated in previous studies which focused on a continuous single storm period ishida et al 2015a 2015b in the same context it is of considerable importance however to estimate extreme precipitation series for such a long period in order to assess the role of large hydraulic structures in controlling extreme floods over a target basin especially in snowmelt driven regions this study estimated the long duration mp for the very large drainage area of bonneville dam which is located at the most downstream of many upstream dam systems in the basin without treating those dam systems independently as shown in fig 13 in fact the proposed approach can maximize precipitation depths for different drainage areas within the same large basin by maximizing the same historical ar events namely without independently identifying ar events for each drainage area this is because the proposed approach identifies ar events using the thresholds of ivt over the large basin in which target drainage areas are located this is one of the most significant advantages of the proposed method from an engineering perspective 5 3 limitations and future directions there are some limitations to this study first this study estimates the mp for the 6 month winter period based on only two water years 1974 and 2017 since the primary purpose of this study was to propose a framework to estimate the mp for long durations however a more rigorous estimate of the long duration mp for the target basin could be founded on the consideration of more historical water years second the ar event identification method using the ivt thresholds still has room for improvement for instance it might be possible to distinguish different ar systems more rigorously by analyzing the trajectory pathways of the ars in the identification process understanding the trajectory pathways of ars might lead to a more efficient determination of the atmospheric bc shifting amount as well however the simplicity with which the ar events could be identified using only thresholds of ivt over the crb is one of the strengths of the proposed method hence there is room for consideration as to how much detail is necessary to distinguish the ar events for estimating the long duration mp third the proposed approach only modified the ar position and atmospheric moisture to maximize precipitation depths during ar events over the crb assuming that these modifications can yield extreme precipitation as in the previous studies however it might be worth considering the effect of other variables such as temperature on the increase in precipitation there have been some studies revealing the strong relationship between extreme precipitation and other atmospheric variables ishida et al 2018a ishida et al 2018b found a monotonous increase in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation with air temperature over the american river watershed in california ohara et al 2017 examined the optimal wind direction for the extreme storm events to maximize the precipitation over the feather and american river watersheds ben alaya et al 2020 found that using the bivariate extreme value model of pw and precipitation efficiency the pmp on the north american continental scale increases at a rate of approximately 4 per 1 c warming therefore it is crucial to investigate the sensitivity of other variables to the increase in precipitation depth and determine which variables to focus on the modification of atmospheric variables should be sufficiently evaluated not to render the atmospheric system unrealistic future work should expand the proposed framework to other regions where other atmospheric phenomena are dominant in causing severe precipitation for instance to expand the proposed framework to the regions where tropical cyclones or hurricanes are dominant it would be necessary to modify the event identification method and rh perturbation method other recent studies mure ravaud et al 2019b 2019a which investigated the extreme precipitation induced by tropical cyclones or hurricanes using the nwm approach could be a good basis for expanding the proposed framework moreover it would be of great interest to estimate the long duration mp under changing climate since the proposed framework identifies ar events based on ivt values calculated by the historical reanalysis datasets the long duration mp estimation under future climate scenarios can be developed using the downscaled global circulation model future climate projections ishida et al 2018a 2018b rastogi et al 2017 it also should be noted that the primary purpose of this effort the mp estimation during the winter season is toward development of a pmp scenario during the winter and spring season which will be used to calculate a pmf for the target drainage areas wmo 2009 the mp estimation during the spring season will be addressed in the second part of an ongoing two part effort to develop the pmp estimation during the winter and spring seasons hence pmf estimation based on the proposed framework is one significant remaining issue the proposed nwm based approach produces not only the precipitation sequence but also other meteorological variables sequences such as temperature solar radiation or wind vector maintaining the physical relationships with precipitation fields thus a rigorous pmf estimation during the winter and spring seasons could be developed by the hydrological analysis using the meteorological variables obtained by the proposed approach as input data gangrade et al 2018 successfully estimated the pmf over the alabama coosa tallapoosa river basin by conducting hydrological simulation under the 72 hr pmp scenario which was estimated using the rhm method although their analysis did not include snowmelt further studies regarding the methodologies for the long duration mp estimation such as on methods for improving the event identification or sequencing method may also be desirable credit authorship contribution statement yusuke hiraga conceptualization methodology

4487,the probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation for long durations during winter and spring seasons is important to develop the probable maximum flood for snowmelt driven regions since extreme floods are often characterized by snow accumulation and snowmelt processes rather than by a single rainstorm event although several studies have estimated the pmp for a single storm duration little attention has been given to the pmp estimation for long durations on the order of several months this study proposes a new framework using a numerical weather model nwm to estimate the long duration maximum precipitation mp during the winter season which is the first part of a two part effort to develop the pmp during the winter and spring seasons as a demonstrative case we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period october to march for the drainage areas of bonneville dam 621 600 km2 and libby dam 23 270 km2 in the columbia river basin dominated by atmospheric rivers ars in the proposed framework the historical ar events are identified based on the integrated water vapor transport thresholds used in the ar category scale the precipitation depths during the identified ar events are then maximized by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric moisture finally the design precipitation sequence is formed by substituting each historical ar event with the corresponding maximized ar event acting as the basis of long duration mp as a result the maximum 6 month winter period accumulated basin average precipitation depths long duration mp for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam are estimated to be 961 0 mm and 1101 7 mm respectively to the authors knowledge this is the first study estimating the mp for long durations on the order of several months and for very large basins above 100 000 km2 by using the nwm based approach keywords probable maximum precipitation pmp regional climate model rcm weather research and forecasting model wrf integrated water vapor transport ivt pacific northwest pnw columbia river basin crb 1 introduction the probable maximum precipitation pmp concept has been widely used as a design basis to estimate the probable maximum flood pmf wmo 2009 the pmp is defined as the theoretical maximum precipitation for a given duration under possible meteorological conditions wmo 2009 since the pmp is a key parameter for estimating pmf the accurate estimation of the pmp is of considerable importance for the design and risk assessment of the potential failure of hydraulic structures traditional approaches to estimate the pmp can be classified mainly into two categories the statistical approach and the storm maximization approach the statistical approach is usually referred to as hershfield s method hershfield 1961 1965 which is based on the general frequency equation proposed by chow 1951 since hershfield s method requires only observed annual maximum daily precipitation data it has been applied in many regions of the world casas et al 2008 desa m et al 2001 rakhecha et al 1992 rezacova et al 2005 sarkar and maity 2020a 2020b sherif et al 2014 tajbakhsh and al ansari 2019 several problematic issues associated with hershfield s method however have been reported for instance koutsoyiannis 1999 argued hershfield s method might not provide the physical upper limit of precipitation but rather rainfall with a given significant return period nobilis et al 1991 argued that hershfield s method is inadequate for observed precipitation series with outliers furthermore hershfield s method may not produce realistic spatial variations of pmp since it yields only point values of pmp where the observed precipitation data are available and thus requires area reduction curves to adjust the point values to areas of various size wmo 2009 in the storm maximization approach the pmp is determined by the transposition and moisture maximization of historical severe rainstorms hansen et al 1994 this approach maximizes the historical storms by multiplying them by the ratio of p w m a x p w where pw is actual precipitable water in the atmosphere and p w m a x is maximum precipitable water estimated by maximum daily dew point temperature of the corresponding month wmo 2009 hence the storm maximization approach lies in the assumption that precipitation depth and pw are linearly related the storm maximization approach has been a widely recognized technique for the pmp estimation especially in north america beauchamp et al 2013 hansen et al 1994 rouhani and leconte 2016 rousseau et al 2014 the limitations of the storm maximization approach however have been discussed in several studies as it is insufficiently grounded in physics several studies showed using numerical weather models that the linear relationship between pw and precipitation depth might not necessarily hold in reality abbs 1999 rastogi et al 2017 zhao et al 1997 chen and bradley 2006 found that the pseudo adiabatic profile assumption which is used to calculate actual pw based on the surface dew point temperature or sea surface temperature could overestimate pw moreover pmp estimation under the hypothesis of stationarity is not valid under changing precipitation patterns led by climate change ben alaya et al 2020 chen et al 2017 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 gao et al 2016 ishida et al 2018a 2018b kunkel et al 2013 furthermore the two traditional methods mentioned above have limitations regarding the spatial extent of the pmp estimation the statistical approach is mainly applicable for watersheds with a drainage area less than 1000 km2 390 sq mi wmo 1986 2009 the storm maximization approach referred to as the storm separation method in hmrs is traditionally limited to areas of 25 900 km2 10 000 sq mi and durations of 72 h or less for generalized pmp estimates hansen et al 1982 1994 however the total drainage area of a dam located at the most downstream of many upstream dam systems such as the drainage area of bonneville dam in the columbia river basin crb can be much larger than 25 900 km2 10 000 sq mi the traditional approaches cannot be applied directly to the pmp estimation for such large drainage areas moreover even though the meteorological hydrological conditions of multiple dams are mutually dependent these traditional approaches need to estimate the pmp for each dam independently due to the areal limitation usace 2019 estimated the 72 hr pmp for many dams in the crb using the traditional storm maximization approach in their study the pmp for each dam s drainage area was estimated considering that each dam is meteorologically and hydrologically independent usace 2019 a numerical weather model nwm based pmp estimation approach has been developed to overcome the aforementioned limitations the nwm based approach estimates the pmp by numerically solving the nonlinear governing equations of the regional atmospheric processes hence the nwm based approach does not depend on the traditional assumptions such as the linear relationship between precipitation depth and pw and does not have a limitation on the spatial extent of the pmp estimation as long as the computational resources allow recently ohara et al 2011 proposed a nwm based pmp estimation approach which modifies the initial and boundary conditions ics bcs at the outer nesting domain of the nwm for maximizing precipitation the approach of ohara et al 2011 consists of a combination of the relative humidity maximization rhm and the geospatial atmospheric bc shifting following the general concepts of the traditional storm maximization approach hereafter the geospatial atmospheric bc shifting will be referred to as shifting in the rhm method the atmospheric moisture in the modeling domain is maximized by setting the relative humidity rh to 100 at ics and bcs of the nwms the shifting method spatially shifts the atmospheric bcs of the nwms so that target storms can be transposed to the specified watersheds in ishida et al 2015a b the severe historical storms over three watersheds in northern california were maximized using the shifting and rhm methods to obtain the pmp for a 72 h duration rastogi et al 2017 estimated the pmp for 6 to 72 h storm durations using the rhm method under changing climate over the southeastern united states toride et al 2019 developed a pmp estimation framework using the relative humidity perturbation rhp method which proportionally increases rh at ics and bcs of the modeling domain instead of setting rh at 100 in order to maintain the original structure of rh yang and smith 2018 toride et al 2019 applied the rhp method only at the model boundaries where vertically integrated water vapor transport ivt values are higher than 250 kg m 1 s 1 rhp ivt method to prevent unrealistic boundary conditions produced by applying the rhp method broadly across the boundary condition to storm free areas of the boundaries the rhp ivt method is detailed in section 3 of this paper although the nwm based approach does not have a theoretical limitation on the spatial extent of the pmp estimation few studies have focused on the pmp estimation for extremely large drainage areas above 100 000 km2 wmo 2009 using the nwm based approach it is of great interest to apply the nwm based approach to estimating the pmp for large drainage areas since it could be essential to evaluate the safety of hydraulic structures whose drainage areas are very large such as that of bonneville dam moreover even though the nwm based approach has been successfully applied to estimate the pmp with a single storm duration mostly hourly to daily scale durations little attention has been given to the pmp estimation for long durations such as seasonal scale durations on the order of several months the pmp estimation for long durations is crucial especially for snowmelt driven regions such as the crb u s weather bureau 1945 in snowmelt driven regions extreme floods are often driven by both snow accumulation and snowmelt processes rather than by a single rainstorm event it has been reported that extreme floods in the crb are strongly dominated by winter snow accumulation and spring melt hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 lee et al 2009 these snow accumulation and snowmelt processes usually last on the order of several months such as from the winter to early spring season therefore the long duration sequence of extreme precipitation or other atmospheric variables such as temperature is necessary for conducting the hydrologic precipitation runoff analysis to estimate pmf in snowmelt driven regions this extreme precipitation sequence is also needed for long duration water resource planning and management the approaches mentioned above cannot be applied directly to the long duration pmp estimation this is because extreme precipitation for long durations especially for large basins is often composed of a sequence of successive short duration storm events from different synoptic systems rather than from a single storm event liu et al 2018 wmo 2009 as a way of estimating the pmp for long durations wmo 2009 suggests the similar process substitution method in this method the storm processes with small rainfalls are temporally substituted with one or more storm processes with similar weather systems and large rainfalls to form a new sequence of ideal extraordinary storms this method however requires sufficient hydrometeorological data as well as theories and experience in mid to long term evolution of the regional weather systems to judge whether it is possible to reasonably link different storms together wmo 2009 hence the similar process substitution method is only applicable to a limited number of watersheds where sufficient observation data are available and highly depends on the subjective judgment of hydrometeorologists based on the above discussion a new framework to estimate the pmp for large basins and long durations during the winter and spring season is required for the extreme flood risk assessment in snowmelt driven regions this study proposes a new framework to estimate the long duration maximum precipitation mp during the winter season for large basins dominated by atmospheric rivers ars using the nwm based approach we call this effort a mp which is defined as a part of pmp due to the fact that in such a long duration flooding regime the ultimate pmp estimation requires the sequence of extreme precipitation during both the winter and spring season this study which is the first part of a two part effort to develop the pmp estimation during the winter and spring season focuses on the winter season mp estimation which addresses the ar induced extreme precipitation and snowpack accumulation during the winter season the second part of the ongoing effort not discussed in this paper will address the mp estimation during the spring season focusing on the spring rain on snow events and snowmelt process that often yields extreme floods in snow dominated regions as a demonstrative case we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period october march for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam in the crb the estimated winter season mp in this paper can be used later to develop the pmp during the winter and spring april june seasons we estimate the mp for the 6 month winter period by maximizing all identified ar events belonging to the specified period in a target water year by optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric moisture in this paper the term optimization is used to describe the combination of the ar position and its atmospheric moisture that maximizes the precipitation depth during the target historical ar event as defined in toride et al 2019 additionally in this paper maximizing ar event means maximizing the cumulative basin average precipitation depth over the target basin during the target ar event period section 2 of this paper reviews the study area numerical weather model and data section 3 describes the framework for the long duration mp estimation section 4 provides the simulation results section 5 summarizes and discusses these results 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the crb is located in the pacific northwest extending over seven u s states and southern british columbia canada which consists of 13

2019 in this study we focus on the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam in the crb to estimate the long duration mp the crb experienced significant floods in 1876 1894 1948 and 1996 stanford et al 2005 the flood of june 1894 recorded the greatest flow discharge reaching 33 6 ft 10 m water level at portland flores and griffith 2002 willingham 2014 while the flood stage for the cr as measured near the port of vancouver was 16 0 ft 4 9 m national weather service 2019 the flood of june 1894 is regarded as one of the world s largest floods o connor and costa 2004 which was caused by heavy snowpack accumulated during the winter of 1893 1894 followed by a dry warm spring resulting in massive snowmelt nelson 1949 the second largest flow discharge in the crb was recorded for the flood of may june 1948 reaching 31 0 ft 9 4 m water level at portland mcgregor 2003 extreme rainfall on the snow which was accumulated in the winter and early spring and sharply increased the temperature in may and june produced this hazardous flood with the estimated damage of more than 100 million dollars rantz and riggs 1949 along the pacific northwest region where the crb is located ars play a critical role in transporting massive amounts of water vapor from the eastern pacific ocean contributing to the majority of wintertime extreme precipitation knippertz and wernli 2010 neiman et al 2008 warner et al 2012 ars are defined as long and narrow corridors of strong ivt ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 recent studies showed that the central crb is largely affected by the ar generated precipitation and floods barth et al 2017 rutz et al 2014 ralph and dettinger 2012 showed that ars fed more than 90 of the heaviest 3 day rain events in the u s west coast neiman et al 2011 reported that about 95 of the annual peak daily flow occurred with landfalling ars in western washington in this paper ivt is calculated by the following equation chen 1985 newell et al 1992 neiman et

wrf version 3 9 1 was used for conducting numerical experiments to estimate the long duration mp in this study wrf is a fully compressible and non hydrostatic model using a terrain following hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate and an arakawa c grid staggering spatial discretization for atmospheric variables skamarock et al 2008 the model configuration consists of two nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions of 36 km and 12 km fig 2 shows the geographic coverage of the domains two way nesting was employed so that information from the inner domain was carried back to the outer domain both model domains have 40 sigma levels from the surface to 50 hpa the outer domain covers the west coast of north america from southern california to middle british columbia while the inner domain covers the whole crb for the initial conditions and boundary conditions in the wrf model this study used the national centers for environmental prediction s ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa twentieth century reanalysis version 2c 20crv2c compo et al 2011 this study also used the cfsr and 20crv2c for calculating ivt used in the ar event identification process detailed in section 3 2 the cfsr is a global reanalysis product generated by a coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation model by assimilating various observations saha et al 2010 the cfsr is available from 1979 to present at 6 hour intervals with 0 5 horizontal resolution and 40 vertical levels 20crv2c is a global reanalysis

the 20crv2c is available from 1850 to 2014 at 6 hour intervals with 2 0 spatial resolution and 24 vertical levels in this study the reanalysis product was selected depending on the target water year cfsr for the 2017 water year and 20crv2c for the 1974 water year selection of the target water years is detailed in section 3 1 the physical parameterization schemes used in the model domains include the rapid radiative transfer model for general rrtmg short radiation scheme iacono et al 2008 the rrtmg longwave radiation scheme iacono et al 2008 the stony brook university microphysics scheme lin and colle 2011 the mellor yamada janjic planetary boundary layer scheme janjić 1994 the zhang mcfarlane cumulus convection scheme zhang and mcfarlane 1995 and the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 this parameterization configuration was selected following the conus physics suite which is available in the wrf version 3 9 except for the microphysics and cumulus convection schemes this study investigated the performance and sensitivity of the parameterization schemes for simulating the basin average precipitation and temperature in the crb resulting in the selection of the different microphysics and cumulus convection schemes from the conus physics suite to evaluate the selected parameterization configuration the simulated crb basin average precipitation was compared to the gridded parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 dataset the prism dataset provides the interpolated ground observed precipitation and temperature data over the u s with 4 km spatial resolution the prism dataset has a daily product from 1979 to present and a monthly product from 1895 to present thus the wrf simulation results were compared to the prism daily product for the 2017 water year and to the prism monthly product for the 1974 water year fig s1 shows the comparison of the daily crb average precipitation depth from october 01 2016 to march 31 2017 from fig s1 the daily crb average precipitation simulated with the selected parameterization schemes shows good agreement with the prism dataset r2 0 87 fig s2 shows the comparison of the monthly crb average precipitation depth from october 01 1973 to march 31 1974 in fig s2 although the wrf simulation tends to overestimate the monthly crb average precipitation depth it captures the temporal variation in the precipitation depth quite well r2 0 94 3 proposed framework for the long duration mp estimation during a winter season in this study a new framework is proposed to estimate the long duration mp during the winter season in ar dominant regions as follows step 1 select target water years based on the historical precipitation depth and average temperature over a specified basin step 2 identify historical ar events over a specified basin during the winter season in the target water years based on the ar category scale developed by ralph et al 2019 step 3 maximize the cumulative precipitation depths over the target drainage areas within a specified basin during the identified ar events by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture step 4 substitute each historical ar event with the corresponding maximized ar event to form the sequence of maximized precipitation events design precipitation sequence during the winter season step 5 develop the long duration mp estimation during the winter season over the target drainage areas by accumulating the design precipitation sequence formed in the above step 4 the procedure at each step is detailed below 3 1 selection of target water years in step 1 target water years for the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period october march are selected based on their historical precipitation depth during the winter season over the crb this procedure is based upon the hypothesis that water years with heavy precipitation during the winter season have high potential to produce the long duration mp table 1 which was created using the prism dataset shows the top 15 water years with respect to the accumulated crb average precipitation depths during the winter season for the period of 1928 2020 water years besides the precipitation depths table 1 shows the ranking of the time averaged crb average temperature during the spring season for the period of 1928 2020 water years in this study the 1974 and 2017 water years were selected to demonstrate the mp estimation for the 6 month winter season over the crb the 1974 water year was selected since it shows the greatest crb average precipitation depth during the winter season for the period of 1928 2020 water years table 1 the 2017 water year was selected because it also shows significant crb average precipitation depth during the winter season 4th largest with the highest spring season temperature among the 15 water years shown in table 1 it should be noted that water years with heavy precipitation during the winter season and high temperature during the spring season could be the basis of a pmp scenario during the winter and spring season in the crb where extreme floods are typically caused by the spring snowmelt process lee et al 2009 therefore the 2017 water year was selected considering the high spring season temperature although the mp estimation during the spring season is not covered in this study 3 2 identification of historical atmospheric river events in step 2 the historical ar events during the winter season in the selected water years were identified based on the ivt thresholds used in the recently developed ar category scale ralph et al 2019 this category scale classifies ar events into five categories primarily beneficial category 1 mostly beneficial but also hazardous category 2 balance of beneficial and hazardous category 3 mostly hazardous but also beneficial category 4 and primarily hazardous category 5 using the maximum ivt magnitude and the duration of the ar event at a given point ralph et al 2019 the ar event is defined in ralph et al 2019 by the period during which ivt at a given point location continuously satisfies the threshold ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 in this study the ar event period is defined by the duration that maximum ivt over the crb continuously satisfies the same threshold ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 the maximum ivt magnitude over the crb is also considered to identify the ar events belonging to the categories 2 5 which could be hazardous the following are the ivt thresholds that were applied to identify the ar events belonging to the categories 2 5 in ralph et al 2019 ar event duration 24 h maximum ivt over the crb 750 kg m 1 s 1 ar event duration 24 h and 48 h maximum ivt over the crb 500 kg m 1 s 1 ar event duration 48 h maximum ivt over the crb 250 kg m 1 s 1 the ivt over the region including north america and the pacific ocean was calculated using the reanalysis datasets cfsr for the 2017 water year and20crv2c for the 1974 water year the identified ar events during the winter season in the 2017 and 1974 water years are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively twenty four ar events were identified during the winter season in the 2017 water year and 16 ar events were identified during the winter season in the 1974 water year the ivt contours over the crb during the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year 1200 utc jan 12 1974 1200 utc jan 17 1974 are shown in fig 3 the ar event 12 b showed the greatest maximum ivt over the crb among all the identified events 1042 5 kg m 1 s 1 from the figure one can see how the ar event enters and passes through the crb with time 3 3 maximization of the identified atmospheric river events in step 3 the cumulative basin average precipitation depths during the identified ar events are maximized by simultaneously optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture the shifting and rhp ivt operations were simultaneously conducted for the optimization the rhp ivt method proportionally increases the rh at the modeling boundary where ivt value exceeds 250 kg m 1 s 1 as follows 2 r h m i n β r h 0 97 i f r h 0 97 r h 0 i f r h 0 97 where rh0 is the original relative humidity and β is a multiplication factor to determine the increment of rh in eq 2 the threshold is set to 97 in order to avoid immediate saturation at the modeling domain zhao et al 1997 hereafter the rhp ivt method with β 1 1 is referred to as rhp110 ivt rhp120 ivt with β 1 2 and so on toride et al 2019 the procedure for maximizing the identified ar events using the combination of the shifting and rhp ivt operations is detailed as follows step 3 1 apply the latitudinal shifting up to 5 in north and south directions at 0 5 intervals with rhp110 ivt shift rhp110 ivt to the ar events in this study the atmospheric boundary conditions were shifted with respect to latitude only the shifting with respect to longitude could render unrealistic atmospheric conditions over the crb due to the land sea contrast in the surface layer since the crb is located along the pacific northwest coast the latitudinal range of the shifting is limited to 5 in north and south directions so that the coriolis parameter component of the absolute vorticity of the system would not change by more than 10 percent hansen et al 1994 in this study the rhp110 ivt was first applied in order to investigate the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation increase to the increase in atmospheric moisture at each shifting amount step 3 2 apply the latitudinal shifting with rhp ivt with β ranging from 1 2 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals rhp120 ivt rhp130 ivt rhp140 ivt and rhp150 ivt to the ar events in this step the shifting amount was determined according to the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation increase to rh increase investigated in step 3 1 the increments of β were limited up to 1 5 since a large increase in atmospheric moisture may change storm evolution and structural properties ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 it was also shown that excessive rh increase does not necessarily lead to a rise in precipitation depths ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 in toride et al 2019 the 72 h pmp in the willamette watershed was obtained by the combination of shifting and rhp130 ivt although they investigated the rhp ivt with β up to 1 7 rhp170 ivt step 3 3 apply the latitudinal shifting at 0 1 intervals with the optimal rhp ivt found in step 3 2 to the ar events the latitudinal shifting amount was set up to 0 5 north and south of the north south location at which the ar event cumulative basin average precipitation depth became greatest in step 3 2 in other words this procedure aims to find an actual maximum basin average precipitation depth by a local search with finer intervals around the optimal north south location with the optimal rhp ivt found in step 3 2 in this study first step 3 1 was conducted for all identified ar events over the crb during the winter season in each target water year then step 3 2 and step 3 3 were performed for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively it is noted that each ar event simulation was initialized using the wrf restart files of the control simulation so that each ar event could be maximized based on the historical conditions 3 4 development of long duration mp estimation during the winter season in step 4 each historical ar event was substituted with the corresponding maximized ar event in order to form a sequence of maximized precipitation depths during the winter season in this paper the resulting sequence of maximized precipitation depths during the winter season is called design precipitation sequence this ar event substitution is based on the concept of the similar process substitution method in which historical storms with small rainfalls are substituted with one or more historical storms with large rainfalls wmo 2009 the design precipitation sequence was formed for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively in step 5 the 6 month winter season accumulated basin average precipitation depths were computed using the design precipitation sequence over the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively finally the maximum 6 month winter season accumulated precipitation depths were obtained as the long duration mp during the winter season for bonneville dam and libby dam 4 results 4 1 maximization of the historical atmospheric river events we first examine how each ar event is maximized through simultaneously optimizing the ar position and its atmospheric water vapor since the long duration mp is obtained as a result of maximization of each ar event figs 4 and 5 show the cumulative basin average precipitation depths during each ar event obtained by the control simulation shift rhp110 ivt experiment and the simulation with the optimal combination of the ar position and rh the optimal combinations of the ar position and rh are shown with the ar event names in the figures e g 5 0 s n rhp150 ivt represents the combination of 5 0 south north shifting and rhp150 ivt the figures also show the increasing rates in the basin average precipitation depths from the control simulation s results to the results of the simulations with the optimal combinations as shown in the figures the ar events with relatively high potential to increase the basin average precipitation depths can be identified it is found that the optimal combination for each ar event depends on the geographical characteristics of the target basin as can be seen from figs 4 and 5 15 ar events 62 5 in the 2017 water year and 10 ar events 62 5 in the 1974 water year are maximized by south shifting for bonneville dam s drainage area meanwhile 14 events 58 3 in the 2017 water year and 11 events 68 8 in the 1974 water year are maximized by north shifting for libby dam s drainage area moreover 23 ar events 95 8 in the 2017 water year and 14 ar events 87 5 in the 1974 water year are maximized by rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area yet 10 ar events 41 7 in the 2017 water year and 7 ar events 31 3 in the 1974 water year are maximized without increasing rh or by rhp110 ivt for libby dam s drainage area the relationship between the optimal combination and target basin can be more clearly found when focusing on specific events for instance the event 22 a in the 2017 water year is maximized by 3 9 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area but by 1 9 north shifting and rhp150 ivt for libby dam s drainage area fig 4 fig 5 shows that the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year is maximized by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area yet by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt for libby dam s drainage area to clarify how the optimal combination for each ar event is determined based on the geographical characteristics of the target basin or the event s properties we investigate the atmospheric fields of the maximized ar events by comparing them with the control simulation s results fig 6 shows the time averaged ivt fields and spatial distributions of the accumulated precipitation depths obtained by the control simulation fig 6a and d and the simulation with the optimal combination for the drainage areas of bonneville dam fig 6b and e and libby dam fig 6c and f during the ar event 22 a in the 2017 water year as can be seen from fig 6a this ar event initially hits the region around oregon to washington state and extends to the central crb in the control simulation fig 6d shows that the region with high precipitation depths such as the western crb corresponds to the strong ivt area in the case of the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area 3 9 south shifting and rhp150 ivt fig 6b and e the region with strong ivt is transposed to further south and becomes wider compared to the control simulation s result the region where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 extends to the southern crb as the ar system is transposed to the south fig 6e shows that the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area increases the precipitation depths especially in the southern part of the domain meanwhile this ar event is maximized by 1 9 north shifting and rhp150 ivt for libby dam s drainage area fig 6c and f in this case the intense ivt region is located slightly more north than the control simulation s result corresponding to the modest shifting amount fig 6c fig 6c shows that the optimization increases ivt intensity overall without changing the pattern of the ivt field much the region where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 covers more northern and eastern parts of the crb where libby dam s drainage area is located accordingly it increases the precipitation depths mainly in the northern part of the crb leading to greater precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area fig 6f fig 6 visualizes how the shifting amount and direction are determined to maximize the contribution of the ar event to the basin average precipitation over the target basin in the proposed method since the major part of bonneville dam s drainage area belongs to the southern crb while libby dam s drainage area is located at the north east of the crb the shifting amount and direction are determined based on each event s characteristics similarly fig 7 shows the time averaged ivt fields and the spatial distributions of the accumulated precipitation depths during the ar event 12 b in the 1974 water year as can be seen from fig 7a this ar event hits the wide region ranging from northern california to washington state and covers a large portion of the crb in the control simulation the maximum ivt magnitude over the crb during this event period is 1042 5 kg m 1 s 1 table 3 in fig 7d the high precipitation depths are distributed mainly in the coastal area and the eastern crb as the ar event is optimized by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7b the strong ivt region is transposed to the south and the magnitude of ivt is intensified overall in this case almost the entire southern to central crb is covered by the region with ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 fig 7e shows the significant increase in the precipitation depths within the modeling domain especially at the eastern crb as well as at the southern coastal area the ar event optimized for libby dam s drainage area by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt also shows a similar geospatial position transposed to the south fig 7c the ivt intensity overall becomes lower than the ivt intensity of the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area since atmospheric moisture is not increased accordingly it shows lower precipitation depths specifically in the south west of the domain compared to the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7e and f interestingly however the precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area become slightly greater especially at the central part of libby dam s drainage area than the optimized case for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7f this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 fig 8 shows the changes in the cumulative basin average precipitation depths through shifting and perturbing rh during the event 22 a fig 8a and b and event 12 b fig 8c and d fig 8a shows that the basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area increases as the atmospheric bc is shifted toward the south and peaks when it is shifted 3 9 south the basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area also monotonically increases with atmospheric moisture fig 8a similarly the basin average precipitation depth over libby dam s drainage area peaks when the atmospheric bc is shifted 1 9 north fig 8b importantly fig 8b shows that the ar event maximization by modifying the ar position and rh is a non linear process although the basin average precipitation depth shows a monotonic increasing trend with rh when the atmospheric bc is shifted around 1 5 2 5 north it gradually diverges from this trend as the atmospheric bc is shifted toward the south of the optimal shifting location fig 8b this nonlinearity emphasizes the importance of the simultaneous optimization of the ar position and atmospheric moisture also in the case of the ar event 12 b although the basin average precipitation over libby dam s drainage area increases with rh when the atmospheric bc is shifted 1 5 2 0 south the increment of the precipitation depth gradually decreases and turns to a decreasing trend as the atmospheric bc is shifted farther south this non linear change in the basin average precipitation depth with shifting and rh perturbation shown in fig 8d will be discussed in section 5 1 we also analyzed the change in pw versus the change in precipitation depths due to the precipitation maximization fig s3 and s4 show the relationships between the change in pw and the change in precipitation depths based on the maximization of the identified ar events in the 1974 and 2017 water years table 2 and table 3 for bonneville dam s drainage area and libby dam s drainage area respectively as we can see from fig s3 and s4 the relationship assumed in the traditional storm maximization approach which is the change in pw is consistent with the change in precipitation depth is not present in our simulations although investigating this relationship further is beyond the scope of this paper this finding could support the validity of the nwm based approach which maximizes precipitation by accounting for non linear atmospheric processes 4 2 development of the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period the design basin average precipitation sequence was formed by substituting each historical ar event with its corresponding maximized ar event fig 9 shows the design basin average precipitation sequence over bonneville dam s drainage area for the 6 month winter period similarly fig 10 shows the design basin average precipitation sequence over libby dam s drainage area as can be seen from these figures the maximized ar events result in significant changes in the basin average precipitation depths during the corresponding ar event period these figures show that the maximization process increases the precipitation peaks further such as the strong peaks in the middle of january in the 1974 water year when comparing the results for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 9 with those for libby dam s drainage area fig 10 the magnitude of the basin average precipitation change by the optimization is generally higher in the libby case than the bonneville case the change in basin average precipitation should be greater in a smaller basin than the change in a larger basin for a given amount of precipitation change in a basin due to the smoothing effect of the spatial averaging which increases with basin size since libby dam s drainage area is much smaller than that of bonneville dam fig 1 the basin average precipitation over libby dam s drainage area is considered to be more sensitive to the to the optimization induced precipitation change in a basin fig 11 shows the cumulative curve of the design basin average precipitation together with the control simulation s results the 6 month winter period accumulated basin average precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area increases 172 7 mm 23 3 in the 2017 water year and 95 1 mm 11 0 in the 1974 water year from the control simulation s results over libby dam s drainage area it increases 304 9 mm 38 3 in the 2017 water year and 223 0 mm 25 5 in the 1974 water year from the control simulation s results the amount of increase in the accumulated precipitation depth becomes larger over libby dam s drainage area than bonneville dam s drainage area since the magnitude of the precipitation change is found to be larger over libby dam s drainage area as discussed above figs 9 and 10 from fig 11 the maximum cumulative basin average precipitation depth namely long duration mp for the 6 month winter season is estimated to be 961 0 mm over bonneville dam s drainage area and 1101 7 mm over libby dam s drainage area the sensitivity of the increase in the cumulative basin average precipitation depth to the ar transposition and rh perturbation was also investigated fig 12 shows the 6 month winter period accumulated precipitation depths when the ar events are transposed to the optimal location for each atmospheric moisture condition in fig 12 design represents the 6 month winter period accumulation of the design precipitation sequence as can be seen from fig 12 the latitudinal shifting accounts for the significant part of the increase in the basin average precipitation depth 63 6 of the total increase in the 2017 water year and 63 2 in the 1974 water year over bonneville dam s drainage area 80 5 in the 2017 water year and 82 4 in the 1974 water year over libby dam s drainage area since ars are narrow and long bands of strong ivt ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 the latitudinal transposition of ars to the optimal locations significantly contributes to the increases in the basin average precipitation depths the atmospheric moisture increase plays a relatively larger role in increasing precipitation depth over bonneville dam s drainage area than libby dam s drainage area the relationship between atmospheric moisture and precipitation depth taking into account the differences in geographical characteristics of the target basins will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the 6 month winter period accumulated precipitation depths over the modeling domain in fig 13 design precipitation shows the spatial distribution of the 6 month winter period accumulation of the design precipitation sequence fig 13e and c show the spatial distribution of the mp scenario for the drainage areas of bonneville dam and libby dam respectively fig 13 shows that the proposed approach can produce the extreme precipitation scenario not only over target drainage areas but over the whole modeling domain based on the mutual dependency of meteorological hydrological conditions of the dam systems over the domain the maximization of each historical ar event increases the cumulative precipitation depths without significantly changing the precipitation distribution pattern over the crb the optimization for bonneville dam s drainage area intensifies the cumulative precipitation depths especially at the southern central crb where it reaches greater than 2000 mm fig 13b and e the optimization for libby dam s drainage area specifically increases the precipitation depths at the northern crb fig 13c and f as a result of optimizing each ar position and rh based on the target basins terrain characteristics the cumulative precipitation depth also shows various spatial distributions depending on the target basin 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 identification and maximization of the historical atmospheric river events this study identified the hazardous ar events by applying the ar category scale ralph et al 2019 to the entire crb all the identified ar events were then maximized by optimizing the ar position and atmospheric moisture as in toride et al 2019 as can be seen from fig 8 the maximization of each ar event shows that the basin average precipitation depth does not necessarily increase with atmospheric moisture which is consistent with the findings of other recent studies ohara et al 2017 yang and smith 2018 fig s3 and s4 show that the change in pw and the change in precipitation depths due to the precipitation maximization are not necessarily consistent which agrees with the finding of rastogi et al 2017 furthermore the ar events with higher precipitation depths in the control simulation do not always provide greater increases in precipitation by optimization figs 4 and 5 which is also in agreement with the recent studies by ishida et al 2015a b toride et al 2019 our analyses on the ar event maximization show that the precipitation maximization process is grounded in the non linear relationships among ar position and direction atmospheric moisture content and the target basin s geographical characteristics for instance fig 7 shows that the cumulative basin average precipitation depth during the ar event 12 b over libby dam s drainage area is maximized by 4 9 south shifting and rhp100 ivt fig 7f nevertheless its corresponding ivt intensity fig 7c overall is lower than the ivt intensity obtained by 5 0 south shifting and rhp150 ivt fig 7b we could interpret this result as follows when the atmospheric moisture is significantly increased at the boundary where ivt 250 kg m 1 s 1 by the rhp150 ivt method as in the ar maximization for bonneville dam s drainage area fig 7b and e the atmosphere can saturate more quickly after injecting the moisture into the domain this relatively immediate saturation causes heavy precipitation near the boundary where rh is increased fig 7e shows that heavy precipitation occurs around the south west boundary during the ar event 12 b that enters the modeling domain from the south west meanwhile this ar event losing some amount of water vapor due to heavy precipitation near the boundary cannot cause substantial precipitation to the basin far from the boundary unless it attains additional moisture this immediate saturation process could impact the precipitation depths over libby dam s drainage area less since that is located at the north east of the modeling domain which is the opposite direction of the boundary where rh was increased meanwhile the moisture depletion process due to the terrain of the cascade range could be a more important factor for determining the contribution of ars to the precipitation depth over the upper inland basins such as libby dam s drainage area ars impacting the upper basins must have a trajectory that favors the ivt penetrating inland through mountain range gaps or the ar ivt being sufficiently strong and deep rutz et al 2015 therefore not only the distance between the boundary and target basin but also the ar trajectories or cascade range s elevation should be investigated in order to explain the mechanism of the ar induced precipitation maximization process investigation of this matter further is beyond the scope of this paper fig 8d also shows that the precipitation maximization process is grounded in the aforementioned non linear relationships between the nature of the ar and terrain characteristics since the relationship between the precipitation depth and rh gradually becomes reversed when the ar is transposed farther south similarly yang and smith 2018 reported that extreme rainfall does not show a monotonic increase with atmospheric moisture but also depends upon the pre storm conditions and complex terrain although investigation of the relationship between the landfalling ar nature and terrain characteristics of the target basin is outside the scope of this paper these findings highlight the importance of the nwm based approach which can account for the orographic uplifting effect moisture convergence and nonlinearity of the atmosphere as several studies have asserted abbs 1999 chen et al 2017 ohara et al 2011 5 2 development of the mp estimation for the 6 month winter period we substituted each historical ar event with its corresponding maximized ar event to form the design precipitation sequence during the winter season which acts as the basis of the long duration mp this sequencing process is based on the concept of the similar process substitution method wmo 2009 while the similar process substitution method temporally substitutes some historical storms with different historical storms to form a new precipitation sequence the proposed method forms a precipitation sequence by maximizing historical ar events in a target water year without combining different storms in fact fig 11 shows that the cumulative design precipitation depths increase with time while maintaining an increasing trend over the control simulation s results this indicates that the proposed method can maximize long duration cumulative precipitation depths based on the maximization of historical ar events over the target basin rather than creating and introducing new ar events to the basin besides as shown in figs 11 and 12 a water year with higher precipitation depth in the control simulation does not always provide greater increase in a 6 month accumulated precipitation depth by the maximization process although the 1974 water year shows 77 5 mm larger 6 month winter period basin average precipitation depth over libby dam s drainage area than the 2017 water year in the control simulation the 2017 water year reaches greater precipitation depth as a result of the maximization this finding is in agreement with the studies by ishida et al 2015a b toride et al 2019 clarifying that the maximization of the storm event with the largest historical precipitation depth does not necessarily yield the mp for a specified duration it is also in the agreement with toride et al 2019 that the latitudinal shifting accounts for the significant part of the increase in the basin average precipitation depth as shown in fig 12 to the authors knowledge this is the first study that estimates the mp for long durations on the order of several months it should be noted that we define the long duration mp as a maximum cumulative precipitation depth during a certain time period including several intervals between ar events thus it cannot be simply compared with the mp value estimated in previous studies which focused on a continuous single storm period ishida et al 2015a 2015b in the same context it is of considerable importance however to estimate extreme precipitation series for such a long period in order to assess the role of large hydraulic structures in controlling extreme floods over a target basin especially in snowmelt driven regions this study estimated the long duration mp for the very large drainage area of bonneville dam which is located at the most downstream of many upstream dam systems in the basin without treating those dam systems independently as shown in fig 13 in fact the proposed approach can maximize precipitation depths for different drainage areas within the same large basin by maximizing the same historical ar events namely without independently identifying ar events for each drainage area this is because the proposed approach identifies ar events using the thresholds of ivt over the large basin in which target drainage areas are located this is one of the most significant advantages of the proposed method from an engineering perspective 5 3 limitations and future directions there are some limitations to this study first this study estimates the mp for the 6 month winter period based on only two water years 1974 and 2017 since the primary purpose of this study was to propose a framework to estimate the mp for long durations however a more rigorous estimate of the long duration mp for the target basin could be founded on the consideration of more historical water years second the ar event identification method using the ivt thresholds still has room for improvement for instance it might be possible to distinguish different ar systems more rigorously by analyzing the trajectory pathways of the ars in the identification process understanding the trajectory pathways of ars might lead to a more efficient determination of the atmospheric bc shifting amount as well however the simplicity with which the ar events could be identified using only thresholds of ivt over the crb is one of the strengths of the proposed method hence there is room for consideration as to how much detail is necessary to distinguish the ar events for estimating the long duration mp third the proposed approach only modified the ar position and atmospheric moisture to maximize precipitation depths during ar events over the crb assuming that these modifications can yield extreme precipitation as in the previous studies however it might be worth considering the effect of other variables such as temperature on the increase in precipitation there have been some studies revealing the strong relationship between extreme precipitation and other atmospheric variables ishida et al 2018a ishida et al 2018b found a monotonous increase in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation with air temperature over the american river watershed in california ohara et al 2017 examined the optimal wind direction for the extreme storm events to maximize the precipitation over the feather and american river watersheds ben alaya et al 2020 found that using the bivariate extreme value model of pw and precipitation efficiency the pmp on the north american continental scale increases at a rate of approximately 4 per 1 c warming therefore it is crucial to investigate the sensitivity of other variables to the increase in precipitation depth and determine which variables to focus on the modification of atmospheric variables should be sufficiently evaluated not to render the atmospheric system unrealistic future work should expand the proposed framework to other regions where other atmospheric phenomena are dominant in causing severe precipitation for instance to expand the proposed framework to the regions where tropical cyclones or hurricanes are dominant it would be necessary to modify the event identification method and rh perturbation method other recent studies mure ravaud et al 2019b 2019a which investigated the extreme precipitation induced by tropical cyclones or hurricanes using the nwm approach could be a good basis for expanding the proposed framework moreover it would be of great interest to estimate the long duration mp under changing climate since the proposed framework identifies ar events based on ivt values calculated by the historical reanalysis datasets the long duration mp estimation under future climate scenarios can be developed using the downscaled global circulation model future climate projections ishida et al 2018a 2018b rastogi et al 2017 it also should be noted that the primary purpose of this effort the mp estimation during the winter season is toward development of a pmp scenario during the winter and spring season which will be used to calculate a pmf for the target drainage areas wmo 2009 the mp estimation during the spring season will be addressed in the second part of an ongoing two part effort to develop the pmp estimation during the winter and spring seasons hence pmf estimation based on the proposed framework is one significant remaining issue the proposed nwm based approach produces not only the precipitation sequence but also other meteorological variables sequences such as temperature solar radiation or wind vector maintaining the physical relationships with precipitation fields thus a rigorous pmf estimation during the winter and spring seasons could be developed by the hydrological analysis using the meteorological variables obtained by the proposed approach as input data gangrade et al 2018 successfully estimated the pmf over the alabama coosa tallapoosa river basin by conducting hydrological simulation under the 72 hr pmp scenario which was estimated using the rhm method although their analysis did not include snowmelt further studies regarding the methodologies for the long duration mp estimation such as on methods for improving the event identification or sequencing method may also be desirable credit authorship contribution statement yusuke hiraga conceptualization methodology

horticultural soils can flush to surface waters following rain events via overland runoff and groundwater seepage creed and band 1998 follett and hatfield 2001 downstream waters receive elevated nutrient inputs for years to decades after the termination of agricultural practices upstream due to soil nutrient storage and leaching frei et al 2020 grimvall et al 2000 mccrackin et al 2017 long term legacy eutrophication has been reported in northern hemisphere temperate systems grimvall et al 2000 mccrackin et al 2017 the predicted recovery time of receiving waters from the stresses of anthropogenically induced algae blooms and eutrophication are variable ranging from 1 year to 100 years after termination of horticulture in the catchment mccrackin et al 2017 the diminishing availability of water for irrigation during drought periods creates a demand for other sources of irrigation water the consistent outflow of greywater recycled treated water from sewage treatment plants from sewage effluent has become an attractive source of irrigation water in many areas worldwide alghobar and suresha 2017 guo et al 2017 pereira et al 2011 tarchouna et al 2010 as greywater typically contains high amounts of nitrogen and other nutrients it is commonly used to reduce fertiliser use on crops khajanchi et al 2015 however adding greywater in addition to routine fertiliser application practices may produce excess nitrogen in soils unbalancing the crop demand whilst not increasing production gu et al 2016 ju et al 2009 therefore there is a need to consider the form and concentrations of nitrogen in greywater related to crop demand applying a high no3 concentration greywater to a crop that preferentially uptakes nh4 such as blueberries can enhance excess nitrogen in soils that is not utilised by the target crop merhaut and darnell 1995 while land use change has dramatically altered nitrogen cycling and loads in temperate systems less is known about how tropical and subtropical systems respond to increasing nitrogen inputs warmer waterways are expected to remove larger amounts of reactive nitrogen via denitrification than temperate systems hajati et al 2020 wadnerkar et al 2019 but these attenuation rates have not been quantified in detail understanding the sources and time scales of nitrogen delivery to creek systems can provide vital information for land use planning and restoration kaushal et al 2011 the dual isotopic composition of no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can provide insights into nitrogen sources and fates in receiving waters zhang et al 2019 each source of nitrogen in a catchment i e sewage fertiliser animal manure atmospheric deposition often has a distinctive isotopic signature as denitrification processes preferentially utilise the lighter isotopes 14n and 16o instead of the heavier isotopes 15n and 18o a predictable kinetic fractionation can reveal nitrogen transformations or attenuation in receiving waters here we quantify creek no3 n loads rainfall no3 n contributions anthropogenic no3 n sources recycled greywater and inorganic fertilisers and natural no3 n attenuation in an australian subtropical creek using a combination of high resolution temporal and spatial observations as well as stable isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the studied system is experiencing rapid land use change providing an opportunity to better understand how modified nitrogen inputs may impact subtropical creeks in contrast to more investigated temperate systems observations were performed during a dry period and over subsequent rain events to assess how short term high intensity rainfall may affect the efficiency of in stream no3 n attenuation and nitrogen flushing from agricultural soils 2 methods 2 1 study site our investigations were performed in the subtropical double crossing creek a catchment draining to hearnes lake australia hearnes lake 30 08 10 3 s 153 11 51 0 e is a culturally important natural asset on gumbaynggirr aboriginal country and forms part of the highly diverse solitary islands marine park simp the region is experiencing rapid land use change historic banana farming in the catchment has given way to blueberry farms and hothouse horticulture since the early 2000 s bevan 2006 rural lands council 2016 recent investigations reveal regional nitrogen n loads were amongst the highest ever recorded in a natural waterway on the east coast of australia white et al 2018a the increasing density of intensive horticulture relies on recycled greywater and artificial fertilisers that are likely contributing to the high nitrogen loads conrad et al 2019 white et al 2018b therefore quantifying the sources transport and attenuation of nitrogen from the farms to the downstream catchment is essential to manage any impact on the protected regional coastal ecosystems mean annual rainfall in the area is 1685 mm per year though 60 of rain events occur between january and may department of land and water conservation 2001 the upstream catchment area is 6 8 km2 draining to hearnes lake primarily via double crossing creek our study focuses on double crossing creek from the upper catchment 41 m asl to the lower catchment 4 m asl the major soil classification across the catchment is kandosol isbell 2016 with areas closer to the creek classified as hydrosol and kurosol nsw office of environment and heritage 1999 land use in the catchment above the most downstream site site 5 is 30 7 currently fertilised land and 46 9 current and historically fertilised soil fig 1 table 1 at present the recommended nitrogen fertiliser regime for blueberries is 121 kg n ha yr 1 using commercially available fertilisers barker and pilbeam 2015 doughty et al 1988 ireland and wilk 2006 blueberries the dominant horticulture in this catchment prefer nitrogen in the form of nh4 rather than no3 merhaut and darnell 1995 therefore no3 n in the greywater that is being applied to blueberry crops can be stored in the upper soils flushed during rainfall events lost to the atmosphere as nitrogen gases or leached to the creek via shallow groundwater discharge in dry periods 2 2 experimental approach we performed high resolution spatial and temporal observations during contrasting hydrological conditions covering the annual extremes for detailed time series observations a station was set up at site 3 approximately in the middle of the transect of 5 sites 1451 m downstream of site 1 and 1605 m upstream of site 5 fig 1 water was continuously pumped from the creek into a small sampling station feeding water a quality sonde with a constant supply of creek water a calibrated hydrolab ms5 measured dissolved oxygen do ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature discrete creek water sampling occurred over 91 days at this site with a total of 222 discrete samples of nitrogen taken between 7th january and 8th april 2019 discrete sampling occurred daily at 09 00 am during dry periods sampling frequency increased to hourly during rainfall periods 20 mm in a day progressively reducing to 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly after rainfall to assess attenuation of n six spatial sites were sampled along the creek transect the creek branches into two distinct sub catchments upstream of site 2 fig 1 hence a control site was located on a branching tributary adjacent to site 2 to assess potential external influences on downstream samples the control site allows for a direct comparison to site 2 because it has a similar catchment land use 36 1 and 37 4 currently fertilised land at site 2 and control respectively and the same creek order strahler order 2 sites along the central transect were spaced 562 1043 m apart with slopes between 0 7 and 2 0 sampling was undertaken at each site approximately weekly during dry times and approximately twice daily reducing to daily after rainfall during first flush and secondary flush events a total of 14 spatial sampling campaigns were undertaken calibrated handheld hach hq40d probes measured dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature whist electrical conductivity ec and salinity were measured using a calibrated ysi salinity probe 2 3 nutrient and isotope analysis dissolved nutrient samples at both the time series and spatial sites were taken using a sample rinsed 60 ml polyethylene syringe satourious 0 45 μm glass fibre syringe filters were used to filter samples into a 10 ml rinsed and capped polyethylene sample tube samples were kept on ice and in darkness for 5 h before being frozen until laboratory analysis no3 n concentrations were analysed colourimetrically using a lachat flow injection analyser fia with analytical uncertainties 5 since no3 n was determined to account for 80 of total dissolved nitrogen species in this catchment white et al 2018a here we assume that no3 n is the most important dissolved nitrogen species and focus our analysis on no3 n a sub selection of samples representing all hydrological conditions and no3 n gradients in the creek from the spatial survey n 46 and the time series n 32 were analysed for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 to estimate the relative contributions of three apparent sources rainfall inorganic fertiliser and greywater to the creek water samples from all sites during sampling campaigns 2 5 and 7 in the dry period 10 and 12 in the first flush and 13 14 and 15 in the second flush were analysed stable isotope samples were analysed using the chemical azide method mcilvin and altabet 2005 no3 was quantitatively converted to no2 via cadmium reduction then to n2o using sodium azide the efficiency of the conversion was 98 2 resultant n2o was analysed on a hydra 20 22 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms sercon ltd uk interfaced to a cryoprep system sercon ltd uk the isotopic ratios of nitrogen and oxygen are expressed in per mil relative to atmospheric air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively the external reproducibility of the isotopic analyses was within 0 3 for δ15n and 0 5 for δ18o the final δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the samples were calculated based on international reference materials which include usgs 34 δ15n 1 8 δ18o 27 9 usgs 35 δ15n 2 7 δ18o 57 5 and iaea no3 δ15n 4 7 δ18o 25 6 a mix standard with δ15n of 39 8 and δ18o of 25 6 was also prepared using usgs32 δ15n 180 δ18o 25 7 and iaea no3 lab internal standards kno3 and nano2 with pre determined isotopic values were also processed the same way as the samples to check on the efficiency of the analytical procedure and the accuracy of the isotopic values the δ15n of the inorganic fertiliser in solid form was dried and pulverised before being analysed on a hydra 20 22 cf irms coupled to an elemental analyser sercon ltd uk the precision of the δ15n was 0 2 source contributions to creek waters were estimated only for sites 1 2 and control due to the proximity to the source we used the stable isotope mixing model simmr parnell and inger 2020 in r studio updated from the original siar code parnell et al 2010 to estimate source no3 n contributions to the creek during the dry first flush and second flush hydrological periods using a gaussian likelihood bayesian statistical framework this analysis method has been evolving since the original 2010 code and simmr is used in various recent isotope studies crespo et al 2020a 2020b sánchez murillo et al 2020 we combined the endmembers of liquid and dry fertilisers as well as the greywater samples using the combine sources function within simmr to estimate the total contribution of fertilisers and greywater to the creek we also use rainfall isotope values from wong et al 2015 within the model framework concentration dependence and trophic enrichment factors were zeroed similar to gokool et al 2018 the markov chain monte carlo mcmc function in simmr creates 100 000 pseudoreplicates and discards the first 10 000 a gelman rubin diagnostic tests model convergence within mcmc and analyses differences between multiple markov chains all gelman rubin values were equal to 1 indicating good model convergence 2 4 hydrology and data analysis a global water company flow probe was used to determine water velocity at each sampling site using the average function within the probe and measuring the flow across the horizontal flow area horizontal surface area of the creek was calculated using the trapezoidal method by acquiring manual measurements of depth and length across the creek discharge was calculated as surface area multiplied by velocity data from the australian landscape water balance model australian bureau of meteorology 2018 was used to obtain root zone soil moisture a rain gauge was installed at site 3 and recorded at each time series discrete sample interval the nitrogen load flux per area per time was calculated using the equation f c m q a where f is the flux of nutrients kg ha day 1 c is the concentration of nutrient µm m is the molecular weight of the element g mol 1 q is discharge m3 day 1 and a is catchment area ha unit conversions were used where appropriate data summaries in tables are means standard error unless otherwise noted fertiliser loss was calculated as our assumed recommended fertiliser use kg ha yr 1 divided by the mean creek flux of no3 n standardised for land use percentage in the catchments we classified the area of catchments upstream of each of the sites using the upper limits of 1 m interval contour data creating a polygon of the catchment in environmental systems research institute esri arcgis mapping software geoscience australia 2015 catchment land uses were classified using aerial imagery and field scouting enabling percent land use calculation of each sub catchment based on december 2018 imagery google earth pro 2018 land and property information nsw 2017 land uses catchment are reported in table 1 3 results 3 1 nitrate time series our observations covered a dry summer with 244 mm of accumulated rainfall during the 91 days of observations two rain events 30 mm in a day significantly altered the flow regime and created spikes of discharge fig 2 the time series dataset was classified into three hydrological stages 1 dry period with 30 mm rain per day 7th january to 29th march 2019 2 first flush the first rain event 30 mm in a day after the dry period 30th march to 1st april 2019 and 3 secondary flush a larger second rain event 30 mm in a day 2nd april to 8th april 2019 we observed a clear shift in no3 n and water flow and soil moisture between these three hydrological events table 2 mean no3 n concentrations at the time series site were 50 74 and 137 fold higher than the australian and new zealand water quality guidelines anzecc during dry first flush and secondary flush periods respectively anzecc 2000 the guideline for lowland streams in slightly disturbed regional catchments is 2 85 µm during the time series the minimum recorded no3 n concentration was 106 µm and the maximum was 485 µm 3 2 spatial surveys the fourteen spatial surveys imply significant attenuation of no3 n concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 4 along the creek transect the most upstream site 1 was located immediately downstream of a hothouse protected cropping growing tomatoes concentrations of no3 n were extremely high reaching 27 198 µm the lowest site 1 concentrations were observed before the tomato hothouse had begun crop growing operations no3 n concentrations decreased exponentially at the downstream sites averaging 49 µm at the most downstream site 5 table 3 there was one sample at site 5 that was below the acceptable anzecc concentrations all other samples from sites 1 5 exceeded the guidelines anzecc 2000 during the second flush survey no3 n concentrations were highest with a maximum of 315 µm at site 5 creating a pulse of extremely high no3 n loads past site 5 and potentially 500 m downstream into the habitat protected estuary comparisons were made between site 2 and the control site to determine if the control site influenced the no3 n loads flowing to the main creek transect the land use was comparable in the catchments draining to site 2 and the control site fig 1 as a result the catchment area weighted no3 n loads at the control site were comparable to site 2 either in all spatial campaigns t 26 0 61 p 0 54 or when data was classified into dry t 16 0 23 p 0 18 first flush t 2 0 44 p 0 69 and second flush t 4 1 11 p 0 32 therefore the two sites make a similar contribution to no3 n at the sites downstream supporting our approach of using sites 1 5 as a one dimensional continuous segment to interpret natural creek attenuation see below 3 3 stable isotope observations farms in the catchment receive recycled greywater from the local sewage treatment plants delivering 2400 m3 d 1 to the catchment or 2176 kg no3 n yr 1 two samples collected from the greywater supply system had no3 n concentrations of 229 and 126 µm with high δ15n no3 21 9 and 20 9 table 4 these concentrations are 10 times lower than creek concentrations at site 1 and within a similar range of samples at site 2 table 5 hence greywater cannot be the dominant contributor to creek no3 n at site 1 but may be relevant at site 2 discussions with farmers indicate that they are filling dams with greywater pumping that water through fertigation systems where additional fertilisers are added then applying the mixed water to crops six samples of nitrogen fertilisers were obtained from a local agricultural supplier capturing sources of nitrogen that are recommended by agronomists to farmers fertilisers were light in δ15n ranging from 8 0 to 0 1 these fertiliser δ15n no3 values are within the range of those reported elsewhere in the literature bateman and kelly 2007 consistent with the change in no3 n loads isotopes samples from both time series and spatial surveys also varied according to different hydrological conditions in general the creek δ15n no3 observations plot between the greywater and the fertiliser endmembers implying a mixed source fig 5 the time series δ15n no3 values in the stream during the dry period were relatively higher than first flush and second flush a similar pattern was observed for the spatial survey except for the samples with the highest no3 n concentrations the lowest δ15n no3 2 more enriched than inorganic fertiliser was observed at the most upstream site consistent with the highest no3 n concentrations the highest δ15n no3 was observed at the most downstream site during the dry period δ18o no3 ranged between 5 and 30 a positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 was observed for the time series no3 n fig 5b but not was apparent on the spatial samples fig 5a 4 discussion 4 1 aquatic nitrogen loads versus catchment inputs we estimated no3 n loss rates by comparing bottom up estimates of nitrogen sources to the catchment and our calculated aquatic no3 n loads the application of fertiliser across all industries blueberries tomatoes cucumbers and bananas and the specific amount of applied fertiliser by local farmers are poorly understood we estimate that the catchment receives 15 877 kg n yr 1 delivered as fertiliser based on the following assumptions 1 farmers apply 100 kg n ha yr 1 to bananas newley et al 2008 and 121 kg n ha yr 1 to blueberries doughty et al 1988 ireland and wilk 2006 2 hothouses produce between two and four crops per year inferring cucumbers would require 2859 kg n ha yr 1 grewal et al 2011 and tomatoes 1200 kg n ha yr 1 tei et al 2002 based on three crops per year as the hothouse crop was not known at all sites we make the conservative assumption that all farmers using hothouses are growing the higher nitrogen crop cucumbers 3 the greywater system delivers 2812 kg n yr 1 to the catchment based on our greywater sample concentrations and an average of 2400 m3 d 1 of greywater and 4 rainfall delivers 1115 kg n yr 1 to the catchment angus and grace 2017 combined these external nitrogen sources add up to 1678 kg n yr 1 and 19 805 kg n yr 1 across the smaller catchment upstream of site 1 and the larger catchment upstream of site 5 respectively our observed aquatic nitrogen fluxes calculated as the mean no3 n load at each site multiplied by the site catchment area ranged from 2284 kg no3 n yr 1 at site 1 to 1350 kg no3 n yr 1 at site 5 therefore we estimate that 136 74 18 17 7 and 68 of the nitrogen inputs in the catchment are reaching the creek at sites 1 2 3 4 5 and control respectively table 3 these values of no3 n losses exceeding 100 nitrogen input loss are presumably impossible implying that one or more of our assumptions may be wrong possible explanations for aquatic losses exceeding 100 of inputs include 1 the real fertiliser application rate on the farms in the catchments of sites 1 2 and control may be far higher than our assumed fertilisation rates and those recommended by the industry peak body yadav et al 1997 there is no available data on the amount or timing of fertilisers applied before and during our observations therefore we had to rely on the assumption that farmers are fertilising their crops in adherence with industry recommendations due to the natural cycling of nitrogen and the role soil bacteria plays in transformations it is not possible to achieve 100 plant uptake of applied fertiliser between 20 and 80 of fertilisers are either lost to local waterways or stored in soils where nitrogen can leach out for decades bindraban et al 2015 sebilo et al 2013 2 significant no3 n leaching may be occurring from overlooked land uses or sources including septic systems gerritse et al 1995 or soil storages of nitrogen from historical fertiliser application sebilo et al 2013 we have no data on septic systems or legacy soil nitrogen in this catchment though the land use is clearly dominated by horticultural activities the soils in the catchment have been recently disturbed 20 years historically the earlier banana plantations required less nitrogen than the recent blueberry industry it is difficult to conceive that legacy aquatic nitrogen fluxes are exceeding expected annual fertilisation rates for 20 years after banana plantations were replaced by more intensive blueberry horticulture 3 our 91 days of observations of creek water quality may not be representative of long term nitrogen loss indeed the summer of 2019 was quite dry with 100 mm of rain between day 1 and day 68 the annual long term rainfall mean is 1685 mm per year with 60 of rain events occurring between january and may department of land and water conservation 2001 our observations occurred in a particularly dry period where only 244 mm of rain fell between january and april which is equivalent to 25 of the expected historical rainfall for those 91 days it would be reasonable to expect that the lower rainfall drove lower than average no3 n concentrations and loads during our observations therefore our observations are likely at the low end of the long term annual average loads 4 2 stable isotope assessment of sources and transformation of no3 n the creek isotope data revealed a complex pattern of both mixing and transformation through nitrification and denitrification adding rainfall isotope data from wong et al 2015 all the δ15n no3 signatures lay between greywater rainfall and the inorganic fertiliser samples fig 6 suggesting a mixing of these end members as the origin of the creek no3 n the very high no3 n concentrations suggest minimal attenuation of no3 n at the three most upstream sites using the simmr package in r studio parnell and inger 2020 greywater was the dominant source 53 9 7 3 of no3 n in the creek during the dry period whilst rainfall and fertiliser contributed 23 4 3 6 and 22 7 7 3 respectively fig 7 during the first and second flush periods respectively greywater contributed 51 6 9 9 and 60 0 5 8 fertiliser contributed 27 4 11 7 and 35 3 5 4 and rainfall contributed 21 0 7 8 and 4 7 2 0 grouping the three hydrological periods together gave overall no3 n contributions to the creek of 28 9 4 6 55 3 3 6 and 15 7 3 1 for fertiliser greywater and rainfall respectively we can compare these estimates to a bottom up mass balance approach in which the source contributions are added up we analysed five rainfall samples in the catchment 0 1 0 04 mg no3 n l 1 and used mean annual rainfall to estimate that rainfall contributes 1115 kg n yr 1 to the catchment fertilisers are expected to deliver 15 877 kg n yr 1 to the catchment if recommended doses are used and greywater 2812 kg n yr 1 if our mean greywater sample concentrations and an estimate of 2400 m3 d 1 of greywater is representative of the annual cycle animal manure is assumed to be negligible due to minimal presence of livestock in the region adding up these known sources implies that greywater would account for about 20 of the total nitrogen load at site 1 considering fertiliser removal by vegetation and loss within soils the stable isotope and the mass balance estimate provide reasonable estimates of source contributions in addition to source mixing and possible inputs of greywater along the creek there were indications of transformation processes along the creek evidence for denitrification comes from the progressive increase in δ15n no3 along the creek from site 1 to site 5 as well as a significant positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 r2 0 862 p 0 001 for the time series no3 n data granger and wankel 2016 zhang et al 2019 we observed distinct patterns that depend on the prevailing hydrology and rainfall liu et al 2017 paredes et al 2020 venkiteswaran et al 2017 high δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values during low flow persisted δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values tended to decrease progressively during the first and second flushes this change in the isotopic signature is consistent with increased nitrogen processing along the soil groundwater stream continuum at longer residence times dry and minimal transformation after extended high flow second flush during the second flush a residual amount of denitrified assimilated inorganic fertiliser appears to be the most probable source of no3 n to the creek the low δ18o no3 of the second flush compared to the liquid fertiliser and no3 n signature at site 1 can be attributed to nitrification of ammonium and urea based fertilisers which typically results in a δ18o no3 of 0 in freshwater systems mixing with rainwater and greywater boshers et al 2019 wong et al 2018 for the stream transects a complex coupling of hydrological biogeochemical effects was observed for example in addition to denitrification possible greywater inputs rainfall and source mixing a freshly nitrified ammonium fertiliser signal was also apparent at site 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by about 12 to 15 compared to liquid no3 n fertiliser indicating denitrification as this no3 n moves from the source into the creek fig 5 at site 2 there was generally an increase in δ15n no3 associated with a substantial drop in the δ18o no3 ruling out denitrification alone we speculate that mixing of the upstream water with a very low δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 nitrate derived from nitrification of ammonium fertiliser greywater and some denitrification drove the elevated δ18o no3 at site 2 during the first and second flush as water moves downstream there is generally an enrichment trend in both δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 consistent with denitrification however during the dry period there is no enrichment of δ18o no3 though enrichment of δ15n no3 continues down the flow path suggesting a combination of denitrification mixing with external fresh greywater inputs and nitrified ammonium driving no3 n in the creek during this period previous studies have modelled the amount of denitrification taking place in streams using rayleigh distillation models paredes et al 2020 however the complex mixing outlined above and the potentially variable isotopic fractionation factors prevent the application of such a model in this study the significant interaction between hydrology and denitrification suggests that hydrological effects warrant an important consideration when using stable isotopes to assess sources and fate of nitrogen denitrification often occurs in anaerobic or anoxic soils riparian zones and saturated sediments bange 2006 statham 2012 the extent of denitrification depends on local conditions which include residence time availability of no3 n microbial community composition dissolved oxygen temperature ph and organic material availability hydrology will alter these parameters at a local scale and in turn control the spatio temporal variations of denitrification rates hefting et al 2003 walker et al 2002 fig 5 thus highlights a need to further investigate the interplay between hydrology and the factors controlling denitrification and the attenuation efficiency of no3 n 4 3 creek nitrogen loads and attenuation a large range in nitrogen loads along our creek transect over both space and time were driven by hydrology soil moisture and distance along the creek transect there was a significant positive relationship between root zone soil moisture and no3 n concentrations with an inflexion of the curve at 55 soil moisture fig 8 this relationship suggests that nitrogen stored in catchment soils was flushed during rain events after soils became saturated van meter et al 2016 and that soils may be storing high loads of n to release it via overland runoff when soil saturation reaches a critical point we suggest that the critical tipping point where soils switch from storage to release is 55 root zone water saturation figs 8 and 9 no3 n is highly soluble in water therefore with higher soil saturation the higher the probability of no3 n leaching either via overland runoff or groundwater seepage puckett 1994 santos et al 2013 in the dry period flows increased steadily along the creek while no3 n concentrations and loads decreased with increasing distance from the upper catchment where most of the intensive horticulture land use occurs fig 1 a phase shift i e a change from attenuation to transport occurred after the first flush on day 64 when rainfall increased no3 n loads and concentrations at downstream sites high rainfall reduces the ability of riparian denitrification due to shorter water residence times konohira et al 2001 here we also observed reduced attenuation of no3 n during high flow events increasing catchment degradation can shift waterways from efficient denitrification to a flow through system where nitrogen is inefficiently denitrified flushed and delivered to the ocean wells and eyre 2018 these hypotheses can be combined with meyer and likens 1979 suggestion of nutrient cycling in low flows and nutrient throughput in high flows headwater streams draining high fertilised land and subsequently high soil nitrogen storages may therefore phase shift between two nutrient processing modes 1 nutrient attenuation during low flows when longer residence times allow for denitrification and reduction of aquatic no3 n in riparian and in stream sediments and 2 a high flow throughput similar to a one directional pipe when short residence times circumvent nitrogen cycling instream and transport most of the no3 n load to downstream receiving waters until the first flush hydrological conditions remained relatively constant throughout the catchment loads at site 5 were 0 2 0 5 and 9 7 of loads at site 1 even though water flux increased by 98 5 99 6 and 71 1 during dry first flush and second flush respectively both dilution and denitrification can occur along the creek transect by using creek loads rather than concentrations in attenuation calculations we account for potential dilution we used the log linear decay rate constant to estimate the attenuation rate ensign et al 2006 this method allows estimation of the no3 n removal from the water column without resolving specific biogeochemical processes such as denitrification or plant uptake duff et al 2008 peterson et al 2001 this approach assumes a log linear decay of the solute load from site 1 and no external inputs consistent with general trends in our data fig 3 we estimate that during the dry period this transect of double crossing creek has the capacity to remove 83 9 r2 0 956 p 0 001 of the no3 n load at site 1 per km of the creek during the first flush the creek attenuated 81 3 per km r2 0 934 p 0 001 whilst during the second flush this attenuation capacity dropped further to 52 2 per km r2 0 944 p 0 001 this implies that the creek provides a valuable ecosystem service during dry and first flush events removing much of the no3 n load however the ability of the creek to attenuate is compromised when soil moisture flow and nutrient loads increase during a second flush event knowledge of longer term soil nitrogen storage has increased from over 2000 sites in north america van meter et al 2016 found soil storage in agricultural landscapes to be between 25 and 70 kg n ha 1 it was once believed that the denitrification in agricultural soils would remove nitrogen soil stocks however the storage of soil nitrogen may be linked to long term flushing during rain events when soil moisture reaches a critical point frei et al 2020 worrall et al 2015 we found no significant correlations between no3 n attenuation and discharge or no3 n attenuation and accumulated rainfall in the 3 days prior to sampling creek discharge and rainfall may be linked to soil moisture but the disparity in the temporal resolution of discharge rainfall and soil moisture data prevent a detailed analysis a significant inverse relationship exists between no3 n attenuation and dissolved oxygen r2 0 553 p 0 05 this correlation likely indicates the reduction of denitrification in high flow periods due to shorter residence times and increased gaseous exchange in the water column inhibiting anaerobic conditions in the riparian zone konohira et al 2001 while the effects of hydrology on in stream processes are also relevant for temperate systems forshay and stanley 2005 the potential of in stream attenuation in temperate freshwater systems is comparatively lower than in subtropical tropical zones for instance a maximum in stream no3 n removal of 20 50 was observed in a first order stream of an agricultural headwater catchment in germany schuetz et al 2016 whilst a median of 16 no3 n removal by denitrification was estimated for 49 streams 18 5 0 48 c in the usa denitrification rates were highly variable from 0 5 to 100 dominantly controlled by specific discharge and no3 n concentration mulholland et al 2009 the relatively lower no3 n removal in temperate compared to tropical subtropical systems i e our study site can be explained by the relatively lower temperature and solar radiation limiting denitrification and primary productivity in cooler temperate systems fellows et al 2006 the creek temperature 19 to 25 2 c was higher than those observed in temperate waterways in the northern hemisphere and likely drove higher denitrification rates sand jensen et al 2007 the ability of a waterway in attenuating no3 n is also a function of stream size and residence times smaller streams with higher surface area to volume ratios can have greater interactions between surface waters and the hyporheic zones enabling a longer residence time greater bioreactive surface area and higher denitrification capacity alexander et al 2000 2007 the creek depth 11 8 0 3 cm and width 41 0 2 75 cm at the time series site indicate a high bioreactive surface area and opportunity for hyporheic exchange briggs et al 2013 peralta maraver et al 2018 during the dry period surface flows in parts of the transect were observed to cease and reappear up to 30 m downstream indicating a strong relationship between surface and hyporheic flows longer streams can often remove more no3 n within the network as loading rates increase at the reach scale total in stream no3 n removal can be responsible for only 2 10 no3 n loss but this can range from 10 to 70 when entire river networks including small first and second order streams are considered dupas et al 2013 hensley et al 2015 schuetz et al 2016 5 conclusions we revealed effective nitrogen attenuation of large anthropogenic nitrogen loads in a subtropical creek a clear shift in no3 n and flow was noted between the three hydrological events with greater loads and concentrations during wet conditions a significant relationship between root zone soil moisture and creek no3 n concentrations indicated that soil stored nitrogen was flushed when soil moisture exceeded 55 saturation stable isotopes δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 suggest that no3 n in the upper creek water originates from a mixture of rainfall 16 fertilisers 29 and greywater 55 these major sources produce creek no3 n loads exceeding the bottom up estimates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to this catchment implying that our assumptions of nitrogen inputs from fertilisers or other sources are underestimated for the majority of the study duration the creek was an effective natural bioreactor attenuating a large fraction of anthropogenic loads in specific hydrological conditions during the dry period the creek removed 84 of the initial no3 n load per km during the first flush the creek attenuated 81 whilst during the second flush this attenuation capacity dropped to 52 per km the ability to attenuate was reduced when soil moisture flow and nutrient loads increased during periods of high flow and saturated soils high loads of no3 n are exported downstream essentially shifting the creek from a natural bioreactor to a theoretical flow through pipe this suggests that nitrogen management during high flow events should be a priority although the creek provides a valuable ecosystem service by naturally reducing no3 n there are still significant loads of no3 n well above expected for natural systems our results highlight the need for modification of fertiliser and greywater use as well as capturing anthropogenic nitrogen at the source before it is lost to creeks and

4488,nitrogen pollution in subtropical waters is rapidly increasing due to land use change but specific sources transformations and attenuation rates remain understudied compared to cooler temperate catchments here we quantify high resolution nitrate no3 n loads sources and natural attenuation in a subtropical creek in australia over contrasting hydrological conditions we observed large creek no3 n loads ranging from 44 to 2938 μmol m 2 catchment d 1 exceeding the bottom up estimates of nitrogen input to the catchment at the most upstream sites stable isotope natural abundances δ15n and δ18o in no3 n and bayesian analysis revealed that greywater was the dominant source accounting for 55 of no3 n in the upper creek but fertilisers 29 and rainfall 16 were also relevant no3 n sources no3 n loads at the most downstream site were only 0 2 9 7 of loads at the most upstream site the resulting no3 n attenuation efficiency mainly via denitrification was 52 84 of original upstream load per km of creek depending on hydrological conditions this large capacity to attenuate no3 n during dry and first flush events exceeds the attenuation found in temperate creeks subject to several decades of pollution in the northern hemisphere during periods of high water flow and saturated soils high no3 n loads were exported downstream turning the creek from a natural bioreactor to a system resembling a flow through pipe in spite of effective natural nitrogen attenuation providing a valuable ecosystem service concentrations and loads remained well above expected for natural systems and water quality guidelines overall our results highlight the need for modifying fertiliser use capturing nitrogen on farms and reducing greywater nitrogen to prevent significant losses to subtropical

anthropogenically induced algae blooms and eutrophication are variable ranging from 1 year to 100 years after termination of horticulture in the catchment mccrackin et al 2017 the diminishing availability of water for irrigation during drought periods creates a demand for other sources of irrigation water the consistent outflow of greywater recycled treated water from sewage treatment plants from sewage effluent has become an attractive source of irrigation water in many areas worldwide alghobar and suresha 2017 guo et al 2017 pereira et al 2011 tarchouna et al 2010 as greywater typically contains high amounts of nitrogen and other nutrients it is commonly used to reduce fertiliser use on crops khajanchi et al 2015 however adding greywater in addition to routine fertiliser application practices may produce excess nitrogen in soils unbalancing the crop demand whilst not increasing production gu et al 2016 ju et al 2009 therefore there is a need to consider the form and concentrations of nitrogen in greywater related to crop demand applying a high no3 concentration greywater to a crop that preferentially uptakes nh4 such as blueberries can enhance excess nitrogen in soils that is not utilised by the target crop merhaut and darnell 1995 while land use change has dramatically altered nitrogen cycling and loads in temperate systems less is known about how tropical and subtropical systems respond to increasing nitrogen inputs warmer waterways are expected to remove larger amounts of reactive nitrogen via denitrification than temperate systems hajati et al 2020 wadnerkar et al 2019 but these attenuation rates have not been quantified in detail understanding the sources and time scales of nitrogen delivery to creek systems can provide vital information for land use planning and restoration kaushal et al 2011 the dual isotopic composition of no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can provide insights into nitrogen sources and fates in receiving waters zhang et al 2019 each source of nitrogen in a catchment i e sewage fertiliser animal manure atmospheric deposition often has a distinctive isotopic signature as denitrification processes preferentially utilise the lighter isotopes 14n and 16o instead of the heavier isotopes 15n and 18o a predictable kinetic fractionation can reveal nitrogen transformations or attenuation in receiving waters here we quantify creek no3 n loads rainfall no3 n contributions anthropogenic no3 n sources recycled greywater and inorganic fertilisers and natural no3 n attenuation in an australian subtropical creek using a combination of high resolution temporal and spatial observations as well as stable isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the studied system is experiencing rapid land use change providing an opportunity to better understand how modified nitrogen inputs may impact subtropical creeks in contrast to more investigated temperate systems observations were performed during a dry period and over subsequent rain events to assess how short term high intensity rainfall may affect the efficiency of in stream no3 n attenuation and nitrogen flushing from agricultural soils 2 methods 2 1 study site our investigations were performed in the subtropical double crossing creek a catchment draining to hearnes lake australia hearnes lake 30 08 10 3 s 153 11 51 0 e is a culturally important natural asset on gumbaynggirr aboriginal country and forms part of the highly diverse solitary islands marine park simp the region is experiencing rapid land use change historic banana farming in the catchment has given way to blueberry farms and hothouse horticulture since the early 2000 s bevan 2006 rural lands council 2016 recent investigations reveal regional nitrogen n loads were amongst the highest ever recorded in a natural waterway on the east coast of australia white et al 2018a the increasing density of intensive horticulture relies on recycled greywater and artificial fertilisers that are likely contributing to the high nitrogen loads conrad et al 2019 white et al 2018b therefore quantifying the sources transport and attenuation of nitrogen from the farms to the downstream catchment is essential to manage any impact on the protected regional coastal ecosystems mean annual rainfall in the area is 1685 mm per year though 60 of rain events occur between january and may department of land and water conservation 2001 the upstream catchment area is 6 8 km2 draining to hearnes lake primarily via double crossing creek our study focuses on double crossing creek from the upper catchment 41 m asl to the lower catchment 4 m asl the major soil classification across the catchment is kandosol isbell 2016 with areas closer to the creek classified as hydrosol and kurosol nsw office of environment and heritage 1999 land use in the catchment above the most downstream site site 5 is 30 7 currently fertilised land and 46 9 current and historically fertilised soil fig 1 table 1 at present the recommended nitrogen fertiliser regime for blueberries is 121 kg n ha yr 1 using commercially available fertilisers barker and pilbeam 2015 doughty et al 1988 ireland and wilk 2006 blueberries the dominant horticulture in this catchment prefer nitrogen in the form of nh4 rather than no3 merhaut and darnell 1995 therefore no3 n in the greywater that is being applied to blueberry crops can be stored in the upper soils flushed during rainfall events lost to the atmosphere as nitrogen gases or leached to the creek via shallow groundwater discharge in dry periods 2 2 experimental approach we performed high resolution spatial and temporal observations during contrasting hydrological conditions covering the annual extremes for detailed time series observations a station was set up at site 3 approximately in the middle of the transect of 5 sites 1451 m downstream of site 1 and 1605 m upstream of site 5 fig 1 water was continuously pumped from the creek into a small sampling station feeding water a quality sonde with a constant supply of creek water a calibrated hydrolab ms5 measured dissolved oxygen do ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature discrete creek water sampling occurred over 91 days at this site with a total of 222 discrete samples of nitrogen taken between 7th january and 8th april 2019 discrete sampling occurred daily at 09 00 am during dry periods sampling frequency increased to hourly during rainfall periods 20 mm in a day progressively reducing to 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly after rainfall to assess attenuation of n six spatial sites were sampled along the creek transect the creek branches into two distinct sub catchments upstream of site 2 fig 1 hence a control site was located on a branching tributary adjacent to site 2 to assess potential external influences on downstream samples the control site allows for a direct comparison to site 2 because it has a similar catchment land use 36 1 and 37 4 currently fertilised land at site 2 and control respectively and the same creek order strahler order 2 sites along the central transect were spaced 562 1043 m apart with slopes between 0 7 and 2 0 sampling was undertaken at each site approximately weekly during dry times and approximately twice daily reducing to daily after rainfall during first flush and secondary flush events a total of 14 spatial sampling campaigns were undertaken calibrated handheld hach hq40d probes measured dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature whist electrical conductivity ec and salinity were measured using a calibrated ysi salinity probe 2 3 nutrient and isotope analysis dissolved nutrient samples at both the time series and spatial sites were taken using a sample rinsed 60 ml polyethylene syringe satourious 0 45 μm glass fibre syringe filters were used to filter samples into a 10 ml rinsed and capped polyethylene sample tube samples were kept on ice and in darkness for 5 h before being frozen until laboratory analysis no3 n concentrations were analysed colourimetrically using a lachat flow injection analyser fia with analytical uncertainties 5 since no3 n was determined to account for 80 of total dissolved nitrogen species in this catchment white et al 2018a here we assume that no3 n is the most important dissolved nitrogen species and focus our analysis on no3 n a sub selection of samples representing all hydrological conditions and no3 n gradients in the creek from the spatial survey n 46 and the time series n 32 were analysed for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 to estimate the relative contributions of three apparent sources rainfall inorganic fertiliser and greywater to the creek water samples from all sites during sampling campaigns 2 5 and 7 in the dry period 10 and 12 in the first flush and 13 14 and 15 in the second flush were analysed stable isotope samples were analysed using the chemical azide method mcilvin and altabet 2005 no3 was quantitatively converted to no2 via cadmium reduction then to n2o using sodium azide the efficiency of the conversion was 98 2 resultant n2o was analysed on a hydra 20 22 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms sercon ltd uk interfaced to a cryoprep system sercon ltd uk the isotopic ratios of nitrogen and oxygen are expressed in per mil relative to atmospheric air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively the external reproducibility of the isotopic analyses was within 0 3 for δ15n and 0 5 for δ18o the final δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the samples were calculated based on international reference materials which include usgs 34 δ15n 1 8 δ18o 27 9 usgs 35 δ15n 2 7 δ18o 57 5 and iaea no3 δ15n 4 7 δ18o 25 6 a mix standard with δ15n of 39 8 and δ18o of 25 6 was also prepared using usgs32 δ15n 180 δ18o 25 7 and iaea no3 lab internal standards kno3 and nano2 with pre determined isotopic values were also processed the same way as the samples to check on the efficiency of the analytical procedure and the accuracy of the isotopic values the δ15n of the inorganic fertiliser in solid form was dried and pulverised before being analysed on a hydra 20 22 cf irms coupled to an elemental analyser sercon ltd uk the precision of the δ15n was 0 2 source contributions to creek waters were estimated only for sites 1 2 and control due to the proximity to the source we used the stable isotope mixing model simmr parnell and inger 2020 in r studio updated from the original siar code parnell et al 2010 to estimate source no3 n contributions to the creek during the dry first flush and second flush hydrological periods using a gaussian likelihood bayesian statistical framework this analysis method has been evolving since the original 2010 code and simmr is used in various recent isotope studies crespo et al 2020a 2020b sánchez murillo et al 2020 we combined the endmembers of liquid and dry fertilisers as well as the greywater samples using the combine sources function within simmr to estimate the total contribution of fertilisers and greywater to the creek we also use rainfall isotope values from wong et al 2015 within the model framework concentration dependence and trophic enrichment factors were zeroed similar to gokool et al 2018 the markov chain monte carlo mcmc function in simmr creates 100 000 pseudoreplicates and discards the first 10 000 a gelman rubin diagnostic tests model convergence within mcmc and analyses differences between multiple markov chains all gelman rubin values were equal to 1 indicating good model convergence 2 4 hydrology and data analysis a global water company flow probe was used to determine water velocity at each sampling site using the average function within the probe and measuring the flow across the horizontal flow area horizontal surface area of the creek was calculated using the trapezoidal method by acquiring manual measurements of depth and length across the creek discharge was calculated as surface area multiplied by velocity data from the australian landscape water balance model australian bureau of meteorology 2018 was used to obtain root zone soil moisture a rain gauge was installed at site 3 and recorded at each time series discrete sample interval the nitrogen load flux per area per time was calculated using the equation f c m q a where f is the flux of nutrients kg ha day 1 c is the concentration of nutrient µm m is the molecular weight of the element g mol 1 q is discharge m3 day 1 and a is catchment area ha unit conversions were used where appropriate data summaries in tables are means standard error unless otherwise noted fertiliser loss was calculated as our assumed recommended fertiliser use kg ha yr 1 divided by the mean creek flux of no3 n standardised for land use percentage in the catchments we classified the area of catchments upstream of each of the sites using the upper limits of 1 m interval contour data creating a polygon of the catchment in environmental systems research institute esri arcgis mapping software geoscience australia 2015 catchment land uses were classified using aerial imagery and field scouting enabling percent land use calculation of each sub catchment based on december 2018 imagery google earth pro 2018 land and property information nsw 2017 land uses catchment are reported in table 1 3 results 3 1 nitrate time series our observations covered a dry summer with 244 mm of accumulated rainfall during the 91 days of observations two rain events 30 mm in a day significantly altered the flow regime and created spikes of discharge fig 2 the time series dataset was classified into three hydrological stages 1 dry period with 30 mm rain per day 7th january to 29th march 2019 2 first flush the first rain event 30 mm in a day after the dry period 30th march to 1st april 2019 and 3 secondary flush a larger second rain event 30 mm in a day 2nd april to 8th april 2019 we observed a clear shift in no3 n and water flow and soil moisture between these three hydrological events table 2 mean no3 n concentrations at the time series site were 50 74 and 137 fold higher than the australian and new zealand water quality guidelines anzecc during dry first flush and secondary flush periods respectively anzecc 2000 the guideline for lowland streams in slightly disturbed regional catchments is 2 85 µm during the time series the minimum recorded no3 n concentration was 106 µm and the maximum was 485 µm 3 2 spatial surveys the fourteen spatial surveys imply significant attenuation of no3 n concentrations fig 3 and loads fig 4 along the creek transect the most upstream site 1 was located immediately downstream of a hothouse protected cropping growing tomatoes concentrations of no3 n were extremely high reaching 27 198 µm the lowest site 1 concentrations were observed before the tomato hothouse had begun crop growing operations no3 n concentrations decreased exponentially at the downstream sites averaging 49 µm at the most downstream site 5 table 3 there was one sample at site 5 that was below the acceptable anzecc concentrations all other samples from sites 1 5 exceeded the guidelines anzecc 2000 during the second flush survey no3 n concentrations were highest with a maximum of 315 µm at site 5 creating a pulse of extremely high no3 n loads past site 5 and potentially 500 m downstream into the habitat protected estuary comparisons were made between site 2 and the control site to determine if the control site influenced the no3 n loads flowing to the main creek transect the land use was comparable in the catchments draining to site 2 and the control site fig 1 as a result the catchment area weighted no3 n loads at the control site were comparable to site 2 either in all spatial campaigns t 26 0 61 p 0 54 or when data was classified into dry t 16 0 23 p 0 18 first flush t 2 0 44 p 0 69 and second flush t 4 1 11 p 0 32 therefore the two sites make a similar contribution to no3 n at the sites downstream supporting our approach of using sites 1 5 as a one dimensional continuous segment to interpret natural creek attenuation see below 3 3 stable isotope observations farms in the catchment receive recycled greywater from the local sewage treatment plants delivering 2400 m3 d 1 to the catchment or 2176 kg no3 n yr 1 two samples collected from the greywater supply system had no3 n concentrations of 229 and 126 µm with high δ15n no3 21 9 and 20 9 table 4 these concentrations are 10 times lower than creek concentrations at site 1 and within a similar range of samples at site 2 table 5 hence greywater cannot be the dominant contributor to creek no3 n at site 1 but may be relevant at site 2 discussions with farmers indicate that they are filling dams with greywater pumping that water through fertigation systems where additional fertilisers are added then applying the mixed water to crops six samples of nitrogen fertilisers were obtained from a local agricultural supplier capturing sources of nitrogen that are recommended by agronomists to farmers fertilisers were light in δ15n ranging from 8 0 to 0 1 these fertiliser δ15n no3 values are within the range of those reported elsewhere in the literature bateman and kelly 2007 consistent with the change in no3 n loads isotopes samples from both time series and spatial surveys also varied according to different hydrological conditions in general the creek δ15n no3 observations plot between the greywater and the fertiliser endmembers implying a mixed source fig 5 the time series δ15n no3 values in the stream during the dry period were relatively higher than first flush and second flush a similar pattern was observed for the spatial survey except for the samples with the highest no3 n concentrations the lowest δ15n no3 2 more enriched than inorganic fertiliser was observed at the most upstream site consistent with the highest no3 n concentrations the highest δ15n no3 was observed at the most downstream site during the dry period δ18o no3 ranged between 5 and 30 a positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 was observed for the time series no3 n fig 5b but not was apparent on the spatial samples fig 5a 4 discussion 4 1 aquatic nitrogen loads versus catchment inputs we estimated no3 n loss rates by comparing bottom up estimates of nitrogen sources to the catchment and our calculated aquatic no3 n loads the application of fertiliser across all industries blueberries tomatoes cucumbers and bananas and the specific amount of applied fertiliser by local farmers are poorly understood we estimate that the catchment receives 15 877 kg n yr 1 delivered as fertiliser based on the following assumptions 1 farmers apply 100 kg n ha yr 1 to bananas newley et al 2008 and 121 kg n ha yr 1 to blueberries doughty et al 1988 ireland and wilk 2006 2 hothouses produce between two and four crops per year inferring cucumbers would require 2859 kg n ha yr 1 grewal et al 2011 and tomatoes 1200 kg n ha yr 1 tei et al 2002 based on three crops per year as the hothouse crop was not known at all sites we make the conservative assumption that all farmers using hothouses are growing the higher nitrogen crop cucumbers 3 the greywater system delivers 2812 kg n yr 1 to the catchment based on our greywater sample concentrations and an average of 2400 m3 d 1 of greywater and 4 rainfall delivers 1115 kg n yr 1 to the catchment angus and grace 2017 combined these external nitrogen sources add up to 1678 kg n yr 1 and 19 805 kg n yr 1 across the smaller catchment upstream of site 1 and the larger catchment upstream of site 5 respectively our observed aquatic nitrogen fluxes calculated as the mean no3 n load at each site multiplied by the site catchment area ranged from 2284 kg no3 n yr 1 at site 1 to 1350 kg no3 n yr 1 at site 5 therefore we estimate that 136 74 18 17 7 and 68 of the nitrogen inputs in the catchment are reaching the creek at sites 1 2 3 4 5 and control respectively table 3 these values of no3 n losses exceeding 100 nitrogen input loss are presumably impossible implying that one or more of our assumptions may be wrong possible explanations for aquatic losses exceeding 100 of inputs include 1 the real fertiliser application rate on the farms in the catchments of sites 1 2 and control may be far higher than our assumed fertilisation rates and those recommended by the industry peak body yadav et al 1997 there is no available data on the amount or timing of fertilisers applied before and during our observations therefore we had to rely on the assumption that farmers are fertilising their crops in adherence with industry recommendations due to the natural cycling of nitrogen and the role soil bacteria plays in transformations it is not possible to achieve 100 plant uptake of applied fertiliser between 20 and 80 of fertilisers are either lost to local waterways or stored in soils where nitrogen can leach out for decades bindraban et al 2015 sebilo et al 2013 2 significant no3 n leaching may be occurring from overlooked land uses or sources including septic systems gerritse et al 1995 or soil storages of nitrogen from historical fertiliser application sebilo et al 2013 we have no data on septic systems or legacy soil nitrogen in this catchment though the land use is clearly dominated by horticultural activities the soils in the catchment have been recently disturbed 20 years historically the earlier banana plantations required less nitrogen than the recent blueberry industry it is difficult to conceive that legacy aquatic nitrogen fluxes are exceeding expected annual fertilisation rates for 20 years after banana plantations were replaced by more intensive blueberry horticulture 3 our 91 days of observations of creek water quality may not be representative of long term nitrogen loss indeed the summer of 2019 was quite dry with 100 mm of rain between day 1 and day 68 the annual long term rainfall mean is 1685 mm per year with 60 of rain events occurring between january and may department of land and water conservation 2001 our observations occurred in a particularly dry period where only 244 mm of rain fell between january and april which is equivalent to 25 of the expected historical rainfall for those 91 days it would be reasonable to expect that the lower rainfall drove lower than average no3 n concentrations and loads during our observations therefore our observations are likely at the low end of the long term annual average loads 4 2 stable isotope assessment of sources and transformation of no3 n the creek isotope data revealed a complex pattern of both mixing and transformation through nitrification and denitrification adding rainfall isotope data from wong et al 2015 all the δ15n no3 signatures lay between greywater rainfall and the inorganic fertiliser samples fig 6 suggesting a mixing of these end members as the origin of the creek no3 n the very high no3 n concentrations suggest minimal attenuation of no3 n at the three most upstream sites using the simmr package in r studio parnell and inger 2020 greywater was the dominant source 53 9 7 3 of no3 n in the creek during the dry period whilst rainfall and fertiliser contributed 23 4 3 6 and 22 7 7 3 respectively fig 7 during the first and second flush periods respectively greywater contributed 51 6 9 9 and 60 0 5 8 fertiliser contributed 27 4 11 7 and 35 3 5 4 and rainfall contributed 21 0 7 8 and 4 7 2 0 grouping the three hydrological periods together gave overall no3 n contributions to the creek of 28 9 4 6 55 3 3 6 and 15 7 3 1 for fertiliser greywater and rainfall respectively we can compare these estimates to a bottom up mass balance approach in which the source contributions are added up we analysed five rainfall samples in the catchment 0 1 0 04 mg no3 n l 1 and used mean annual rainfall to estimate that rainfall contributes 1115 kg n yr 1 to the catchment fertilisers are expected to deliver 15 877 kg n yr 1 to the catchment if recommended doses are used and greywater 2812 kg n yr 1 if our mean greywater sample concentrations and an estimate of 2400 m3 d 1 of greywater is representative of the annual cycle animal manure is assumed to be negligible due to minimal presence of livestock in the region adding up these known sources implies that greywater would account for about 20 of the total nitrogen load at site 1 considering fertiliser removal by vegetation and loss within soils the stable isotope and the mass balance estimate provide reasonable estimates of source contributions in addition to source mixing and possible inputs of greywater along the creek there were indications of transformation processes along the creek evidence for denitrification comes from the progressive increase in δ15n no3 along the creek from site 1 to site 5 as well as a significant positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 r2 0 862 p 0 001 for the time series no3 n data granger and wankel 2016 zhang et al 2019 we observed distinct patterns that depend on the prevailing hydrology and rainfall liu et al 2017 paredes et al 2020 venkiteswaran et al 2017 high δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values during low flow persisted δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values tended to decrease progressively during the first and second flushes this change in the isotopic signature is consistent with increased nitrogen processing along the soil groundwater stream continuum at longer residence times dry and minimal transformation after extended high flow second flush during the second flush a residual amount of denitrified assimilated inorganic fertiliser appears to be the most probable source of no3 n to the creek the low δ18o no3 of the second flush compared to the liquid fertiliser and no3 n signature at site 1 can be attributed to nitrification of ammonium and urea based fertilisers which typically results in a δ18o no3 of 0 in freshwater systems mixing with rainwater and greywater boshers et al 2019 wong et al 2018 for the stream transects a complex coupling of hydrological biogeochemical effects was observed for example in addition to denitrification possible greywater inputs rainfall and source mixing a freshly nitrified ammonium fertiliser signal was also apparent at site 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by about 12 to 15 compared to liquid no3 n fertiliser indicating denitrification as this no3 n moves from the source into the creek fig 5 at site 2 there was generally an increase in δ15n no3 associated with a substantial drop in the δ18o no3 ruling out denitrification alone we speculate that mixing of the upstream water with a very low δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 nitrate derived from nitrification of ammonium fertiliser greywater and some denitrification drove the elevated δ18o no3 at site 2 during the first and second flush as water moves downstream there is generally an enrichment trend in both δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 consistent with denitrification however during the dry period there is no enrichment of δ18o no3 though enrichment of δ15n no3 continues down the flow path suggesting a combination of denitrification mixing with external fresh greywater inputs and nitrified ammonium driving no3 n in the creek during this period previous studies have modelled the amount of denitrification taking place in streams using rayleigh distillation models paredes et al 2020 however the complex mixing outlined above and the potentially variable isotopic fractionation factors prevent the application of such a model in this study the significant interaction between hydrology and denitrification suggests that hydrological effects warrant an important consideration when using stable isotopes to assess sources and fate of nitrogen denitrification often occurs in anaerobic or anoxic soils riparian zones and saturated sediments bange 2006 statham 2012 the extent of denitrification depends on local conditions which include residence time availability of no3 n microbial community composition dissolved oxygen temperature ph and organic material availability hydrology will alter these parameters at a local scale and in turn control the spatio temporal variations of denitrification rates hefting et al 2003 walker et al 2002 fig 5 thus highlights a need to further investigate the interplay between hydrology and the factors controlling denitrification and the attenuation efficiency of no3 n 4 3 creek nitrogen loads and attenuation a large range in nitrogen loads along our creek transect over both space and time were driven by hydrology soil moisture and distance along the creek transect there was a significant positive relationship between root zone soil moisture and no3 n concentrations with an inflexion of the curve at 55 soil moisture fig 8 this relationship suggests that nitrogen stored in catchment soils was flushed during rain events after soils became saturated van meter et al 2016 and that soils may be storing high loads of n to release it via overland runoff when soil saturation reaches a critical point we suggest that the critical tipping point where soils switch from storage to release is 55 root zone water saturation figs 8 and 9 no3 n is highly soluble in water therefore with higher soil saturation the higher the probability of no3 n leaching either via overland runoff or groundwater seepage puckett 1994 santos et al 2013 in the dry period flows increased steadily along the creek while no3 n concentrations and loads decreased with increasing distance from the upper catchment where most of the intensive horticulture land use occurs fig 1 a phase shift i e a change from attenuation to transport occurred after the first flush on day 64 when rainfall increased no3 n loads and concentrations at downstream sites high rainfall reduces the ability of riparian denitrification due to shorter water residence times konohira et al 2001 here we also observed reduced attenuation of no3 n during high flow events increasing catchment degradation can shift waterways from efficient denitrification to a flow through system where nitrogen is inefficiently denitrified flushed and delivered to the ocean wells and eyre 2018 these hypotheses can be combined with meyer and likens 1979 suggestion of nutrient cycling in low flows and nutrient throughput in high flows headwater streams draining high fertilised land and subsequently high soil nitrogen storages may therefore phase shift between two nutrient processing modes 1 nutrient attenuation during low flows when longer residence times allow for denitrification and reduction of aquatic no3 n in riparian and in stream sediments and 2 a high flow throughput similar to a one directional pipe when short residence times circumvent nitrogen cycling instream and transport most of the no3 n load to downstream receiving waters until the first flush hydrological conditions remained relatively constant throughout the catchment loads at site 5 were 0 2 0 5 and 9 7 of loads at site 1 even though water flux increased by 98 5 99 6 and 71 1 during dry first flush and second flush respectively both dilution and denitrification can occur along the creek transect by using creek loads rather than concentrations in attenuation calculations we account for potential dilution we used the log linear decay rate constant to estimate the attenuation rate ensign et al 2006 this method allows estimation of the no3 n removal from the water column without resolving specific biogeochemical processes such as denitrification or plant uptake duff et al 2008 peterson et al 2001 this approach assumes a log linear decay of the solute load from site 1 and no external inputs consistent with general trends in our data fig 3 we estimate that during the dry period this transect of double crossing creek has the capacity to remove 83 9 r2 0 956 p 0 001 of the no3 n load at site 1 per km of the creek during the first flush the creek attenuated 81 3 per km r2 0 934 p 0 001 whilst during the second flush this attenuation capacity dropped further to 52 2 per km r2 0 944 p 0 001 this implies that the creek provides a valuable ecosystem service during dry and first flush events removing much of the no3 n load however the ability of the creek to attenuate is compromised when soil moisture flow and nutrient loads increase during a second flush event knowledge of longer term soil nitrogen storage has increased from over 2000 sites in north america van meter et al 2016 found soil storage in agricultural landscapes to be between 25 and 70 kg n ha 1 it was once believed that the denitrification in agricultural soils would remove nitrogen soil stocks however the storage of soil nitrogen may be linked to long term flushing during rain events when soil moisture reaches a critical point frei et al 2020 worrall et al 2015 we found no significant correlations between no3 n attenuation and discharge or no3 n attenuation and accumulated rainfall in the 3 days prior to sampling creek discharge and rainfall may be linked to soil moisture but the disparity in the temporal resolution of discharge rainfall and soil moisture data prevent a detailed analysis a significant inverse relationship exists between no3 n attenuation and dissolved oxygen r2 0 553 p 0 05 this correlation likely indicates the reduction of denitrification in high flow periods due to shorter residence times and increased gaseous exchange in the water column inhibiting anaerobic conditions in the riparian zone konohira et al 2001 while the effects of hydrology on in stream processes are also relevant for temperate systems forshay and stanley 2005 the potential of in stream attenuation in temperate freshwater systems is comparatively lower than in subtropical tropical zones for instance a maximum in stream no3 n removal of 20 50 was observed in a first order stream of an agricultural headwater catchment in germany schuetz et al 2016 whilst a median of 16 no3 n removal by denitrification was estimated for 49 streams 18 5 0 48 c in the usa denitrification rates were highly variable from 0 5 to 100 dominantly controlled by specific discharge and no3 n concentration mulholland et al 2009 the relatively lower no3 n removal in temperate compared to tropical subtropical systems i e our study site can be explained by the relatively lower temperature and solar radiation limiting denitrification and primary productivity in cooler temperate systems fellows et al 2006 the creek temperature 19 to 25 2 c was higher than those observed in temperate waterways in the northern hemisphere and likely drove higher denitrification rates sand jensen et al 2007 the ability of a waterway in attenuating no3 n is also a function of stream size and residence times smaller streams with higher surface area to volume ratios can have greater interactions between surface waters and the hyporheic zones enabling a longer residence time greater bioreactive surface area and higher denitrification capacity alexander et al 2000 2007 the creek depth 11 8 0 3 cm and width 41 0 2 75 cm at the time series site indicate a high bioreactive surface area and opportunity for hyporheic exchange briggs et al 2013 peralta maraver et al 2018 during the dry period surface flows in parts of the transect were observed to cease and reappear up to 30 m downstream indicating a strong relationship between surface and hyporheic flows longer streams can often remove more no3 n within the network as loading rates increase at the reach scale total in stream no3 n removal can be responsible for only 2 10 no3 n loss but this can range from 10 to 70 when entire river networks including small first and second order streams are considered dupas et al 2013 hensley et al 2015 schuetz et al 2016 5 conclusions we revealed effective nitrogen attenuation of large anthropogenic nitrogen loads in a subtropical creek a clear shift in no3 n and flow was noted between the three hydrological events with greater loads and concentrations during wet conditions a significant relationship between root zone soil moisture and creek no3 n concentrations indicated that soil stored nitrogen was flushed when soil moisture exceeded 55 saturation stable isotopes δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 suggest that no3 n in the upper creek water originates from a mixture of rainfall 16 fertilisers 29 and greywater 55 these major sources produce creek no3 n loads exceeding the bottom up estimates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to this catchment implying that our assumptions of nitrogen inputs from fertilisers or other sources are underestimated for the majority of the study duration the creek was an effective natural bioreactor attenuating a large fraction of anthropogenic loads in specific hydrological conditions during the dry period the creek removed 84 of the initial no3 n load per km during the first flush the creek attenuated 81 whilst during the second flush this attenuation capacity dropped to 52 per km the ability to attenuate was reduced when soil moisture flow and nutrient loads increased during periods of high flow and saturated soils high loads of no3 n are exported downstream essentially shifting the creek from a natural bioreactor to a theoretical flow through pipe this suggests that nitrogen management during high flow events should be a priority although the creek provides a valuable ecosystem service by naturally reducing no3 n there are still significant loads of no3 n well above expected for natural systems our results highlight the need for modification of fertiliser and greywater use as well as capturing anthropogenic nitrogen at the source before it is lost to creeks and

4489,water resources play an important role in many aspects of our daily lives e g industrial food processing irrigation and hydropower generation etc the natural flow regime and water availability were studied across canada using 167 catchments from the water survey of canada dataset reference hydrometric basin network rhbn we established a systematic analysis of water availability annual and monthly runoff to determine both the quantity and distribution of water within the year in each province we investigated the severity of low flow conditions namely the magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows there are prominent disparities in water availability at the annual and monthly time scales across canada the annual runoff characteristics showed a relatively abundant quantities of water on the east and west coasts 800 2300 mm year annual runoff is critically low 150 mm year in the prairies and northern territories monthly analyses revealed eminent differences in the timing and magnitude of high and low flows the spring snowmelt is the main trigger of high flows in most provinces however the quantities of water during freshet period varied dramatically across provinces british columbia showed among the highest hydrological variability where some catchments showed relatively high flows year around in canada a second high flow period was observed in some provinces e g quebec ontario and the maritimes the underpinning hydrological processes and the precipitation regime are discussed to explain the regional hydrologic disparities the monthly flow of the 80th percentile q80 monthly flow duration curve was used as the cutoff to describe low flows both in terms of magnitude and duration the q80 variability across canadian rivers was significantly large 0 3 100 mm month many regions have one period of extreme low flows except in newfoundland new brunswick british columbia ontario quebec and saskatchewan where 2 seasons of low flows can be observed in newfoundland and new brunswick the low flow period was the shortest 2 6 months in contrast in the prairies and north territories the low flow period extended between 3 4 and 4 months we further explained the disparities in water availability and low flows from analysis of the daily flow duration curve fdc we quantified the differences in the flow response from flow indices calculated from fdc baseflow index low flow index and slope of the fdc the results of water availability and low flows have important socio economic impacts on water supply reservoir operations and far reaching implications on the health of aquatic habitats 1 introduction freshwater supplies is a common concern in canada and worldwide there is a need to assess water availability to secure freshwater sustainability koshida et al 2015 definitions of water availability vary with disciplines and applications available water can be viewed as the runoff discharge in rivers as a result of precipitation rainfall and snowfall in excess of evaporation transpiration and soil infiltration moreland 1993 in other words this is the amount of water one can measure during any period of the year low flow analysis in this paper are part of the water availability investigations and determines the amounts of water available during low flow and dry seasons most of the studies conducted in canada to assess water availability focused on indicators of surface water availability mortsch et al 2015 these indicators are of three categories water demand supply based climate based and hydrology based indicators koshida et al 2015 the water demand supply indicators often compares volumes of water in rivers with amounts of water used by the several sectors koshida et al 2015 the climate based indicators mostly inform about the drought and precipitation frequencies the indicators are based on a water balance approach that uses the monthly or weekly difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration to examine wet and dry periods over different time scales among the indicators is the palmer drought severity index pdsi which has been analyzed in the drought prone regions of the prairies bonsal et al 2013 the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei was used by dibike et al 2017 and tam et al 2019 to study future changes of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration in nine rivers from western canada the same indicator spei was used to characterize drought in india bisht et al 2019 more recent studies in canada interested in studying historical and future trends of drought using the climate based indicators e g spei and pdsi bonsal and cuell 2017 asong et al 2019 the main challenges of the climate based approach are the uncertainty in precipitation and evapotranspiration also the uncertainty in the global climate models gcms and in the forcing scenarios lead to uncertainty in future projections dibike et al 2017 these indicators remain primarily useful for drought assessment however they do not answer questions about changes in runoff quantities in rivers the hydrology based indicators interest in quantifying runoff in rivers annual maximum daily mean streamflow monk et al 2012 burn et al 2010 cohen et al 2015 and average summer flows brabets and walvrood 2009 are among the hydrology based indicators that have been used in canada the literature pointed to over 300 freshwater related indicators that are used in canada dunn and bakker 2011 the study by dunn and bakker 2011 underlined that 50 indicators were used for surface water assessment and over 100 indicators were used for water quality and quantity however the large number of indicators and their diversity lead to redundancies and most often to a lack of consistency between the provinces the lack of consistency does not help in comparing assessing water potentials across the country other gaps are related to the narrowness of indicators i e more emphasis on water quality than quantity and data issues data availability that limit their usages across the provinces dunn and bakker 2011 therefore there is a need to develop methods that assess and compare water potentials at the national scale evidently these assessment tools should be of utility to the decision makers other studies across canada analyzed trends of hydro meteorological variables e g mekis and vincent 2011 tremblay et al 2011 for instance mekis and vincent 2011 analyzed future changes in precipitation across canada whereas tremblay et al 2011 investigated trends in groundwater levels cohen et al 2015a is among the few regional studies that undertook a canada wide analysis using 24 hydrometric stations to compare water potentials and streamflow however only the positive and negative trends of few streamflow predictions i e the annual runoff the winter summer runoff and snowmelt were revealed uncertainties due to differences between climate scenarios generating models and hydrologic models i e hydrologic model structure uncertainty in evapotranspiration and snowmelt simulations are among the challenges of the study by cohen et al 2015a recent studies from canada addressed some of these issues using data of individual catchments shrestha et al 2019 investigated the use of gcms in isolating the climate controls on future hydrologic changes i e flow forecasting in a subarctic river basin muhammad et al 2019 studied the impact of model structure on the accuracy of hydrological modeling in a prairie watershed the trend analysis studies have been very informative to forecast future changes of several hydro meteorological variables past studies of hydrology based water availability studies across canada revealed three major issues mainly i lack of comparability and consistency between indicators ii emphasis on the trend analysis of hydro meteorological variables and iii focus on the effect of climate controls on streamflow projections using on site studies an area that remains challenging provided the level of uncertainty it involves there is a need for a national study that investigates more closely runoff across canadian rivers decision makers are looking for comparative and comprehensive assessment of the current water potentials across the country mainly the differences in quantities and distribution of water within the year and between provinces water potentials assessment can also inform about periods of water shortages where it becomes more challenging to manage the water resources questions about low flows i e the magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows across provinces and within canada require further investigations most of the low flow studies in canada interested in applying methods of environmental flows to maintain viable conditions of the river water quantity and quality for fish and fish habitat e g ehsanzadeh and adamowski et al 2007 caissie et al 2015 berthot et al 2020 however more information about extreme low flow periods not necessarily equal to environmental flow levels their duration and magnitude remain unexplored at the national scale the flow duration curve fdc has been extensively used in hydrology to conduct studies about water quantity and quality and streamflow assessment etc e g vogel and fennessey 1995 the fdc informs on the flow magnitude as well as the percentage of time the flow is equaled or exceeded smakhtin 2001 chouaib et al 2018 therefore it shows the ability of the basin to provide flows of various magnitudes iacobellis 2008 the shape of the fdc depends on the relative contribution of climate precipitation and watershed characteristics e g storage outside the low flow season the water quantities flowing in a river constitute mainly the upper and the middle thirds of the fdc q30 and q30 to q60 respectively studies have shown that precipitation is governing the shapes of the fdc in the upper and middle thirds of the curve yokoo and sivapalan 2011 chouaib et al 2019 the lower portion of the fdc range of low flows is very important in terms of water availability during dry periods and is governed by basin storage characteristics evapotranspiraion topography geology basin storage and groundwater yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the current study focuses on developing a national framework that provides new insights about runoff disparities across canada the runoff analyses teases out differences at the annual and monthly time scales the study serves to overcome issues of lack of comparability and consistency in quantifying the water potentials across the provinces it also informs about periods duration and levels of severe water shortages in canadian rivers through the use of fdc indices the study proposes a comprehensive assessment of the disparities in water availability particularly during dry periods therefore the specific objectives of the present study are as follows i to analyze water availability using annual and monthly runoff to determine differences in quantities and inter annual variability ii to investigate low flow conditions and study differences in magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows and iii to use the shape measures of the flow duration curve fdc to explain disparities in streamflow and low flows across canada the paper marks an important step in advancing assessments of the water potentials across canada the proposed national framework can underpin future efforts aimed at detecting the change in water availability by studying the temporal variability of streamflow using historical data and future predictions also the regionalization efforts and prediction at ungauged catchments can be further advanced using the proposed framework among the limitations of the current national study is the small number of functional hydrometric stations in remote areas such as the northern territories 2 methods 2 1 dataset and study catchments in canada the reference hydrometric basin network rhbn water survey of canada was developed to provide a network for monitoring long term changes and impacts of climate on water resources across the country monk et al 2012 the rhbn stations are characterized by good quality data and natural flow with stationary land use conditions burn and whitfield 2016 the rhbn database can be found through the following link https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity monitoring survey data products services reference hydrometric basin network html in the present study two data sources were used 160 stations from the rhbn database and 7 stations having natural flows from the water survey of canada archive to supplement areas with a low number of stations we first selected 200 stations and then retained 167 stations based on specific selection criteria these exclusion criteria were catchments in the higher latitudes with long periods of zero flows ephemeral streams and catchments with excessive discontinuities in records for many years incomplete years of records most catchments with discontinuous data were located in the southern part of the prairie provinces manitoba saskatchewan and parts of alberta and in northern territories the limited number of hydrometric stations with continuous data in the remote areas accounts as one of the limitations of the proposed study we noted that some streams had zero flows for most of the year during long periods of cold winters or during dry summers ephemeral and intermittent streams these stations were also eliminated from the original database table 1 shows the number of selected catchments in each province as well as the acronym used for each province and territory british columbia has the largest number of sites 39 stations whereas nunavut yukon and prince edwards island have the smallest number of stations 4 3 and 2 sites respectively the study catchments and their locations are shown in figure 1 the record length distribution is normal the median is equal to the mean 50 years and the 25th and 75th percentiles are 39 and 59 years respectively the longest records are in bc on the east coast nl ns and nb in southern qc and in southern on record years are between 30 and 108 years the province of bc has the highest record length between 50 and 80 years in this study 7 catchments have flow records 100 years located in ns southern on and one catchment in ab shorter record lengths 50 years are found in the prairies ab sk mb and within northern territories nt yt nu note that a few catchments in light blue figure 1 have record lengths between 51 and 60 years one catchment in the qc north shore has a record length equal to 8 years highlighted in grey in the map this catchment was selected to better cover the region of quebec the study catchment areas show a large variability figure 2 smaller catchments are located in pe 37 km2 147 km2 in ns 92 2 km2 1350 km2 and in nb 130 km2 4700 km2 figure 2a in bc ab and qc there is a strong variability with a few catchment being larger than others in bc the drainage area ranges between 88 km2 and 20 300 km2 in ab the range is between 248 km2 and 35 800 km2 whereas in qc drainage basins are between 642 km2 and 40 400 km2 the largest catchments are in the northern territories mb and sk median values exceed 7760 km2 with catchment as

availability in this study we analyzed differences in the amounts of surface water available annual monthly time scales and highlighted the spatial variability the timing and seasonality we calculated the mean annual runoff mar at each hydrometric station the mean monthly runoff mmr and we assessed the low flow conditions in each hydrometric station the low flow analysis aims at revealing and characterizing the most extreme and severe flow conditions in each river in figure 3 a flow chart is presented the flow chart summarizes the four main steps of the study 2 3 1 mean annual runoff mar step 1 this refers to step 1 in figure 3 the mean annual runoff determines the yearly average amount of water that flows in a river this indicator provides the total volume of water available in this study the mar is expressed in mm year which is a depth of water spread evenly across the entire drainage basin 2 3 2 mean monthly runoff mmr step 2 this refers to step 2 in figure 3 the mmr is calculated at each hydrometric station where the units are expressed as mm month the mmr teases out the variability and timing of high and low flow months within and across the provinces regional differences in mar and mmr are studied to better understand the underlying hydrological processes under different precipitation regimes across canada 2 3 3 low flow analysis use of monthly flow duration curve mfdc step 3 this refers to step 3 in figure 3 extreme low flows are critical periods of the year where water availability is generally compromised for various human activities and a general water quality degradation can be observed due to a lack of dilution capacities nemerow 1985 the low flow analysis in this study has different objectives from the approaches used to identify environmental flow levels environmental flow studies aims at determining levels of discharge to leave in rivers so that viable conditions are preserved for the fish and the ecosystem e g eslamian et al 2010 linnansaari et al 2012 caissie et al 2015 hatfield and paul 2015 jayasiri et al 2017 kuriqi et al 2019 berthot et al 2020 in this study the low flow characteristics are part of water availability analyses because it is during low flow periods that water availability will be most problematic as such it is important to have an overall assessment of water availability across canada spatial differences but equally important to know when are the periods of the year where water availability is problematic temporal differences within the spatial differences across the provinces the analysis points to reveal the flow levels and the periods of the year during which streams are having acute decline in streamflow our approach in identifying conditions of low flows is based on the mmr for each station the mmr time series a value for each month i e 12 mean monthly averages are used to determine the monthly flow duration curve at each station mfdc see section 2 4 2 for more about the fdc low values of the mmr are extracted i e the lower tail of the mfdc the quantiles q90 q80 and q70 were calculated from the mfdc among the three quantiles a cutoff value was selected that best described low flow conditions in terms of magnitude seasonality and duration among the q90 q80 and q70 the q90 led to only one low flow month in most study catchments whereas the q70 was too high to designate low flow periods as such the q80 was selected because it provided more than one month of low flows and captured both winter and summer low flow periods therefore the q80 will be used as the threshold to identify the magnitude duration and seasonality of low flows for each station the value of the q80 threshold is specific to each hydrometric station the duration of low flows was determined based on a binary matrix table 2 each row in the matrix depicts the seasonality of low flow for each catchment filling the matrix row by row a value of 1 was given for each month where the flow was lower or equal to q80 the values in each column are summed up the percentage obtained represents the number of catchments with flows q80 in each specific month see each month column table 2 note that for each month this percentage may vary between 0 and 100 for example in january 42 8 19 of the total study catchments in on have flows q80 q80 is a threshold value of the flow that is specific to each catchment the catchments that represent the 42 are 02aa001 02ab008 04da001 04jc002 04ka001 04lj001 04mf001 and 05pb014 in february the percentage of catchments with flows q80 increased to 74 14 19 the percentages obtained for the 12 months allow to draw the pattern of seasonality of severe low flows in each province last row in table 2 the matrix specifies which months of the year experience conditions of low flow the duration of low flows is equal to the sum of low flow months within each row of the matrix summing the ones in sum per catchment column table 2 the average duration of low flow months average table 2 was then calculated for each province for on 2 895 months in each province there was an assessment of whether the months of severe low flows occurred predominantly in summer in winter or during both seasons 2 3 4 indices of daily flow duration curve step 4 this refers to step 4 in figure 3 the daily flow duration curves fdcs were also analyzed the entire set of the daily flows was used for each catchment to construct the fdcs the daily fdcs were used to study the disparities in water availability and low flow conditions across canada the fdc in the upper tail percentiles 30th percentile and medium flow percentiles 33th percentile and 66th percentile was shown to be closely related to the shape of the precipitation duration curve e g yokoo and sivapalan 2011 cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2019 in other words the flow response in these magnitudes are mostly affected by the precipitation therefore the daily fdc metrics of this range mainly between 33th percentile and 66th percentile were used to further comprehend and examine the differences in the runoff response which is mostly affected by budgets of precipitation the lower portion of the fdc 60th percentile illustrates the flows observed during dry periods this portion is governed by basin storage characteristics evapotranspiraion topography geology basin storage and groundwater yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the fdc metrics of the lower tail 60th percentile were used to explain the disparities in water availability during low flow periods so in this manuscript the fdc helps to qualitatively relate the disparities in water availability either in terms of average through time or lower flow magnitudes to an understanding of the catchment response that changes with the range of the flow percentiles three fdc indices of flow were calculated at each station 1 the slope of the fdc sfdc 2 the baseflow index bfi and 3 the low flow index lfi figure 4 illustrates the flow percentiles needed to calculate each index 2 3 4 1 the slope of the flow duration curve sfdc the fdc is a cumulative distribution function whose properties are used to determine the proportion of water available alaouze 1991 the slope of the fdc sfdc is a surrogate of flow variability in time sawicz et al 2011 the relatively linear part of the fdc when plotted on a log scale is the portion of the curve falling between the 33rd and 66th percentile the slope of the fdc informs on how fast the basin responses i e the decrease of flow magnitudes with increasing probability of exceedance chouaib et al 2018 the slope of the fdc can be calculated using the following semi log equation sawicz et al 2011 chouaib et al 2018 the sfdc formulation is as follows 1 s f d c ln q 33 l n q 66 0 66 0 33 where q33 the flow with 33rd percentile q66 the flow with 66th percentile 2 3 4 2 the baseflow index bfi the ratio of q90 flow exceeded 90 of the time to q50 flow exceeded 50 of the time median flow is usually used to identify the groundwater storage contribution or other basin storages lakes or swamps to the median runoff al faraj and scholz 2014 caissie et al 2015 in other words this ratio represents the percentage of the baseflow component 2 b f i q 90 q 50 2 3 4 3 the low flow index lfi the ability of the fdc to describe the behavior in low flows was further explored using the low flow index lfi derived from the percentiles of the lower tail of the fdc e g burn et al 2008 lfi is calculated as follows 3 lfi m e a n q 90 q 75 q 50 where q90 q75 and q50 represent the flow value exceeded 90 75 and 50 of the time respectively the larger the lfi close to 1 the closer the mean q90 q75 is to q50 and therefore the flatter the fdc similar to the sfdc the lfi informs on the slope of the fdc particularly at the lower tail low flow range 3 results 3 1 mean annual runoff mar figure 5 shows the mean annual average of water available across canada using the studied hydrometric stations the regions that are most limited in water are the northern territories yt nt and nu and the prairie region mb sk and ab which have generally less than 400 mm year the mar showed intermediate values in on 200 400 mm year and interior bc 200 600 mm year the highest runoff areas of canada were observed in atlantic canada nl nb pei and ns and on the west coast coastal bc the mars

in mar compared to other provinces and territories in the prairies the mars were generally lower than 200 mm year figure 5 extremely low values of mar close to 40 mm year were observed in two catchments one catchment in mb and one in sk red triangles figure 5 the mars drop below 100 mm year in three catchments within the prairie region sk ab and in two catchments in nt see yellow triangles in figure 5 in the northern territories nt yt and nu the mars were generally between 100 mm year and 500 mm year with the exception of the abovementioned rivers in nt on showed values between 200 400

of water availability were studied within the year using mean monthly runoff values the highest monthly flows were observed in bc ab nl and qc maximum of 500 mm month in all other provinces the monthly flows were below 250 mm month figures 6 7 8 figure 6 shows the four provinces with similar monthly flow magnitudes less than 500 mm month and similar timing catchments in ab and bc generally showed similar timing of high flows from may to july most likely snowmelt generated figures 6a and 6b the maximum monthly flow was reached in june with a median value of 136 mm month bc and 117 mm month ab a peak value of 530 mm month was observed in bc june beyond the scale of figure 6a in bc and ab only one period of high flows was observed predominantly the spring high flow period the low flow period in both ab and bc was generally in winter december january and february bc showed higher variability and higher flows at a few sites the lowest values of the median mmrs were observed in february with median values of 6 37 mm month in ab and 14 9 mm month in bc nl and qc showed similar flow characteristics the onset of the high flow season was observed in april and peak flows were observed in may figures 6c and 7 d in nl the maximum median mmr was observed at 152 mm month may whereas qc showed maximum median mmr at 130 mm month may in nl and qc a second high flow season was observed in autumn september to december median mmrs 52 mm month in qc and median mmrs 96 mm month in nl january and february were low flow months the median mmrs 52 mm month in nl and median mmrs 15 mm month in qc figure 7 shows results for on ns nb and pe the highest mmrs for these provinces were observed in april and may in nb and on the maximum monthly flows occurred in april and may with similar monthly flows median mmrs 170mm month for nb and 63 mm month for on in nb a large variability in mmrs was observed during the periods of high flows note the inter quantile range and the whiskers figure 7c two stations had particularly high autumn flows in nb oct nov and dec figure 7c in ns and pe the largest monthly flows occurred in april with median mmrs close to 150 mm month both ns and pe observed relatively high flows in winter compared to on and nb median mmr in january 101 mm month ns 52 mm month pe 35 mm month nb and 17 mm month on nb ns and pe showed two high flow periods spring and autumn blue boxplots highlight a second peak in autumn figure 7 the highest mmr medians in ns and pe were observed in april 156 mm month in ns 138 mm month in pe among these provinces figure 7 ns showed the highest autumn flows with median mmrs between 107 mm month november and 121 mm month december in on ns nb and pe there are chiefly two periods of low flows the winter low flows january and february and the summer low flows july august and september figure 7 median winter low flows were generally between 12 17 mm month on and 25 35 mm month nb values were slightly higher in pe and ns between 41 52 mm month pe and 80 103 ns summer low flows were generally more severe than winter with median mmrs of 14 mm month on 26 mm month nb 19 mm month pe and 31 mm month ns

8b and 8c the highest median mmrs were 37 mm month in nt may 71 mm month in yt june and 30 mm month in nu july relatively high mmrs were observed from may to october in nt and yt nu sites showed highest mmrs from june to august with values generally less than 27 mm month in the prairies mb and sk showed similar mmrs to northern territories in both timing and magnitude however the highest flow month occurred earlier may with median mmrs 28 mm month mb and 17 mm month sk may figures 8d and 8e prairies mb and sk and northern territories nt yt and nu showed low flow months from november to

magnitude seasonality and duration the q80 monthly flow duration curve was set as a threshold to analyze low flows in each study catchment across canada results of this analysis are presented in figure 9 the q80 flow metrics showed less severe low flow conditions on the east and west coasts in coastal area of bc the q80 ranges between 50 mm month and 75 mm month on vancouver island two catchments showed relatively severe low flow conditions q80 15 mm month in interior bc low flows showed moderate low flow conditions 5 mm month q80 25 mm month on the east coast of canada the least severe low flow conditions were observed in nl 50 mm month q80 100 mm month moderate low flow conditions span over the region of qc nb and ns 10 mm month q80 50 mm month for higher latitudes in qc and nl low flow conditions were increasingly more severe with q80 10 mm month results showed that the most severe low flow conditions in canada were in on the prairies and the northern territories for instance many rivers in these regions showed q80 between 0 3 mm month and 15 mm month the threshold value of q80 revealed not only differences in the magnitude but also in the duration and seasonality of the low flow season in each province the seasons of severe low flows were revealed the number of low flow months flow q80 was determined using a binary matrix as shown in table 2 section 2 2 1 for brevity the matrices of all the provinces are not presented the example from on showed that in january 42 of the catchments had flows q80 in february the percentage increased to 74 then dropped to 53 in march table 2 in april and may the catchments with severe low flows represented only 11 in each month whereas june showed 0 flows were below q80 in july 26 august 47 and september 26 for some catchment october november and december were not low flow months 0 in each month table 2 notably in on severe low flows occurred in winter and summer however only 21 of the catchments 4 19 showed low flow conditions during both summer and winter this is the percentage reported on top of each plot in figures 10 and 11 i e 21 for on figure 10d in bc qc nl on most of the study catchments had low flow periods in either summer or winter months figure 10a 10b 10c 10e for instance in bc more than 60 of catchments showed monthly flows q80 in january february and march figure 10a the proportion of catchments with low flows q80 occurring in both summer and winter months in bc was 10 as such 90 of catchments showed extreme low flow months either in winter or in summer the predominant low flow season in bc was winter in qc the proportion of catchments with flows q80 and predominantly in winter was 89 february 83 of catchments and march 78 of catchments were the months with the most occurrence of catchments figure 10b in nl and on the proportion of catchments with two periods of low flows remained low at 18 and 10 respectively figures 10c and 10d in nb more than half of the catchments showed severe low flows occurring in both summer and winter 53 figure 10e and september was the month with the most occurrence of catchments 83 in ns and pe extreme low flows q80 were observed in summer only for all the study catchments figures 10f and 10g all stations in ns 100 showed flows q80 in july to september whereas all stations in pe showed flows q80 during august and september in sk 88 of the catchment showed 1 season winter however one catchment 1 7 14 showed extreme period of low flow starting from august and ending in december figure 11a for sk 86 of the station showed low flow conditions in february and march in mb ab and northern territories yt nu nt the low flow period occurred in winter 100 figures 11 for these areas many winter months showed 100 of the station having flows q80 as well table 3 presents the duration of low flows for each province and territory nl and nb showed the shortest low flow season at 2 62 months many provinces across canada on qc bc ab ns and pe showed a period of low flows of 2 9 3 months the longest low flow conditions were observed in the prairies mb and sk and the northern territories nt nu and yt in these regions the low flow season ranged from 3 4 months to 4 months table 3 3 4 flow duration curve fdc analysis as described in the method section the fdcs can provide valuable information related to water availability and low flow characteristics in canada particularly when studying differences in shapes of the fdcs upper middle and lower portion of the curve figure 4 different fdcs are presented to illustrate disparities in shapes using one station in on river lockchart station 07rd001 and one station in ab river waterton station 05ad003 figures 12 a ab and on are influenced mainly by the boreal climatic regime the two catchments are located at different latitudes which are subject to different hydrological regimes the q50 was equal to 4 3 l s km2 for river lockchart and 10 8 l s km2 for river waterton river lockchart on showed a flatter fdc with a lower sfdc of 12 compared to 20 for river waterton ab i e steeper slope the lfi for river lockchart was 0 73 compared to 0 14 for river waterton notably a lower lfi represents a steeper slope at the lower tail of the fdc mean of q75 and q90 divided by q50 river lockchart on showed a bfi of 0 65 compared to 0 38 river waterton ab where a higher bfi is synonym of q90 getting closer in value to q50 and a flatter fdc the fdc characteristics are presented in figures 12b 12c and 12d for all stations in provinces and territories the differences in the fdc shapes translate into different values of the shape measures slope of the fdc and indices bfi and lfi across the country the relationships between the slopes of the fdc sfdc the baseflow index bfi and the low flow index lfi showed statistically significant relations among indices table 4 the bfi vs lfi relationship was positively correlated and explained 96 of the variability r2 0 96 r 0 98 larger bfis reflect larger lfis the sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi relationships were negatively correlated and both statistically significant despite lower r2 values 0 06 and 0 10 respectively despite the large variability the sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi relationships stated that the larger the bfi the smaller is the sfdc and the larger is the lfi the increase in the storage conditions bfi increases of the catchments makes the fdcs flatter sfdc decreases and the low flow less severe lfi increases 4 discussion water resources are fundamental to the national economic well being of canada many human uses require fresh water including agricultural industrial household recreational and environmental activities in the current study 167 canadian rivers were used to analyze the water availability at the annual and monthly time scales the water potentials across the country were assessed with the consideration of magnitudes seasonality and timing of high low flows a low flow analysis was carried out to answer questions about the severity of the low flows in different regions of the country the shape measures of the fdc were quantified to explore differences in water availability and low flow conditions across canada 4 1 mean annual runoff precipitation is a significant hydro climatological variable that affects the natural environment wan et al 2005 the precipitation regime rain versus snow and magnitudes in terms of mean annual precipitation map are heavily affected by the climate conditions and both play a major role in the runoff response precipitation varies widely throughout the climate regions of canada atlas of canada 1957 there are prominent disparities in water availability across canada that may be explained using the map the largest water potentials are found in the east and the west coasts of the country particularly in the provinces of bc nl ns nb and pe 600 mm year mar 2270 mm year on the west coast map can reach 2540 mm year and it may be as high as 5000 mm on the southwest coast in bc alila 1999 atlas of canada 1957 disturbances from moist pacific air as a result of westerly winds are the main mechanism behind precipitation in the western wet area of canada this area of high precipitation explains higher mars in the region on the east coast the map can reach 1250 mm year these values are observed in the laurentians and hilly parts of the atlantic provinces alila 1999 atlas of canada 1957 the main reason for these amounts of precipitation is moisture from the atlantic and the gulf of mexico via the united states midwest alila 1999 these mechanisms explain relatively high mars on the east coast in the wet regions of canada east and west coasts our results underlined i large variability of mar across bc and ii large water potentials in ns and nl compared to the rest of the atlantic provinces bc is a province ruled by two climatic zones pacific and cordillera and is subject to influences from the rocky mountains in interior regions alila 1999 eaton and moore 2010 schwörer et al 2017 the pacific influence explains the large water potentials on the coasts of bc figure 5 some regions of interior bc also experienced high mars 800 mm year 1500 mm year this region is the west facing slopes of the rocky mountains which receives relatively high precipitation 1016 mm year map 1524 mm year atlas of canada 1957 the east facing region of the rocky mountains experiences lower amount of precipitation and correspondingly lower mars 200 mm year 600 mm year the dryness of this region is most likely caused by the rain shadow effect which is less precipitation falling on the lee side of a mountain range eaton and moore 2010 alila 1999 in between the west facing region of the rocky mountains and the pacific coast there was a strong variability in mars pink boundary figure 5 this region encounters low and variable rainfall map not exceeding 457 mm year due to orographic influences and the western cordilleran ranges atlas of canada 1957 there were two catchments in this region stellako river 08jb002 and big creek 08mb006 with severely low mars mar 180 mm year see white highlights in figure 5 which can be explained by the limited amounts of precipitation map ranges between 300 and 400 mm year atlas of canada 1957 in the atlantic region higher mars in nl with similar precipitation as the maritime provinces nb ns and pe 1100 mm year map 1400 mm year suggests higher runoff coefficients in this province figure 5 notably snowfall amounts are the most abundant in nl 3048 mm year compared to the rest of atlantic region in ns the province with the second highest mars yearly annual snowfall is equal to 2160 mm year atlas of canada 1957 climate and air temperature play a major driving force in energy balance and snowmelt processes dingman 2015 ohmura 2015 nl has average annual air temperatures between 1 c and 9 c with total sunny hours of 1633 hrs year environment canada 2010 these figures are smaller than those observed in ns and 4 c 11 c for air temperatures and 1962 hrs year for total sunny hours most likely the abundant snowfall in nl explains the highest mars observed in this province the higher mars in the few rivers from ab bc borders figure 5 compared with the rest of catchments in the prairies may be explained by the rocky mountains headwater streams that feed southern ab streams forbes et al 2011 in the prairies climate is driven by regional precipitation and circulation within the atmosphere rather than regional changes in topography and coastline conditions mcginn 2010 the movement of cyclonic low pressure systems brings advected moisture and triggers precipitation often the prairies are subject to a unique circulation pattern that consists of a northward extension of a persistent drought in the continental united states bonsal et al 2011 these patterns of atmospheric circulations are the driving forces of 454 mm year of annual precipitation in this region mcginn and shephard 2003 which is much less than the canada wide average of 535 mm year environment canada 1995 according to mcginn 2010 the distribution of annual precipitation across the grasslands prairies is highly variable it ranges between 300 550 mm year most of which is received as rain in spring and summer the potential evapotranspiration per year tends to exceed the average annual precipitation burn et al 2008 the low map and high evapotranspiration explain the limited water potentials across ab sk and mb figure 5 the severely low mars red and yellow highlights figure 5 40 mm year 100mm year in the prairies were observed in catchments that belong to the palliser s triangle i e the driest region in the prairies mcginn 2010 in this region there are consistent issues of droughts one dry hydrologic year is occurring almost every decade nkemdirin and weber 1999 these severe droughts are the results of a combined effect of the orographic lift caused by the rockies the coast mountains the cascade range and the sierra nevada range nemanishen 1998 yt is a province located in the cordillera climate zone however nt and nu are part of the boreal climate zone alila 1999 the lower map in the boreal zone 308 406 mm year compared with the cordillera climate 308 406 mm year explains the larger amounts of mars observed in yt versus those recorded for ny and nu the map is less in on 508 mm year map 1016 mm year compared to qc 508 mm year map 1117 6 mm year which explains the differences in mars between these two provinces the provinces with large water potentials bc nl ns nb pe qc and on were provinces with higher map 4 2 monthly magnitudes and flow seasonality the analysis of monthly flows revealed that in bc there is a large variability in magnitudes that can be explained by the diversity of runoff generating factors across the province e g rain melting snow glacier ice or by both rain and snowmelt effects the streamflow seasonality should depend on the catchment location within the province of bc it has been shown that low relief coastal regions have no pattern in the timing of peak flows however in high relief coastal basins peak flows occur in may june or july in response to seasonal snowmelt in autumn streamflow occurs as a result of rain events pike et al 2010 in the interior of bc the catchments have more predictable peak flow timing between may and late june depending on the elevation that control the snowpack depth and melt conditions moore and demuth 2001 which partially explains the high inter quantile ranges observed in may and june figure 6a earlier peaks january april reflects a smaller winter snowpack and potentially warmer area a later peak may is the product of lower air temperature and a greater snowpack to the north in the glaciered basins of bc peak mmr can occur in may or june in response to snowmelt or in august and september as a result of glacial melt more peak flow events are observed either in october november or december as a result of warm frontal systems producing rainfall and melt of either glacier ice or early snowpack moore and demuth 2001 pike et al 2010 these mechanisms may explain the high variability of monthly flows from august to december in bc figure 5a in the prairies over 80 of runoff is derived from snowmelt although snow represents only one third of annual precipitation the dominant snowmelt processes reflect on the timing of highest flows which is june for ab and may for mb and sk figures 6b 6d 6e respectively in the canadian prairies the relatively impervious frozen soils and low evaporation rates in the cold season enhance the snowmelt contribution to the total runoff gray 1986 maximum snow accumulation in the prairies is observed in march the increase in temperature generally begins in april which is responsible for the onset of snowmelt fang and pomeroy 2008 in the prairies the differences in the magnitudes and timing of the monthly flow may refer to differences in the hydrological processes mainly the wind redistribution of snow open fields the snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils and evaporation in winter and early spring fang and pomeroy 2008 the blowing snow can erode and redistribute about 75 of annual snowfall snowmelt infiltration can reduce the direct surface runoff and therefore decreases peak flows norum et al 1976 the variability of these mechanisms between ab sk and mb explains the disparities in seasonality and monthly flow magnitudes in this region qc and on showed the same pattern in flow seasonality mainly a high flow season from march to april and a second increase during october and december figures 6d and 7a qc and on are influenced by the same climate zones the boreal climate zone to the north and the great lakes saint lawrence to the south alila 1999 the intra annual variability reported in the current study in qc is the same as the seasonality reported in previous studies e g assani et al 2012 note that qc had higher monthly flows throughout the year than on given the differences in precipitation discussed previously the spring snowmelt represents roughly half of the annual streamflow in qc and contributes to aquifer recharge larocque et al 2010 the autumn rainfall can also contribute to recharge of aquifers which maintains streamflow during winter low flow period in qc assani et al 2012 in atlantic canada higher flows were observed in nl figures 6 and 7 the snowpack in nl is generally higher than in the maritime provinces many variables e g atmospheric pressure the amount of precipitation air temperature wind speed etc across atlantic canada play an important role in the snowpack runoff anderson 1968 similar to qc and on the atlantic provinces have two seasons of high flows march to june and october to december the largest water potentials are observed in spring during the freshet period march to june often generated by snowmelt qi et al 2017 however high runoff can also be triggered in pre snowmelt periods due to rain on snow events in atlantic canada rain on snow is a common driving force due to warm air from oceans bringing rain on snow covered lands predominantly in northern maritime climates us army corps of engineers 1998 cohen et al 2015 putkonen and roe 2003 in the maritimes high stream flows and hazardous flood can be rather generated by rain on snow than radiation driven snowmelt singh et al 1997 in nb the flows remained equally high for april and may figure 7c the historical flood of april may 1973 is among the most hazardous in nb burrell and keefe 1989 the combined processes of snowmelt and rain on snow in nb explains the occurrence of highest flow months figure 6c el jabi et al 2016 in northern territories most of the precipitation is in the form of snow northern territories are underlain by sporadic permafrost brown et al 1997 all three provinces showed the same timing of high flows may to september figure 8 however nu showed lower monthly values nu is receiving less than 254 mm year of annual precipitation 55 snow st jacque and sauchyn 2009 which could explain these low runoff values the subarctic continental climate has typically cool short summers and long cold winters the average daily temperatures are between 16 c and 29 c jacque and sauchyn 2009 4 3 low flow conditions in canada the q80 threshold for low flow revealed that most severe low flow conditions are observed in the regions with low mar values figures 5 and 6 this is most likely related to lower precipitation in these areas see section 4 1 low flow conditions are also moderated by moisture released from storages in lakes and wetlands in general larger basins have less severe low flows because of larger storages bart and hope 2014 however extremely low flow conditions were observed in northwest territories and prairies though they have the largest catchments figure 2 other factors such as contribution from aquifers that are hydraulically connected to the river and melting of the snowpack tends to mitigate the low flow conditions burn et al 2008 such conditions could be limited in the north the northwest territories yt nu nt and the prairies sk mb ab have exclusively one long season of severe low flows 4 months in winter the cold conditions in canada at higher latitudes exacerbate the pattern of zero flows leading most often to intermittent flows burn et al 2008 the intermittent flows in the prairies and northwest territories may have reduced the value of q80 and the value of flows at larger exceedance probability this explains the severe low flow conditions and lower q80 in these regions figure 9 in the atlantic the low flow period was 3 months in ns and pe and 2 62 months in nb and nl the shortest in all canada these disparities in duration of the low flow season are most likely due to the spatial variability in mean annual air temperatures colder temperatures prevent runoff in winter and result in more severe conditions of low flows burn et al 2008 in nl low flows are mainly occurring in winter which agrees with findings by burn et al 2008 in nb the low flow season occurs either in both summer and winter or in one of the seasons there are climatic disparities between north and south nb the southern nb have slightly higher precipitations and warmer temperature compared to northern nb burn et al 2008 results from boisvert et al 2017 subdivided nb into two regions north and south nb based on the timing of flows burn et al 2008 found that in northern nb low flows occur in winter these findings point to differences in the flow regime between north and south nb and therefore explain the nuances observed in low flow seasonality across nb in ns and pe there is only one low flow season occurring in summer figure 10 this is a warmer region of atlantic canada that have exclusively low flows in summer burn et al 2008 in pe it appears that the groundwater contribution maintains baseflow and mitigates low flow periods burn et al 2008 the cooler climate in ns and snowmelt should have attenuated the severity of low flows the differences in low flows between north and south of on and qc are most likely due to the disparities in climate boreal to the north and great lakes saint laurence to the south the low flow conditions tend to be more severe in the north of on and qc q80 values in figure 9 in both provinces the low flow season is the second shortest in canada 2 9 months after nl and nb in these two provinces very few catchments had low flows in summer and winter 10 in on and 11 in qc in qc winter is substantially the season of low flows figure 10 in northern parts of the boreal where most qc and some on rivers are located longer periods of sub zero temperatures are observed and low flow periods occur mainly in winter burn et al 2008 as temperatures are generally higher in the south the precipitation regime shifts to rain on snow the low flow periods extends therefore to may in qc and on figures 10b 10d rain on snow increases runoff and decreases snow accumulation grillakis et al 2011 whitefield et al 2003 summer low flows occur as a results of lower precipitation and higher evapotranspiration burn et al 2008 in bc low flows occurred either in summer or in winter 3 months duration very few catchments had two seasons of low flows 10 figure 10a in bc the complex relief and combined cordillera pacific influences create strong gradients and differences in temperature and precipitation winter temperatures decrease with elevation with the distance from the coast and with the latitude and these differences are the main driver of the severity and seasonality of low flows burn et al 2008 in interior bc cordillera catchments the low flow season is observed in winter but the onset month varies with elevation and location in this region late summer baseflow may originate from alluvial aquifers that recharge during spring freshet scibeck et al 2007 however along the coast catchments at a lower elevation with pluvial regimes are the ones to have summer as the primary low flow season burn et al 2008 4 4 fdc shape indices and flow conditions the fdcs were steeper in northwest territories and the prairies figure 12b steeper fdcs have a faster declining flow with an increasing exceedance probability cheng et al 2012 the q75 and q90 that are used to calculate lfi equation 5 are low in northwest territories and the prairies leading to lower lfis the bfi that was positively correlated to lfi and negatively correlated to sfdc table 4 indicates a lower contribution of the baseflow during dry periods in northern territories and the prairies the intermittent flow illustrated by steeper fdcs would explain the severely low flows in northern territories and the prairies in provinces with larger water potentials atlantic provinces bc qc and on figure 5 the fdcs had a flatter curve smaller sfdcs figure 12a with less severe low flows q80 results figure 9 and shortest low flow season s table 3 than the catchments with smaller water potentials such as the prairies and northwest territories see blue boxplots figure 12b the fdc was shown to be closely related to the shape of the precipitation duration curve e g cheng et al 2012 particularly the fast flow component of the fdcs reflected the shape of the precipitation duration curves chouaib et al 2019 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the catchments with smaller sfdcs generally showed higher water availability figure 12a there was a negative and statistically significant relationship between the sfdc and bfi table 4 however only 6 of the variability was explained between these two variables the sfdc is more related to basin response and water availability whereas the bfi measures the ability of a catchment to release water from storages during dry periods gregory et al 1999 bfi is influenced by basin characteristics such as aquifer properties evapotranspiration geomorphology landscape and soil types price 2011 the higher the bfi the more stable are the flow conditions no intermittence higher bfis indicate a large contribution of groundwater and other storage sources to the flow caissie et al 2015 the highest median bfis 0 38 0 52 were observed in north and eastern provinces pe qc nu sk and nt according to al faraj and scholz 2014 a bfi close to 0 4 indicates that 40 of long term total stream flow could be derived from groundwater discharge or other delayed shallow sub surface flow based on the sfdc and bfi it appears that in some provinces with large water availability e g pe and qc runoff is driven by two main factors higher precipitation and large catchments storage note that in areas of low water potentials e g nu sk and nt the bfi can also be high the lfi increased for flatter fdcs and larger bfi and both were highly correlated table 4 the lfi was particularly large in the north and eastern provinces same as bfi nt qc pe nu and sk 0 43 0 64 the general assumption states that larger basins have increased storages and therefore experience less severe low flow conditions in smaller catchments i e pe the groundwater mitigates low flow seasons smakhtin 2001 the eastern and north provinces qc nu sk and nt are among the provinces with the largest catchments figure 2 the bfi did not show a pattern with the basin size across canada figures not shown in fact there are situations where the aquifer becomes spatially disconnected from the river brunner et al 2009 as such the water losses from evaporation and infiltration through the channel bed increase during low flow periods and summer droughts todd et al 2006 also in larger basins the storages from groundwater lakes wetlands and glaciers cannot be maintained for instance within some boreal rivers such as those in northern canada groundwater may be largely confined and the bedrock porosity may be low steedman et al 2003 glacier melt and contribution to low flows may vary with cold conditions and latitude burn et al 2008 in other circumstances i e the prairies low flows are hardly sustained by other forms of storages wetlands and lakes as evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation hydrological atlas of canada 1978 sauchyn et al 2003 these mechanisms suggest that the large variability in sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi correlations table 4 is likely due to the complex interactions between climate and geomorphological conditions contributing to baseflow generation and therefore to low flow mitigation this paper is a major step towards a more advanced regional assessment of water potentials disparities across canadian rivers one should note that the study did not address non stationarity in assessments of the water availability the data and outcomes of the present research can be used to conduct analysis that aims at examining the non stationary water potentials in canadian rivers the analyses may consider to detect and simulate non stationarity of historical annual and monthly flows the q80 determined from observed monthly fdc can be used to study the temporal change of severe low flow conditions that is to assess for each river the change in magnitude and durations of low flows over the years these investigations will determine how water availability in rivers including the extreme low flows are changing through time the outcomes are of ultimate interest to decision makers and stakeholders future projections of water availability assessments can be made after building the most efficient models from historical data 5 conclusions the goal of this paper was to elucidate regional differences in water availability low flow conditions and to study fdc indices to further advance our understanding of those disparities from the analysis performed using daily flow data from 167 stations across canada several conclusions were made 1 water potentials are high in the east and the west coasts of the country the water availability is limited in the prairies and the northern territories differences in climate and precipitation regimes are likely the driving factors for such disparities in water availability 2 there were eminent differences in high low flow seasonality and magnitude across canada the spring snowmelt is an important trigger of high flows in most provinces although some provinces atlantic provinces ontario and quebec showed a second high flow period in autumn driven by precipitation and lower interception evapotranspiration 3 the most severe low flow conditions were in the prairies and the northern territories in these two regions the low flow season experienced the longest duration in canada approximately 4 months flows below the q80 threshold was the lowest in these regions and low flows extended over mainly one season winter in atlantic canada east coast the low flow season was the shortest 2 6 3 months occurring in summer in ns and pe in other provinces nl and nb the low flow season occurred either in summer or in winter depending on the location particularly in nb the duration and timing of low flow season changed from north to south as a result of differences in precipitation rain vs snow and air temperatures on the west coast bc the duration of the low flow season was moderate 3 months despite the variability in the mechanism driving the runoff response winter was the season of severe low flows the same applied to quebec and ontario except that in southern ontario frequent melt in a warmer climate and rain on snow maintained baseflow during winter low flows occurred in summer as a result of lower precipitation 4 the fdc was flatter in regions with larger water potentials flatter fdcs were indicative of baseflow contributions leading to less severe low flow conditions 5 canada has a wide range of water potentials which impacts both usages and aquatic habitat conditions credit authorship contribution statement wafa chouaib

4489,water resources play an important role in many aspects of our daily lives e g industrial food processing irrigation and hydropower generation etc the natural flow regime and water availability were studied across canada using 167 catchments from the water survey of canada dataset reference hydrometric basin network rhbn we established a systematic analysis of water availability annual and monthly runoff to determine both the quantity and distribution of water within the year in each province we investigated the severity of low flow conditions namely the magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows there are prominent disparities in water availability at the annual and monthly time scales across canada the annual runoff characteristics showed a relatively abundant quantities of water on the east and west coasts 800 2300 mm year annual runoff is critically low 150 mm year in the prairies and northern territories monthly analyses revealed eminent differences in the timing and magnitude of high and low flows the spring snowmelt is the main trigger of high flows in most provinces however the quantities of water during freshet period varied dramatically across provinces british columbia showed among the highest hydrological variability where some catchments showed relatively high flows year around in canada a second high flow period was observed in some provinces e g quebec ontario and the maritimes the underpinning hydrological processes and the precipitation regime are discussed to explain the regional hydrologic disparities the monthly flow of the 80th percentile q80 monthly flow duration curve was used as the cutoff to describe low flows both in terms of magnitude and duration the q80 variability across canadian rivers was significantly large 0 3 100 mm month many regions have one period of extreme low flows except in newfoundland new brunswick british columbia ontario quebec and saskatchewan where 2 seasons of low flows can be observed in newfoundland and new brunswick the low flow period was the shortest 2 6 months in contrast in the prairies and north territories the low flow period extended between 3 4 and 4 months we further explained the disparities in water availability and low flows from analysis of the daily flow duration curve fdc we quantified the differences in the flow response from flow indices calculated from fdc baseflow index low flow index and slope of the fdc the results of water availability and low flows have important socio economic impacts on water supply reservoir operations and far reaching implications on the health of aquatic habitats 1 introduction freshwater supplies is a common concern in canada and worldwide there is a need to assess water availability to secure freshwater sustainability koshida et al 2015 definitions of water availability vary with disciplines and applications available water can be viewed as the runoff discharge in rivers as a result of precipitation rainfall and snowfall in excess of evaporation transpiration and soil infiltration moreland 1993 in other words this is the amount of water one can measure during any period of the year low flow analysis in this paper are part of the water availability investigations and determines the amounts of water available during low flow and dry seasons most of the studies conducted in canada to assess water availability focused on indicators of surface water availability mortsch et al 2015 these indicators are of three categories water demand supply based climate based and hydrology based indicators koshida et al 2015 the water demand supply indicators often compares volumes of water in rivers with amounts of water used by the several sectors koshida et al 2015 the climate based indicators mostly inform about the drought and precipitation frequencies the indicators are based on a water balance approach that uses the monthly or weekly difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration to examine wet and dry periods over different time scales among the indicators is the palmer drought severity index pdsi which has been analyzed in the drought prone regions of the prairies bonsal et al 2013 the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei was used by dibike et al 2017 and tam et al 2019 to study future changes of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration in nine rivers from western canada the same indicator spei was used to characterize drought in india bisht et al 2019 more recent studies in canada interested in studying historical and future trends of drought using the climate based indicators e g spei and pdsi bonsal and cuell 2017 asong et al 2019 the main challenges of the climate based approach are the uncertainty in precipitation and evapotranspiration also the uncertainty in the global climate models gcms and in the forcing scenarios lead to uncertainty in future projections dibike et al 2017 these indicators remain primarily useful for drought assessment however they do not answer questions about changes in runoff quantities in rivers the hydrology based indicators interest in quantifying runoff in rivers annual maximum daily mean streamflow monk et al 2012 burn et al 2010 cohen et al 2015 and average summer flows brabets and walvrood 2009 are among the hydrology based indicators that have been used in canada the literature pointed to over 300 freshwater related indicators that are used in canada dunn and bakker 2011 the study by dunn and bakker 2011 underlined that 50 indicators were used for surface water assessment and over 100 indicators were used for water quality and quantity however the large number of indicators and their diversity lead to redundancies and most often to a lack of consistency between the provinces the lack of consistency does not help in comparing assessing water potentials across the country other gaps are related to the narrowness of indicators i e more emphasis on water quality than quantity and data issues data availability that limit their usages across the provinces dunn and bakker 2011 therefore there is a need to develop methods that assess and compare water potentials at the national scale evidently these assessment tools should be of utility to the decision makers other studies across canada analyzed trends of hydro meteorological variables e g mekis and vincent 2011 tremblay et al 2011 for instance mekis and vincent 2011 analyzed future changes in precipitation across canada whereas tremblay et al 2011 investigated trends in groundwater levels cohen et al 2015a is among the few regional studies that undertook a canada wide analysis using 24 hydrometric stations to compare water potentials and streamflow however only the positive and negative trends of few streamflow predictions i e the annual runoff the winter summer runoff and snowmelt were revealed uncertainties due to differences between climate scenarios generating models and hydrologic models i e hydrologic model structure uncertainty in evapotranspiration and snowmelt simulations are among the challenges of the study by cohen et al 2015a recent studies from canada addressed some of these issues using data of individual catchments shrestha et al 2019 investigated the use of gcms in isolating the climate controls on future hydrologic changes i e flow forecasting in a subarctic river basin muhammad et al 2019 studied the impact of model structure on the accuracy of hydrological modeling in a prairie watershed the trend analysis studies have been very informative to forecast future changes of several hydro meteorological variables past studies of hydrology based water availability studies across canada revealed three major issues mainly i lack of comparability and consistency between indicators ii emphasis on the trend analysis of hydro meteorological variables and iii focus on the effect of climate controls on streamflow projections using on site studies an area that remains challenging provided the level of uncertainty it involves there is a need for a national study that investigates more closely runoff across canadian rivers decision makers are looking for comparative and comprehensive assessment of the current water potentials across the country mainly the differences in quantities and distribution of water within the year and between provinces water potentials assessment can also inform about periods of water shortages where it becomes more challenging to manage the water resources questions about low flows i e the magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows across provinces and within canada require further investigations most of the low flow studies in canada interested in applying methods of environmental flows to maintain viable conditions of the river water quantity and quality for fish and fish habitat e g ehsanzadeh and adamowski et al 2007 caissie et al 2015 berthot et al 2020 however more information about extreme low flow periods not necessarily equal to environmental flow levels their duration and magnitude remain unexplored at the national scale the flow duration curve fdc has been extensively used in hydrology to conduct studies about water quantity and quality and streamflow assessment etc e g vogel and fennessey 1995 the fdc informs on the flow magnitude as well as the percentage of time the flow is equaled or exceeded smakhtin 2001 chouaib et al 2018 therefore it shows the ability of the basin to provide flows of various magnitudes iacobellis 2008 the shape of the fdc depends on the relative contribution of climate precipitation and watershed characteristics e g storage outside the low flow season the water quantities flowing in a river constitute mainly the upper and the middle thirds of the fdc q30 and q30 to q60 respectively studies have shown that precipitation is governing the shapes of the fdc in the upper and middle thirds of the curve yokoo and sivapalan 2011 chouaib et al 2019 the lower portion of the fdc range of low flows is very important in terms of water availability during dry periods and is governed by basin storage characteristics evapotranspiraion topography geology basin storage and groundwater yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the current study focuses on developing a national framework that provides new insights about runoff disparities across canada the runoff analyses teases out differences at the annual and monthly time scales the study serves to overcome issues of lack of comparability and consistency in quantifying the water potentials across the provinces it also informs about periods duration and levels of severe water shortages in canadian rivers through the use of fdc indices the study proposes a comprehensive assessment of the disparities in water availability particularly during dry periods therefore the specific objectives of the present study are as follows i to analyze water availability using annual and monthly runoff to determine differences in quantities and inter annual variability ii to investigate low flow conditions and study differences in magnitude seasonality and duration of extreme low flows and iii to use the shape measures of the flow duration curve fdc to explain disparities in streamflow and low flows across canada the paper marks an important step in advancing assessments of the water potentials across canada the proposed national framework can underpin future efforts aimed at detecting the change in water availability by studying the temporal variability of streamflow using historical data and future predictions also the regionalization efforts and prediction at ungauged catchments can be further advanced using the proposed framework among the limitations of the current national study is the small number of functional hydrometric stations in remote areas such as the northern territories 2 methods 2 1 dataset and study catchments in canada the reference hydrometric basin network rhbn water survey of canada was developed to provide a network for monitoring long term changes and impacts of climate on water resources across the country monk et al 2012 the rhbn stations are characterized by good quality data and natural flow with stationary land use conditions burn and whitfield 2016 the rhbn database can be found through the following link https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity monitoring survey data products services reference hydrometric basin network html in the present study two data sources were used 160 stations from the rhbn database and 7 stations having natural flows from the water survey of canada archive to supplement areas with a low number of stations we first selected 200 stations and then retained 167 stations based on specific selection criteria these exclusion criteria were catchments in the higher latitudes with long periods of zero flows ephemeral streams and catchments with excessive discontinuities in records for many years incomplete years of records most catchments with discontinuous data were located in the southern part of the prairie provinces manitoba saskatchewan and parts of alberta and in northern territories the limited number of hydrometric stations with continuous data in the remote areas accounts as one of the limitations of the proposed study we noted that some streams had zero flows for most of the year during long periods of cold winters or during dry summers ephemeral and intermittent streams these stations were also eliminated from the original database table 1 shows the number of selected catchments in each province as well as the acronym used for each province and territory british columbia has the largest number of sites 39 stations whereas nunavut yukon and prince edwards island have the smallest number of stations 4 3 and 2 sites respectively the study catchments and their locations are shown in figure 1 the record length distribution is normal the median is equal to the mean 50 years and the 25th and 75th percentiles are 39 and 59 years respectively the longest records are in bc on the east coast nl ns and nb in southern qc and in southern on record years are between 30 and 108 years the province of bc has the highest record length between 50 and 80 years in this study 7 catchments have flow records 100 years located in ns southern on and one catchment in ab shorter record lengths 50 years are found in the prairies ab sk mb and within northern territories nt yt nu note that a few catchments in light blue figure 1 have record lengths between 51 and 60 years one catchment in the qc north shore has a record length equal to 8 years highlighted in grey in the map this catchment was selected to better cover the region of quebec the study catchment areas show a large variability figure 2 smaller catchments are located in pe 37 km2 147 km2 in ns 92 2 km2 1350 km2 and in nb 130 km2 4700 km2 figure 2a in bc ab and qc there is a strong variability with a few catchment being larger than others in bc the drainage area ranges between 88 km2 and 20 300 km2 in ab the range is between 248 km2 and 35 800 km2 whereas in qc drainage basins are between 642 km2 and 40 400 km2 the largest catchments are in the northern territories mb and sk median values exceed 7760 km2 with catchment as large as 146 400 km2 great bear river at outlet of great bear lake 10jc003 in nt figure 2b 2 2 climate in canada the canadian climate is made of seven main regions these regions are the pacific cordillera prairies boreal arctic great lakes st lawrence and the atlantic hare and thomas 1979 the pacific is influencing the coasts of bc vancouver island and extends to yukon the cordillera covers interior bc the prairies influence southern regions of each of ab sk and mb the boreal region influences northern territories northern regions in ab sk mb on qc and west nl the arctic influences the upward latitudes of northern territories the great lakes saint laurence influences southern on and southern qc the atlantic region comprises the east namely nl pe nb and ns alila 1999 2 3 water availability in this study we analyzed differences in the amounts of surface water available annual monthly time scales and highlighted the spatial variability the timing and seasonality we calculated the mean annual runoff mar at each hydrometric station the mean monthly runoff mmr and we assessed the low flow conditions in each hydrometric station the low flow analysis aims at revealing and characterizing the most extreme and severe flow conditions in each river in figure 3 a flow chart is presented the flow chart summarizes the four main steps of the study 2 3 1 mean annual runoff mar step 1 this refers to step 1 in figure 3 the mean annual runoff determines the yearly average amount of water that flows in a river this indicator provides the total volume of water available in this study the mar is expressed in mm year which is a depth of water spread evenly across the entire drainage basin 2 3 2 mean monthly runoff mmr step 2 this refers to step 2 in figure 3 the mmr is calculated at each hydrometric station where the units are expressed as mm month the mmr teases out the variability and timing of high and low flow months within and across the provinces regional differences in mar and mmr are studied to better understand the underlying hydrological processes under different precipitation regimes across canada 2 3 3 low flow analysis use of monthly flow duration curve mfdc step 3 this refers to step 3 in figure 3 extreme low flows are critical periods of the year where water availability is generally compromised for various human activities and a general water quality degradation can be observed due to a lack of dilution capacities nemerow 1985 the low flow analysis in this study has different objectives from the approaches used to identify environmental flow levels environmental flow studies aims at determining levels of discharge to leave in rivers so that viable conditions are preserved for the fish and the ecosystem e g eslamian et al 2010 linnansaari et al 2012 caissie et al 2015 hatfield and paul 2015 jayasiri et al 2017 kuriqi et al 2019 berthot et al 2020 in this study the low flow characteristics are part of water availability analyses because it is during low flow periods that water availability will be most problematic as such it is important to have an overall assessment of water availability across canada spatial differences but equally important to know when are the periods of the year where water availability is problematic temporal differences within the spatial differences across the provinces the analysis points to reveal the flow levels and the periods of the year during which streams are having acute decline in streamflow our approach in identifying conditions of low flows is based on the mmr for each station the mmr time series a value for each month i e 12 mean monthly averages are used to determine the monthly flow duration curve at each station mfdc see section 2 4 2 for more about the fdc low values of the mmr are extracted i e the lower tail of the mfdc the quantiles q90 q80 and q70 were calculated from the mfdc among the three quantiles a cutoff value was selected that best described low flow conditions in terms of magnitude seasonality and duration among the q90 q80 and q70 the q90 led to only one low flow month in most study catchments whereas the q70 was too high to designate low flow periods as such the q80 was selected because it provided more than one month of low flows and captured both winter and summer low flow periods therefore the q80 will be used as the threshold to identify the magnitude duration and seasonality of low flows for each station the value of the q80 threshold is specific to each hydrometric station the duration of low flows was determined based on a binary matrix table 2 each row in the matrix depicts the seasonality of low flow for each catchment filling the matrix row by row a value of 1 was given for each month where the flow was lower or equal to q80 the values in each column are summed up the percentage obtained represents the number of catchments with flows q80 in each specific month see each month column table 2 note that for each month this percentage may vary between 0 and 100 for example in january 42 8 19 of the total study catchments in on have flows q80 q80 is a threshold value of the flow that is specific to each catchment the catchments that represent the 42 are 02aa001 02ab008 04da001 04jc002 04ka001 04lj001 04mf001 and 05pb014 in february the percentage of catchments with flows q80 increased to 74 14 19 the percentages obtained for the 12 months allow to draw the pattern of seasonality of severe low flows in each province last row in table 2 the matrix specifies which months of the year experience conditions of low flow the duration of low flows is equal to the sum of low flow months within each row of the matrix summing the ones in sum per catchment column table 2 the average duration of low flow months average table 2 was then calculated for each province for on 2 895 months in each province there was an assessment of whether the months of severe low flows occurred predominantly in summer in winter or during both seasons 2 3 4 indices of daily flow duration curve step 4 this refers to step 4 in figure 3 the daily flow duration curves fdcs were also analyzed the entire set of the daily flows was used for each catchment to construct the fdcs the daily fdcs were used to study the disparities in water availability and low flow conditions across canada the fdc in the upper tail percentiles 30th percentile and medium flow percentiles 33th percentile and 66th percentile was shown to be closely related to the shape of the precipitation duration curve e g yokoo and sivapalan 2011 cheng et al 2012 chouaib et al 2019 in other words the flow response in these magnitudes are mostly affected by the precipitation therefore the daily fdc metrics of this range mainly between 33th percentile and 66th percentile were used to further comprehend and examine the differences in the runoff response which is mostly affected by budgets of precipitation the lower portion of the fdc 60th percentile illustrates the flows observed during dry periods this portion is governed by basin storage characteristics evapotranspiraion topography geology basin storage and groundwater yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the fdc metrics of the lower tail 60th percentile were used to explain the disparities in water availability during low flow periods so in this manuscript the fdc helps to qualitatively relate the disparities in water availability either in terms of average through time or lower flow magnitudes to an understanding of the catchment response that changes with the range of the flow percentiles three fdc indices of flow were calculated at each station 1 the slope of the fdc sfdc 2 the baseflow index bfi and 3 the low flow index lfi figure 4 illustrates the flow percentiles needed to calculate each index 2 3 4 1 the slope of the flow duration curve sfdc the fdc is a cumulative distribution function whose properties are used to determine the proportion of water available alaouze 1991 the slope of the fdc sfdc is a surrogate of flow variability in time sawicz et al 2011 the relatively linear part of the fdc when plotted on a log scale is the portion of the curve falling between the 33rd and 66th percentile the slope of the fdc informs on how fast the basin responses i e the decrease of flow magnitudes with increasing probability of exceedance chouaib et al 2018 the slope of the fdc can be calculated using the following semi log equation sawicz et al 2011 chouaib et al 2018 the sfdc formulation is as follows 1 s f d c ln q 33 l n q 66 0 66 0 33 where q33 the flow with 33rd percentile q66 the flow with 66th percentile 2 3 4 2 the baseflow index bfi the ratio of q90 flow exceeded 90 of the time to q50 flow exceeded 50 of the time median flow is usually used to identify the groundwater storage contribution or other basin storages lakes or swamps to the median runoff al faraj and scholz 2014 caissie et al 2015 in other words this ratio represents the percentage of the baseflow component 2 b f i q 90 q 50 2 3 4 3 the low flow index lfi the ability of the fdc to describe the behavior in low flows was further explored using the low flow index lfi derived from the percentiles of the lower tail of the fdc e g burn et al 2008 lfi is calculated as follows 3 lfi m e a n q 90 q 75 q 50 where q90 q75 and q50 represent the flow value exceeded 90 75 and 50 of the time respectively the larger the lfi close to 1 the closer the mean q90 q75 is to q50 and therefore the flatter the fdc similar to the sfdc the lfi informs on the slope of the fdc particularly at the lower tail low flow range 3 results 3 1 mean annual runoff mar figure 5 shows the mean annual average of water available across canada using the studied hydrometric stations the regions that are most limited in water are the northern territories yt nt and nu and the prairie region mb sk and ab which have generally less than 400 mm year the mar showed intermediate values in on 200 400 mm year and interior bc 200 600 mm year the highest runoff areas of canada were observed in atlantic canada nl nb pei and ns and on the west coast coastal bc the mars

1200 2270 mm year were observed in few stations in nl 3 2 mean monthly runoff mmr in the previous section the disparities in runoff were analyzed on a provincial basis in this section the distribution of water availability were studied within the year using mean monthly runoff values the highest monthly flows were observed in bc ab nl and qc maximum of 500 mm month in all other provinces the monthly flows were below 250 mm month figures 6 7 8 figure 6 shows the four provinces with similar monthly flow magnitudes less than 500 mm month and similar timing catchments in ab and bc generally showed similar timing of high flows from may to july most likely snowmelt generated figures 6a and 6b the maximum monthly flow was reached in june with a median value of 136 mm month bc and 117 mm month ab a peak value of 530 mm month was observed in bc june beyond the scale of figure 6a in bc and ab only one period of high flows was observed predominantly the spring high flow period the low flow period in both ab and bc was generally in winter december january and february bc showed higher variability and higher flows at a few sites the lowest values of the median mmrs were observed in

observed in may figures 6c and 7 d in nl the maximum median mmr was observed at 152 mm month may whereas qc showed maximum median mmr at 130 mm month may in nl and qc a second high flow season was observed in autumn september to december median mmrs 52 mm month in qc and median mmrs 96 mm month in nl january and february were low flow months the median mmrs 52 mm month in nl and median mmrs 15

provinces figure 7 ns showed the highest autumn flows with median mmrs between 107 mm month november and 121 mm month december in on ns nb and pe there are chiefly two periods of low flows the winter low flows january and february and the summer low flows july august and september figure 7 median winter low flows were generally between 12 17 mm month on and 25 35 mm month nb values were slightly higher in pe and ns between 41 52 mm month pe and 80 103 ns summer low flows were generally more severe than winter with median mmrs of 14 mm month on 26 mm month nb 19 mm month pe and 31 mm month ns

magnitude seasonality and duration the q80 monthly flow duration curve was set as a threshold to analyze low flows in each study catchment across canada results of this analysis are presented in figure 9 the q80 flow metrics showed less severe low flow conditions on the east and west coasts in coastal area of bc the q80 ranges between 50 mm month and 75 mm month on vancouver island two catchments showed relatively severe low flow conditions q80 15 mm month in interior bc low flows showed moderate low flow conditions 5 mm month q80 25 mm month on the east coast of canada the least severe low flow conditions were observed in nl 50 mm month q80 100 mm month moderate low flow conditions span over the region of qc nb and ns 10 mm month q80 50 mm month for higher latitudes in qc and nl low flow conditions were increasingly more severe with q80 10 mm month results showed that the most severe low flow conditions in canada were in on the prairies and the northern territories for instance many rivers in these regions showed q80 between 0 3 mm month and 15 mm month the threshold value of q80 revealed not only differences in the magnitude but also in the duration and seasonality of the low flow season in each province the seasons of severe low flows were revealed the number of low flow months flow q80 was determined using a binary matrix as shown in table 2 section 2 2 1 for brevity the matrices of all the provinces are not presented the example from on showed that in january 42 of the catchments had flows q80 in february the percentage increased to 74 then dropped to 53 in march table 2 in april and may the catchments with severe low flows represented only 11 in each month whereas june showed 0 flows were below q80 in july 26 august 47 and september 26 for some catchment october november and december were not low flow months 0 in each month table 2 notably in on severe low flows occurred in winter and summer however only 21 of the catchments 4 19 showed low flow conditions during both summer and winter this is the percentage reported on top of each plot in figures 10 and 11 i e 21 for on figure 10d in bc qc nl on most of the study catchments had low flow periods in either summer or winter months figure 10a 10b 10c 10e for instance in bc more than 60 of catchments showed monthly flows q80 in january february and march figure 10a the proportion of catchments with low flows q80 occurring in both summer and winter months in bc was 10 as such 90 of catchments showed extreme low flow months either in winter or in summer the predominant low flow season in bc was winter in qc the proportion of catchments with flows q80 and predominantly in winter was 89 february 83 of catchments and march 78 of catchments were the months with the most occurrence of catchments figure 10b in nl and on the proportion of catchments with two periods of low flows remained low at 18 and 10 respectively figures 10c and 10d in nb more than half of the catchments showed severe low flows occurring in both summer and winter 53 figure 10e and september was the month with the most occurrence of catchments 83 in ns and pe extreme low flows q80 were observed in summer only for all the study catchments figures 10f and 10g all stations in ns 100 showed flows q80 in july to september whereas all stations in pe showed flows q80 during august and september in sk 88 of the catchment showed 1 season winter however one catchment 1 7 14 showed extreme period of low flow starting from august and ending in december figure 11a for sk 86 of the station showed low flow conditions in february and march in mb ab and northern territories yt nu nt the low flow period occurred in winter 100 figures 11 for these areas many winter months showed 100

canada on qc bc ab ns and pe showed a period of low flows of 2 9 3 months the longest low flow conditions were observed in the prairies mb and sk and the northern territories nt nu and yt in these regions the low flow season ranged from 3 4 months to 4 months table 3 3 4 flow duration curve fdc analysis as described in the method section the fdcs can provide valuable information related to water availability and low flow characteristics in canada particularly when studying differences in shapes of the fdcs upper middle and lower portion of the curve figure 4 different fdcs are presented to illustrate disparities in shapes using one station in on river lockchart station 07rd001 and one station in ab river waterton station 05ad003 figures 12 a ab and on are influenced mainly by the boreal climatic regime the two catchments are located at different latitudes which are subject to different hydrological regimes the q50 was equal to 4 3 l s km2 for river lockchart and 10 8 l s km2 for river waterton river lockchart on showed a flatter fdc with a lower sfdc of 12 compared to 20 for river waterton ab i e steeper slope the lfi for river lockchart was 0 73 compared to 0 14 for river waterton notably a lower lfi represents a steeper slope at the lower tail of the fdc mean of q75 and q90 divided by q50 river lockchart on showed a bfi of 0 65 compared to 0 38 river waterton ab where a higher bfi is synonym of q90 getting closer in value to q50 and a flatter fdc the fdc characteristics are presented in figures 12b 12c and 12d for all stations in provinces and territories the differences in the fdc shapes translate into different values of the shape measures slope of the fdc and indices bfi and lfi across the country the relationships between the slopes of the fdc sfdc the baseflow index bfi and the low flow index lfi showed statistically significant relations among indices table 4 the bfi vs lfi relationship was positively correlated and explained 96 of the variability r2 0 96 r 0 98 larger bfis reflect larger lfis the sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi relationships were negatively correlated and both statistically significant despite lower r2 values 0 06 and 0 10 respectively despite the large variability the sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi relationships stated that the larger the bfi the smaller is the sfdc and the larger is the lfi the increase in the storage conditions bfi increases of the catchments makes the fdcs flatter sfdc decreases and the low flow less severe lfi increases 4 discussion water resources are fundamental to the national economic well being of canada many human uses require fresh water including agricultural industrial household recreational and environmental activities in the current study 167 canadian rivers were used to analyze the water availability at the annual and monthly time scales the water potentials across the country were assessed with the consideration of magnitudes seasonality and timing of high low flows a low flow analysis was carried out to answer questions about the severity of the low flows in different regions of the country the shape measures of the fdc were quantified to explore differences in water availability and low flow conditions across canada 4 1 mean annual runoff precipitation is a significant hydro climatological variable that affects the natural environment wan et al 2005 the precipitation regime rain versus snow and magnitudes in terms of mean annual precipitation map are heavily affected by the climate conditions and both play a major role in the runoff response precipitation varies widely throughout the climate regions of canada atlas of canada 1957 there are prominent disparities in water availability across canada that may be explained using the map the largest water potentials are found in the east and the west coasts of the country particularly in the provinces of bc nl ns nb and pe 600 mm year mar 2270 mm year on the west coast map can reach 2540 mm year and it may be as high as 5000 mm on the southwest coast in bc alila 1999 atlas of canada 1957 disturbances from moist pacific air as a result of westerly winds are the main mechanism behind precipitation in the western wet area of canada this area of high precipitation explains higher mars in the region on the east coast the map can reach 1250 mm year these values are observed in the laurentians and hilly parts of the atlantic provinces alila 1999 atlas of canada 1957 the main reason for these amounts of precipitation is moisture from the atlantic and the gulf of mexico via the united states midwest alila 1999 these mechanisms explain relatively high mars on the east coast in the wet regions of canada east and west coasts our results underlined i large variability of mar across bc and ii large water potentials in ns and nl compared to the rest of the atlantic provinces bc is a province ruled by two climatic zones pacific and cordillera and is subject to influences from the rocky mountains in interior regions alila 1999 eaton and moore 2010 schwörer et al 2017 the pacific influence explains the large water potentials on the coasts of bc figure 5 some regions of interior bc also experienced high mars 800 mm year 1500 mm year this region is the west facing slopes of the rocky mountains which receives relatively high precipitation 1016 mm year map 1524 mm year atlas of canada 1957 the east facing region of the rocky mountains experiences lower amount of precipitation and correspondingly lower mars 200 mm year 600 mm year the dryness of this region is most likely caused by the rain shadow effect which is less precipitation falling on the lee side of a mountain range eaton and moore 2010 alila 1999 in between the west facing region of the rocky mountains and the pacific coast there was a strong variability in mars pink boundary figure 5 this region encounters low and variable rainfall map not exceeding 457 mm year due to orographic influences and the western cordilleran ranges atlas of canada 1957 there were two catchments in this region stellako river 08jb002 and big creek 08mb006 with severely low mars mar 180 mm year see white highlights in figure 5 which can be explained by the limited amounts of precipitation map ranges between 300 and 400 mm year atlas of canada 1957 in the atlantic region higher mars in nl with similar precipitation as the maritime provinces nb ns and pe 1100 mm year map 1400 mm year suggests higher runoff coefficients in this province figure 5 notably snowfall amounts are the most abundant in nl 3048 mm year compared to the rest of atlantic region in ns the province with the second highest mars yearly annual snowfall is equal to 2160 mm year atlas of canada 1957 climate and air temperature play a major driving force in energy balance and snowmelt processes dingman 2015 ohmura 2015 nl has average annual air temperatures between 1 c and 9 c with total sunny hours of 1633 hrs year environment canada 2010 these figures are smaller than those observed in ns and 4 c 11 c for air temperatures and 1962 hrs year for total sunny hours most likely the abundant snowfall in nl explains the highest mars observed in this province the higher mars in the few rivers from ab bc borders figure 5 compared with the rest of catchments in the prairies may be explained by the rocky mountains headwater streams that feed southern ab streams forbes et al 2011 in the prairies climate is driven by regional precipitation and circulation within the atmosphere rather than regional changes in topography and coastline conditions mcginn 2010 the movement of cyclonic low pressure systems brings advected moisture and triggers precipitation often the prairies are subject to a unique circulation pattern that consists of a northward extension of a persistent drought in the continental united states bonsal et al 2011 these patterns of atmospheric circulations are the driving forces of 454 mm year of annual precipitation in this region mcginn and shephard 2003 which is much less than the canada wide average of 535 mm year environment canada 1995 according to mcginn 2010 the distribution of annual precipitation across the grasslands prairies is highly variable it ranges between 300 550 mm year most of which is received as rain in spring and summer the potential evapotranspiration per year tends to exceed the average annual precipitation burn et al 2008 the low map and high evapotranspiration explain the limited water potentials across ab sk and mb figure 5 the severely low mars red and yellow highlights figure 5 40 mm year 100mm year in the prairies were observed in catchments that belong to the palliser s triangle i e the driest region in the prairies mcginn 2010 in this region there are consistent issues of droughts one dry hydrologic year is occurring almost every decade nkemdirin and weber 1999 these severe droughts are the results of a combined effect of the orographic lift caused by the rockies the coast mountains the cascade range and the sierra nevada range nemanishen 1998 yt is a province located in the cordillera climate zone however nt and nu are part of the boreal climate zone alila 1999 the lower map in the boreal zone 308 406 mm year compared with the cordillera climate 308 406 mm year explains the larger amounts of mars observed in yt versus those recorded for ny and nu the map is less in on 508 mm year map 1016 mm year compared to qc 508 mm year map 1117 6 mm year which explains the differences in mars between these two provinces the provinces with large water potentials bc nl ns nb pe qc and on were provinces with higher map 4 2 monthly magnitudes and flow seasonality the analysis of monthly flows revealed that in bc there is a large variability in magnitudes that can be explained by the diversity of runoff generating factors across the province e g rain melting snow glacier ice or by both rain and snowmelt effects the streamflow seasonality should depend on the catchment location within the province of bc it has been shown that low relief coastal regions have no pattern in the timing of peak flows however in high relief coastal basins peak flows occur in may june or july in response to seasonal snowmelt in autumn streamflow occurs as a result of rain events pike et al 2010 in the interior of bc the catchments have more predictable peak flow timing between may and late june depending on the elevation that control the snowpack depth and melt conditions moore and demuth 2001 which partially explains the high inter quantile ranges observed in may and june figure 6a earlier peaks january april reflects a smaller winter snowpack and potentially warmer area a later peak may is the product of lower air temperature and a greater snowpack to the north in the glaciered basins of bc peak mmr can occur in may or june in response to snowmelt or in august and september as a result of glacial melt more peak flow events are observed either in october november or december as a result of warm frontal systems producing rainfall and melt of either glacier ice or early snowpack moore and demuth 2001 pike et al 2010 these mechanisms may explain the high variability of monthly flows from august to december in bc figure 5a in the prairies over 80 of runoff is derived from snowmelt although snow represents only one third of annual precipitation the dominant snowmelt processes reflect on the timing of highest flows which is june for ab and may for mb and sk figures 6b 6d 6e respectively in the canadian prairies the relatively impervious frozen soils and low evaporation rates in the cold season enhance the snowmelt contribution to the total runoff gray 1986 maximum snow accumulation in the prairies is observed in march the increase in temperature generally begins in april which is responsible for the onset of snowmelt fang and pomeroy 2008 in the prairies the differences in the magnitudes and timing of the monthly flow may refer to differences in the hydrological processes mainly the wind redistribution of snow open fields the snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils and evaporation in winter and early spring fang and pomeroy 2008 the blowing snow can erode and redistribute about 75 of annual snowfall snowmelt infiltration can reduce the direct surface runoff and therefore decreases peak flows norum et al 1976 the variability of these mechanisms between ab sk and mb explains the disparities in seasonality and monthly flow magnitudes in this region qc and on showed the same pattern in flow seasonality mainly a high flow season from march to april and a second increase during october and december figures 6d and 7a qc and on are influenced by the same climate zones the boreal climate zone to the north and the great lakes saint lawrence to the south alila 1999 the intra annual variability reported in the current study in qc is the same as the seasonality reported in previous studies e g assani et al 2012 note that qc had higher monthly flows throughout the year than on given the differences in precipitation discussed previously the spring snowmelt represents roughly half of the annual streamflow in qc and contributes to aquifer recharge larocque et al 2010 the autumn rainfall can also contribute to recharge of aquifers which maintains streamflow during winter low flow period in qc assani et al 2012 in atlantic canada higher flows were observed in nl figures 6 and 7 the snowpack in nl is generally higher than in the maritime provinces many variables e g atmospheric pressure the amount of precipitation air temperature wind speed etc across atlantic canada play an important role in the snowpack runoff anderson 1968 similar to qc and on the atlantic provinces have two seasons of high flows march to june and october to december the largest water potentials are observed in spring during the freshet period march to june often generated by snowmelt qi et al 2017 however high runoff can also be triggered in pre snowmelt periods due to rain on snow events in atlantic canada rain on snow is a common driving force due to warm air from oceans bringing rain on snow covered lands predominantly in northern maritime climates us army corps of engineers 1998 cohen et al 2015 putkonen and roe 2003 in the maritimes high stream flows and hazardous flood can be rather generated by rain on snow than radiation driven snowmelt singh et al 1997 in nb the flows remained equally high for april and may figure 7c the historical flood of april may 1973 is among the most hazardous in nb burrell and keefe 1989 the combined processes of snowmelt and rain on snow in nb explains the occurrence of highest flow months figure 6c el jabi et al 2016 in northern territories most of the precipitation is in the form of snow northern territories are underlain by sporadic permafrost brown et al 1997 all three provinces showed the same timing of high flows may to september figure 8 however nu showed lower monthly values nu is receiving less than 254 mm year of annual precipitation 55 snow st jacque and sauchyn 2009 which could explain these low runoff values the subarctic continental climate has typically cool short summers and long cold winters the average daily temperatures are between 16 c and 29 c jacque and sauchyn 2009 4 3 low flow conditions in canada the q80 threshold for low flow revealed that most severe low flow conditions are observed in the regions with low mar values figures 5 and 6 this is most likely related to lower precipitation in these areas see section 4 1 low flow conditions are also moderated by moisture released from storages in lakes and wetlands in general larger basins have less severe low flows because of larger storages bart and hope 2014 however extremely low flow conditions were observed in northwest territories and prairies though they have the largest catchments figure 2 other factors such as contribution from aquifers that are hydraulically connected to the river and melting of the snowpack tends to mitigate the low flow conditions burn et al 2008 such conditions could be limited in the north the northwest territories yt nu nt and the prairies sk mb ab have exclusively one long season of severe low flows 4 months in winter the cold conditions in canada at higher latitudes exacerbate the pattern of zero flows leading most often to intermittent flows burn et al 2008 the intermittent flows in the prairies and northwest territories may have reduced the value of q80 and the value of flows at larger exceedance probability this explains the severe low flow conditions and lower q80 in these regions figure 9 in the atlantic the low flow period was 3 months in ns and pe and 2 62 months in nb and nl the shortest in all canada these disparities in duration of the low flow season are most likely due to the spatial variability in mean annual air temperatures colder temperatures prevent runoff in winter and result in more severe conditions of low flows burn et al 2008 in nl low flows are mainly occurring in winter which agrees with findings by burn et al 2008 in nb the low flow season occurs either in both summer and winter or in one of the seasons there are climatic disparities between north and south nb the southern nb have slightly higher precipitations and warmer temperature compared to northern nb burn et al 2008 results from boisvert et al 2017 subdivided nb into two regions north and south nb based on the timing of flows burn et al 2008 found that in northern nb low flows occur in winter these findings point to differences in the flow regime between north and south nb and therefore explain the nuances observed in low flow seasonality across nb in ns and pe there is only one low flow season occurring in summer figure 10 this is a warmer region of atlantic canada that have exclusively low flows in summer burn et al 2008 in pe it appears that the groundwater contribution maintains baseflow and mitigates low flow periods burn et al 2008 the cooler climate in ns and snowmelt should have attenuated the severity of low flows the differences in low flows between north and south of on and qc are most likely due to the disparities in climate boreal to the north and great lakes saint laurence to the south the low flow conditions tend to be more severe in the north of on and qc q80 values in figure 9 in both provinces the low flow season is the second shortest in canada 2 9 months after nl and nb in these two provinces very few catchments had low flows in summer and winter 10 in on and 11 in qc in qc winter is substantially the season of low flows figure 10 in northern parts of the boreal where most qc and some on rivers are located longer periods of sub zero temperatures are observed and low flow periods occur mainly in winter burn et al 2008 as temperatures are generally higher in the south the precipitation regime shifts to rain on snow the low flow periods extends therefore to may in qc and on figures 10b 10d rain on snow increases runoff and decreases snow accumulation grillakis et al 2011 whitefield et al 2003 summer low flows occur as a results of lower precipitation and higher evapotranspiration burn et al 2008 in bc low flows occurred either in summer or in winter 3 months duration very few catchments had two seasons of low flows 10 figure 10a in bc the complex relief and combined cordillera pacific influences create strong gradients and differences in temperature and precipitation winter temperatures decrease with elevation with the distance from the coast and with the latitude and these differences are the main driver of the severity and seasonality of low flows burn et al 2008 in interior bc cordillera catchments the low flow season is observed in winter but the onset month varies with elevation and location in this region late summer baseflow may originate from alluvial aquifers that recharge during spring freshet scibeck et al 2007 however along the coast catchments at a lower elevation with pluvial regimes are the ones to have summer as the primary low flow season burn et al 2008 4 4 fdc shape indices and flow conditions the fdcs were steeper in northwest territories and the prairies figure 12b steeper fdcs have a faster declining flow with an increasing exceedance probability cheng et al 2012 the q75 and q90 that are used to calculate lfi equation 5 are low in northwest territories and the prairies leading to lower lfis the bfi that was positively correlated to lfi and negatively correlated to sfdc table 4 indicates a lower contribution of the baseflow during dry periods in northern territories and the prairies the intermittent flow illustrated by steeper fdcs would explain the severely low flows in northern territories and the prairies in provinces with larger water potentials atlantic provinces bc qc and on figure 5 the fdcs had a flatter curve smaller sfdcs figure 12a with less severe low flows q80 results figure 9 and shortest low flow season s table 3 than the catchments with smaller water potentials such as the prairies and northwest territories see blue boxplots figure 12b the fdc was shown to be closely related to the shape of the precipitation duration curve e g cheng et al 2012 particularly the fast flow component of the fdcs reflected the shape of the precipitation duration curves chouaib et al 2019 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the catchments with smaller sfdcs generally showed higher water availability figure 12a there was a negative and statistically significant relationship between the sfdc and bfi table 4 however only 6 of the variability was explained between these two variables the sfdc is more related to basin response and water availability whereas the bfi measures the ability of a catchment to release water from storages during dry periods gregory et al 1999 bfi is influenced by basin characteristics such as aquifer properties evapotranspiration geomorphology landscape and soil types price 2011 the higher the bfi the more stable are the flow conditions no intermittence higher bfis indicate a large contribution of groundwater and other storage sources to the flow caissie et al 2015 the highest median bfis 0 38 0 52 were observed in north and eastern provinces pe qc nu sk and nt according to al faraj and scholz 2014 a bfi close to 0 4 indicates that 40 of long term total stream flow could be derived from groundwater discharge or other delayed shallow sub surface flow based on the sfdc and bfi it appears that in some provinces with large water availability e g pe and qc runoff is driven by two main factors higher precipitation and large catchments storage note that in areas of low water potentials e g nu sk and nt the bfi can also be high the lfi increased for flatter fdcs and larger bfi and both were highly correlated table 4 the lfi was particularly large in the north and eastern provinces same as bfi nt qc pe nu and sk 0 43 0 64 the general assumption states that larger basins have increased storages and therefore experience less severe low flow conditions in smaller catchments i e pe the groundwater mitigates low flow seasons smakhtin 2001 the eastern and north provinces qc nu sk and nt are among the provinces with the largest catchments figure 2 the bfi did not show a pattern with the basin size across canada figures not shown in fact there are situations where the aquifer becomes spatially disconnected from the river brunner et al 2009 as such the water losses from evaporation and infiltration through the channel bed increase during low flow periods and summer droughts todd et al 2006 also in larger basins the storages from groundwater lakes wetlands and glaciers cannot be maintained for instance within some boreal rivers such as those in northern canada groundwater may be largely confined and the bedrock porosity may be low steedman et al 2003 glacier melt and contribution to low flows may vary with cold conditions and latitude burn et al 2008 in other circumstances i e the prairies low flows are hardly sustained by other forms of storages wetlands and lakes as evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation hydrological atlas of canada 1978 sauchyn et al 2003 these mechanisms suggest that the large variability in sfdc vs bfi and sfdc vs lfi correlations table 4 is likely due to the complex interactions between climate and geomorphological conditions contributing to baseflow generation and therefore to low flow mitigation this paper is a major step towards a more advanced regional assessment of water potentials disparities across canadian rivers one should note that the study did not address non stationarity in assessments of the water availability the data and outcomes of the present research can be used to conduct analysis that aims at examining the non stationary water potentials in canadian rivers the analyses may consider to detect and simulate non stationarity of historical annual and monthly flows the q80 determined from observed monthly fdc can be used to study the temporal change of severe low flow conditions that is to assess for each river the change in magnitude and durations of low flows over the years these investigations will determine how water availability in rivers including the extreme low flows are changing through time the outcomes are of ultimate interest to decision makers and stakeholders future projections of water availability assessments can be made after building the most efficient models from historical data 5 conclusions the goal of this paper was to elucidate regional differences in water availability low flow conditions and to study fdc indices to further advance our understanding of those disparities from the analysis performed using daily flow data from 167 stations across canada several conclusions were made 1 water potentials are high in the east and the west coasts of the country the water availability is limited in the prairies and the northern territories differences in climate and precipitation regimes are likely the driving factors for such disparities in water availability 2 there were eminent differences in high low flow seasonality and magnitude across canada the spring snowmelt is an important trigger of high flows in most provinces although some provinces atlantic provinces ontario and quebec showed a second high flow period in autumn driven by precipitation and lower interception evapotranspiration 3 the most severe low flow conditions were in the prairies and the northern territories in these two regions the low flow season experienced the longest duration in canada approximately 4 months flows below the q80 threshold was the lowest in these regions and low flows extended over mainly one season winter in atlantic canada east coast the low flow season was the shortest 2 6 3 months occurring in summer in ns and pe in other provinces nl and nb the low flow season occurred either in summer or in winter depending on the location particularly in nb the duration and timing of low flow season changed from north to south as a result of differences in precipitation rain vs snow and air temperatures on the west coast bc the duration of the low flow season was moderate 3 months despite the variability in the mechanism driving the runoff response winter was the season of severe low flows the same applied to quebec and ontario except that in southern ontario frequent melt in a warmer climate and rain on snow maintained baseflow during winter low flows occurred in summer as a result of lower precipitation 4 the fdc was flatter in regions with larger water potentials flatter fdcs were indicative of baseflow contributions leading to less severe low flow conditions 5 canada has a wide range of water potentials which impacts both usages and aquatic habitat conditions credit authorship contribution statement wafa chouaib
