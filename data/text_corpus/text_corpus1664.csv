chemistry and sometimes making it improper to human use sea salt splay and wave driven flooding during storms are among the most common salinization processes modifying groundwater chemistry by infiltration gingerich et al 2017 freshwater resources in uplifted atolls are particularly vulnerable to the seawater intrusion because of the occurrence of high permeable aquifers of low elevation and of small size the salinization of freshwater near seashores increases the ionic strength of water which in turn provokes an increase in the solubility of carbonate aquifers machusak and kump 1997 rezaei et al 2005 this leads to an increase of the aquifer secondary porosity through formation of karstic phenomena such as dolines fractures and caves yoshimura and inokura 1997 these high porosity aquifers further facilitate the seawater intrusion inland also fissures created by tectonic movements accelerate the seawater intrusion and particularly affect the degradation of the freshwater

freshwater seawater mixing at the discharge seashore area chae et al 2012 stable isotope ratios of hydrogen 2h 1h or δ2h and oxygen 18o 16o or δ18o are natural tracers of the water phase and are frequently used as a tool to determine water sources recharge elevation evaporation processes and water mixing because their characteristics vary during phase changes cartwright and weaver 2005 chae et al 2012 kong and pang 2016 minami daito island japan is an uplifted atoll located in the northern philippine sea and consists of an atoll rim about 50 m above sea level or a s l and a central lowland where large and small lakes are present 30 m a s l arai 1979 previous studies showed that chloride concentration in groundwater was higher at the atoll rim than that in the central lowland and the lake water was less salty than the groundwater due to direct rainwater supply arai 1979 however the hydrological system has been modified by the construction of artificial channels between 1982 and 1994 fig s1 and by sea level rise kagabu et al 2015 consequently lake water can flow easily to other lakes through the artificial channels recently yang et al 2016 2020 studied the fluctuation of freshwater lens by monitoring groundwater level electrical conductivity and water quality in the same island however hydrogeochemical studies including effects of sea level rise have been not carried out in the groundwater and lake of the island since the late 1970s here we analyzed dissolved ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of groundwater and lake water in samples collected during three field surveys in 2014 to unravel the dominant processes controlling the hydrogeochemical characteristics and their spatial distribution around the island and to reveal the salinization mechanism by the long term effect of sea level rise 2 study site the minami daito island is located about 360 km southeast of okinawa island japan 25 50 n 131 14 e the island is 5 7 km wide and 6 5 km long for a total surface of 30 7 km2 fig 1 the morphology shows a concave shape indicating a surrounding rim and a central lowland the island forms an uplifted atoll on a rising volcanic edifice and is entirely composed of dolomite and limestone ohde and elderfield 1992 the central lowland was originally a lagoon and the elevation is lower in its western side 2 4 m a s l than in the eastern side 5 20 m a s l arai 1979 the island is mainly covered with subtropical forest and intense sugarcane farming is developed occupying 90 of the cultivated areas the population is 1447 inhabitants in 2011 kagabu et al 2015 annual mean rainfall is 1641 332 mm and rainfall is mainly observed during april may and august october yang et al 2020 water collected from a freshwater lens and water storage using rainwater tanks are normally used for sugarcane irrigation purpose whereas a seawater desalination plant supplies the tap water for human use kagabu et al 2015 major ions analyzed in drip water from limestone caves revealed that the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 derived from calcite and dolomite dissolution and the concentrations of na and cl originated from salt spray that piled up on the ground surface kashima et al 2015 residence time of water in the freshwater lens is about 40 days using water budget calculations okumura et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis water sampling surveys were carried out three times during february july and december 2014 at 15 observation wells g1 g15 together with surface water surveys at eight representative lakes l1 l8 and one seawater

of calcite dolomite and co2 the solution concentration for water samples was input into the geochemical modeling program phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 for the calculation the reference thermodynamic database wateq4 ball and nordstrom 1991 was used and solution concentrations of a mixture between seawater and rainwater were obtained the used concentrations of the two selected end members seawater and rainwater are those of an average seawater table 1 and rainwater from hedomisaki station in okinawa island japan national institute for environmental studies 2020 this choice was dictated by the fact that no rainwater data is available for minami daito island the referenced rainwater data of hedomisaki are mean values obtained in 2014 ca2 is 0 18 mg l mg2 is 0 37 mg l na is 3 07 mg l cl is 5 44 mg l so4 2 is 1 22 mg l and ph is 5 1 temperature for phreeqc input set at 23 0 c that is mean annual temperature in 2014 in minami daito island japan meteorological agency 2020 3 3 trend detection of sea level to understand long term changes in sea level a trend test was conducted and its slope was estimated using monthly sea levels from january 1976 to december 2014 at naha and chichijima tide gauge stations because the minami daito tide gauge station started monitoring operation only since 2007 fig 1 before performing the trend test relationship among the sea levels of the three stations from april 2007 to december 2014 was confirmed based on linear regression and correlation analysis after that the trend test was performed by mann kendall test and the trend slope was estimated by sen s slope estimator which are suitable for non normal distribution data zaiontz 2020 mann kendall test was used to determine whether sea levels at the naha and chichijima stations have a monotonic upward or downward trend sen s slope was conducted for estimating the degree of the trend slope with confidence level α 0 05 in this study mann kendall test and sen s slope were calculated using excel referring to zaiontz 2020 and equations see eq 1 7 in gocic and trajkovic 2013 the monthly sea levels were obtained from the japan meteorological agency 2020 as the obtained sea levels were values of the datum line not the mean sea levels the obtained sea level was subtracted by the mean value i e x i x x i is a sea level and x is a mean sea level because our purpose is to detect the trend of the sea levels and its correlation 4 results major dissolved ion compositions and field physical and chemical data are shown in table s1 the average standard deviation of electrical conductivity ec orp do and ph in the groundwater were 2590 1610 μs cm 82 88 mv 3 2 1 9 mg l and 7 4 0 3 respectively and those in the lake water were 3360 1470 μs cm 114 21 mv 6 0 2 2 mg l and 8 2 0 6 respectively these parameters are higher in the lake water than in the groundwater the average concentrations of major dissolved cations and anions were na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 respectively the concentrations of cl na and hco3 in the groundwater and lake water were dominating and ranged from 57 to 2700 mg l from 34 to 1250 mg l and from 27 to 454 mg l with average values of 921 mg l 413 mg l and 250 mg l respectively seawater ion concentrations are one order higher than those in groundwater and lake water the sampling sites were classified into five groups c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 based on chemical and physical differences of groundwater samples c1 and c2 lake water samples c3 and c4 and groundwater samples collected at 30 m b s l c5 the c1 and c2 groups were classified based on a chloride concentration of 500 mg l but the c3 and c4 groups were classified based on a chloride concentration of 900 mg l freshwater is defined as a water body having a chloride concentration below 500 mg l because higher chloride concentration 500 mg l is not suitable for agricultural usage yang et al 2020 however we decided the c3 and c4 group classification based on the mean value and standard deviation of the chloride concentration of c3 group table 1 because cl concentrations below 500 mg l were not measured on the lake water samples table s1 the do ph and concentration of hco3 for the groundwater are higher than those measured in lake water the na and cl are lower concentrations at c1 and c3 than those at c2 and c4 these differences were confirmed by p values 0 05 using mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 that is a nonparametric test to distinguish statistically two groups of data the resulting group classification is as follows c1 is fresh groundwater wells g3 g8 g9 g10 g11 g12 g13 g14 and g15 group c2 is brackish groundwater wells g1 g2 g4 g5 g6 and g7 group c3 is relatively fresh lake water lakes l4 l6 l7 and l8 group c4 is brackish lake water lakes l1 l2 l3 and l5 and group c5 is saline groundwater collected at 30 m b s l at wells g12 g14 g15 here group c3 will be defined as relatively fresh water because based on the criterion of chloride concentration which is 900 mg l in this study is too high to define properly them as freshwater chemical compositions were plotted on the piper diagram to describe water types fig 2 the groundwater belongs to ca hco3 type ca na hco3 cl mixing type and na cl type the lake water and seawater are plotted on the na cl type region of the diagram the group c1 indicates ca hco3 type and ca na hco3 cl type and the group c2 is na cl type hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of all samples were distributed on ranges from 38 7 to 0 9 and 6 2 to 0 6 respectively table s1 the average standard deviation of δ2h and δ18o values were 28 7 2 2 and 4 9 0 3 in the groundwater 12 4 6 9 and 1 9 0 9 in the lake water respectively the averages of δ2h and δ18o in each group are reported in table 1 showing lighter values for groundwater when compared to those of the lake water and the seawater 5 discussion 5 1 seawater intrusion and water sources the lake water and the groundwater chemistry of group c2 is clearly identified as na cl type fig 2 this is a simple but robust criterion to suggest that freshwater seawater mixing by seawater intrusion dominate the chemistry of c2 waters relationships between chloride and other ion concentrations are reported in fig 3 indeed chlorine is considered a conservative element in groundwater and variations in natural waters are primarily due to physical processes such as dilution and evaporation e g matray et al 1994 hejazian et al 2017 if the mixing by seawater intrusion is the dominant process the ion concentration of the water samples distributes along the seawater rainwater mixing line calculated using phreeqc and reported in fig 3 the concentration of na vs cl for all samples shows a linear relation along the seawater rainwater mixing line fig 3a the concentration of mg2 fig 3e and so4 2 fig 3d well correlates to the concentration of cl along the mixing line it reflects the supply of these ions by the mixing between the rainwater and underlying saline groundwater this is further supported by the increase of groundwater salinity with the depth and the location of the sites i e sites that are closer to the shoreline show higher salinity yang et al 2015 in lake water the concentration of na cl mg2 and so4 2 are likely derived from sea salt spray as reported by arai 1979 but are higher in group c4 than in group c3 fig 3a d and e this indicates that additional seawater intrusion increases these ions concentrations in group c4 because of the presence of fractures connecting lakes l1 and l2 to the northern coast takenaga 1965 thus saline water mixed with intruded seawater into fractures would affect the chemical composition of lake water l1 and l2 then it spreads through the artificial channels in lakes l3 and l5 but it cannot reach to lakes l6 and l7 due to a long distance and to lakes l4 and l8 because they are isolated lakes fig 1 thus chloride concentrations for group c4 were higher than those of group c3 fig 3 the concentrations of ca2 fig 3c and hco3 fig 3b show no relation with the concentration of cl and were mostly scattered above the seawater rainwater mixing line the δ2h and δ18o values of the lake water were higher than those of the groundwater table 1 the groundwater samples are plotted near the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating their dominant meteoric origin while the lake water samples are distributed below the gmwl line fig 4 a which is characteristics of evaporated waters a plot of δ2h vs cl concentrations fig 4b confirms that lake water is plotted in an evaporation dominated zone harbison and cox 2002 whereas groundwater is distributed along a linear mixing line represented by the linear regression through groundwater and seawater data indicating little or no evaporation effect the concentration of cl of the group c4 is higher than that of the group c3 evaporation affects the lake water isotopic ratios with typical heavier isotopes enrichment hamada et al 2004 similarly a plot of cl vs δ18o fig 4c shows the difference between the lake water and the groundwater and that the concentration of cl of the group c4 is higher than that of the group c3 this suggests the addition of intruded seawater through the fractures as mentioned above therefore we conclude that the groundwater and the lake water are supplied by rainwater and successively affected by seawater intrusion and that the lake water is further modified by evaporation 5 2 water carbonate rock interaction carbonate dissolution precipitation reactions can affect ca2 and hco3 concentrations in groundwater plummer et al 1976 which relate to ph partial pressure of co2 pco2 and alkalinity represented by hco3 in this study the dissolution of calcite is accelerated as pco2 increases so that the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 contemporarily increase yoshimura and inokura 1997 when ph decreases asmael et al 2014 calculated pco2 of groundwater using the phreeqc ranges from 10 2 7 to 10 1 1 atm with an average value of 10 1 8 atm fig 5 a it is higher than the pco2 in the atmosphere about 10 3 5 atm and consistent with other groundwater studies which showed 10 1 6 atm at okinawa island and 10 1 4 atm at taiwan agata et al 2001 the pco2 in groundwater shows an inverse relation with the ph fig 5a indicating that concentrations of ca2 and hco3 increase by dissolution of calcite and dolomite also the dolomite dissolution processes yield concentrations of mg2 via the reaction camg co3 2 2h2o 2co2 ca2 mg2 4 hco3 the ratio of ca2 vs mg2 explains which process of calcite and dolomite dissolution is dominant mayo and loucks 1995 if the ratio ca2 mg2 1 then dolomite dissolution occurs whereas the ratio ca2 mg2 1 indicates dominance of calcite dissolution mayo and loucks 1995 the ratio ca2 mg2 against pco2 in the most of the groundwater samples is higher than the seawater samples fig 5b fresh groundwater group c1 data is mainly plotted over the line i e ca2 mg2 1 reflecting dominant dissolution of calcite the brackish groundwater group c2 is plotted near the line indicating the dissolution of dolomite however the concentration of mg2 for group c2 mainly relates to the seawater rainwater mixing line fig 3e so it is consistent with the combination of dolomite dissolution and freshwater seawater mixing saturation indices sis of calcite and dolomite in the groundwater samples are shown in fig 5c and d the sis in the surface waters are excluded because they are affected by evaporation the sis are mostly plotted over 0 indicating oversaturation conditions dissolution of carbonate rocks is a possible reason for the oversaturation of groundwater seawater mixing causes rising ionic strength of freshwater so its solubility increases chae et al 2012 and consequently sis decreases it implies that the sis will head from oversaturation condition to equilibrium or under saturation condition by seawater mixing as the groundwater flows toward the seashore the sis do not decrease as the electrical conductivity increases in group c2 indicating that dissolution of carbonate rocks dominates rather than the freshwater seawater mixing on the other hand those of group c5 plot near 0 indicating equilibrium conditions fig 5c and d thus we conclude that concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater group c1 and c2 are related to dissolution of carbonate rocks and concentration of mg2 is also supplied by freshwater seawater mixing in group c2 in a lesser way and group c5 5 3 effects of sea level rise and dissolution of carbonate rocks sea level rise and dissolution of carbonate rocks affect the concentrations of cl and of hco3 respectively in other words the concentrations of cl and hco3 are the key parameters to monitor the freshwater seawater mixing and the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the study area respectively to reveal long term changes in the concentration of these ions we compared the spatial distribution of the concentration of these two ions in 2014 this study fig 6 b and d to that measured in march 1976 by kaneshima et al 1977 fig 6a and c the concentrations of cl and hco3 measured in february 2014 were used for this comparison because kaneshima et al 1977 sampled 12 groundwater and 39 lake water samples on the adjacent month in march 1976 fig 6a and table s2 note that 39 lake water samples were taken mainly on lakes l1 l2 l4 and l6 and the locations are shown in fig 6a and c a critical difference which could create bias between the two spatial distributions is the absence of artificial channels in 1976 fig 6a kaneshima et al 1977 concluded that seawater intrusion in the western and southern directions was faster due to the developing fractures and cavities occurring in these regions takenaga 1965 contours of cl concentration 500 and 1000 mg l in this study is distributed along sw ne direction including fresh groundwater and lake water whose shape is similar to the shape of freshwater lens previously estimated using electrical conductivity and resistivity by okumura et al 2016 fig 6b the area showing the cl concentration lower than 500 mg l is now drastically reduced and that of 1500 mg l is extended to near the center of the island compared to the situation in 1976 suggesting progressive seawater intrusion and salinization in the last 38 years fig 6a and b the area reduction is remarkable in the northwestern direction and near the lakes there are many fractures in the nw direction and now the lakes are connected through the artificial channels on the other hand the cl concentration lower than 200 mg l is now discovered in the north eastern part of the island fig 6b it indicates that the freshwater lens in this area expanded because the extraction of potable and agricultural water from the lens decreased with the development of the seawater desalination plant and the construction of impermeable reservoirs since the 2000s kagabu et al 2015 alternative water resources could be useful in future for increasing the volume of water available in the freshwater lens which will become a strategic reserve in periods of exceptional droughts or destructive typhoons we examined whether the sea level rises or not in the minami daito island based on mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator considered sea levels data are those from january 1976 to december 2014 and measured at the naha and chichijima cj tide gauge stations located in okinawa island and chichi island respectively fig 1 these stations were chosen because the stations as well as the minami daito station are located within the influence areas of kuroshio current and data of the naha and cj stations record a very long period of time the sea levels of the three stations showed slightly downward trend from april 2007 to december 2014 thick lines in fig 7 a and the coefficient of determination r2 between minami daito md and naha and between md and cj was 0 61 and 0 42 respectively fig 7b it implies that the sea level of md has somehow a positive correlation with that of naha and cj fig 7c depicts the long term sea level changes in naha and cj stations with the trend calculated by the linear regression although the linear regression showed the upward trend we used mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator because the sea level of the naha station showed a non normal distribution the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator inform that both sea levels of naha and cj have an upward trend p values 0 05 and that mean sea level for 38 years rose 0 081 m at naha and 0 131 m at cj with upper and lower confidence levels respectively of 0 118 and 0 043 m at naha and of 0 167 and 0 102 m at cj table 2 this implies that the sea level of md is also rising the degree of rising of the md mean sea level in the last 38 years would be from 0 029 to 0 056 m that estimated by using linear regression parameters shown in fig 7b thus it might be concluded that sea level rise facilitate saline water intrusion to lakes l1 and l2 through these fractures as mentioned in chapter 5 section 5 1 this evolution of the spatial distribution of chloride concentration allows for the first time to report a salinization mechanism on inland lakes which are not directly face to the sea and are obstructed by an uplifted atoll rim about 50 m a s l using combination of major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o concentration of hco3 is higher in the eastern and southern areas than in the central lowland of minami daito this pattern showed little changes for the groundwater and lake water in the last 38 years fig 6c and d table s2 average standard deviation of hco3 concentration is 341 103 mg l for groundwater and 154 29 mg l for lake water on march 1976 and it is 323 72 mg l for groundwater and 156 19 mg l for lake water on february 2014 this suggests that dissolution of carbonate rocks shows little changes for 38 years thus it has little effects on the increase of the aquifer secondary porosity i e expansion of fractures which facilitates seawater intrusion thus it might be concluded that the sea level rise and the existence of artificial channels have mainly affected the salinization of lake water rather than the expansion of the fractures 6 conclusions dissolved major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of groundwater and lake water were measured in the uplifted atoll of minami daito island japan rainfall is the main source of groundwater and of lake water with dissolved major ions originated from seawater intrusion and dissolution of local carbonate rocks evaporation further affects the lake water stable isotope isotopic composition the groundwater classifies into three types ca hco3 type ca na hco3 cl mixing type and na cl type and the lake water and seawater belong to na cl type concentration of cl in groundwater increases with depth and decrease with distance moving away from the seashore geochemical modeling using phreeqc suggests that freshwater seawater mixing is the main process responsible for the increase of na cl mg2 and so4 2 concentrations whose sources are saline groundwater from seawater intrusion and sea salt spray whereas dissolution of calcite and dolomite increases concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater water with low concentration of cl 500 mg l occurs in a region of the island stretched in the sw ne direction but the present day area is sensibly reduced comparing that in 1976 due to the global sea level rise fractures connecting lakes to the northern coast favor seawater intrusion in those regions affecting the salinity of lake water the presence of artificial channels among lakes made chloride spreading to the other lakes in the central lowland progressive sea level rise in the near future will certainly enhance seawater intrusion inland calling for continuous monitoring of the water chemistry on this island credit authorship

the long term effect of sea level rise 2 study site the minami daito island is located about 360 km southeast of okinawa island japan 25 50 n 131 14 e the island is 5 7 km wide and 6 5 km long for a total surface of 30 7 km2 fig 1 the morphology shows a concave shape indicating a surrounding rim and a central lowland the island forms an uplifted atoll on a rising volcanic edifice and is entirely composed of dolomite and limestone ohde and elderfield 1992 the central lowland was originally a lagoon and the elevation is lower in its western side 2 4 m a s l than in the eastern side 5 20 m a s l arai 1979 the island is mainly covered with subtropical forest and intense sugarcane farming is developed occupying 90 of the cultivated areas the population is 1447 inhabitants in 2011 kagabu et al 2015 annual mean rainfall is 1641 332 mm and rainfall is mainly observed during april may and august october yang et al 2020 water collected from a freshwater lens and water storage using rainwater tanks are normally used for sugarcane irrigation purpose whereas a seawater desalination plant supplies the tap water for human use kagabu et al 2015 major ions analyzed in drip water from limestone caves revealed that the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 derived from calcite and dolomite dissolution and the concentrations of na and cl originated from salt spray that piled up on the ground surface kashima et al 2015 residence time of water in the freshwater lens is about 40 days using water budget calculations okumura et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis water sampling surveys were carried out three times during february july and december 2014 at 15 observation wells g1 g15 together with surface water surveys at eight representative lakes l1 l8 and one seawater representative site s1 in total 24 sampling sites were monitored in the island fig 1 all the groundwater samples were taken at about 2 m below sea level b s l and additionally three samples of saline

water abundantly dissolving co2 shows high solubility yoshimura and inokura 1997 saturation indices si give information on the saturation state of minerals in solution to calculate saturation indices of calcite dolomite and co2 the solution concentration for water samples was input into the geochemical modeling program phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 for the calculation the reference thermodynamic database wateq4 ball and nordstrom 1991 was used and solution concentrations of a mixture between seawater and rainwater were obtained the used concentrations of the two selected end members seawater and rainwater are those of an average seawater table 1 and rainwater from hedomisaki station in okinawa island japan national institute for environmental studies 2020 this choice was dictated by the fact that no rainwater data is available for minami daito island the referenced rainwater data of hedomisaki are mean values obtained in 2014 ca2 is 0 18 mg l mg2 is 0 37 mg l na is 3 07 mg l cl is 5 44 mg l so4 2 is 1 22 mg l and ph is 5 1 temperature for phreeqc input set at 23 0 c that is mean annual temperature in 2014 in minami daito island japan meteorological agency 2020 3 3 trend detection of sea level to understand long term changes in sea level a trend test was conducted and its slope was estimated using monthly sea levels from january 1976 to december 2014 at naha and chichijima tide gauge stations because the minami daito tide gauge station started monitoring operation only since 2007 fig 1 before performing the trend test relationship among the sea levels of the three stations from april 2007 to december 2014 was confirmed based on linear regression and correlation analysis after that the trend test was performed by mann kendall test and the trend slope was estimated by sen s slope estimator which are suitable for non normal distribution data zaiontz 2020 mann kendall test was used to determine whether sea levels at the naha and chichijima stations have a monotonic upward or downward trend sen s slope was conducted for estimating the degree of the trend slope with confidence level α 0 05 in this study mann kendall test and sen s slope were calculated using excel referring to zaiontz 2020 and equations see eq 1 7 in gocic and trajkovic 2013 the monthly sea levels were obtained from the japan meteorological agency 2020 as the obtained sea levels were values of the datum line not the mean sea levels the obtained sea level was subtracted by the mean value i e x i x x i is a sea level and x is a mean sea level because our purpose is to detect the trend of the sea levels and its correlation 4 results major dissolved ion compositions and field physical and chemical data are shown in table s1 the average standard deviation of electrical conductivity ec orp do and ph in the groundwater were 2590 1610 μs cm 82 88 mv 3 2 1 9 mg l and 7 4 0 3 respectively and those in the lake water were 3360 1470 μs cm 114 21 mv 6 0 2 2 mg l and 8 2 0 6 respectively these parameters are higher in the lake water than in the groundwater the average concentrations of major dissolved cations and anions were na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 respectively the concentrations of cl na and hco3 in the groundwater and lake water were dominating and ranged from 57 to 2700 mg l from 34 to 1250 mg l and from 27 to 454 mg l with average values of 921 mg l 413 mg l and 250 mg l respectively seawater ion concentrations are one order higher than those in groundwater and lake water the sampling sites were classified into five groups c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 based on chemical and physical differences of groundwater samples c1 and c2 lake water samples c3 and c4 and groundwater samples collected at 30 m b s l c5 the c1 and c2 groups were classified based on a chloride concentration of 500 mg l but the c3 and c4 groups were classified based on a chloride concentration of 900 mg l freshwater is defined as a water body having a chloride concentration below 500 mg l because higher chloride concentration 500 mg l is not suitable for agricultural usage yang et al 2020 however we decided the c3 and c4 group classification based on the mean value and standard deviation of the chloride concentration of c3 group table 1 because cl concentrations below 500 mg l were not measured on the lake water samples table s1 the do ph and concentration of hco3 for the groundwater are higher than those measured in lake water the na and cl are lower concentrations at c1 and c3 than those at c2 and c4 these differences were confirmed by p values 0 05 using mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 that is a nonparametric test to distinguish statistically two groups of data the resulting group classification is as follows c1 is fresh groundwater wells g3 g8 g9 g10 g11 g12 g13 g14 and g15 group c2 is brackish groundwater wells g1 g2 g4 g5 g6 and g7 group c3 is relatively fresh lake water lakes l4 l6 l7 and l8 group c4 is brackish lake water lakes l1 l2 l3 and l5 and group c5 is saline groundwater collected at 30 m b s l at wells g12 g14 g15 here group c3 will be defined as relatively fresh water because based on the criterion of chloride concentration which is 900 mg l in this study is too high to define properly them as freshwater chemical compositions were plotted on the piper diagram to describe water types fig 2 the groundwater belongs to ca hco3 type ca na hco3 cl mixing type and na cl type the lake water and seawater are plotted on the na cl type region of the diagram the group c1 indicates ca hco3 type and ca na hco3 cl type and the group c2 is na cl type hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of all samples were distributed on ranges from 38 7 to 0 9 and 6 2 to 0 6 respectively table s1 the average standard deviation of δ2h and δ18o values were 28 7 2 2 and 4 9 0 3 in the groundwater 12 4 6 9 and 1 9 0 9 in the lake water respectively the averages of δ2h and δ18o in each group are reported in table 1 showing lighter values for groundwater when compared to those of the lake water and the seawater 5 discussion 5 1 seawater intrusion and water sources the lake water and the groundwater chemistry of group c2 is clearly identified as na cl type fig 2 this is a simple but robust criterion to suggest that freshwater seawater mixing by seawater intrusion dominate the chemistry of c2 waters relationships between chloride and other ion concentrations are reported in fig 3 indeed chlorine is considered a conservative element in groundwater and variations in natural waters are primarily due to physical processes such as dilution and evaporation e g matray et al 1994 hejazian et al 2017 if the mixing by seawater intrusion is the dominant process the ion concentration of the water samples distributes along the seawater rainwater mixing line calculated using phreeqc and reported in fig 3 the concentration of na vs cl for all samples shows a linear relation along the seawater rainwater mixing line fig 3a the concentration of mg2 fig 3e and so4 2 fig 3d well correlates to the concentration of cl along the mixing line it reflects the supply of these ions by the mixing between the rainwater and underlying saline groundwater this is further supported by the increase of groundwater salinity with the depth and the location of the sites i e sites that are closer to the shoreline show higher salinity yang et al 2015 in lake water the concentration of na cl mg2 and so4 2 are likely derived from sea salt spray as reported by arai 1979 but are higher in group c4 than in group c3 fig 3a d and e this indicates that additional seawater intrusion increases these ions concentrations in group c4 because of the presence of fractures connecting lakes l1 and l2 to the northern coast takenaga 1965 thus saline water mixed with intruded seawater into fractures would affect the chemical composition of lake water l1 and l2 then it spreads through the artificial channels in lakes l3 and l5 but it cannot reach to lakes l6 and l7 due to a long distance and to lakes l4 and l8 because they are isolated lakes fig 1 thus chloride concentrations for group c4 were higher than those of group c3 fig 3 the concentrations of ca2 fig 3c and hco3 fig 3b show no relation with the concentration of cl and were mostly scattered above the seawater rainwater mixing line the δ2h and δ18o values of the lake water were higher than those of the groundwater table 1 the groundwater samples are plotted near the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 indicating their dominant meteoric origin while the lake water samples are distributed below the gmwl line fig 4 a which is characteristics of evaporated waters a plot of δ2h vs cl concentrations fig 4b confirms that lake water is plotted in an evaporation dominated zone harbison and cox 2002 whereas groundwater is distributed along a linear mixing line represented by the linear regression through groundwater and seawater data indicating little or no evaporation effect the concentration of cl of the group c4 is higher than that of the group c3 evaporation affects the lake water isotopic ratios with typical heavier isotopes enrichment hamada et al 2004 similarly a plot of cl vs δ18o fig 4c shows the difference between the lake water and the groundwater and that the concentration of cl of the group c4 is higher than that of the group c3 this suggests the addition of intruded seawater through the fractures as mentioned above therefore we conclude that the groundwater and the lake water are supplied by rainwater and successively affected by seawater intrusion and that the lake water is further modified by evaporation 5 2 water carbonate rock interaction carbonate dissolution precipitation reactions can affect ca2 and hco3 concentrations in groundwater plummer et al 1976 which relate to ph partial pressure of co2 pco2 and alkalinity represented by hco3 in this study the dissolution of calcite is accelerated as pco2 increases so that the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 contemporarily increase yoshimura and inokura 1997 when ph decreases asmael et al 2014 calculated pco2 of groundwater using the phreeqc ranges from 10 2 7 to 10 1 1 atm with an average value of 10 1 8 atm fig 5 a it is higher than the pco2 in the atmosphere about 10 3 5 atm and consistent with other groundwater studies which showed 10 1 6 atm at okinawa island and 10 1 4 atm at taiwan agata et al 2001 the pco2 in groundwater shows an inverse relation with the ph fig 5a indicating that concentrations of ca2 and hco3 increase by dissolution of calcite and dolomite also the dolomite dissolution processes yield concentrations of mg2 via the reaction camg co3 2 2h2o 2co2 ca2 mg2 4 hco3 the ratio of ca2 vs mg2 explains which process of calcite and dolomite dissolution is dominant mayo and loucks 1995 if the ratio ca2 mg2 1 then dolomite dissolution occurs whereas the ratio ca2 mg2 1 indicates dominance of calcite dissolution mayo and loucks 1995 the ratio ca2 mg2 against pco2 in the most of the groundwater samples is higher than the seawater samples fig 5b fresh groundwater group c1 data is mainly plotted over the line i e ca2 mg2 1 reflecting dominant dissolution of calcite the brackish groundwater group c2 is plotted near the line indicating the dissolution of dolomite however the concentration of mg2 for group c2 mainly relates to the seawater rainwater mixing line fig 3e so it is consistent with the combination of dolomite dissolution and freshwater seawater mixing saturation indices sis of calcite and dolomite in the groundwater samples are shown in fig 5c and d the sis in the surface waters are excluded because they are affected by evaporation the sis are mostly plotted over 0 indicating oversaturation conditions dissolution of carbonate rocks is a possible reason for the oversaturation of groundwater seawater mixing causes rising ionic strength of freshwater so its solubility increases chae et al 2012 and consequently sis decreases it implies that the sis will head from oversaturation condition to equilibrium or under saturation condition by seawater mixing as the groundwater flows toward the seashore the sis do not decrease as the electrical conductivity increases in group c2 indicating that dissolution of carbonate rocks dominates rather than the freshwater seawater mixing on the other hand those of group c5 plot near 0 indicating equilibrium conditions fig 5c and d thus we conclude that concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater group c1 and c2 are related to dissolution of carbonate rocks and concentration of mg2 is also supplied by freshwater seawater mixing in group c2 in a lesser way and group c5 5 3 effects of sea level rise and dissolution of carbonate rocks sea level rise and dissolution of carbonate rocks affect the concentrations of cl and of hco3 respectively in other words the concentrations of cl and hco3 are the key parameters to monitor the freshwater seawater mixing and the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the study area respectively to reveal long term changes in the concentration of these ions we compared the spatial distribution of the concentration of these two ions in 2014 this study fig 6 b and d to that measured in march 1976 by kaneshima et al 1977 fig 6a and c the concentrations of cl and hco3 measured in february 2014 were used for this comparison because kaneshima et al 1977 sampled 12 groundwater and 39 lake water samples on the adjacent month in march 1976 fig 6a and table s2 note that 39 lake water samples were taken mainly on lakes l1 l2 l4 and l6 and the locations are shown in fig 6a and c a critical difference which could create bias between the two spatial distributions is the absence of artificial channels in 1976 fig 6a kaneshima et al 1977 concluded that seawater intrusion in the western and southern directions was faster due to the developing fractures and cavities occurring in these regions takenaga 1965 contours of cl concentration 500 and 1000 mg l in this study is distributed along sw ne direction including fresh groundwater and lake water whose shape is similar to the shape of freshwater lens previously estimated using electrical conductivity and resistivity by okumura et al 2016 fig 6b the area showing the cl concentration lower than 500 mg l is now drastically reduced and that of 1500 mg l is extended to near the center of the island compared to the situation in 1976 suggesting progressive seawater intrusion and salinization in the last 38 years fig 6a and b the area reduction is remarkable in the northwestern direction and near the lakes there are many fractures in the nw direction and now the lakes are connected through the artificial channels on the other hand the cl concentration lower than 200 mg l is now discovered in the north eastern part of the island fig 6b it indicates that the freshwater lens in this area expanded because the extraction of potable and agricultural water from the lens decreased with the development of the seawater desalination plant and the construction of impermeable reservoirs since the 2000s kagabu et al 2015 alternative water resources could be useful in future for increasing the volume of water available in the freshwater lens which will become a strategic reserve in periods of exceptional droughts or destructive typhoons we examined whether the sea level rises or not in the minami daito island based on mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator considered sea levels data are those from january 1976 to december 2014 and measured at the naha and chichijima cj tide gauge stations located in okinawa island and chichi island respectively fig 1 these stations were chosen because the stations as well as the minami daito station are located within the influence areas of kuroshio current and data of the naha and cj stations record a very long period of time the sea levels of the three stations showed slightly downward trend from april 2007 to december 2014 thick lines in fig 7 a and the coefficient of determination r2 between minami daito md and naha and between md and cj was 0 61 and 0 42 respectively fig 7b it implies that the sea level of md has somehow a positive correlation with that of naha and cj fig 7c depicts the long term sea level changes in naha and cj stations with the trend calculated by the linear regression although the linear regression showed the upward trend we used mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator because the sea level of the naha station showed a non normal distribution the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator inform that both sea levels of naha and cj have an upward trend p values 0 05 and that mean sea level for 38 years rose 0 081 m at naha and 0 131 m at cj with upper and lower confidence levels respectively of 0 118 and 0 043 m at naha and of 0 167 and 0 102 m at cj table 2 this implies that the sea level of md is also rising the degree of rising of the md mean sea level in the last 38 years would be from 0 029 to 0 056 m that estimated by using linear regression parameters shown in fig 7b thus it might be concluded that sea level rise facilitate saline water intrusion to lakes l1 and l2 through these fractures as mentioned in chapter 5 section 5 1 this evolution of the spatial distribution of chloride concentration allows for the first time to report a salinization mechanism on inland lakes which are not directly face to the sea and are obstructed by an uplifted atoll rim about 50 m a s l using combination of major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o concentration of hco3 is higher in the eastern and southern areas than in the central lowland of minami daito this pattern showed little changes for the groundwater and lake water in the last 38 years fig 6c and d table s2 average standard deviation of hco3 concentration is 341 103 mg l for groundwater and 154 29 mg l for lake water on march 1976 and it is 323 72 mg l for groundwater and 156 19 mg l for lake water on february 2014 this suggests that dissolution of carbonate rocks shows little changes for 38 years thus it has little effects on the increase of the aquifer secondary porosity i e expansion of fractures which facilitates seawater intrusion thus it might be concluded that the sea level rise and the existence of artificial channels have mainly affected the salinization of lake water rather than the expansion of the fractures 6 conclusions dissolved major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of groundwater and lake water were measured in the uplifted atoll of minami daito island japan rainfall is the main source of groundwater and of lake water with dissolved major ions originated from seawater intrusion and dissolution of local carbonate rocks evaporation further affects the lake water stable isotope isotopic composition the groundwater classifies into three types ca hco3 type ca na hco3 cl mixing type and na cl type and the lake water and seawater belong to na cl type concentration of cl in groundwater increases with depth and decrease with distance moving away from the seashore geochemical modeling using phreeqc suggests that freshwater seawater mixing is the main process responsible for the increase of na cl mg2 and so4 2 concentrations whose sources are saline groundwater from seawater intrusion and sea salt spray whereas dissolution of calcite and dolomite increases concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater water with low concentration of cl 500 mg l occurs in a region of the island stretched in the sw ne direction but the present day area is sensibly reduced comparing that in 1976 due to the global sea level rise fractures connecting lakes to the northern coast favor seawater intrusion in those regions affecting the salinity of lake water the presence of artificial channels among lakes made chloride spreading to the other lakes in the central lowland progressive sea level rise in the near future will certainly enhance seawater intrusion inland calling for continuous monitoring of the water chemistry on this island credit authorship

8321,study region oil palm cultivation has rapidly expanded worldwide due to demands for food oils and the potential for liquid fuel production however there is a scarcity of research on the hydrologic impacts of oil palm plantations at a watershed scale especially in latin america we focus on a watershed typical of intensive palm oil production in tabasco mexico study focus a soil and water assessment tool model was calibrated to simulate long term streamflow in the study watershed the plant growth module was calibrated for leaf area index lai and fruit yield simulations oil palm development scenarios were simulated to investigate the impacts of planting density and converted land cover types new hydrological insights for the region oil palm evapotranspiration rates were 51 higher on average than the converted land covers the higher water use reduced mean annual streamflow by only 9 at the watershed scale due to high precipitation in the upper watershed in contrast a 15 decline in annual water yield was simulated in the converted areas of the watershed corresponding streamflow reductions in low flow months were on average 34 a planting density of 150 palm ha was the most efficient for water use and fruit production giving a green water footprint for producing biodiesel of 87 m3 gj energy similar to oil palm cultivation elsewhere in the world keywords land use

processed foods mukherjee and sovacool 2014 oil palm is the fastest expanding tree species in humid tropical low lands especially in southeast asia faostat 2017 land area for oil palm cultivation increased from 10 to 17 million ha from 2000 to 2012 pirker et al 2016 resulting in attention to the environmental impacts of conversion to palm oil most of the research on environmental impacts of oil palm conversion has focused on deforestation and consequent greenhouse gas impacts and loss of biodiversity pirker et al 2016 vijay et al 2016 the impacts of oil palm on hydrologic cycling are less well publicized or understood comte et al 2012 larsen et al 2014 carlson et al 2014 meijide et al 2018 manoli et al 2018 oil palm requires humid warm conditions such as those found in the tropics to produce high yields sheil et al 2009 while the tropics are renowned as water rich oil palm yields could be increased substantially by irrigation in regions with greater variability or lower rainfall ludwig et al 2011 dislich et al 2017 woittiez et al 2017 land drainage for oil palm cultivation can result in soil subsidence and associated increases in flood risk sumarga et al 2016 furthermore conversion of tropical forests to oil palm can decrease streamflows substantially during dry seasons or droughts bruijnzeel 2004 yusop et al 2007 adnan and atkinson 2011 merten et al 2016 dislich et al 2017 tarigan et al 2020 research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation on hydrology has focused primarily on plot scale studies of ecohydrologic fluxes such as the impact of tree age on canopy rainfall interception farmanta and dedi 2015 chong et al 2018 and transpiration rates in palms with varying ages and grown on different slopes röll et al 2015 hardanto et al 2017 a small number of modeling studies have been used to investigate impacts from oil palm conversion focusing on nutrient cycling babel et al 2011 at the watershed scale and carbon water energy budgets at the plot scale manoli et al 2018 the tradeoffs between oil palm production and hydrologic impacts have been acknowledged but there are no studies of how management of oil palm cultivation could mitigate these tradeoffs at the plantation and watershed scales ultimately optimizing water use and oil palm production could result in more efficient land use and reduce conversion from natural landscapes moreover while most of the studies on impacts of oil palm cultivation on hydrology have focused on southeast asia there is little published on these impacts in tropical latin america regions experiencing oil palm expansion gilroy et al 2015 furumo and aide 2017 while deforestation due to oil palm cultivation occurs in latin america vijay et al 2016 as in southeast asia the primary mode of conversion in latin america is the transformation of cattle pasture to oil palm furumo and aide 2017 ramankutty and graesser 2017 thus there is little information on how land use change from existing land use to oil palm cultivation impacts or will impact hydrologic cycling in the tropical latin america setting our study area is located in the mexican states of tabasco and chiapas which underwent rapid deforestation to pasture lands in the late 1900s and is now experiencing oil palm conversion at a rapid rate in mexico at large oil palm cultivated area increased 485 from 2003 to 2017 faostat 2017 the goal of this study is to determine how oil palm cultivation practices impact hydrologic cycling including evapotranspiration et streamflows and water yields at local and watershed scales in a latin american setting a calibrated soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 hydrologic agronomic model is used to simulate hydrologic fluxes and oil palm fruit production the simulation

management scenarios based on the land use classes to be converted from present use to oil palm oil palm planting densities and maximum land slopes are formulated and simulated to investigate how tradeoffs between oil palm fruit production and streamflow change with spatial scale and alternative management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site calibration and validation the study watershed which includes areas in tabasco and chiapas mexico fig 1 was selected based on data availability and proximity to existing oil palm plantations in the region the watershed land use is predominantly pasture for cattle raising crop production and forests the majority of the remaining forest is found at higher elevations and slopes long term daily flow records from the pichucalco hydrologic station http www conagua gob mx were used for hydrologic calibration and validation purposes the contributing area to the gauge was estimated as 361 km2 based on 15 meter resolution digital elevation model provided by the national institute of statistics and geography instituto nacional de estadística y geografía inegi 2020 the simulated watershed was extended 22 km downstream of the pichucalco hydrologic station to capture more low slope areas typical of oil palm plantations in the study region resulting in a watershed area of 561 km2 a customized streamline shapefile from conagua http www conagua gob mx was used for stream delineation land use land cover lulc maps for 2000 and 2014 and soil maps were obtained from inegi maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation were compiled from the national climatological database base de datos climatológica nacional http clicom mex cicese mx in addition climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr global weather data https globalweather tamu edu was added to the swat weather database fuka et al 2014 spatial interpolation of the climate data indicates that the area receives an average of almost four meters 3960 mm of precipitation annually with the majority of rainfall occurring during june to october see fig 2 precipitation is higher in the southern portion of the watershed see fig 1 where elevation increases to 2100 m asl the average annual temperature in the watershed is 25 2 c with slight variation across the watershed fig 2 shows the intra annual variation of streamflow temperature and precipitation the highest monthly average streamflow is in october as a result of heavy rain events with the lowest flow months occurring in march through may streamflows are higher than precipitation in the cool weather months october through march because baseflows contribute to a greater amount of streamflow during those months 116 mm yr on average in the cool weather months vs 80 mm yr in the remaining months hydrologic and vegetation growth models were set up in swat to allow the investigation of oil palm planting density and the impacts of land conversion policies arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 winchell et al 2013 was used to incorporate the year 2000 land use land cover lulc map for the region which most closely aligns with the historical streamflow data the watershed was divided into 9 sub watersheds and 142 non contiguous hydrologic response units hrus which represent homogeneous areas within each sub basin with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class thresholds of 0 10 and 10 were selected for lulc soils and slope classes respectively for the hru definition calibration and validation focused on both the hydrological and plant growth components of the model the hydrologic calibration and validation was performed with 22 years from 1962 to 1983 of daily streamflow to include a combination of dry and wet years in both the calibration period 1962 1973 and validation period 1974 1983 a baseflow separation procedure was first conducted on the streamflow time series arnold and allen 1999 http www envsys co kr swatbflow resulting in a ratio of baseflow to total flow ranging from 0 35 to 0 50 on an annual basis next a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the swatcup sufi2 software abbaspour 2013 which involved running thousands of simulations and applying statistical tests to identify the parameters explaining greater variability in the model output the most sensitive parameters were grouped according to the hydrologic flux that was most sensitive to the particular parameter including runoff baseflow routing and et and each grouping of parameters was varied one at a time performance metrics used in calibration and validation included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the ratio of simulated baseflow to total flow was required to be within the observed range 0 35 0 50 which resulted in slight adjustments after the initial calibration final adjusted parameter values for the hydrologic calibration are presented in table s1 in the supplementary materials in order of sensitivity full descriptions of each parameter are presented in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 calibration of the plant growth model in swat followed a multi step procedure based on comparing lai biomass and fruit yield growth to field measurements similar to the procedure in heidari et al 2019 the first step of the calibration process involved varying the sensitive lai growth related parameters which include maximum potential lai blai and the values of points that define the lai seasonal development and decline relationship frgrw1 frgwrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and dlai since it is recognized that swat typically does not simulate perennial vegetation growth in the tropics adequately see for example alemayehu et al 2017 special attention was paid to adjusting the lai seasonal relationship parameters so that lai did not exhibit dormancy at any time during the growth cycle second biomass production which comprises the total mass of the palms was calibrated by changing the radiation use efficiency bio e and light extinction coefficient ext coef parameters third harvest index parameters which relate the fruit yield to biomass were adjusted hvsti and hi ovr the lai biomass and fruit yield growth models were calibrated with reported values from studies with different planting densities lamade and setiyo 1996 corley and tinker 2008 ishak and awal 2007 gerritsma and wessel 1997 goh 1982 higher ranges of reported values in the literature were used for matching fruit yield since it was assumed that the palms are fully fertilized and water stress is unlikely due to high precipitation the final adjusted parameter values for the vegetation growth model are presented in table s2 in the supplementary materials full descriptions of these parameters are found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 potential et is calculated in swat with a penman monteith model requiring the hydroclimatic time series inputs described previously actual et is dependent on canopy interception of precipitation which in turn is controlled by lai and maximum canopy storage values measured values of precipitation interception for oil plam chong et al 2018 farmanta and dedi 2015 were used calibrate the maximum canopy interception parameter canmx see table s2 in the supplementary materials for the range of calibrated values following the procedure of arnold 2012 since the lai models were calibrated for a range of planting densities the actual et varies with the particular planting density 2 2 modeling scenarios the calibrated and validated model is used to simulate a range of oil palm conversion scenarios in general conversion to oil palm and subsequent fruit production are simulated as a initial planting of nursery stock in the first year of conversion b a yield building phase which lasts up to three years after planting yap during which the canopy is not closed and no fruit is harvested c a linear increase in fruits yield phase a 4 7 yap d a mature or plateau yield phase 8 14 yap e a yield decline phase 15 25 yap and f removal of the tree at 25 yap woittiez et al 2017 fairhurst and griffiths 2014 five planting densities were simulated see table 1 for each land use conversion scenario the most recent lulc map 2014 see land cover change analysis in table s3 in the supplementary materials is used to represent the base case scenario and assess the impacts of converting from existing t land cover types to oil palm analysis of land use change from 2000 to 2014 indicates that approximately 10 of forest land was converted to agriculture and pasture during that period although the 2014 land cover map represents a period substantially later than the period of record for the hydroclimatic time series used in the calibration the only parameter related to land cover that was adjusted during calibration was the curve number cn the calibrated cn values for each land use type and the other previously calibrated parameters are used for the new setup the impacts of allowing or disallowing conversion of existing cropland areas are simulated to assess policies of prohibiting land use competition between food crops and crops with potential industrial uses such as using palm oil for biofuels while current guidelines for optimal yield and minimizing soil erosion woittiez et al 2017 paramananthan 2013 indicate that plantations occur on lands with slopes less than 12 corley and tinker 2008 furumo and aide 2017 we also allow oil palm conversion on slopes as high as 30 to simulate the intensification of palm oil production due to higher demand and or prices the resulting four scenarios are then a base case b conversion of pasture and forest pf scenario to oil palm on lands with slopes 12 127 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 124 m above sea level masl c conversion of crop pasture and forest pfa scenario on lands with slopes 12 214 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 132 masl and d conversion of crop pasture and forest pfa on lands with slopes 30 346 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 219 masl table 2 shows the areas of land use classes converted for each of the scenarios following a warm up period to obtain initial conditions each scenario simulation occurred over the 20 year period using the 1964 1983 hydroclimatic time series the green water footprint is the volumetric water consumption associated with consumption of precipitation stored in the soil by a given production process that is otherwise available for evapotranspiration the green water footprint is used as a metric to compare for example water to energy efficiency for biofuels and other energy sources hoekstra and chapagain 2006 chiu and wu 2013 we report the green water use per mass of biomass and by using literature values for the expected energy generated per unit of biomass we convert the green water consumption per mass to green water consumption per unit of energy generated gerbens leenes et al 2009 we then compare the green water footprints to literature values for oil palm fruit production and other biofuel feedstocks 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation comparison of simulated and observed monthly discharges is shown in fig 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 72 r2 of 0 74 and pbias of 4 5 for the entire simulation period indicates very good hydrologic model performance moriasi et al 2007 table s4 gives complete details of the model performance statistics for the calibration and verification periods as shown in fig 4 comparison of the simulated versus measured oil palm yields demonstrates that the calibration of the plant growth model was reliable r2 0 81 over all phases of fruit production final adjusted parameter values for the hydrologic and vegetation growth model calibration are presented in tables s1 and s2 respectively in the supplementary materials area weighted average values of the fitted curve numbers for the land covers were as follows oil palm cn 75 4 agriculture cn 88 6 pasture cn 79 4 forest averaged over mixed evergreen deciduous and mixed forest cn 69 0 3 2 optimal planting density comparison across planting densities fig 4 shows that the highest fruit production occurs with an average planting density of 150 palm ha at planting densities lower than 150 palm ha the yields are lower simply because there are fewer oil palms per cultivated area while planting densities greater than 150 palm ha are more productive in earlier years competition for solar radiation causes a rapid decline in the yield starting in year 7 or 8 for the high planting densities in the vegetation growth sub model fruit yield is a function of intercepted solar radiation and radiation use efficiency rue rue does not change with tree age but light interception lai and fruit yield increase with oil palm age however the fruit production simulations account for a decline in yield at a threshold around lai of 6 as observed by breure 2010 due to competition for solar radiation resulting in the simulated declines in fruit production for higher planting densities fig 5 shows the annual fruit yield versus the annual additional water use for all planting densities and scenarios additional water use is defined as the difference between et for the base case and et for a given conversion scenario for the converted land these results indicate that for every scenario the 150 palm ha planting density is the most efficient in terms of maximizing fruit production and minimizing additional water use the increasing trend in efficiency from lower planting densities 55 and 105 palm ha to the 150 palm ha planting density reflects a greater fractional increase in fruit production due to the greater number of palms see fig 4 than the corresponding fractional increase in water use the smaller fractional increase in water use compared to the increase in fruit production is due to the lower sensitivity of et to lai as compared to the sensitivity of fruit production to lai the efficiency decreases when planting density increases from 150 palm ha indicating that fruit production decreases and water use increases while the fruit yield declines steeply with planting density greater than 150 palm ha see fig 4 due to the threshold lai that indicates radiative crowding the increase in lai with planting density tends to slightly increase the et rate since the overall pattern of efficiency of water use per biomass production is similar across the planting densities fig 5 results for only the most efficient density of 150 palm ha are reported in the remaining text 3 3 hydrologic impacts in converted areas table 2 shows changes in average annual et and yield for the land areas converted to oil palm for the three conversion scenarios relative to the bau scenario these results show that the et rate increases over a range of 36 52 due to conversion to oil palm with a corresponding decrease in water yield ranging from 11 to 17 et rates for the converted oil palm ranged from 1210 to 1340 mm yr with a mean of 1270 mm yr the higher et rates for oil palm compared to the prior land uses are due to higher water use rates and higher lai values in general higher changes in et are found for conversion from the pasture and evergreen forest since these land covers tended to have lower et rates because of lower lai and water use rates respectively the results in fig 5 show that both the volumetric water use and fruit yield increase roughly linearly with the area of converted land for each scenario pf 127 km2 converted pfa 214 km2 converted pfa 346 km2 converted the results in table 2 also show that the increase in et and subsequent decrease in water yield somewhat diminish from the pf to the pfa and pfa scenarios this trend can be explained by the mixture of land uses that are converted in each scenario in the pfa scenario the additional converted agricultural land produces a slightly smaller increase in et compared to the other land conversions in the pf scenario resulting in a small decrease in the change overall et for the pfa scenario 49 compared to the pf scenario 51 however for the pfa scenario the converted land classes have higher et rates to begin with because of the higher elevation in the watershed which has the effect of reducing the increase overall et rate substantially for the pfa scenario 39 compared to the pfa scenario 49 while the annual average increase in et and decrease in water yield are substantial the simulated monthly et for the base case and the pf scenario shown in fig 6 indicate that the seasonal impacts can be even greater in march and april et increases by 100 relative to the base case due to higher temperatures and the palms reaching the yearly maximum lai for these months the error bars in fig 6 indicate the standard deviation of et across the 20 year simulation period the widths of the error bars for the pf conversion scenario are substantially greater due both to the higher mean et values and the higher sensitivity of et rates to annual variations in climate for the pf oil palm conversion case than for the base case in particular the month of may displays an exceptionally high variability in et across the 20 years during the driest years 1971 and 1977 average precipitation of 2923 mm compared to annual precipitation of 3962 mm the increase in et and decrease in water yield were 60 and 23 respectively for the pf case compared to the base case on average the month of may has the greatest changes in water yield with a reduction as large as 60 in the driest year similar patterns of seasonal and inter annual variations in et were observed in the simulations of the pfa and pfa scenarios see figure s2 annual variations in the et rate also depend but to a lesser extent on the life cycle of oil palm as the lai increases and eventually reaches the maximum value in year 10 see figure s1 fig 7 shows the average monthly decrease in water yield for the converted area for the pf scenario relative to the base case the mean decreases are highest in may due to lower rainfall and especially high temperatures see fig 2 with decreases higher than 50 in the driest years again similar patterns of seasonal and inter annual variations in water yield were observed in the pfa and pfa scenario simulations see figure s3 3 4 watershed scale impacts from land conversion scenarios the model simulations indicate higher water use throughout the watershed as a result of oil palm conversions planting oil palm increases the et rate over the whole watershed by 11 18 and 29 for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively compared to the base case scenario due to the high annual precipitation rates in the watershed especially in the southern portions of the watershed where the elevation increases above 2100 m asl the increases in et only slightly affect the streamflow at the outlet with 3 6 and 9 declines in average annual streamflows for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively interannual variation in climate produces a slightly larger decrease in the streamflow due to oil palm conversion in some years during the driest years 1977 and 1971 annual streamflow at the outlet declines by 5 0 8 6 and 13 5 under the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively relative to the base case scenario in contrast during the wet years highest 25th percentile annual precipitation streamflow at the outlet decreases by an average of 3 5 and 8 for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively fig 8 shows the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of monthly watershed scale streamflow for the base case pf pfa and pfa scenarios over the simulation period the cdfs for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios are almost identical in terms of the deviation from the base case scenario except for the magnitude of low flows for example the 90 exceedance flow for the pf and pfa scenarios differ from the base case scenario by 16 and 35 respectively at the sub basin level the simulation results indicate that sub basin 1 fig 1 will experience the greatest decline 24 in average annual water yield as a result of oil palm expansion for all three scenarios on a seasonal basis during the low flow months of april may and june streamflow will decrease 50 on average the significant decline in annual and seasonal streamflows in sub basin 1 is due to the low average annual precipitation in the sub basin 2580 mm year which is 35 lower than the watershed wide average for sub basin 2 which has 50 more rainfall than sub basin 1 3841 mm year the decline in average annual water yield in sub basin 2 was only 14 although the fraction of converted land in sub basin 2 was identical to that for sub basin 1 for the pf scenario 3 5 green water footprint the simulations indicate an et water requirement of 0 98 to 1 4 m3 to produce 1 kg of dry fruit across the scenarios this range is similar to the range of 1 1 to 1 4 m3 water kg fruit reported by pleanjai et al 2007 for oil palm cultivation in malaysia assuming each kilogram of fresh fruit dry weight can produce 0 30 kg of fuel pleanjai et al 2007 the green water footprint is 3300 m3 of water per 1 m3 of biodiesel biodiesel density 874 7 kg m3 usdoe further assuming that the liquid fuel would have an energy content similar to conventional diesel fuels 43 mj kg international gas union 2019 the green water footprint is 87 m3 water gj babel et al 2011 reports a slightly higher value of 110 m3 gj for biodiesel derived from oil palm in thailand if the green water footprint is calculated based on the additional et relative to the base case scenario shown in table s6 the green water footprint is 0 34 m3 kg of biomass or 25 2 m3 gj of energy in addition to conversion of the oil palm fruit 50 70 tons ha of biomass residue in the form of fiber shell palm kernel fronds and trunks can be collected over the life span of the oil palm salathong 2007 the simulations conducted here indicate a total biomass production of 57 ton ha including fruit above and below ground biomass with 34 tons of biomass left as residue at the end of the 20 year simulation period this residual is equivalent to an extra 323 gj ha or a total of 4 0 6 9 and 11 2 million gj of bioethanol energy for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively over the roughly 20 year lifetime of the oil palms 4 discussion the et rates for the converted oil palm ranged from 1210 to 1340 mm yr for the 150 palm ha planting density these values of et are on the lower end of values found in the literature including henson et al 2007 arshad 2014 meijide et al 2018 tarigan et al 2018 and fan et al 2019 who report mean et rates from 1300 to 1800 mm yr for sites in indonesia and malaysia the lower et for the tabasco site compared to the southeastern asia sites could be due to differences in climate planting densities and other hydrologic and vegetation conditions however one likely explanation is that the southeastern asian sites are located close to the equator compared to the mean latitude of 17 5 for the tabasco site which would lead to correspondingly lower solar radiation and et in the tabasco site the calibrated curve number for oil palm in this study was cn 75 4 areally averaged over all of the soil types which is in the middle of the range of curve numbers found by tarigan et al 2016 for oil palm of cn 67 89 with cn increasing as soils are less permeable as tarigan et al 2016 2018 have reported conversion of forested land oil palm can lead to soil compaction the curve number for oil palm found here is substantially higher than the average curve number for forest cover 69 0 which is an indirect indication that the soils were modified when converted for forest to land cover in this work however other soil parameters such as bulk density and available water content were constant for each soil type and were not adjusted based on land cover the maximum lai and calibrated maximum canopy interception ranged from blai 2 9 and canmx 3 19 respectively increasing as oil palm planting density increases tarigan et al 2018 used values of blai 3 6 and canmx 13 1 mm for a tree spacing of 8 m approximately 140 palm ha which is roughly in the middle of planting densities used in this work tarigan et al s 2018 values of blai and canmx fall roughly in the middle of the ranges found for these parameters in the present work field and modeling studies from southeast asia e g yusop et al 2007 adnan and atkinson 2011 van griensven et al 2014 merten et al 2016 dislich et al 2017 tarigan et al 2020 have demonstrated that conversion to oil palm plantations can substantially diminish streamflows at the watershed scale and on an average annual basis the results of this work imply that hydrologic impacts of oil palm conversion in this tropical latin american region are minimal even for the scenario with the greatest area of conversion pfa however it is important to recognize that impacts at the watershed scale are subdued in this case because of the high overall precipitation rate in the watershed 4000 mm yr and b the substantial fraction of land 40 in the watershed that cannot be converted due to high slopes and elevations on the other hand the results found here demonstrate that substantial impacts on local scale et and water yield can occur at the scale of the converted lands especially when seasonal and interannual variability are considered corroborating the findings of van griensven et al 2014 and tarigan et al 2018 the results also showed that impacts can be severe where precipitation rates are lower and where the converted land us has relatively low et rates for example simulation results indicated that the highest relative increase in et 53 and largest decrease in water yield 17 occurred in lower precipitation areas 3200 mm yr where evergreen forest is converted in the northern sub basin with 35 less precipitation simulations indicated a significant decline in the annual water yield 24 and a decrease in water yield of up to 50 in the low flow months of april to june these results point to the potentially acute hydrologic impacts of oil palm plantations in areas with lower precipitation such as other locations where oil palm is grown in the americas which have average annual precipitation between 1600 3500 mm year woittiez et al 2017 in areas with for example less than 3000 mm of rainfall the increases in et observed in the simulations presented here due to conversion to oil palm streamflows at the watershed scale could be critically diminished especially during dry seasons we find that even for a wet region such as tabasco streamflows decreased by 35 during the driest month for the case where approximately 60 of the watershed was converted finally areas where precipitation is expected to decline due to climate change may also be vulnerable to hydrologic impacts from palm oil conversion the results across the conversion scenarios indicate that the biomass production and the local hydrologic impacts measured as loss in volumetric water yield change linearly with the area of palm conversion including the pfa scenario however the pfa scenario involves planting on steeply sloped lands which could offer several disadvantages including the potential for higher erosion rates and added labor or machinery expenses corley and tinker 2008 in addition yields of oil palm have been known to decline on higher slopes because soils tend be shallower on higher slopes corley and tinker 2008 in the case of the study area however soil depths are relatively thick over all of the slopes in the pfa so shallow depths were not a factor in this case 5 conclusion the main objective of this work was to study the hydrological impacts and water biomass tradeoffs associated with the development of oil palm plantations for bioenergy production in a latin american context a swat model was used to simulate hydrologic fluxes and fruit production as a result of the conversion to a range of densities of oil palm from various land covers the most efficient planting density in terms of water use and fruit production yield was 150 palm ha hydrologic model simulations with this planting density indicated an 11 29 increase in the overall et rate of the watershed across the conversion scenarios however the higher water use did not result in a notable decline in the streamflow at the watershed scale due to the high average annual precipitation in this region over the converted area hydrologic model simulations indicated that the et rates of oil palm were significantly higher 51 compared to the converted land covers leading to a 15 decline in average annual water yield and up to a 35 decrease in monthly water yield from the converted area at the sub watershed scale areas with lower precipitation had significant declines in the annual water yield up to 24 and decreases in water yield of up to 50 in the low flow months of april to june further hydrologic extensions of this work could consider impacts of conversion to oil palm on hydrologic properties such as soil compaction which could result in higher runoff and consequently lower amounts of baseflow and diminished flows during low rainfall months in addition the potential negative impacts of oil palm conversion on water quality due to for example soil erosion and application of fertilizers could be simulated with a swat model however reliable water quality modeling will require careful long term observations of parameters such as suspended solids and nutrients finally since oil palm cultivation in low lying lands with relatively low permeability soils typically requires drainage in the impact of lowering the water table on seasonal flow needs to be investigated the local impacts of oil palm conversion on et and water yields from various land covers identified in this study will help regional planners in determining the proportions of land covers that should be maintained to ensure effective water flow regulations at the watershed scale in addition the tradeoffs between biomass energy production and hydrologic impacts found here have important implications in determining which bioenergy crops are most suitable for a given hydroclimatic region however an integrated analysis of the potential impacts of oil palm conversion on the range of ecosystem service and socioeconomic outcomes is required to fully understand the sustainability of oil palm as a bioenergy feedstock credit authorship contribution statement azad heidari conceptualization methodology writing original draft alex mayer

8321,study region oil palm cultivation has rapidly expanded worldwide due to demands for food oils and the potential for liquid fuel production however there is a scarcity of research on the hydrologic impacts of oil palm plantations at a watershed scale especially in latin america we focus on a watershed typical of intensive palm oil production in tabasco mexico study focus a soil and water assessment tool model was calibrated to simulate long term streamflow in the study watershed the plant growth module was calibrated for leaf area index lai and fruit yield simulations oil palm development scenarios were simulated to investigate the impacts of planting density and converted land cover types new hydrological insights for the region oil palm evapotranspiration rates were 51 higher on average than the converted land covers the higher water use reduced mean annual streamflow by only 9 at the watershed scale due to high precipitation in the upper watershed in contrast a 15

dislich et al 2017 tarigan et al 2020 research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation on hydrology has focused primarily on plot scale studies of ecohydrologic fluxes such as the impact of tree age on canopy rainfall interception farmanta and dedi 2015 chong et al 2018 and transpiration rates in palms with varying ages and grown on different slopes röll et al 2015 hardanto et al 2017 a small number of modeling studies have been used to investigate impacts from oil palm conversion focusing on nutrient cycling babel et al 2011 at the watershed scale and carbon water energy budgets at the plot scale manoli et al 2018 the tradeoffs between oil palm production and hydrologic impacts have been acknowledged but there are no studies of how management of oil palm cultivation could mitigate these tradeoffs at the plantation and watershed scales ultimately optimizing water use and oil palm production could result in more efficient land use and reduce conversion from natural landscapes moreover while most of the studies on impacts of oil palm cultivation on hydrology have focused on southeast asia there is little published on these impacts in tropical latin america regions experiencing oil palm expansion gilroy et al 2015 furumo and aide 2017 while deforestation due to oil palm cultivation occurs in latin america vijay et al 2016 as in southeast asia the primary mode of conversion in latin america is the transformation of cattle pasture to oil palm furumo and aide 2017 ramankutty and graesser 2017 thus there is little information on how land use change from existing land use to oil palm cultivation impacts or will impact hydrologic cycling in the tropical latin america setting our study area is located in the mexican states of tabasco and chiapas which underwent rapid deforestation to pasture lands in the late 1900s and is now experiencing oil palm conversion at a rapid rate in mexico at large oil palm cultivated area increased 485 from 2003 to 2017 faostat 2017 the goal of this study is to determine how oil palm cultivation practices impact hydrologic cycling including evapotranspiration et streamflows and water yields at local and watershed scales in a latin american setting a calibrated soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 hydrologic agronomic model is used to simulate hydrologic fluxes and oil palm fruit production the simulation results are synthesized to assess tradeoffs between hydrologic impact e g streamflows and water yields and bioenergy feedstock production e g oil palm production for a range of management scenarios management scenarios based on the land use classes to be converted from present use to oil palm oil palm planting densities and maximum land slopes are formulated and simulated to investigate how tradeoffs between oil palm fruit production and streamflow change with spatial scale and alternative management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site calibration and validation the study watershed which includes areas in tabasco and chiapas mexico fig 1 was selected based on data availability and proximity to existing oil palm plantations in the region the watershed land use is predominantly pasture for cattle raising crop production and forests the majority of the remaining forest is found at higher elevations and slopes long term daily flow records from the pichucalco hydrologic station http www conagua gob mx were used for hydrologic calibration and validation purposes the contributing area to the gauge was estimated as 361 km2 based on 15 meter resolution digital elevation model provided by the national institute of statistics and geography instituto nacional de estadística y geografía inegi 2020 the simulated watershed was extended 22 km downstream of the pichucalco hydrologic station to capture more low slope areas typical of oil palm plantations in the study region resulting in a watershed area of 561 km2 a customized streamline shapefile from conagua http www conagua gob mx was used for stream delineation land use land cover lulc maps for 2000 and 2014 and soil maps were obtained from inegi maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation were compiled from the national climatological database base de datos climatológica nacional http clicom mex cicese mx in addition climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr global weather data https globalweather tamu edu was added to the swat weather database fuka et al 2014 spatial interpolation of the climate data indicates that the area receives an average of almost four meters 3960 mm of precipitation annually with the majority of rainfall occurring during june to october see fig 2 precipitation is higher in the southern portion of the watershed see fig 1 where elevation increases to 2100 m asl the average annual temperature in the watershed is 25 2 c with slight variation across the watershed fig 2 shows the intra annual variation of streamflow temperature and precipitation the highest monthly average streamflow is in october as a result of heavy rain events with the lowest flow months occurring in march through may streamflows are higher than precipitation in the cool weather months october through march because baseflows contribute to a greater amount of streamflow during those months 116 mm yr on average in the cool weather months vs 80 mm yr in the remaining months hydrologic and vegetation growth models were set up in swat to allow the investigation of oil palm planting density and the impacts of land conversion policies arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 winchell et al 2013 was used to incorporate the year 2000 land use land cover lulc map for the region which most closely aligns with the historical streamflow data the watershed was divided into 9 sub watersheds and 142 non contiguous hydrologic response units hrus which represent homogeneous areas within each sub basin with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope class thresholds of 0 10 and 10 were selected for lulc soils and slope classes respectively for the hru definition calibration and validation focused on both the hydrological and plant growth components of the model the hydrologic calibration and validation was performed with 22 years from 1962 to 1983 of daily streamflow to include a combination of dry and wet years in both the calibration period 1962 1973 and validation period 1974 1983 a baseflow separation procedure was first conducted on the streamflow time series arnold and allen 1999 http www envsys co kr swatbflow resulting in a ratio of baseflow to total flow ranging from 0 35 to 0 50 on an annual basis next a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the swatcup sufi2 software abbaspour 2013 which involved running thousands of simulations and applying statistical tests to identify the parameters explaining greater variability in the model output the most sensitive parameters were grouped according to the hydrologic flux that was most sensitive to the particular parameter including runoff baseflow routing and et and each grouping of parameters was varied one at a time performance metrics used in calibration and validation included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the ratio of simulated baseflow to total flow was required to be within the observed range 0 35 0 50 which resulted in slight adjustments after the initial calibration final adjusted parameter values for the hydrologic calibration are presented in table s1 in the supplementary materials in order of sensitivity full descriptions of each parameter are presented in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 calibration of the plant growth model in swat followed a multi step procedure based on comparing lai biomass and fruit yield growth to field measurements similar to the procedure in heidari et al 2019 the first step of the calibration process involved varying the sensitive lai growth related parameters which include maximum potential lai blai and the values of points that define the lai seasonal development and decline relationship frgrw1 frgwrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and dlai since it is recognized that swat typically does not simulate perennial vegetation growth in the tropics adequately see for example alemayehu et al 2017 special attention was paid to adjusting the lai seasonal relationship parameters so that lai did not exhibit dormancy at any time during the growth cycle second biomass production which comprises the total mass of the palms was calibrated by changing the radiation use efficiency bio e and light extinction coefficient ext coef parameters third harvest index parameters which relate the fruit yield to biomass were adjusted hvsti and hi ovr the lai biomass and fruit yield growth models were calibrated with reported values from studies with different planting densities lamade and setiyo 1996 corley and tinker 2008 ishak and awal 2007 gerritsma and wessel 1997 goh 1982 higher ranges of reported values in the literature were used for matching fruit yield since it was assumed that the palms are fully fertilized and water stress is unlikely due to high precipitation the final adjusted parameter values for the vegetation growth model are presented in table s2 in the supplementary materials full descriptions of these parameters are found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 potential et is calculated in swat with a penman monteith model requiring the hydroclimatic time series inputs described previously actual et is dependent on canopy interception of precipitation which in turn is controlled by lai and maximum canopy storage values measured values of precipitation interception for oil plam chong et al 2018 farmanta and dedi 2015 were used calibrate the maximum canopy interception parameter canmx see table s2 in the supplementary materials for the range of calibrated values following the procedure of arnold 2012 since the lai models were calibrated for a range of planting densities the actual et varies with the particular planting density 2 2 modeling scenarios the calibrated and validated model is used to simulate a range of oil palm conversion scenarios in general conversion to oil palm and subsequent fruit production are simulated as a initial planting of nursery stock in the first year of conversion b a yield building phase which lasts up to three years after planting yap during which the canopy is not closed and no fruit is harvested c a linear increase in fruits yield phase a 4 7 yap d a mature or plateau yield phase 8 14 yap e a yield decline phase 15 25 yap and f removal of the tree at 25 yap woittiez et al 2017 fairhurst and griffiths 2014 five planting densities were simulated see table 1 for each land use conversion scenario the most recent lulc map 2014 see land cover change analysis in table s3 in the supplementary materials is used to represent the base case scenario and assess the impacts of converting from existing t land cover types to oil palm analysis of land use change from 2000 to 2014 indicates that approximately 10 of forest land was converted to agriculture and pasture during that period although the 2014 land cover map represents a period substantially later than the period of record for the hydroclimatic time series used in the calibration the only parameter related to land cover that was adjusted during calibration was the curve number cn the calibrated cn values for each land use type and the other previously calibrated parameters are used for the new setup the impacts of allowing or disallowing conversion of existing cropland areas are simulated to assess policies of prohibiting land use competition between food crops and crops with potential industrial uses such as using palm oil for biofuels while current guidelines for optimal yield and minimizing soil erosion woittiez et al 2017 paramananthan 2013 indicate that plantations occur on lands with slopes less than 12 corley and tinker 2008 furumo and aide 2017 we also allow oil palm conversion on slopes as high as 30 to simulate the intensification of palm oil production due to higher demand and or prices the resulting four scenarios are then a base case b conversion of pasture and forest pf scenario to oil palm on lands with slopes 12 127 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 124 m above sea level masl c conversion of crop pasture and forest pfa scenario on lands with slopes 12 214 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 132 masl and d conversion of crop pasture and forest pfa on lands with slopes 30 346 km2 converted average elevation of converted land 219 masl table 2 shows the areas of land use classes converted for each of the scenarios following a warm up period to obtain initial conditions each scenario simulation occurred over the 20 year period using the 1964 1983 hydroclimatic time series the green water footprint is the volumetric water consumption associated with consumption of precipitation stored in the soil by a given production process that is otherwise available for evapotranspiration the green water footprint is used as a metric to compare for example water to energy efficiency for biofuels and other energy sources hoekstra and chapagain 2006 chiu and wu 2013 we report the green water use per mass of biomass and by using literature values for the expected energy generated per unit of biomass we convert the green water consumption per mass to green water consumption per unit of energy generated gerbens leenes et al 2009 we then compare the green water footprints to literature values for oil palm fruit production and other biofuel feedstocks 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation comparison of simulated and observed monthly discharges is shown in fig 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 72 r2 of 0 74 and pbias of 4 5 for the entire simulation period indicates very good hydrologic model performance moriasi et al 2007 table s4 gives complete details of the model performance statistics for the calibration and verification periods as shown in fig 4 comparison of the simulated versus measured oil palm yields demonstrates that the calibration of the plant growth model was reliable r2 0 81 over all phases of fruit production final adjusted parameter values for the hydrologic and vegetation growth model calibration are presented in tables s1 and s2 respectively in the supplementary materials area weighted average values of the fitted curve numbers for the land covers were as follows oil palm cn 75 4 agriculture cn 88 6 pasture cn 79 4 forest averaged over mixed evergreen deciduous and mixed forest cn 69 0 3 2 optimal planting density comparison across planting densities fig 4 shows that the highest fruit production occurs with an average planting density of 150 palm ha at planting densities lower than 150 palm ha the yields are lower simply because there are fewer oil palms per cultivated area while planting densities greater than 150 palm ha are more productive in earlier years competition for solar radiation causes a rapid decline in the yield starting in year 7 or 8 for the high planting densities in the vegetation growth sub model fruit yield is a function of intercepted solar radiation and radiation use efficiency rue rue does not change with tree age but light interception lai and fruit yield increase with oil palm age however the fruit production simulations account for a decline in yield at a threshold around lai of 6 as observed by breure 2010 due to competition for solar radiation resulting in the simulated declines in fruit production for higher planting densities fig 5 shows the annual fruit yield versus the annual additional water use for all planting densities and scenarios additional water use is defined as the difference between et for the base case and et for a given conversion scenario for the converted land these results indicate that for every scenario the 150 palm ha planting density is the most efficient in terms of maximizing fruit production and minimizing additional water use the increasing trend in efficiency from lower planting densities 55 and 105 palm ha to the 150 palm ha planting density reflects a greater fractional increase in fruit production due to the greater number of palms see fig 4 than the corresponding fractional increase in water use the smaller fractional increase in water use compared to the increase in fruit production is due to the lower sensitivity of et to lai as compared to the sensitivity of fruit production to lai the efficiency decreases when planting density increases from 150 palm ha indicating that fruit production decreases and water use increases while the fruit yield declines steeply with planting density greater than 150 palm ha see fig 4 due to the threshold lai that indicates radiative crowding the increase in lai with planting density tends to slightly increase the et rate since the overall pattern of efficiency of water use per biomass production is similar across the planting densities fig 5 results for only the most efficient density of 150 palm ha are reported in the remaining text 3 3 hydrologic impacts in converted areas table 2 shows changes in average annual et and yield for the land areas converted to oil palm for the three conversion scenarios relative to the bau scenario these results show that the et rate increases over a range of 36 52 due to conversion to oil palm with a corresponding decrease in water yield ranging from 11 to 17 et rates for the converted oil palm ranged from 1210 to 1340 mm yr with a mean of 1270 mm yr the higher et rates for oil palm compared to the prior land uses are due to higher water use rates and higher lai values in general higher changes in et are found for conversion from the pasture and evergreen forest since these land covers tended to have lower et rates because of lower lai and water use rates respectively the results in fig 5 show that both the volumetric water use and fruit yield increase roughly linearly with the area of converted land for each scenario pf 127 km2 converted pfa 214 km2 converted pfa 346 km2 converted the results in table 2 also show that the increase in et and subsequent decrease in water yield somewhat diminish from the pf to the pfa and pfa scenarios this trend can be explained by the mixture of land uses that are converted in each scenario in the pfa scenario the additional converted agricultural land produces a slightly smaller increase in et compared to the other land conversions in the pf scenario resulting in a small decrease in the change overall et for the pfa scenario 49 compared to the pf scenario 51 however for the pfa scenario the converted land classes have higher et rates to begin with because of the higher elevation in the watershed which has the effect of reducing the increase overall et rate substantially for the pfa scenario 39 compared to the pfa scenario 49 while the annual average increase in et and decrease in water yield are substantial the simulated monthly et for the base case and the pf scenario shown in fig 6 indicate that the seasonal impacts can be even greater in march and april et increases by 100 relative to the base case due to higher temperatures and the palms reaching the yearly maximum lai for these months the error bars in fig 6 indicate the standard deviation of et across the 20 year simulation period the widths of the error bars for the pf conversion scenario are substantially greater due both to the higher mean et values and the higher sensitivity of et rates to annual variations in climate for the pf oil palm conversion case than for the base case in particular the month of may displays an exceptionally high variability in et across the 20 years during the driest years 1971 and 1977 average precipitation of 2923 mm compared to annual precipitation of 3962 mm the increase in et and decrease in water yield were 60 and 23 respectively for the pf case compared to the base case on average the month of may has the greatest changes in water yield with a reduction as large as 60 in the driest year similar patterns of seasonal and inter annual variations in et were observed in the simulations of the pfa and pfa scenarios see figure s2 annual variations in the et rate also depend but to a lesser extent on the life cycle of oil palm as the lai increases and eventually reaches the maximum value in year 10 see figure s1 fig 7 shows the average monthly decrease in water yield for the converted area for the pf scenario relative to the base case the mean decreases are highest in may due to lower rainfall and especially high temperatures see fig 2 with decreases higher than 50 in the driest years again similar patterns of seasonal and inter annual variations in water yield were observed in the pfa and pfa scenario simulations see figure s3 3 4 watershed scale impacts from land conversion scenarios the model simulations indicate higher water use throughout the watershed as a result of oil palm conversions planting oil palm increases the et rate over the whole watershed by 11 18 and 29 for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively compared to the base case scenario due to the high annual precipitation rates in the watershed especially in the southern portions of the watershed where the elevation increases above 2100 m asl the increases in et only slightly affect the streamflow at the outlet with 3 6 and 9 declines in average annual streamflows for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively interannual variation in climate produces a slightly larger decrease in the streamflow due to oil palm conversion in some years during the driest years 1977 and 1971 annual streamflow at the outlet declines by 5 0 8 6 and 13 5 under the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively relative to the base case scenario in contrast during the wet years highest 25th percentile annual precipitation streamflow at the outlet decreases by an average of 3 5 and 8 for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively fig 8 shows the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of monthly watershed scale streamflow for the base case pf pfa and pfa scenarios over the simulation period the cdfs for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios are almost identical in terms of the deviation from the base case scenario except for the magnitude of low flows for example the 90 exceedance flow for the pf and pfa scenarios differ from the base case scenario by 16 and 35 respectively at the sub basin level the simulation results indicate that sub basin 1 fig 1 will experience the greatest decline 24 in average annual water yield as a result of oil palm expansion for all three scenarios on a seasonal basis during the low flow months of april may and june streamflow will decrease 50 on average the significant decline in annual and seasonal streamflows in sub basin 1 is due to the low average annual precipitation in the sub basin 2580 mm year which is 35 lower than the watershed wide average for sub basin 2 which has 50 more rainfall than sub basin 1 3841 mm year the decline in average annual water yield in sub basin 2 was only 14 although the fraction of converted land in sub basin 2 was identical to that for sub basin 1 for the pf scenario 3 5 green water footprint the simulations indicate an et water requirement of 0 98 to 1 4 m3 to produce 1 kg of dry fruit across the scenarios this range is similar to the range of 1 1 to 1 4 m3 water kg fruit reported by pleanjai et al 2007 for oil palm cultivation in malaysia assuming each kilogram of fresh fruit dry weight can produce 0 30 kg of fuel pleanjai et al 2007 the green water footprint is 3300 m3 of water per 1 m3 of biodiesel biodiesel density 874 7 kg m3 usdoe further assuming that the liquid fuel would have an energy content similar to conventional diesel fuels 43 mj kg international gas union 2019 the green water footprint is 87 m3 water gj babel et al 2011 reports a slightly higher value of 110 m3 gj for biodiesel derived from oil palm in thailand if the green water footprint is calculated based on the additional et relative to the base case scenario shown in table s6 the green water footprint is 0 34 m3 kg of biomass or 25 2 m3 gj of energy in addition to conversion of the oil palm fruit 50 70 tons ha of biomass residue in the form of fiber shell palm kernel fronds and trunks can be collected over the life span of the oil palm salathong 2007 the simulations conducted here indicate a total biomass production of 57 ton ha including fruit above and below ground biomass with 34 tons of biomass left as residue at the end of the 20 year simulation period this residual is equivalent to an extra 323 gj ha or a total of 4 0 6 9 and 11 2 million gj of bioethanol energy for the pf pfa and pfa scenarios respectively over the roughly 20 year lifetime of the oil palms 4 discussion the et rates for the converted oil palm ranged from 1210 to 1340 mm yr for the 150 palm ha planting density these values of et are on the lower end of values found in the literature including henson et al 2007 arshad 2014 meijide et al 2018 tarigan et al 2018 and fan et al 2019 who report mean et rates from 1300 to 1800 mm yr for sites in indonesia and malaysia the lower et for the tabasco site compared to the southeastern asia sites could be due to differences in climate planting densities and other hydrologic and vegetation conditions however one likely explanation is that the southeastern asian sites are located close to the equator compared to the mean latitude of 17 5 for the tabasco site which would lead to correspondingly lower solar radiation and et in the tabasco site the calibrated curve number for oil palm in this study was cn 75 4 areally averaged over all of the soil types which is in the middle of the range of curve numbers found by tarigan et al 2016 for oil palm of cn 67 89 with cn increasing as soils are less permeable as tarigan et al 2016 2018 have reported conversion of forested land oil palm can lead to soil compaction the curve number for oil palm found here is substantially higher than the average curve number for forest cover 69 0 which is an indirect indication that the soils were modified when converted for forest to land cover in this work however other soil parameters such as bulk density and available water content were constant for each soil type and were not adjusted based on land cover the maximum lai and calibrated maximum canopy interception ranged from blai 2 9 and canmx 3 19 respectively increasing as oil palm planting density increases tarigan et al 2018 used values of blai 3 6 and canmx 13 1 mm for a tree spacing of 8 m approximately 140 palm ha which is roughly in the middle of planting densities used in this work tarigan et al s 2018 values of blai and canmx fall roughly in the middle of the ranges found for these parameters in the present work field and modeling studies from southeast asia e g yusop et al 2007 adnan and atkinson 2011 van griensven et al 2014 merten et al 2016 dislich et al 2017 tarigan et al 2020 have demonstrated that conversion to oil palm plantations can substantially diminish streamflows at the watershed scale and on an average annual basis the results of this work imply that hydrologic impacts of oil palm conversion in this tropical latin american region are minimal even for the scenario with the greatest area of conversion pfa however it is important to recognize that impacts at the watershed scale are subdued in this case because of the high overall precipitation rate in the watershed 4000 mm yr and b the substantial fraction of land 40 in the watershed that cannot be converted due to high slopes and elevations on the other hand the results found here demonstrate that substantial impacts on local scale et and water yield can occur at the scale of the converted lands especially when seasonal and interannual variability are considered corroborating the findings of van griensven et al 2014 and tarigan et al 2018 the results also showed that impacts can be severe where precipitation rates are lower and where the converted land us has relatively low et rates for example simulation results indicated that the highest relative increase in et 53 and largest decrease in water yield 17 occurred in lower precipitation areas 3200 mm yr where evergreen forest is converted in the northern sub basin with 35 less precipitation simulations indicated a significant decline in the annual water yield 24 and a decrease in water yield of up to 50 in the low flow months of april to june these results point to the potentially acute hydrologic impacts of oil palm plantations in areas with lower precipitation such as other locations where oil palm is grown in the americas which have average annual precipitation between 1600 3500 mm year woittiez et al 2017 in areas with for example less than 3000 mm of rainfall the increases in et observed in the simulations presented here due to conversion to oil palm streamflows at the watershed scale could be critically diminished especially during dry seasons we find that even for a wet region such as tabasco streamflows decreased by 35 during the driest month for the case where approximately 60 of the watershed was converted finally areas where precipitation is expected to decline due to climate change may also be vulnerable to hydrologic impacts from palm oil conversion the results across the conversion scenarios indicate that the biomass production and the local hydrologic impacts measured as loss in volumetric water yield change linearly with the area of palm conversion including the pfa scenario however the pfa scenario involves planting on steeply sloped lands which could offer several disadvantages including the potential for higher erosion rates and added labor or machinery expenses corley and tinker 2008 in addition yields of oil palm have been known to decline on higher slopes because soils tend be shallower on higher slopes corley and tinker 2008 in the case of the study area however soil depths are relatively thick over all of the slopes in the pfa so shallow depths were not a factor in this case 5 conclusion the main objective of this work was to study the hydrological impacts and water biomass tradeoffs associated with the development of oil palm plantations for bioenergy production in a latin american context a swat model was used to simulate hydrologic fluxes and fruit production as a result of the conversion to a range of densities of oil palm from various land covers the most efficient planting density in terms of water use and fruit production yield was 150 palm ha hydrologic model simulations with this planting density indicated an 11 29 increase in the overall et rate of the watershed across the conversion scenarios however the higher water use did not result in a notable decline in the streamflow at the watershed scale due to the high average annual precipitation in this region over the converted area hydrologic model simulations indicated that the et rates of oil palm were significantly higher 51 compared to the converted land covers leading to a 15 decline in average annual water yield and up to a 35 decrease in monthly water yield from the converted area at the sub watershed scale areas with lower precipitation had significant declines in the annual water yield up to 24 and decreases in water yield of up to 50 in the low flow months of april to june further hydrologic extensions of this work could consider impacts of conversion to oil palm on hydrologic properties such as soil compaction which could result in higher runoff and consequently lower amounts of baseflow and diminished flows during low rainfall months in addition the potential negative impacts of oil palm conversion on water quality due to for example soil erosion and application of fertilizers could be simulated with a swat model however reliable water quality modeling will require careful long term observations of parameters such as suspended solids and nutrients finally since oil palm cultivation in low lying lands with relatively low permeability soils typically requires drainage in the impact of lowering the water table on seasonal flow needs to be investigated the local impacts of oil palm conversion on et and water yields from various land covers identified in this study will help regional planners in determining the proportions of land covers that should be maintained to ensure effective water flow regulations at the watershed scale in addition the tradeoffs between biomass energy production and hydrologic impacts found here have important implications in determining which bioenergy crops are most suitable for a given hydroclimatic region however an integrated analysis of the potential impacts of oil palm conversion on the range of ecosystem service and socioeconomic outcomes is required to fully understand the sustainability of oil palm as a bioenergy feedstock credit authorship contribution statement azad heidari conceptualization methodology writing original draft alex mayer

8322,study region the lockyer catchment queensland australia study focus future rainfall projections are usually presented as a percentage change from current climate where current climate is defined using relatively short instrumental records however palaeoclimate reconstructions demonstrate that instrumental data does not capture the full range of climate variability that has occurred understanding natural climate variability and how it compares to climate model projections for the future requires the use of a instrumental and palaeoclimate data to quantify the range of historical variability and b climate model data to quantify if how things could change in the future considering this we compare instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics for the lockyer catchment new hydrologic insights for the region we found that in the lockyer catchment instrumental data insufficiently captures past variability and plausible projections of rainfall decreases in the future we also found that at mid 21st and late 21st century time periods decreases in annual average rainfall rainfall variability and ninetieth percentile rainfall outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible also when considering variability in the palaeoclimate record compounded with projected rainfall trends much larger decreases in rainfall are plausible than when only considering instrumental and projected rainfall the implications of these results are discussed in terms of a calculating the sustainable yield of water supply catchments and b estimating catchment runoff using hydrological models keywords paleoclimate climate change modelling water management 1 introduction in australia current water management plans and associated infrastructure have been developed using statistics derived from a relatively short 100 year instrumental record franks 2002 verdon kidd and kiem 2010 however interannual to multidecadal fluctuations in various oceanatmospheric processes e g el niño southern oscillation enso interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo the complex interactions between such processes and the various spatial and temporal rainfall responses to such interactions highlight the need for more extensive data describing the climate system than that available in the instrumental record verdon kidd and kiem 2009 johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 gergis and henley 2017 palaeoclimate reconstructions based on proxy data offer a potential solution to this issue contextualising instrumental climate and providing more robust baseline statistics that describe the climate system griffin and anchukaitis 2014 ho et al 2015 vance et al 2015 these reconstructions can be inferred using local proxy data i e tree rings allen et al

2017 these independently sourced palaeoclimate reconstructions can provide multiple lines of evidence regarding the nature of past climate variability kiem et al 2016 australian reconstructions extending beyond the last 500 years show that the wet and dry epochs observed in the instrumental record are not unprecedented in terms of duration severity and intensity and are within the confines of natural variability verdon kidd et al 2017 palmer et al 2015 vance et al 2015 tozer et al 2016 for example vance et al 2015 identified the occurrence of eight megadroughts 5 years in southeastern australia over the last millennium the longest being 39 years given droughts of this severity have not occurred in the instrumental period this highlights limitations with using instrumental data to calculate hydroclimatic risk when developing water management plans and infrastructure tozer et al 2018 considering this recent research the translation of palaeoclimate information into a useful format for water managers has been identified as a key future research area in australian flood and drought adaptation johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 however incorporating palaeoclimate data into the development and testing of water management plans comes with unique challenges issues such as the unavailability of palaeoclimate records that are statistically related to climate in a specific catchment palaeoclimate records of insufficient length to record the full extent of natural variability and palaeoclimate records of unsuitable format for inclusion in hydrological models are barriers to the application of palaeoclimate data in water management tingstad et al 2014 such issues need to be directly accounted for if water management strategies are to be robust under natural climate variability into the future although palaeoclimate reconstructions provide helpful insights regarding the extent of natural climate variability consideration of past climate alone does not necessarily equate to a secure water source in the future how anthropogenic climate change will influence future rainfall in relation to variability in the instrumental and palaeoclimate reconstructions must also be considered kiem and verdon kidd 2011 such information is obtained from global climate models gcms the main tools for projecting future climate the various gcm rainfall projections for australia differ in sign and magnitude and at regional scales are biased for example annual rainfall in southeast queensland is projected to change 4 8 22 1 by 2090 under a high emissions future irving et al 2012 further examples of australian rainfall projection uncertainty can be found in grose et al 2015 and dowdy et al 2015 gcms also simulate climate at a relatively coarse horizontal resolution 200 km x 200 km so cannot properly account for sub grid scale processes such as topographical heterogeneities and convective cloud processes that influence regional rainfall rummukainen 2010 hence rainfall processes are parameterised which can cause uncertainty between models and bias with respect to observations gcm rainfall projections are also typically presented as a percent change with respect to a subset of rainfall in the instrumental record for example the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report examined projected rainfall changes with respect to a 1986 2005 baseline collins et al 2013 projections are rarely analyzed with respect to natural variability evident in the palaeoclimate record or even the full range of variability evident in the instrumental record given that palaeoclimate reconstructions typically reveal past natural climate variability not captured in the instrumental record analysing projected climate change within a palaeoclimate context provides greater insights as to how climate may change in future with respect to the past ault et al 2014 provides an example of how palaeoclimate projected and instrumental data can be better used to characterise drought risk when all available hydroclimatic data i e instrumental palaeoclimate and projected was considered they calculated an 80 chance of multi decadal drought occurring in the southwest united states over the next century which was previously thought to be 50 when only instrumental and projected rainfall were considered in an australian based study cook et al 2016 examined the future trajectory of east australian hydroclimatic extremes within the context of the australia and new zealand summer drought atlas anzda of palmer et al 2015 a palaeoclimate reconstruction of the palmer drought severity index pdsi in late 21st century projections for coastal queensland the probability of a pdsi value equal to or drier than the lowest value in the anzda which had an instrumental period probability of 1 was found to be 5 these studies highlight the utility of analysing projected climate change within a context of natural variability in the palaeoclimate record and suggest limitations with approaches that analyse gcm projections with respect to an instrumental record subset if the instrumental record does not capture the full extent of past hydroclimatic variability how can anthropogenic influences on hydroclimate be understood if comparing projections to instrumental record subsets limited research has been conducted analysing gcm projections within context of the longer term past particularly at the catchment scale that water management decisions are made examining how rainfall has changed prior to the instrumental period and how it might change in the future under global warming also has significant implications for our understanding of the rainfall runoff relationship and therefore catchment yields traditional water management approaches have considered this relationship stationary meaning that for a particular catchment the proportion of unit runoff change per unit rainfall change is constant however for some catchments the strength of the rainfall runoff relationship will vary i e is non stationary saft et al 2015 as these non stationarities have been identified during the instrumental period if pre instrumental variability and gcm projection uncertainty are outside the confines of instrumental variability limitations with treating the rainfall runoff relationship as stationary will be amplified understanding the physical processes driving non stationary rainfall runoff relationships is an ongoing area of research although climate variability plays an important role the internal catchment responses to climate variability which will vary between catchments have a greater influence on rainfall runoff non stationarity saft et al 2016 deb et al 2019b for example variations in the interactions between surface water sw and groundwater gw whereby fluctuations in the groundwater table can change the sign of the groundwater contributions to the surface water i e change from a loosing stream to a gaining stream can drive variations in the rainfall runoff relationship deb et al 2019a 2019b changes in vegetation cover and behaviour under climate variability ajami et al 2017 or enhanced atmospheric c02 chiew et al 2014 may also contribute to observed rainfall runoff non stationarity the dynamic response of internal catchment processes to climate variability which drive non stationary rainfall runoff relationships can explain the difficulties in extrapolating observed catchment behaviour to different climate conditions a significant problem in assessing future water system performance therefore in order to better understand the roles that these processes may have in estimating future runoff quantifying the range of possible catchment climates both past and future is crucial as such the aim of this study is to compare past instrumental and palaeoclimate rainfall variability and future rainfall projections in the lockyer catchment queensland australia fig 1 this catchment was selected because catchment rainfall varies at interannual and multidecadal time scales power et al 1999 the rainfall runoff relationship in the catchment in non stationary cui et al 2018 instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall data are available for the catchment vance et al 2013 kiem et al 2020 the comparison of instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall data is the first step in assessing the strength of current water management strategies and informing the development of robust adaptation strategies that ensure water security under climate variability and change in this study we will examine if the instrumental record in the lockyer catchment captures natural variability in the palaeoclimate record and if projected changes in future rainfall are within or outside the confines of instrumental palaeoclimate variability the implications of this analysis for water management strategies developed using instrumental data and for current hydrological modelling practices are then discussed although our analysis is focused on lockyer catchment rainfall the results and implications of this study can be generalised to other catchments with a climate influenced by sources

instrumental period was derived from the australian water availability project awap dataset which provides gridded rainfall data across australia at a 5 km spatial resolution raupach et al 2009 the average of the awap rainfall grids lying within the lockyer catchment boundary was calculated from 1900 to 2015 and used for further analysis this time series period is hereafter referred to as instrumental rainfall and the instrumental period respectively throughout this paper 2 2 palaeoclimate rainfall reconstruction the palaeoclimate rainfall reconstruction of vance et al 2015 was used for this study providing area averaged lockyer catchment annual rainfall from 1000 to 2012 area averaged rainfall was calculated by first reconstructing the individual awap grids lying within the catchment boundary using a linear regression reconstruction model then averaging the reconstructed grid values for each year the reconstruction is based upon a statistically significant correlation between east australian rainfall and summer sea salt accumulation at the law dome ice core in east antarctica which are both influenced by atmospheric circulation patterns driven by enso ipo variability vance et al 2013 2015 the correlation between the law dome proxy and lockyer catchment rainfall varies between ipo phases with a statistically significant correlation during ipo positive pearson correlation of 0 41 and no significant correlation during ipo negative kiem et al 2020 as such this reconstruction can be used to analyse pre instrumental rainfall during ipo positive phases which in the lockyer catchment and in general eastern australia are associated with dry conditions power et al 1999 for a more detailed analysis explanation of the reconstruction used in this study including a comparison of drought risk quantified using the instrumental rainfall record versus the 1000 year rainfall reconstruction refer to kiem et al 2020 although there are other proxies reconstructions that could have been used for this study this reconstruction was selected as it a captures a prolonged period of decreased rainfall occurring from 1000 to 1150 ce and b is annually resolved annually resolved reconstructions derived from biological proxies i e tree ring width coral luminescence were not considered as they were of insufficient length to capture this dry period and other east australian reconstructions that did capture this dry period i e barr et al 2019 were not annually resolved statistics derived from the driest 116 year period coinciding with the length of the awap time series in the 1013 year reconstruction 1146 1261 ce hereafter referred to as palaeo dry were used for further analysis 2 3 climate model rainfall projections gcm simulations of rainfall were taken from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 cmip5 provides a coordinated experimental framework under which gcms are run details available in taylor et al 2012 gcm simulations using representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were examined in this study historical simulations of rainfall were taken from 1900 to 2005 the time period with rainfall data overlapping instrumental rainfall gcm future projections were separated into different time periods 2041 2060 mid 21st century climate and 2081 2100 late 21st century climate 3 methods 3 1 climate model selection climate models were selected for this study using the climate change in australia climate futures detailed projections tool available at https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en climateprojections climate futures tool detailed projections the climate futures detailed projections tool provides the projected percent change in average annual rainfall for various rcp time period with respect to a 1986 2005 baseline seen in cmip5 gcms over a region of interest clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 for each rcp time period outlined in section 3 3 we selected the cmip5 model showing the greatest decrease in average annual rainfall for the region covering the lockyer catchment table 1 gcms explicitly advised against use as a representative model for the region on the ccia website https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en recommendations on this website are based on the comprehensive model evaluation study of moise et al 2015 were not considered this approach captured the lowest plausible bound on gcm uncertainty for each scenario time period note that for some gcms the same cmip5 experiments i e rcp8 5 historical have been simulated with different initial states start up methods and physics scheme parameterisations for this analysis the choice of ensemble member had little influence on the resultant projection statistics see table s1 in the supplementary material as such if a gcm had multiple ensemble members for either the historical or future simulations the first ensemble member denoted as r1i1p1 using the rip nomenclature associated with each gcm simulation was selected for further analysis for each time period we also analysed projected data for the next driest model see table s3 and table s4 in the supplementary material these projections were similar to those from the models shown in table 1 given the relatively small size of the study catchment relative to the coarse horizontal resolution of gcm grids downscaled projections could better capture spatial changes in rainfall however considering that the application of different statistical or dynamical downscaling methods does not provide a consistent projection signal different from the cmip5 ensemble in eastern australia grose et al 2015 and that downscaling adds little value to coarser resolution gridded data for the study area di virgilio et al 2020 downscaled climate model projections were not considered although we did not use downscaled projections it should be noted that specific downscaling methods may introduce greater rainfall projection uncertainty in eastern australia than that evident in the cmip5 gcm ensemble grose et al 2015 for an in depth look at climate model projections for the study area we refer the reader to grose et al 2015 and grose et al 2020 please note that in subsequent post processing stochastic modelling and analysis of the projected data we are treating transient time slices i e a small section of a trending time series as a stable climate i e has reached an equilibrium with no forced trend this comes with limitations as for a given rcp scenario the use of transient versus longer term projections which have reached a quasi equilibrium for example the extended rcp experiments that continue out to 2300 can result in different estimates of regional climate variability king et al 2020 however not all of the selected models have extended simulations that allow analysis of stable projected climates and we considered sampling the lower bound of gcm uncertainty to be more important for our study 3 2 post processing of climate model rainfall data given the tendency for gcm simulations of instrumental period climate to have systematic biases in relation to observed climate values i e instrumental measurements and the assumption that this bias will hold for future projections climate projections are typically post processed to remove this bias johnson and sharma 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 nguyen et al 2017 this study used a distribution based change factor cf approach at a quartile resolution as a post processing method chiew et al 2003 this approach calculates the relative change in average rainfall the cf at quartile n seen in the modelled future climate μmf with respect to that in the modelled historical i e instrumental period climate μmc eq 1 the cf is then applied to the observed awap annual rainfall total p in year x within corresponding quartile n to obtain a scaled rainfall time series eq 2 1 cf n μmf fn μmc n 2 pscaled x n pobserved x n cf n the application of a cf was used in this study as a means of conserving the relative rainfall trends seen in the model projections while removing bias in the raw gcm outputs although the cf approach is not an explicit bias correction method by applying the projected changes seen in gcm simulations to the instrumental period we remove the need to use raw gcm outputs and the biases that are associated with them a distribution based approach was implemented as it can better preserve any changes in variability present in model simulations compared to mean based approaches yang et al 2010 anandhi et al 2011 the cf approach is also one of the recommended methods for the creation of application ready climate change data for use in detailed climate impact statements in australia csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 and has been used in numerous climate change impact studies kiem et al 2008 kirby et al 2014 mortazavi naeini et al 2015 cfs derived from all gcm scenarios presented in table 1 were applied to the instrumental instrumental period catchment average from 1900 to 2015 and palaeo dry reconstructed catchment average from 1146 to 1261 ce rainfall time series this accounts for the natural variability in the instrumental palaeoclimate records compounded with the largest plausible rainfall trend seen in gcm projections and allowed a comparison of plausible worst case scenarios i e the difference in the most extreme climate change projections applied to the instrumental record compared to climate change projections applied to the combined instrumental and palaeoclimate record the underlying assumption is that climate variability seen in the instrumental palaeoclimate records can occur in the future and that it is reasonable to superimpose climate model trends on this climate variability more specifically we are assuming that the regional rainfall response to increased atmospheric c02 would have been the same for the instrumental and palaeo dry time periods 3 3 comparing instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics 10 000 stochastic replicates 116 years in length were generated for historical instrumental palaeo palaeo dry and post processed rainfall time series using the freely available ewater stochastic climate library scl https toolkit ewater org au tools default aspx the scl uses an annual first order autoregressive model that has been tested for use in australian climate srikanthan et al 2002 model parameter uncertainty is explicitly accounted for when generating replicates with the scl using the method of thyer et al 2002 which allowed the characterisation comparison of the uncertainty in different rainfall statistics sampling distributions of mean standard deviation 10th percentile annual rainfall total and 90th percentile annual rainfall total were calculated from stochastic replicates of each data set all sampling distributions reproduced the corresponding statistic from the respective modelled time series 95 confidence intervals of each sampling distribution were calculated by identifying respective 2 5 and 97 5 percentile values palaeoclimate and projected sampling distributions with confidence bounds outside those calculated from the corresponding instrumental distribution were noted it is important to note that the focus here is on annual statistics because scl uses only lag 1 autocorrelation and further research is required to ensure that interannual to multidecadal persistence of dry events is realistically captured in the stochastic replicates a perkins skill score pss perkins et al 2007 was also used to compare the sampling distributions of both palaeoclimate and projected data with the corresponding instrumental distribution the pss measures the proportion with which two distributions overlap a score of zero means there is no overlap between distributions and a score of one means that the two distributions overlap perfectly in order to calculate the pss instrumental and palaeo dry projected sampling distributions were binned in increments of ten the proportion of samples out of a total of 10 000 contained in each respective bin was calculated and the minimum proportion found for each overlapping bin was then summed eq 3 displays the pss formula used in this study 3 σn 1 minimum proportioninstrumnetal proportionpalaeo dry projected where n is the number of bins 4 results the sampling distributions and 95 confidence intervals for mean standard deviation 10th percentile annual rainfall and 90th percentile rainfall for different scenarios in the lockyer catchment are shown in fig 2 and table 2 respectively when examining these results the following observations can be made decreases in mean and ninetieth percentile total outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible for each rcp time period analysed regardless of the historical data set i e instrumental or palaeo dry to which the cf was applied applying a cf to the driest 116 year period in the palaeoclimate record resulted in much larger decreases in mean and tenth percentile rainfall than applying a cf to the instrumental record decreases in mean and ninetieth percentile total rainfall outside the confines of instrumental variability were observed in the palaeoclimate record outside the confines a lower standard deviation was observed in the instrumental record than in the driest 116 year period in the palaeoclimate record also shown in table 2 are the psss obtained when comparing sampling distributions for palaeoclimate projected rainfall scenarios with the corresponding instrumental period sampling distribution note that the pss calculates the proportion of overlap between sampling distributions with a score of 1 meaning total overlap and a score of 0 meaning no overlap when comparing palaeo dry and instrumental sampling distributions mean standard deviation and tenth percentile rainfall distributions shared 13 9 16 9 and 5 1 overlap respectively whereas ninetieth percentile rainfall distributions shared 81 3 overlap when comparing future scenarios with the instrumental record both late 21st century rcp8 5 mean rainfall sampling distributions had no overlap with the instrumental mean rainfall sampling distribution i e a pss of 0 out of all future scenarios the mean sampling distribution for mid 21st century rcp4 5 with the cf applied to the instrumental record had the highest proportion of overlap with the corresponding instrumental distribution with 11 for each statistic analysed all late 21st century rcp8 5 sampling distributions had less than 10 overlap with the corresponding instrumental sampling distribution such small percentages of overlap highlight the limitations of assuming instrumental period climate is representative of future climate an example of the divergent sampling distributions possible over the same catchment is shown in fig 3 displaying the mean sampling distributions for instrumental palaeo dry and the trends seen in the driest late 21st century rcp8 5 simulation superimposed on instrumental palaeo dry time series it is shown that even considering parametric uncertainty in the instrumental record may not capture any of the plausible mean climate states that could arise if rainfall were to follow the trends in the driest cmip5 model it also shows that even driest 100 year period in the palaeoclimate record may not capture the lower bound of gcm projection uncertainty like figs 2 3 also demonstrates larger projection uncertainty if applying climate model trends to palaeoclimate data instead of only applying to instrumental data as per common practice 5 discussion the results show that changes in climate state outside that experienced in the instrumental record are plausible now and into the future given that such large changes are evident in both the palaeoclimate record and in climate model projections water management strategies developed using only instrumental data will underestimate current future hydroclimatic risk this has implications for current and future performance of water management systems and the estimates of sustainable yield underpinning water supply system operations as demonstrated by the psss in table 2 and the mean sampling distributions in fig 3 even considering parameter uncertainty in the instrumental record when estimating sustainable yield i e berghout et al 2017 may not expose the water system model to mean climates that are plausible now i e the palaeo dry and in future i e the driest gcm from the late 21st century rcp8 5 projection scenario however as water supply systems have inherent redundancy to handle extreme events not experienced in the instrumental period evaluating the performance of existing water supply systems using a combination of instrumental palaeoclimate and projected model data is a key recommendation of this study although we have demonstrated that the instrumental record is not representative of past future climate some questions naturally arise from our analysis are these dry palaeoclimate projected scenarios likely to occur in the future and should our water supply systems be updated now to handle such extreme scenarios or should updates be made as such scenarios occur in reality prescribing accurate probabilities of these dry epochs occurring in the near future is difficult lempert et al 2003 given this difficulty the most appropriate way a water supply system management plan could be updated in future remains an ongoing area of research hall et al 2012 borgomeo et al 2018 regardless of how water supply systems are updated in future the triggers for when and ways how these systems could be updated are strongly influenced by what kinds of climates are considered plausible in the future i e culley et al 2016 borgomeo et al 2016 an important contribution of this study is the demonstration of how limits on plausible future rainfall change can be identified the application of a cf to a dry epoch in the palaeoclimate record was also presented as a simple way of illustrating variability seen in palaeoclimate records compounded with climate model projection trends this highlights a significant limitation with comparing projected trends with respect to an instrumental period subset i e ipcc s 1986 2005 baseline wmo s 1960 1990 baseline when estimating the potential impacts of climate change by failing to consider the full range of natural climate variability these approaches will underestimate the full range of climate conditions that are plausible and give an unrealistic assessment of future hydroclimatic risk although combining palaeoclimate and gcm data can better estimate the full range of projection uncertainty this application comes with inherent limitations first as this is a statistical method no physical mechanism is proposed that could drive such large decreases in rainfall in future further cmip5 model evaluation studies extending the work of moise et al 2015 or updated climate model structures simulations i e outputs from cmip6 eyring et al 2016 may find the changes identified in this study as implausible however water managers must make decisions based on the best information currently available and it may not be feasible to wait for new model evaluations simulations second by applying the same cfs to different historical periods we are assuming that climate sensitivity i e how a model projects rainfall to change given a specific increase in atmospheric c02 is independent of the climate state to which climate forcings are applied this assumption is probably flawed the same climate forcings applied to different baseline climates can result in different projected trends deser et al 2020 although this is a limitation of the method given the limited understanding as to how rainfall could change given different climate baselines we proposed the heuristic application of the same cf to different historical periods third as the law dome ice core record is a remote proxy it is unable to capture local synoptic events that influence catchment rainfall tozer et al 2016 as such the skill of the palaeoclimate reconstruction is constrained and the stochastic modelling of the palaeoclimate time series may inadvertently capture high frequency variability not related to catchment processes fourth although the application of a distribution based cf used in this study preserved the projected changes evident at different rainfall quartiles this scaling method can distort non targeted rainfall variables relationships i e the serial dependence of the time series or the value of the 99th percentile rainfall total the inverse peturbation method of guo et al 2018 which identifies stochastic model parameters that preserves these variables relationships while reproducing the coincident change in statistics of interest i e rainfall mean and standard deviation offers a potential avenue for generating physically consistent stochastic traces for use in evaluating the performance of water supply systems and climate impact assessments in general a bottom up approach can be used to evaluate the performance of water supply systems under the palaeoclimate projected scenarios generated in this study prudhomme et al 2010 brown et al 2012 this approach involves assessing the performance of a water supply system under hypothetical climates such as those produced in this study thereby identifying scenarios where the water supply system does not meet operational requirements herman et al 2016 the inclusion of climate model projections in these bottom up assessments generally involves the peturbation of an instrumental subset based on the magnitude of change seen in future projections i e turner et al 2014 mortazavi naeini et al 2015 however as demonstrated in figs 2 3 this method may not capture the most extreme plausible worst case rainfall scenario an important contribution of this study is the demonstration of a method that derives a plausible worst case scenario i e the driest 100 year period in the last 1000 years compounded with the largest plausible decrease in rainfall under global warming not currently captured when only considering instrumental and projected rainfall data this worse case scenario can then be used to inform stochastic weather generation within a bottom up assessment framework even though these bottom up approaches can be used to evaluate water management strategies under climate variability change the extreme climate variability that a single catchment can experience may amplify existing limitations of the conceptual rainfall runoff models used in water management and therefore underpinning these bottom up evaluations for instance as hydrological models assume the rainfall runoff relationship is stationary the model parameters identified during calibration are considered robust under climate variability however under multi year drought conditions for some catchments this assumption of stationarity is inadequate saft et al 2015 non stationary rainfall runoff relationships driven by changing surface water ground water interactions deb et al 2019b dynamic vegetation cover behavioural responses to climate variability ajami et al 2017 and vegetation responses to increased atmospheric co2 chiew et al 2014 must be accounted for in order to accurately estimate stream flow when evaluating the performance of a water management plan under palaeoclimate variability and climate change there are numerous calibration operational strategies that could improve the performance of conceptual rainfall runoff models when simulating runoff under the climate scenarios identified in this study for example models calibrated to a dry non dry period can perform well under a similarly dry non dry future period li et al 2012 there may also be an optimal parameter set that performs satisfactorily across many different climate states fowler et al 2016 time varying parameterisations whereby model parameters change based on the current catchment climate state is another approach that could improve the accuracy of hydrological model runoff simulations climate variability change westra et al 2014 pathiraja et al 2016 the selection application of robust i e able to accurately simulate runoff model parameters is important when estimating future runoff but given the significant climate variability change found plausible in this study it may not overcome the structural limitations of many conceptual rainfall runoff models used in water management pathiraja et al 2018 stephens et al 2019 these models have no explicit representation of the physical processes driving non stationary rainfall runoff relationships e g surface water ground water interactions which can bias runoff estimates deb et al 2019a as such seemingly robust estimations of future runoff i e consistent estimates between different conceptual rainfall runoff models calibrated to similar climate conditions may also be similarly biased guo et al 2018b as our results show that catchment climates can plausibly change to states with no instrumental period analogue under both preinstrumental and projected climate scenarios and recent research has demonstrated the limited ability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to accurately simulate runoff under climate conditions not experienced during the calibration period deb and kiem 2020 stephens et al 2020 current hydrological model structures seem poorly suited to estimate future runoff clearly the further study of the physical processes driving rainfall runoff non stationarity under climate variability change and the incorporation of such processes into hydrological models is an important area of further research blöschl et al 2019 with implications for the current future performance of existing water supply systems 6 conclusions in conclusion this study explored the differences in instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics over the lockyer catchment which is a catchment with a climate influenced by interannual to multidecadal variability e g enso ipo the key findings of this study are water management strategies developed using only instrumental data underestimate or at least misrepresent current future hydroclimatic risk considering projected changes in hydroclimate with respect to only instrumental data results in underestimation of future hydroclimatic uncertainty for each rcp time period analysed decreases in mean rainfall outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible compounding the most extreme palaeoclimate epoch with the largest gcm trend is presented as a way of generating a plausible worst case scenario for use in bottom up assessment frameworks given that current water management plans were developed using instrumental data and that the hydrological models underpinning these plans were calibrated to the instrumental record our results have implications for the development of future water management plans in particular the evident mischaracterisation of current and future hydroclimate hydroclimatic risk by the instrumental record has consequences for the accuracy of sustainable yield estimates derived from instrumental period climate conditions the ability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to accurately simulate runoff under climate conditions for which there are no instrumental period analogue although we have

8322,study region the lockyer catchment queensland australia study focus future rainfall projections are usually presented as a percentage change from current climate where current climate is defined using relatively short instrumental records however palaeoclimate reconstructions demonstrate that instrumental data does not capture the full range of climate variability that has occurred understanding natural climate variability and how it compares to climate model projections for the future requires the use of a instrumental and palaeoclimate data to quantify the range of historical variability and b climate model data to quantify if how things could change in the future considering this we compare instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics for the lockyer catchment new hydrologic insights for the region we found that in the lockyer catchment instrumental data insufficiently captures past variability and plausible projections of rainfall decreases in the future we also found that at mid 21st and late 21st century time periods decreases in annual average rainfall rainfall variability and ninetieth percentile rainfall outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible also when considering variability in the palaeoclimate record compounded with projected rainfall trends much larger decreases in rainfall are plausible than when only considering instrumental and projected rainfall the implications of these results are discussed in terms of a calculating the sustainable yield of water supply catchments and b estimating catchment runoff using hydrological models keywords paleoclimate climate change modelling water management 1 introduction in australia current water management plans and associated infrastructure have been developed using statistics derived from a relatively short 100 year instrumental record franks 2002 verdon kidd and kiem 2010 however interannual to multidecadal fluctuations in various oceanatmospheric processes e g el niño southern oscillation enso interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo the complex interactions between such processes and the various spatial and temporal rainfall responses to such interactions highlight the need for more extensive data describing the climate system than that available in the instrumental record verdon kidd and kiem 2009 johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 gergis and henley 2017 palaeoclimate reconstructions based on proxy data offer a potential solution to this issue contextualising instrumental climate and providing more robust baseline statistics that describe the climate system griffin and anchukaitis 2014 ho et al 2015 vance et al 2015 these reconstructions can be inferred using local proxy data i e tree rings allen et al 2019 coral luminescence lough 2011 remote proxy data i e ice core snow accumulation van ommen and morgan 2010v vance et al 2013 tozer et al 2016 or a combination of both palmer et al 2015 freund et al 2017 these independently sourced palaeoclimate reconstructions can provide multiple lines of evidence regarding the nature of past climate variability kiem et al 2016 australian reconstructions extending beyond the last 500 years show that the wet and dry epochs observed in the instrumental record are not unprecedented in terms of duration severity and intensity and are within the confines of natural variability verdon kidd et al 2017 palmer et al 2015 vance et al 2015 tozer et al 2016 for example vance et al 2015 identified the occurrence of eight megadroughts 5 years in southeastern australia over the last millennium the longest being 39 years given droughts of this severity have not occurred in the instrumental period this highlights limitations with using instrumental data to calculate hydroclimatic risk when developing water management plans and infrastructure tozer et al 2018 considering this recent research the translation of palaeoclimate information into a useful format for water managers has been identified as a key future research area in australian flood and drought adaptation johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 however incorporating palaeoclimate data into the development and testing of water management plans comes with unique challenges issues such as the unavailability of palaeoclimate records that are statistically related to climate in a specific catchment palaeoclimate records of insufficient length to record the full extent of natural variability and palaeoclimate records of unsuitable format for inclusion in hydrological models are barriers to the application of palaeoclimate data in water management tingstad et al 2014 such issues need to be directly accounted for if water management strategies are to be robust under natural climate variability into the future although palaeoclimate reconstructions provide helpful insights regarding the extent of natural climate variability consideration of past climate alone does not necessarily equate to a secure water source in the future how anthropogenic climate change will influence future rainfall in relation to variability in the instrumental and palaeoclimate reconstructions must also be considered kiem and verdon kidd 2011 such information is obtained from global climate models gcms the main tools for projecting future climate the various gcm rainfall projections for australia differ in sign and magnitude and at regional scales are biased for example annual rainfall in southeast queensland is projected to change 4 8 22 1 by 2090 under a high emissions future irving et al 2012 further examples of australian rainfall projection uncertainty can be found in grose et al 2015 and dowdy et al 2015 gcms also simulate climate at a relatively coarse horizontal resolution 200 km x 200 km so cannot properly account for sub grid scale processes such as topographical heterogeneities and convective cloud processes that influence regional rainfall rummukainen 2010 hence rainfall processes are parameterised which can cause uncertainty between models and bias with respect to observations gcm rainfall projections are also typically presented as a percent change with respect to a subset of rainfall in the instrumental record for example the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report examined projected rainfall changes with respect to a 1986 2005 baseline collins et al 2013 projections are rarely analyzed with respect to natural variability evident in the palaeoclimate record or even the full range of variability evident in the instrumental record given that palaeoclimate reconstructions typically reveal past natural climate variability not captured in the instrumental record analysing projected climate change within a palaeoclimate context provides greater insights as to how climate may change in future with respect to the past ault et al 2014 provides an example of how palaeoclimate projected and instrumental data can be better used to characterise drought risk when all available hydroclimatic data i e instrumental palaeoclimate and projected was considered they calculated an 80 chance of multi decadal drought occurring in the southwest united states over the next century which was previously thought to be 50 when only instrumental and projected rainfall were considered in an australian based study cook et al 2016 examined the future trajectory of east australian hydroclimatic extremes within the context of the australia and new zealand summer drought atlas anzda of palmer et al 2015 a palaeoclimate reconstruction of the palmer drought severity index pdsi in late 21st century projections for coastal queensland the probability of a pdsi value equal to or drier than the lowest value in the anzda which had an instrumental period probability of 1 was found to be 5 these studies highlight the utility of analysing projected climate change within a context of natural variability in the palaeoclimate record and suggest limitations with approaches that analyse gcm projections with respect to an instrumental record subset if the instrumental record does not capture the full extent of past hydroclimatic variability how can anthropogenic influences on hydroclimate be understood if comparing projections to instrumental record subsets limited research has been conducted analysing gcm projections within context of the longer term past particularly at the catchment scale that water management decisions are made examining how rainfall has changed prior to the instrumental period and how it might change in the future under global warming also has significant implications for our understanding of the rainfall runoff relationship and therefore catchment yields traditional water management approaches have considered this relationship stationary meaning that for a particular catchment the proportion of unit runoff change per unit rainfall change is constant however for some catchments the strength of the rainfall runoff relationship will vary i e is non stationary saft et al 2015 as these non stationarities have been identified during the instrumental period if pre instrumental variability and gcm projection uncertainty are outside the confines of instrumental variability limitations with treating the rainfall runoff relationship as stationary will be amplified understanding the physical processes driving non stationary rainfall runoff relationships is an ongoing area of research although climate variability plays an important role the internal catchment responses to climate variability which will vary between catchments have a greater influence on rainfall runoff non stationarity saft et al 2016 deb et al 2019b for example variations in the interactions between surface water sw and groundwater gw whereby fluctuations in the groundwater table can change the sign of the groundwater contributions to the surface water i e change from a loosing stream to a gaining stream can drive variations in the rainfall runoff relationship deb et al 2019a 2019b changes in vegetation cover and behaviour under climate variability ajami et al 2017 or enhanced atmospheric c02 chiew et al 2014 may also contribute to observed rainfall runoff non stationarity the dynamic response of internal catchment processes to climate variability which drive non stationary rainfall runoff relationships can explain the difficulties in extrapolating observed catchment behaviour to different climate conditions a significant problem in assessing future water system performance therefore in order to better understand the roles that these processes may have in estimating future runoff quantifying the range of possible catchment climates both past and future is crucial as such the aim of this study is to compare past instrumental and palaeoclimate rainfall variability and future rainfall projections in the lockyer catchment queensland australia fig 1 this catchment was selected because catchment rainfall varies at interannual and multidecadal time scales power et al 1999 the rainfall runoff relationship in the catchment in non stationary cui et al 2018 instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall data are available for the catchment vance et al 2013 kiem et al 2020 the comparison of instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall data is the first step in assessing the strength of current water management strategies and informing the development of robust adaptation strategies that ensure water security under climate variability and change in this study we will examine if the instrumental record in the lockyer catchment captures natural variability in the palaeoclimate record and if projected changes in future rainfall are within or outside the confines of instrumental palaeoclimate variability the implications of this analysis for water management strategies developed using instrumental data and for current hydrological modelling practices are then discussed although our analysis is focused on lockyer catchment rainfall the results and implications of this study can be generalised to other catchments with a climate influenced by sources of interannual to multidecadal variability e g enso ipo and b non stationary rainfall runoff relationships 2 data 2 1 instrumental period rainfall an indication of rainfall experienced during the instrumental period was derived from the australian water availability project awap dataset which provides gridded rainfall data across australia at a 5 km spatial resolution raupach et al 2009 the average of the awap rainfall grids lying within the lockyer catchment boundary was calculated from 1900 to 2015 and used for further analysis this time series period is hereafter referred to as instrumental rainfall and the instrumental period respectively throughout this paper 2 2 palaeoclimate rainfall reconstruction the palaeoclimate rainfall reconstruction of vance et al 2015 was used for this study providing area averaged lockyer catchment annual rainfall from 1000 to 2012 area averaged rainfall was calculated by first reconstructing the individual awap grids lying within the catchment boundary using a linear regression reconstruction model then averaging the reconstructed grid values for each year the reconstruction is based upon a statistically significant correlation between east australian rainfall and summer sea salt accumulation at the law dome ice core in east antarctica which are both influenced by atmospheric circulation patterns driven by enso ipo variability vance et al 2013 2015 the correlation between the law dome proxy and lockyer catchment rainfall varies between ipo phases with a statistically significant correlation during ipo positive pearson correlation of 0 41 and no significant correlation during ipo negative kiem et al 2020 as such this reconstruction can be used to analyse pre instrumental rainfall during ipo positive phases which in the lockyer catchment and in general eastern australia are associated with dry conditions power et al 1999 for a more detailed analysis explanation of the reconstruction used in this study including a comparison of drought risk quantified using the instrumental rainfall record versus the 1000 year rainfall reconstruction refer to kiem et al 2020 although there are other proxies reconstructions that could have been used for this study this reconstruction was selected as it a captures a prolonged period of decreased rainfall occurring from 1000 to 1150 ce and b is annually resolved annually resolved reconstructions derived from biological proxies i e tree ring width coral luminescence were not considered as they were of insufficient length to capture this dry period and other east australian reconstructions that did capture this dry period i e barr et al 2019 were not annually resolved statistics derived from the driest 116 year period coinciding with the length of the awap time series in the 1013 year reconstruction 1146 1261 ce hereafter referred to as palaeo dry were used for further analysis 2 3 climate model rainfall projections gcm simulations of rainfall were taken from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 cmip5 provides a coordinated experimental framework under which gcms are run details available in taylor et al 2012 gcm simulations using representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were examined in this study historical simulations of rainfall were taken from 1900 to 2005 the time period with rainfall data overlapping instrumental rainfall gcm future projections were separated into different time periods 2041 2060 mid 21st century climate and 2081 2100 late 21st century climate 3 methods 3 1 climate model selection climate models were selected for this study using the climate change in australia climate futures detailed projections tool available at https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en climateprojections climate futures tool detailed projections the climate futures detailed projections tool provides the projected percent change in average annual rainfall for various rcp time period with respect to a 1986 2005 baseline seen in cmip5 gcms over a region of interest clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 for each rcp time period outlined in section 3 3 we selected the cmip5 model showing the greatest decrease in average annual rainfall for the region covering the lockyer catchment table 1 gcms explicitly advised against use as a representative model for the region on the ccia website https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en recommendations on this website are based on the comprehensive model evaluation study of moise et al 2015 were not considered this approach captured the lowest plausible bound on gcm uncertainty for each scenario time period note that for some gcms the same cmip5 experiments i e rcp8 5 historical have been simulated with different initial states start up methods and physics scheme parameterisations for this analysis the choice of ensemble member had little influence on the resultant projection statistics see table s1 in the supplementary material as such if a gcm had multiple ensemble members for either the historical or future simulations the first ensemble member denoted as r1i1p1 using the rip nomenclature associated with each gcm simulation was selected for further analysis for each time period we also analysed projected data for the next driest model see table s3 and table s4 in the supplementary material these projections were similar to those from the models shown in table 1 given the relatively small size of the study catchment relative to the coarse horizontal resolution of gcm grids downscaled projections could better capture spatial changes in rainfall however considering that the application of different statistical or dynamical downscaling methods does not provide a consistent projection signal different from the cmip5 ensemble in eastern australia grose et al 2015 and that downscaling adds little value to coarser resolution gridded data for the study area di virgilio et al 2020 downscaled climate model projections were not considered although we did not use downscaled projections it should be noted that specific downscaling methods may introduce greater rainfall projection uncertainty in eastern australia than that evident in the cmip5 gcm ensemble grose et al 2015 for an in depth look at climate model projections for the study area we refer the reader to grose et al 2015 and grose et al 2020 please note that in subsequent post processing stochastic modelling and analysis of the projected data we are treating transient time slices i e a small section of a trending time series as a stable climate i e has reached an equilibrium with no forced trend this comes with limitations as for a given rcp scenario the use of transient versus longer term projections which have reached a quasi equilibrium for example the extended rcp experiments that continue out to 2300 can result in different estimates of regional climate variability king et al 2020 however not all of the selected models have extended simulations that allow analysis of stable projected climates and we considered sampling the lower bound of gcm uncertainty to be more important for our study 3 2 post processing of climate model rainfall data given the tendency for gcm simulations of instrumental period climate to have systematic biases in relation to observed climate values i e instrumental measurements and the assumption that this bias will hold for future projections climate projections are typically post processed to remove this bias johnson and sharma 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 nguyen et al 2017 this study used a distribution based change factor cf approach at a quartile resolution as a post processing method chiew et al 2003 this approach calculates the relative change in average rainfall the cf at quartile n seen in the modelled future climate μmf with respect to that in the modelled historical i e instrumental period climate μmc eq 1 the cf is then applied to the observed awap annual rainfall total p in year x within corresponding quartile n to obtain a scaled rainfall time series eq 2 1 cf n μmf fn μmc n 2 pscaled x n pobserved x n cf n the application of a cf was used in this study as a means of conserving the relative rainfall trends seen in the model projections while removing bias in the raw gcm outputs although the cf approach is not an explicit bias correction method by applying the projected changes seen in gcm simulations to the instrumental period we remove the need to use raw gcm outputs and the biases that are associated with them a distribution based approach was implemented as it can better preserve any changes in variability present in model simulations compared to mean based approaches yang et al 2010 anandhi et al 2011 the cf approach is also one of the recommended methods for the creation of application ready climate change data for use in detailed climate impact statements in australia csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 and has been used in numerous climate change impact studies kiem et al 2008 kirby et al 2014 mortazavi naeini et al 2015 cfs derived from all gcm scenarios presented in table 1 were applied to the instrumental instrumental period catchment average from 1900 to 2015 and palaeo dry reconstructed catchment average from 1146 to 1261 ce rainfall time series this accounts for the natural variability in the instrumental palaeoclimate records compounded with the largest plausible rainfall trend seen in gcm projections and allowed a comparison of plausible worst case scenarios i e the difference in the most extreme climate change projections applied to the instrumental record compared to climate change projections applied to the combined instrumental and palaeoclimate record the underlying assumption is that climate variability seen in the instrumental palaeoclimate records can occur in the future and that it is reasonable to superimpose climate model trends on this climate variability more specifically we are assuming that the regional rainfall response to increased atmospheric c02 would have been the same for the instrumental and palaeo dry time periods 3 3 comparing instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics 10 000 stochastic replicates 116 years in length were generated for historical instrumental palaeo palaeo dry and post processed rainfall time series using the freely available ewater stochastic climate library scl https toolkit ewater org au tools default aspx the scl uses an annual first order autoregressive model that has been tested for use in australian climate srikanthan et al 2002 model parameter uncertainty is explicitly accounted for when generating replicates with the scl using the method of thyer et al 2002 which allowed the characterisation comparison of the uncertainty in different rainfall statistics sampling distributions of mean standard deviation 10th percentile annual rainfall total and 90th percentile annual rainfall total were calculated from stochastic replicates of each data set all sampling distributions reproduced the corresponding statistic from the respective modelled time series 95 confidence intervals of each sampling distribution were calculated by identifying respective 2 5 and 97 5 percentile values palaeoclimate and projected sampling distributions with confidence bounds outside those calculated from the corresponding instrumental distribution were noted it is important to note that the focus here is on annual statistics because scl uses only lag 1 autocorrelation and further research is required to ensure that interannual to multidecadal persistence of dry events is realistically captured in the stochastic replicates a perkins skill score pss perkins et al 2007 was also used to compare the sampling distributions of both palaeoclimate and projected data with the corresponding instrumental distribution the pss measures the proportion with which two distributions overlap a score of zero means there is no overlap between distributions and a score of one means that the two distributions overlap perfectly in order to calculate the pss instrumental and palaeo dry projected sampling distributions were binned in increments of ten the proportion of samples out of a total of 10 000 contained in each respective bin was calculated and the minimum proportion found for each overlapping bin was then summed eq 3 displays the pss formula used in this study 3 σn 1 minimum proportioninstrumnetal proportionpalaeo dry projected where n is the number of bins 4 results the sampling distributions and 95 confidence intervals for mean standard deviation 10th percentile annual rainfall and 90th percentile rainfall for different scenarios in the lockyer catchment are shown in fig 2 and table 2 respectively when examining these results the following observations can be made decreases in mean and ninetieth percentile total outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible for each rcp time period analysed regardless of the historical data set i e instrumental or palaeo dry to which the cf was applied applying a cf to the driest 116 year period in the palaeoclimate record resulted in much larger decreases in mean and tenth percentile rainfall than applying a cf to the instrumental record decreases in mean and ninetieth percentile total rainfall outside the confines of instrumental variability were observed in the palaeoclimate record outside the confines a lower standard deviation was observed in the instrumental record than in the driest 116 year period in the palaeoclimate record also shown in table 2 are the psss obtained when comparing sampling distributions for palaeoclimate projected rainfall scenarios with the corresponding instrumental period sampling distribution note that the pss calculates the proportion of overlap between sampling distributions with a score of 1 meaning total overlap and a score of 0 meaning no overlap when comparing palaeo dry and instrumental sampling distributions mean standard deviation and tenth percentile rainfall distributions shared 13 9 16 9 and 5 1 overlap respectively whereas ninetieth percentile rainfall distributions shared 81 3 overlap when comparing future scenarios with the instrumental record both late 21st century rcp8 5 mean rainfall sampling distributions had no overlap with the instrumental mean rainfall sampling distribution i e a pss of 0 out of all future scenarios the mean sampling distribution for mid 21st century rcp4 5 with the cf applied to the instrumental record had the highest proportion of overlap with the corresponding instrumental distribution with 11 for each statistic analysed all late 21st century rcp8 5 sampling distributions had less than 10 overlap with the corresponding instrumental sampling distribution such small percentages of overlap highlight the limitations of assuming instrumental period climate is representative of future climate an example of the divergent sampling distributions possible over the same catchment is shown in fig 3 displaying the mean sampling distributions for instrumental palaeo dry and the trends seen in the driest late 21st century rcp8 5 simulation superimposed on instrumental palaeo dry time series it is shown that even considering parametric uncertainty in the instrumental record may not capture any of the plausible mean climate states that could arise if rainfall were to follow the trends in the driest cmip5 model it also shows that even driest 100 year period in the palaeoclimate record may not capture the lower bound of gcm projection uncertainty like figs 2 3 also demonstrates larger projection uncertainty if applying climate model trends to palaeoclimate data instead of only applying to instrumental data as per common practice 5 discussion the results show that changes in climate state outside that experienced in the instrumental record are plausible now and into the future given that such large changes are evident in both the palaeoclimate record and in climate model projections water management strategies developed using only instrumental data will underestimate current future hydroclimatic risk this has implications for current and future performance of water management systems and the estimates of sustainable yield underpinning water supply system operations as demonstrated by the psss in table 2 and the mean sampling distributions in fig 3 even considering parameter uncertainty in the instrumental record when estimating sustainable yield i e berghout et al 2017 may not expose the water system model to mean climates that are plausible now i e the palaeo dry and in future i e the driest gcm from the late 21st century rcp8 5 projection scenario however as water supply systems have inherent redundancy to handle extreme events not experienced in the instrumental period evaluating the performance of existing water supply systems using a combination of instrumental palaeoclimate and projected model data is a key recommendation of this study although we have demonstrated that the instrumental record is not representative of past future climate some questions naturally arise from our analysis are these dry palaeoclimate projected scenarios likely to occur in the future and should our water supply systems be updated now to handle such extreme scenarios or should updates be made as such scenarios occur in reality prescribing accurate probabilities of these dry epochs occurring in the near future is difficult lempert et al 2003 given this difficulty the most appropriate way a water supply system management plan could be updated in future remains an ongoing area of research hall et al 2012 borgomeo et al 2018 regardless of how water supply systems are updated in future the triggers for when and ways how these systems could be updated are strongly influenced by what kinds of climates are considered plausible in the future i e culley et al 2016 borgomeo et al 2016 an important contribution of this study is the demonstration of how limits on plausible future rainfall change can be identified the application of a cf to a dry epoch in the palaeoclimate record was also presented as a simple way of illustrating variability seen in palaeoclimate records compounded with climate model projection trends this highlights a significant limitation with comparing projected trends with respect to an instrumental period subset i e ipcc s 1986 2005 baseline wmo s 1960 1990 baseline when estimating the potential impacts of climate change by failing to consider the full range of natural climate variability these approaches will underestimate the full range of climate conditions that are plausible and give an unrealistic assessment of future hydroclimatic risk although combining palaeoclimate and gcm data can better estimate the full range of projection uncertainty this application comes with inherent limitations first as this is a statistical method no physical mechanism is proposed that could drive such large decreases in rainfall in future further cmip5 model evaluation studies extending the work of moise et al 2015 or updated climate model structures simulations i e outputs from cmip6 eyring et al 2016 may find the changes identified in this study as implausible however water managers must make decisions based on the best information currently available and it may not be feasible to wait for new model evaluations simulations second by applying the same cfs to different historical periods we are assuming that climate sensitivity i e how a model projects rainfall to change given a specific increase in atmospheric c02 is independent of the climate state to which climate forcings are applied this assumption is probably flawed the same climate forcings applied to different baseline climates can result in different projected trends deser et al 2020 although this is a limitation of the method given the limited understanding as to how rainfall could change given different climate baselines we proposed the heuristic application of the same cf to different historical periods third as the law dome ice core record is a remote proxy it is unable to capture local synoptic events that influence catchment rainfall tozer et al 2016 as such the skill of the palaeoclimate reconstruction is constrained and the stochastic modelling of the palaeoclimate time series may inadvertently capture high frequency variability not related to catchment processes fourth although the application of a distribution based cf used in this study preserved the projected changes evident at different rainfall quartiles this scaling method can distort non targeted rainfall variables relationships i e the serial dependence of the time series or the value of the 99th percentile rainfall total the inverse peturbation method of guo et al 2018 which identifies stochastic model parameters that preserves these variables relationships while reproducing the coincident change in statistics of interest i e rainfall mean and standard deviation offers a potential avenue for generating physically consistent stochastic traces for use in evaluating the performance of water supply systems and climate impact assessments in general a bottom up approach can be used to evaluate the performance of water supply systems under the palaeoclimate projected scenarios generated in this study prudhomme et al 2010 brown et al 2012 this approach involves assessing the performance of a water supply system under hypothetical climates such as those produced in this study thereby identifying scenarios where the water supply system does not meet operational requirements herman et al 2016 the inclusion of climate model projections in these bottom up assessments generally involves the peturbation of an instrumental subset based on the magnitude of change seen in future projections i e turner et al 2014 mortazavi naeini et al 2015 however as demonstrated in figs 2 3 this method may not capture the most extreme plausible worst case rainfall scenario an important contribution of this study is the demonstration of a method that derives a plausible worst case scenario i e the driest 100 year period in the last 1000 years compounded with the largest plausible decrease in rainfall under global warming not currently captured when only considering instrumental and projected rainfall data this worse case scenario can then be used to inform stochastic weather generation within a bottom up assessment framework even though these bottom up approaches can be used to evaluate water management strategies under climate variability change the extreme climate variability that a single catchment can experience may amplify existing limitations of the conceptual rainfall runoff models used in water management and therefore underpinning these bottom up evaluations for instance as hydrological models assume the rainfall runoff relationship is stationary the model parameters identified during calibration are considered robust under climate variability however under multi year drought conditions for some catchments this assumption of stationarity is inadequate saft et al 2015 non stationary rainfall runoff relationships driven by changing surface water ground water interactions deb et al 2019b dynamic vegetation cover behavioural responses to climate variability ajami et al 2017 and vegetation responses to increased atmospheric co2 chiew et al 2014 must be accounted for in order to accurately estimate stream flow when evaluating the performance of a water management plan under palaeoclimate variability and climate change there are numerous calibration operational strategies that could improve the performance of conceptual rainfall runoff models when simulating runoff under the climate scenarios identified in this study for example models calibrated to a dry non dry period can perform well under a similarly dry non dry future period li et al 2012 there may also be an optimal parameter set that performs satisfactorily across many different climate states fowler et al 2016 time varying parameterisations whereby model parameters change based on the current catchment climate state is another approach that could improve the accuracy of hydrological model runoff simulations climate variability change westra et al 2014 pathiraja et al 2016 the selection application of robust i e able to accurately simulate runoff model parameters is important when estimating future runoff but given the significant climate variability change found plausible in this study it may not overcome the structural limitations of many conceptual rainfall runoff models used in water management pathiraja et al 2018 stephens et al 2019 these models have no explicit representation of the physical processes driving non stationary rainfall runoff relationships e g surface water ground water interactions which can bias runoff estimates deb et al 2019a as such seemingly robust estimations of future runoff i e consistent estimates between different conceptual rainfall runoff models calibrated to similar climate conditions may also be similarly biased guo et al 2018b as our results show that catchment climates can plausibly change to states with no instrumental period analogue under both preinstrumental and projected climate scenarios and recent research has demonstrated the limited ability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to accurately simulate runoff under climate conditions not experienced during the calibration period deb and kiem 2020 stephens et al 2020 current hydrological model structures seem poorly suited to estimate future runoff clearly the further study of the physical processes driving rainfall runoff non stationarity under climate variability change and the incorporation of such processes into hydrological models is an important area of further research blöschl et al 2019 with implications for the current future performance of existing water supply systems 6 conclusions in conclusion this study explored the differences in instrumental palaeoclimate and projected rainfall statistics over the lockyer catchment which is a catchment with a climate influenced by interannual to multidecadal variability e g enso ipo the key findings of this study are water management strategies developed using only instrumental data underestimate or at least misrepresent current future hydroclimatic risk considering projected changes in hydroclimate with respect to only instrumental data results in underestimation of future hydroclimatic uncertainty for each rcp time period analysed decreases in mean rainfall outside the confines of instrumental and palaeoclimate variability are plausible compounding the most extreme palaeoclimate epoch with the largest gcm trend is presented as a way of generating a plausible worst case scenario for use in bottom up assessment frameworks given that current water management plans were developed using instrumental data and that the hydrological models underpinning these plans were calibrated to the instrumental record our results have implications for the development of future water management plans in particular the evident mischaracterisation of current and future hydroclimate hydroclimatic risk by the instrumental record has consequences for the accuracy of sustainable yield estimates derived from instrumental period climate conditions the ability of conceptual rainfall runoff models to accurately simulate runoff under climate conditions for which there are no instrumental period analogue although we have discussed the implications of this research from a water management hydrological modelling perspective the issues highlighted in this study are applicable to natural resources management environmental

8323,study region mewat renamed as nuh district of haryana india having geographical area of 1507 km2 comes under semi arid climatic conditions and aravali hill ranges separates it from rajasthan state study focus groundwater salinization is an emerging threat to water management understanding the sources of salinization and their relative contributions by different sources and seasonal variability has become priority for planning best practices in water management and suggesting remedial measures for identifying the sources of salinization the direct application of the relationship between δ18o and δd is limited as it depends upon initial isotopic composition showing no isotopic variation in the mineral dissolution process the present study advocates the use of deuterium excess which is independent of initial isotopic composition and extends this concept for identifying the relative contribution of different sources towards seasonal variability in salinization new hydrological insights for the region the district showed an average salinity of 6 7 g l in pre monsoon 7 3 g l in monsoon and 7 4 g l in post monsoon season thus a variability of 0 7 g l observed the area affected by the salinization 2 g l also registers an increase from 86 pre monsoon to 99 post monsoon period mineral dissolution is found to be responsible for overall groundwater salinization with contribution of 97 declined to 86 in post monsoon in post monsoon season contributions from initial salinity and evapoconcentration towards salinization increased by 8 and 3 respectively keywords d excess salinity mechanism seasonal changes mewat haryana 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater reservoir in most parts of the world and its consumption is only possible when it is free from any contaminants and pollutants including the salts excess salts in groundwater may lead to abandonment of supply wells groundwater salinization occurs at local and regional scales and may have diverse origins wen et al 2005 manivannan and elango 2019 as a result of geogenic sources initiated or facilitated by anthropogenic activities krishan 2019b has become a very serious and widespread groundwater contamination issue throughout the world groundwater salinization is a very common along the coasts and in island systems and was first identified more than a century ago drabbe and ghijben 1889 herzberg 1901 but increasing inland groundwater salinity in arid and semi arid regions is also posing threats to populations living in those areas krishan et al 2019a arid and semi arid regions already have fragile ecosystem that threaten the people living in these areas and increasing groundwater salinity further adds to the water resource issues of the area bennetts et al 2006 for healthier water resource management it is important to identify the sources of salinity and understand mechanisms of groundwater salinization through its chemical evolution edmunds 2009 in this context various experiments have been carried out in many parts of the world which include effects of evaporation on groundwater salinity simpson et al 1987 mobilization of salts due to change in hydrological regimes simpson and herczeg 1991 the effect of groundwater salinity on plant growth he et al 2006 manchanda and garg 2008 and deterioration in water quality edmunds 2003 for inland areas studies have examined groundwater salinity arising as a result of mineral dissolution and evapo transpiration taking place at local and regional scales hao et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 controlled by factors such as source of groundwater recharge aquifer characteristics and discharging areas isotopes can be used as an effective tool in various hydrological evaluations including understanding salinity mechanisms krishan et al 2020a b it has been reported by barnes and allison 1988 that precipitation water undergoes evaporative fractionation during the process of infiltration through the top layers of soil water infiltration on the other hand few other researchers zimmermann et al 1967 foerstel 1982 found no isotopic fractionation during salt drainage plant transpiration or mineral dissolution it has been found that stable isotopes of water δ18o and δd separately or in combination or their relations with salinity can not be used to examine the evaporation processes due to seasonal variations in source waters krishan et al 2020a b to overcome this limitation huang and pang 2012 proposed a method to explain salinity mechanisms using deuterium excess which is calculated from the stable isotopes δ18o and δd the proposed method works on the principle of mass loss ratio with a limitation of varying initial water due to different recharge sources and has been successfully tested in tarim river basin china according to this method δd and δ 18o increases in a water body undergoing evaporation which results in decreased deuterium excess and increased salinity dansgaard 1964 certain relationships between evaporation salinity and mass loss ratio can be established in the process of evaporation water gets lost to the atmosphere leaving the dissolved salts in the reserves of water resulting in increase in salinity a similar phenomenon can be observed between water lost to atmosphere and enrichment of heavier isotopic ratio for example 1 loss of water body in comparison to initial mass enriches δd value by 0 65 in egypt simpson et al 1987 0 78 for northwestern sahara fontes and gonfiantini 1967 and 0 62 for australia simpson and herczeg 1991 a similar trend can be obtained between water body loss and enrichment of δ18o gaye 2001 however both δd and δ18o vary with season representing the unique signatures of their source clark and fritz 1997 but the ability to establish a relation between salinity and water body loss with availability of initial isotopic composition for each and every scenario is limited huang and pang 2012 identified that although δd and δ18o vary with season both for groundwater and surface water the mass loss ratio remains the same thus dansgaard 1964 proposed the use of deuterium excess d represented by d δd 8δ18o to determine the relation between evaporation and salinity in india 70 of food production and economy depend on the southwest monsoon which onsets during june to ends during late september exhibits large variability in space and time and consequently leads to a considerable variation in groundwater recharge considering these facts this purpose driven study was carried out for monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons under national hydrology project india with the aims to 1 identify salinity mechanisms through the use of deuterium excess in the salinity affected mewat region of haryana 2 to understand the contribution of mineralization towards groundwater salinity and 3 to determine groundwater residence time using tritium 3h with identification of source of salinity in semi arid part of mewat an economical water management and salinity control plan can be created for the region the outputs of the study will help controlling salinity and managing water in sustainable and economical manners in the semi arid regions 2 study area the mewat district renamed as nuh is a newly formed district of haryana state india fig 1 with a geographical area of 1507 km2 and population of 1 089 406 census 2011 the district comes under semi arid climatic conditions with normal rainfall of 594 mm year out of which 80 rainfall occurs in monsoon season water level is 2 35 m below ground level mbgl in pre monsoon season and 0 9 38 1 mbgl in post monsoon season priyanka et al 2016 aravalli hill ranges occupy 199 65 km2 in the district separate mewat from rajasthan state and also check movement of sand from the thar desert in rajasthan the aravallis also help in recharging of groundwater and aquifers in these ranges are interconnected the digital elevation data shows depressions in the central part of the district with altitude decreasing from 450 m amsl meters above mean sea level to 150 m amsl fig 2 a the district is comprised of five blocks named tauru nuh punhana nagina and firozepur jhirka the nagina and parts of nuh and firozepur jhirka blocks are found with a very high groundwater salinity which is increasing over time and is reported to be advancing on fresh water aquifers thomas et al 2012 krishan et al 2017 2019c the major soil texture in the study area is loamy sand sandy loam and silty loam krishan et al 2018 land use land cover map fig 2b and d and the area statistics of land uses covers show that 64 of the district and 48 of the study area area 393 km2 is cultivated water bodies are 2 of the study area the geology of the district is dominated by middle late pleistocene and holocene fig 2c quaternary sediments alluvium deposits consists a sequence of inter layered clay silt and sand with occasional kankar formations malik and rajeshwari 2011 the point lithologs of the borelogs along with different geological formations are shown in fig 3 the lithologs show intermittent good aquifer or multiple aquifer formations at particular depths wherein the clay and silt layer formations have continuous areal extent at different layers 3 methodology 3 1 sampling in the year 2018 18 random groundwater samples were collected from the salinity influenced zone covering a 393 km2 area in nagina and firozepur jhirka blocks of the mewat district during pre monsoon april may monsoon july august and post monsoon october november seasons the sampling locations shown in fig 1 include open wells tubewells and handpumps with a depth range of 4 92 m six groundwater samples were collected from nagina and firozepur jhirka blocks for tritium analysis 3 2 analysis ec was measured on site using portable hand held hach hq30d ec meter and then converted to salinity and expressed in g l the ratios of heavy stable isotopes δ18o and δd were measured using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer di irms isoprime gv instruments u k with automatic sample preparation units at nuclear hydrology laboratory of national institute of hydrology roorkee measurement errors precision in estimates were within the limits of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δd the isotope ratios for 18o 16o and d h were expressed in per mil units using the δ notation relative to vsmow clark and fritz 1997 d excess was calculated as δ d 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 and globally it is 10 and it decreases with increases in evaporation and salinity for the tritium analysis 1000 ml of six groundwater samples were collected and distilled to reduce the conductivity deuterium and hydrogen were removed by the process of physico chemical fractionation in the tritium enrichment unit which is based on physico chemical fractionation by difference in the strength of bonds formed by the light versus the heavier isotope of a given element the values of tritium observed were low so a total of 8 10 cycles runs were executed using quintals process tritium concentration data files were created with the help of winq and quick start software in quintals process liquid scintillation spectrometer the concentration of tritium in terms of tritium units tu of various samples was determined tritium error of the individual samples is given in fig 10 water builds up in the aquifers in the years so age was calculated using the radioactive decay equation and called effective age mazor 2004 or tracer age 3 3 salinity mechanism groundwater salinity is the result of the combined effects of evaporation mineral dissolution and plant transpiration when plants transpire it excludes the salt present in the water in arid and semi arid climatic condition due to less rainfall in comparison to evapo transpiration the salt thus excluded gets deposited in the soil when water seeps through salty soil layer it increases the salinity of groundwater fass et al 2007 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 but out of the three phenomena it is only the effect of evaporation that is translated into a change in isotopic fractionation zimmermann et al 1967

and allison 1988 but the use of eq 1 becomes limited in estimating the effect of evaporation on water salinity as the isotopic composition of initial water varies with both season and between

of aravalli possess groundwater which satisfies all groundwater standards and used for drinking purposes for the δd and δ18o in source water firstly determined the average d value then the approximate median value can be estimated because d is not related to specific δd and δ18o value for example the d value of your source water for pre monsoon is 8 24 calculated from δ18o of 6 78 and δd of 46 for

level data groundwater levels were recorded for 40 monitoring wells during the time period 2011 15 the wells are developed by sehgal foundation in the study area in mewat district haryana during this period there is an average decrease of 29 in water level in pre monsoon and in general water levels decreased during pre monsson period and increased during post monsoon period priyanka et al 2016 4 results and discussion to understand the source of seasonal variation in the groundwater salinity 18 samples from different sites in the mewat district haryana were collected and analyzed for δ 18o and δ d the results are listed in table 1 for the pre monsoon season april may the mean values of δ 18o and δ d for pre monsoon season april may with mean temperature 32 75 c and humidity 26 25 are 5 5 and 42 3 respectively whereas δ 18o is 5 5 and δ d is 42 3 with a mean temperature of 32 75 c and mean humidity of 26 25 in contrast for the post monsoon season period october δ 18o is 5 3 and δ d is 41 8 with the temperature of 27 25 c and humidity of 49 25 the variation in mean values of isotopic composition of pre monsoon and post monsoon is small rozanski et al 1993 examined the relationship between isotopic composition and temperature t for precipitation over india and showed that the seasonal δt is low and so there is little variation in isotopic composition δ 18o and δ d there is also a strong influence of dansgaard s amount effect in the region precipitation during low rainfall months experiences evaporation in low humid air column and d excess correlates with the seasonal variation in the precipitation the seasonal variability in isotopic composition of precipitation gets captured by the groundwater samples to further examine the evaporation effect on groundwater of the study area δ 18o is plotted against δ d as shown in fig 5 the slope of 5 5 6 and 6 is observed for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively since the regression lines are subparallel to global meteoric water line gmwl given by craig 1961 with slopes less than 8 it suggests occurrence of evaporation prior to the infiltration of water in the unsaturated zone krishan et al 2020b huang et al 2012 kulkarni et al 1989 seasonal variations in d excess remaining fraction and salinity during evaporation are shown in fig 6 it is found that salinity increases and d excess decreases during evapoconcentation in all seasons there is a linear relationship between d excess and remaining fraction in all 3 seasons in all samples more scatter is found in salinity and remaining fraction values in 16 of the samples indicating seasonal variations huang and pang 2012 found that the salinity is doubled when half of the water is evaporated due to evapoconcentration and a decrease in deuterium excess from 10 to 9 7 the summary of water samples collected from kotla is taken as reference and given in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 a relation between d excess f and salinity exists in the monsoon period the salinity value is highest at 0 53 g l because these monsoon months have heavy rainfall mineral dilution occurs along with higher evaporation which is reflected in the lower values of fraction f in the post monsoon period with its lower temperatures the evaporation decreases f 0 45 and the salinity comes down to 0 31 g l in the pre monsoon period the fraction f increases drastically and the salinity shows a decline to 0 05 g l this was possible because the groundwater level start to rise during pre monsoon seasons dilution of the regional water source by rainfall recharge can be seen in the declining salinity to understand the contribution of initial salinity evaporation and mineral dissolution the value of d excess tds and fraction after evaporation is calculated and tabulated in table 3 the value of d excess depends upon the temperature and humidity values in the area the seasonal variability in salinity and d excess are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it has been observed that the groundwater of the district showed an increase of 0 7 g l salinity from pre monsoon 6 7 g l to post monsoon season 7 4 g l the d excess shows a decline of 1 6 in post monsoon when compared to pre monsoon it decreases from 2 4 in pre monsoon to 0 8 in post monsoon which is as per the observations of dansgaard 1964 similar results showing control of seasons and climates were reported in precipitation and air moisture samples by unnikrishnan warrior et al 2010 purushothaman et al 2012 saranya et al 2018 and aneesh et al 2019 the percent area under salinity values of 2 g l increased from 86 in pre monsoon to 99 in post monsoon while percent area with d excess 0 increased from 4 in pre monsoon to 25 in post monsoon season which indicates the increase in saline affected area the sources of salinity initial salinity evaporation and mineral dissolution in different seasons are shown in fig 9 the contribution of evaporation in total salinity is calculated using d excess it was found that in the pre monsoon season salinity was due to mineral dissolution however in the monsoon and post monsoon seasons initial salinity also contributes to salinity percent area in groundwater salinity with s contribution of 2 from evapo concentration increased from 0 in pre monsoon to 94 with contributions of 2 8 in groundwater salinity the contribution of mineral dissolution is found by separating the salinity value of evaporation from dissolution the results were further tested by using tritium 3h to distinguish between modern groundwater recharge occurring during last 60 years and pre modern groundwater recharge occurring 60 years fig 10 shows the groundwater age map for the region along with the contribution of mineral dissolution in different seasons considering the 3h input sequence of precipitation in the region with average values 8 10 tu but the tu is observed as high as 22 the decayed results show that groundwater 3h with content below 2 tu likely recharged more than 60 years ago this shows that groundwater has a long residence time in high saline affected areas a majority of the samples show a contribution from mineral dissolution in the pre monsoon season with a slight decrease in monsoon and post monsoon seasons there is wide variation in tritium activities may be due to discontinue water flow or poor connectivity between aquifers in some samples high tritium activities corresponds to percolation from nearby artificial tritium sources ramaroson et al 2018 the contributions from initial salinity evapo concentration and mineral dissolution in groundwater in the study area is given in table 3 mineral dissolution contributes most of the groundwater salinity 76 97 a decrease in the contribution of mineral dissolution occurs in the monsoon season as the initial salinity contribution increases to as high as 21 this is due to the increased groundwater recharge and mobilization of accumulated salts in soils either naturally or anthropogenic sources this has also been explained through the fig 14 showing an increase in water level in salinity affected central part in post monsoon season allison et al 1990 and simpson and herczeg 1991 have also reported mobilisation of salts in the murray river basins australia due to hydrological regimes and land uses in addition to landuse changes in arid and semiarid environments irrigation and groundwater exploitation can also cause increase in salinity williams 1999 the percent area in groundwater salinity with contributions of 5 from initial salinity was 93 in pre monsoon season but changed to 97 of area having contribution from initial salinity 5 in post monsoon season fig 11 this may be due to the spread of mobilized salt to more areas the percent area in groundwater salinity with contributions of 2 from evapo concentration increased from 0 in pre monsoon to 94 with contribution of 2 8 in groundwater salinity fig 12 the mineral dissolution contribution of 95 in groundwater salinity in the pre monsoon season was in 88 of the area but it reduced to 80 90 contribution in groundwater salinity in 79 of area fig 13 these results are very useful in understanding the salinity mechanisms in the area and its relationship with the surrounding environmental phenomenon like the monsoon can play an important role in making sensible water resource management decisions adams et al 2001 fig 14 depicts the water level map of the study area it is evident from the fig 14 that water tables are deeper in the western region the water is potable in these areas and resulting in higher water withdrawals in the eastern and southern sides of the study area water is saline and water tables are high the contours of water level show a natural gradient from the aravalli hills towards the central region but due to high groundwater extraction in the foothills regions of area there is apprehension of movement of water from salinity affected areas to fresh water areas seasonal effects were found in the water levels in post monsoon seasons the water levels increased by 18 in southern south western region of the study area as compared to pre monsoon season this rise was found in water level class of 210 230 m there are possibilities of change in salinity mechanism due to the rise in groundwater levels due to precipitation 5 conclusions the use of deuterium excess is an effective tool to determine season wise pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon contribution of evapo concentration and mineral dissolution to groundwater salinity the mineral dissolution contributes maximum average salinity 76 97 the decreases in mineral dissolution contribution in monsoon and post monsoon seasons are compensated by increase in initial salinity to a large extent due to the mobilization of salts in groundwater the increase in salinity affected groundwater area due to initial salinity was found in monsoon and post monsoon seasons this study is extremely useful for determining the salinisation mechanism understanding salt movements to larger areas for their control and proper management authors statement the

8323,study region mewat renamed as nuh district of haryana india having geographical area of 1507 km2 comes under semi arid climatic conditions and aravali hill ranges separates it from rajasthan state study focus groundwater salinization is an emerging threat to water management understanding the sources of salinization and their relative contributions by different sources and seasonal variability has become priority for planning best practices in water management and suggesting remedial measures for identifying the sources of salinization the direct application of the relationship between δ18o and δd is limited as it depends upon initial isotopic composition showing no isotopic variation in the mineral dissolution process the present study advocates the use of deuterium excess which is independent of initial isotopic composition and extends this concept for identifying the relative contribution of different sources towards seasonal variability in salinization new hydrological insights for the region the district showed an average salinity of 6 7 g l in pre monsoon 7 3 g l in monsoon and 7 4 g l in post monsoon season thus a variability of 0 7 g l observed the area affected by the salinization 2 g l also registers an increase from 86 pre monsoon to 99 post monsoon period mineral dissolution is found to be responsible for overall groundwater salinization with contribution of 97 declined to 86 in post monsoon in post monsoon season contributions from initial salinity and evapoconcentration towards salinization increased by 8 and 3 respectively keywords d excess salinity mechanism seasonal changes mewat haryana 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater reservoir in most parts of the world and its consumption is only possible when it is free from any contaminants and pollutants including the salts excess salts in groundwater may lead to abandonment of supply wells groundwater salinization occurs at local and regional scales and may have diverse origins wen et al 2005 manivannan and elango 2019 as a result of geogenic sources initiated or facilitated by anthropogenic activities krishan 2019b has become a very serious and widespread groundwater contamination issue throughout the world groundwater salinization is a very common along the coasts and in island systems and was first identified more than a century ago drabbe and ghijben 1889 herzberg 1901 but increasing inland groundwater salinity in arid and semi arid regions is also posing threats to populations living in those areas krishan et al 2019a arid and semi arid regions already have fragile ecosystem that threaten the people living in these areas and increasing groundwater salinity further adds to the water resource issues of the area bennetts et al 2006 for healthier water resource management it is important to identify the sources of salinity and understand mechanisms of groundwater salinization through its chemical evolution edmunds 2009 in this context various experiments have been carried out in many parts of the world which include effects of evaporation on groundwater salinity simpson et al 1987 mobilization of salts due to change in hydrological regimes simpson and herczeg 1991 the effect of groundwater salinity on plant growth he et al 2006 manchanda and garg 2008 and deterioration in water quality edmunds 2003 for inland areas studies have examined groundwater salinity arising as a result of mineral dissolution and evapo transpiration taking place at local and regional scales hao et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 controlled by factors such as source of groundwater recharge aquifer characteristics and discharging areas isotopes can be used as an effective tool in various hydrological evaluations including understanding salinity mechanisms krishan et al 2020a b it has been reported by barnes and allison 1988 that precipitation water undergoes evaporative fractionation during the process of infiltration through the top layers of soil water infiltration on the other hand few other researchers zimmermann et al 1967 foerstel 1982 found no isotopic fractionation during salt drainage plant transpiration or mineral dissolution it has been found that stable isotopes of water δ18o and δd separately or in combination or their relations with salinity can not be used to examine the evaporation processes due to seasonal variations in source waters krishan et al 2020a b to overcome this limitation huang and pang 2012 proposed a method to explain salinity mechanisms using deuterium excess which is calculated from the stable isotopes δ18o and δd the proposed method works on the principle of mass loss ratio with a limitation of varying initial water due to different recharge sources and has been successfully tested in tarim river basin china according to this method δd and δ 18o increases in a water body undergoing evaporation which results in decreased deuterium excess and increased salinity dansgaard 1964 certain relationships between evaporation salinity and mass loss ratio can be established in the process of evaporation water gets lost to the atmosphere leaving the dissolved salts in the reserves of water resulting in increase in salinity a similar phenomenon can be observed between water lost to atmosphere and enrichment of heavier isotopic ratio for example 1 loss of water body in comparison to initial mass enriches δd value by 0 65 in egypt simpson et al 1987 0 78 for northwestern sahara fontes and gonfiantini 1967 and 0 62 for australia simpson and herczeg 1991 a similar trend can be obtained between water body loss and enrichment of δ18o gaye 2001 however both δd and δ18o vary with season representing the unique signatures of their source clark and fritz 1997 but the ability to establish a relation between salinity and water body loss with availability of initial isotopic composition for each and every scenario is limited huang and pang 2012 identified that although δd and δ18o vary with season both for groundwater and surface water the mass loss ratio remains the same thus dansgaard 1964 proposed the use of deuterium excess d represented by d δd 8δ18o to determine the relation between evaporation and salinity in india 70 of food production and economy depend on the southwest monsoon which onsets during june to ends during late september exhibits large variability in space and time and consequently leads to a considerable variation in groundwater recharge considering these facts this purpose driven study was carried out for monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons under national hydrology project india with the aims to 1 identify salinity mechanisms through the use of deuterium excess in the salinity affected mewat region of haryana 2 to understand the contribution of mineralization towards groundwater salinity and 3 to determine groundwater residence time using tritium 3h with identification of source of salinity in semi arid part of mewat an economical water management and salinity control plan can be created for the region the outputs of the study will help controlling salinity and managing water in sustainable and economical manners in the semi arid regions 2 study area the mewat district renamed as nuh is a newly formed district of haryana state india fig 1 with a geographical area of 1507 km2 and population of 1 089 406 census 2011 the district comes under semi arid climatic conditions with normal rainfall of 594 mm year out of which 80 rainfall occurs in monsoon season water level is 2 35 m below ground level mbgl in pre monsoon season and 0 9 38 1 mbgl in post monsoon season priyanka et al 2016 aravalli hill ranges occupy 199 65 km2 in the district separate mewat from rajasthan state and also check movement of sand from the thar desert in rajasthan the aravallis also help in recharging of groundwater and aquifers in these ranges are interconnected the digital elevation data shows depressions in the central part of the district with altitude decreasing from 450 m amsl meters above mean sea level to 150 m amsl fig 2 a the district is comprised of five blocks named tauru nuh punhana nagina and firozepur jhirka the nagina and parts of nuh and firozepur jhirka blocks are found with a very high groundwater salinity which is increasing over time and is reported to be advancing on fresh water aquifers thomas et al 2012 krishan et al 2017 2019c the major soil texture in the study area is loamy sand sandy loam and silty loam krishan et al 2018 land use land cover map fig 2b and d and the area statistics of land uses covers show that 64 of the district and 48 of the study area area 393 km2 is cultivated water bodies are 2 of the study area the geology of the district is dominated by middle late pleistocene and holocene fig 2c quaternary sediments alluvium deposits consists a sequence of inter layered clay silt and sand with occasional kankar formations malik and rajeshwari 2011 the point lithologs of the borelogs along with different geological formations are shown in fig 3 the lithologs show intermittent good aquifer or multiple aquifer formations at particular depths wherein the clay and silt layer formations have continuous areal extent at different layers 3 methodology 3 1 sampling in the year 2018 18 random groundwater samples were collected from the salinity influenced zone covering a 393 km2 area in nagina and firozepur jhirka blocks of the mewat district during pre monsoon april may monsoon july august and post monsoon october november seasons the sampling locations shown in fig 1 include open wells tubewells and handpumps with a depth range of 4 92 m six groundwater samples were collected from nagina and firozepur jhirka blocks for tritium analysis 3 2 analysis ec was measured on site using portable hand held hach hq30d ec meter and then converted to salinity and expressed in g l the ratios of heavy stable isotopes δ18o and δd were measured using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer di irms isoprime gv instruments u k with automatic sample preparation units at nuclear hydrology laboratory of national institute of hydrology roorkee measurement errors precision in estimates were within the limits of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δd the isotope ratios for 18o 16o and d h were expressed in per mil units using the δ notation relative to vsmow clark and fritz 1997 d excess was calculated as δ d 8 δ 18o dansgaard 1964 and globally it is 10 and it decreases with increases in evaporation and salinity for the tritium analysis 1000 ml of six groundwater samples were collected and distilled to reduce the conductivity deuterium and hydrogen were removed by the process of physico chemical fractionation in the tritium enrichment unit which is based on physico chemical fractionation by difference in the strength of bonds formed by the light versus the heavier isotope of a given element the values of tritium observed were low so a total of 8 10 cycles runs were executed using quintals process tritium concentration data files were created with the help of winq and quick start software in quintals process liquid scintillation spectrometer the concentration of tritium in terms of tritium units tu of various samples was determined tritium error of the individual samples is given in fig 10 water builds up in the aquifers in the years so age was calculated using the radioactive decay equation and called effective age mazor 2004 or tracer age 3 3 salinity mechanism groundwater salinity is the result of the combined effects of evaporation mineral dissolution and plant transpiration when plants transpire it excludes the salt present in the water in arid and semi arid climatic condition due to less rainfall in comparison to evapo transpiration the salt thus excluded gets deposited in the soil when water seeps through salty soil layer it increases the salinity of groundwater fass et al 2007 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 but out of the three phenomena it is only the effect of evaporation that is translated into a change in isotopic fractionation zimmermann et al 1967

a decrease in deuterium excess from 10 to 9 7 the summary of water samples collected from kotla is taken as reference and given in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 a relation between d excess f and salinity exists in the monsoon period the salinity value is highest at 0 53 g l because these monsoon months have heavy rainfall mineral dilution occurs along with higher evaporation which is reflected in the lower values of fraction f in the post monsoon period with its lower temperatures the evaporation decreases f 0 45 and the salinity comes down to 0 31 g l in the pre monsoon period the fraction f increases drastically and the salinity shows a decline to 0 05 g l this was possible because the groundwater level start to rise during pre monsoon seasons dilution of the regional water source by rainfall recharge can be seen in the declining salinity to understand the contribution of initial salinity evaporation and mineral dissolution the value of d excess tds and fraction after evaporation is calculated and tabulated in table 3 the value of d excess depends upon the temperature and humidity values in the area the seasonal variability in salinity and d excess are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it has been observed that the groundwater of the district showed an increase of 0 7 g l salinity from pre monsoon 6 7 g l to post monsoon season 7 4 g l the d excess shows a decline of 1 6 in post monsoon when compared to pre monsoon it decreases from 2 4 in pre monsoon to 0 8 in post monsoon which is as per the observations of dansgaard 1964 similar results showing control of seasons and climates were reported in precipitation and air moisture samples by unnikrishnan warrior et al 2010 purushothaman et al 2012 saranya et al 2018 and aneesh et al 2019 the percent area under salinity values of 2 g l increased from 86 in pre monsoon to 99 in post monsoon while percent area with d excess 0 increased from 4 in pre monsoon to 25 in post monsoon season which indicates the increase in saline affected area the sources of salinity initial salinity evaporation and mineral dissolution in different seasons are shown in fig 9 the contribution of evaporation in total salinity is calculated using d excess it was found that in the pre monsoon season salinity was due to mineral dissolution however in the monsoon and post monsoon seasons initial salinity also contributes to salinity percent area in groundwater salinity with s contribution of 2 from evapo concentration increased from 0 in pre monsoon to 94 with contributions of 2 8 in groundwater salinity the contribution of mineral dissolution is found by separating the salinity value of evaporation from dissolution the results were further tested by using tritium 3h to distinguish between modern groundwater recharge occurring during last 60 years and pre modern groundwater recharge occurring 60 years fig 10 shows the groundwater age map for the region along with the contribution of mineral dissolution in different seasons considering the 3h input sequence of precipitation in the region with average values 8 10 tu but the tu is observed as high as 22 the decayed results show that groundwater 3h with content below 2 tu likely recharged more than 60 years ago this shows that groundwater has a long residence time in high saline affected areas a majority of the samples show a contribution from mineral dissolution in the pre monsoon season with a slight decrease in monsoon and post monsoon seasons there is wide variation in tritium activities may be due to discontinue water flow or poor connectivity between aquifers in some samples high tritium activities corresponds to percolation from nearby artificial tritium sources ramaroson et al 2018 the contributions from initial salinity evapo concentration and mineral dissolution in groundwater in the study area is given in table 3 mineral dissolution contributes most of the groundwater salinity 76 97 a decrease in the contribution of mineral dissolution occurs in the monsoon season as the initial salinity contribution increases to as high as 21 this is due to the increased groundwater recharge and mobilization of accumulated salts in soils either naturally or anthropogenic sources this has also been explained through the fig 14 showing an increase in water level in salinity affected central part in post monsoon season allison et al 1990 and simpson and herczeg 1991 have also reported mobilisation of salts in the murray river basins australia due to hydrological regimes and land uses in addition to landuse changes in arid and semiarid environments irrigation and groundwater exploitation can also cause increase in salinity williams 1999 the percent area in groundwater salinity with contributions of 5 from initial salinity was 93 in pre monsoon season but changed to 97 of area having contribution from initial salinity 5 in post monsoon season fig 11 this may be due to the spread of mobilized salt to more areas the percent area in groundwater salinity with contributions of 2 from evapo concentration increased from 0 in pre monsoon to 94 with contribution of 2 8 in groundwater salinity fig 12 the mineral dissolution contribution of 95 in groundwater salinity in the pre monsoon season was in 88 of the area but it reduced to 80 90 contribution in groundwater salinity in 79 of area fig 13 these results are very useful in understanding the salinity mechanisms in the area and its relationship with the surrounding environmental phenomenon like the monsoon can play an important role in making sensible water resource management decisions adams et al 2001 fig 14 depicts the water level map of the study area it is evident from the fig 14 that water tables are deeper in the western region the water is potable in these areas and resulting in higher water withdrawals in the eastern and southern sides of the study area water is saline and water tables are high the contours of water level show a natural gradient from the aravalli hills towards the central region but due to high groundwater extraction in the foothills regions of area there is apprehension of movement of water from salinity affected areas to fresh water areas seasonal effects were found in the water levels in post monsoon seasons the water levels increased by 18 in southern south western region of the study area as compared to pre monsoon season this rise was found in water level class of 210 230 m there are possibilities of change in salinity mechanism due to the rise in groundwater levels due to precipitation 5 conclusions the use of deuterium excess is an effective tool to determine season wise pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon contribution of evapo concentration and mineral dissolution to groundwater salinity the mineral dissolution contributes maximum average salinity 76 97 the decreases in mineral dissolution contribution in monsoon and post monsoon seasons are compensated by increase in initial salinity to a large extent due to the mobilization of salts in groundwater the increase in salinity affected groundwater area due to initial salinity was found in monsoon and post monsoon seasons this study is extremely useful for determining the salinisation mechanism understanding salt movements to larger areas for their control and proper management authors statement the

8324,study region the pampas region is located in the central east part of argentina and is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the world under rainfed conditions study focus this study aims at examining how different land surface models lsms and satellite estimations reproduce daily surface and root zone soil moisture variability over 8 in situ observation sites the ability of the lsms to detect dry and wet events is also evaluated new hydrological insights for the region the surface and root zone soil moisture of the lsms and the surface soil moisture of the esa cci european space agency climate change initiative hereafter esa sm show in general a good performance against the in situ measurements in particular the bhoa balance hidrológico operativo para el agro shows the best representation of the soil moisture dynamic range and variability and the gldas global land data assimilation system noah era interim tessel tiled ecmwf s scheme for surface exchanges over land and global drought observatory gdo lisflood are able to adequately represent the soil moisture anomalies over the pampas region in addition to the lsm results also the esa sm satellite estimated anomalies proved to be valuable however the lsms and the esa sm have difficulties in reproducing the soil moisture frequency distributions based on this study it is clear that accurate forcing data and soil parameters are critical to substantially improve the ability of lsms to detect dry and wet events keywords soil moisture evaluation land surface models satellite estimations 1 introduction agricultural production is one of the economic sectors most vulnerable to climate variability and long term changes verón et al 2015 meinke et al 2006 argentina is one of the world s major agricultural exporters ranking among the top oilseed and cereal grains producers calviño and monzón 2009 crops in central eastern argentina i e pampas region are mostly cultivated under rainfed conditions thus the main climatic constraint on agricultural production is the water supply hall et al 1992 maddonni 2012 aramburu merlos et al 2015 as an example during the recent 2017 18 drought the country exports of maize and soybean were reduced by more than us 4 8 billion bolsa de cereales 2018a 2018b such significant losses affect not only the local economy but also global commodity markets and food prices fao giews 2018 which could lead to food insecurity in most vulnerable countries this alone justifies the global and regional efforts carried out by different institutions and organizations e g the wmo regional climate center for southern south america rcc ssa or the european commission s global drought observatory gdo to improve the monitoring and forecasting of the key variables that define droughts currently the main regional and global drought monitoring centers covering argentina e g climate prediction center gdo use drought indices based on precipitation soil moisture estimates from land surface models lsms and or satellite and remotely sensed vegetation statuses as individual indicators or as combined drought indicators sepulcre canto et al 2012 precipitation is a key indicator for monitoring water conditions in the soil as it is the main driver of deficit or excess conditions the propagation of these anomalies through the terrestrial segment of the hydrological cycle as well as the impacts on vegetated land is commonly analysed using soil moisture and vegetation indicators during the monitoring phase accurate estimations of soil moisture anomalies can inform rain reliant farmers about potential production impacts during the different crop growth stages i e sowing flowering it is clear that soil moisture is a key variable for monitoring the evolution of excess or deficit water conditions as such it is important to describe the strengths and limitations of the main available soil moisture data sources 1 satellite microwave

measurements i e networks are needed previous studies using soil moisture networks assessed the capability of lsms and satellite soil moisture estimations over different regions e g europe north america africa and china and found that in general lsms and satellite estimations are able to reliably reproduce the seasonal cycle albergel et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in particular albergel et al 2012 evaluated the ecmwf tessel european centre for medium range weather forecasts tiled ecmwf s scheme for surface exchanges over land lsm model forced by era interim data dee et al 2011 against soil moisture networks from several countries and regions e g spain france australia and west africa the authors also concluded that era interim i e tessel lsm surface soil moisture is well represented in those regions however they highlight that over some regions the modelled surface soil moisture has a lower variability or smaller dynamical range than the in situ measurements also a lower skill is observed over dry lands e g amma network in western africa the authors observed that the root zone soil moisture i e top 1 m of soil analysed over 48 stations shows good correlation with in situ measurements in a similar research line several global studies focused on determining the performance of satellite soil moisture estimations such as the esa cci european space agency climate change initiative hereafter referred to as esa sm daily surface combined soil moisture product dorigo et al 2017 which is a combination of the different active and passive microwave sensors from 1978 onwards the study of dorigo et al 2012 analysed global trends of surface soil moisture based on esa sm era interim and the noah lsm from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 on monthly and seasonal scales highlighting the consistency across datasets they also pointed out a good agreement with the sign of precipitation and vegetation indices trends the study of fang et al 2016 documented that esa sm soil moisture shows a good agreement with 6 in situ measurements but over many observational networks the lsm simulations driven by observed precipitation performed better than the esa sm v02 2 soil moisture product in cammalleri et al 2017 a monthly anomaly evaluation of esa sm lisflood lsm roo et al 2000 simulations and satellite land surface temperature as a proxy of soil moisture was performed they concluded that esa sm performed better over dry areas meanwhile lisflood was more reliable over regions with dense meteorological ground stations over argentina few studies evaluated lsm simulations and or satellite estimations of soil moisture e g fernández long et al 2012 spennemann et al 2015 with most of them based only on cross comparisons with proxy data e g standardized precipitation index spi for example the study of spennemann et al 2015 evaluated four lsms from gldas against different spi aggregation periods the authors concluded that the gldas lsms in particular the noah lsm ek et al 2003 are capable of representing wet and dry soil moisture anomalies on monthly time scales 1980 2008 using the bhoa balance hidrológico operativo para el agro operational water balance for agriculture applications fernández long et al 2012 water balance model performed an evaluation using the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi senay and verdin 2003 against crop yields over the pampas region argentina the results showed that the model was able to represent the relationship between wrsi and crop yields in a satisfactory way only few studies using in situ measurements were performed over argentina e g ferreira et al 2011 grings et al 2015 in particular grings et al 2015 performed an evaluation of two different satellite estimations i e advanced scatterometer ascat and soil moisture ocean salinity smos the gldas noah lsm against 16 months of daily in situ measurements from the argentinian space agency conae in central argentina córdoba they also compared the results against spi to analyse the relationship of the different soil moisture estimations during extreme wet and dry conditions the gldas noah showed high correlations against in situ measurements followed by smos passive estimations however smos estimations showed a greater dynamic range while gldas noah showed a systematic underestimation of the observed soil moisture finally the authors concluded that the three products i e gldas noah smos and spi 1 month are capable of determine extreme deficit and excesses conditions over the region the above brief overview highlights the lack of soil moisture evaluations using lsms and satellite estimations against in situ observational sites with records longer than one year and using several sites over argentina this is mainly due to the absence of extensive in situ measurement networks this study aims at narrowing this gap by using several observation sites and an observational soil moisture network developed by the conae over the pampas region therefore the main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of four lsms and the esa sm soil moisture over multiple sites and over an observational network with daily in situ measurements located within the pampas region and determining the ability capability of these soil moisture datasets in detecting dry and wet events the structure of this study is as follows section 2 presents the methods and the different sm datasets results are presented in section 3 the discussion in section 4 and finally the conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the analysis of the performance of both the lsms and the satellite datasets are based on the comparison between the in situ measurements and the estimates on the nearest grid point the error metrics include the bias simulation in situ measurements indicator to quantify the systematic errors the root mean square error rmse to provide an indication of the mean deviation of the simulated values of soil moisture compared to the observed values and the unbiased rmse unbrmse to represent the non systematic errors i e the rmse removing the bias since soil moisture is usually not normally distributed mo 2008 the non parametric spearman correlation was used the spearman correlation metric is essentially a pearson correlation coefficient but computed using the ranks of the data wilks 2011 the surface soil moisture depth varies among the lsms see table 1 for example the surface layer root zone depths range from 0 7 cm 0 45 cm to 0 15 cm 0 150 cm and it is variable in the case of satellite estimations thus in order to make the different metrics comparable the bias rmse and unbrmse were divided by the mean soil moisture values of the corresponding lsm satellite estimation in this sense the different metric errors are relative to the different mean values expressed in corresponding to the different soil depths this also allows a more direct comparison between the lsm metrics mm units in this study and the satellite estimations m3 m3 the soil moisture anomalies i e without the seasonal effect were constructed using a moving window of 35 days 17 days as a departure from the 5 weeks mean values and then scaled by the standard deviation from the same time window albergel et al 2012 this procedure of calculating the soil moisture anomalies using relative short time records is able to reasonable reproduce the percentile distribution frequency of longer records ford et al 2016 in our case a minimum of 5 records during this 35 days period was required to calculate the anomalies when this criterion was not fulfilled that specific time was not considered in the analysis taking into account the differences in depths and lsms the soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies were standardised to make the different kernel density functions comparable in that sense the following standardization was applied 1 s m s t a n d s m s m 5 s m 95 s m 5 where smstand corresponds to standardized soil moisture sm5 and sm95 correspond to the 5th and 95th percentiles of soil moisture respectively thus all standardized soil moisture values fall approximately within the 0 1 range to quantify the ability of the lsms to characterize both surplus and deficit soil moisture conditions all the time series were divided in terciles upper 67 100 middle 34 66 and lower 0 33 then a hit for dry events was considered when a lsm simulation showed a value at the lowest tercile that was also observed i e hit rate an error was considered when the observation showed a value at the lowest tercile but the lsm showed a value in the upper tercile i e false alarm the same criterion was applied for the detection of wet events 2 2 in situ measurements the conae soil moisture observational network consists of 66 sites and 100 sensors distributed in the pampas region the sensors used are hydra probe ii stevens 1 1 mention of trade names does not constitute endorsement by the authors with hourly time steps at soil depths of 5 cm and or 50 cm depending on the site the original soil moisture measurements are in volumetric units m3 m3 which are converted to absolute values of column of water in the soil mm to make them comparable to the lsms outputs the 5 cm and 50 cm measurement depths are representative of 0 10 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers e g albergel et al 2012 2008 the original volumetric units were kept when comparing against the satellite estimations with the aim to perform the analysis on a dataset of consistent and long ground records only the sites with at least 1 year of in situ measurements not necessarily consecutive days were used in this analysis following this criteria 8 sites were selected for this study see spatial location in fig 1 and details in table 2 the hourly in situ measurements were aggregated to daily data considering only days with less than 33 of missing hourly data i e maximum of 8 hourly measurements missing the data were averaged over 12utc to 12utc time in order to be comparable with some of the operational lsms e g bhoa with the exception of the location of monte buey mb see location in fig 1 the rest of the sites have only 1 one sensor measuring it is worth mentioning that the mb site located in the province of córdoba in central argentina is the core site for validation of satellite missions like the soil moisture active passive smap over south america colliander et al 2017 the core site of mb started measuring in 2012 and has 43 sensors that were used during an intensive field campaign with the idea of being comparable across different spatial scales the sensor distribution is shown in thibeault et al 2015 however as the number of sensors changed over time a specific criterion was applied in order to get a spatial soil moisture value representative for that area the criteria for selecting the most representative sensor in the mb site i e being approximately representative of a 80 30 km2 area focused first on finding the sensors with the longest time record and lowest mean relative difference mrd eq 2 2 m r d j i s j s s where s corresponds to the sensor number j s corresponds to the spatial average among all sensors available for that day and i index accounts for the number of measurements of sensor j used to perform the summation the sensor identification number used based on this criteria is the n 55 following this analysis it is worth noting that this location is the only site were the soil moisture values are representative of an area comparable to the lsms satellite spatial grid scale 2 3 land surface models the land surface models lsms tested in this study are widely used by the scientific community and by operational national centers gldas noah gldas version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 ek et al 2003 era interim tessel van den hurk et al 2000v gdo lisflood roo et al 2000 and the bhoa bucket model fernández long et al 2012 the gldas noah and era interim tessel are reanalysis type products disseminated with a delay of 2 3 months whereas gdo lisflood and bhoa are operational products available in near real time the bhoa is a single layer hydrological bucket model that is locally driven by observations e g precipitation from conventional meteorological stations from the argentinean meteorological service smn all measurement sites described in table 1 used in bhoa coincide with smn meteorological stations except for mb and ata that use observations from marcos juarez 39 km and sunchales 13 km respectively it also incorporates local information about the soil types e g field capacity and wilting point despite that bhoa has only one layer a second simulation based on the 25 of the field capacity i e maximum water retained in the soil was performed in order to represent the surface soil moisture the gldas 2 1 noah uses a combination of global precipitation climatology project gpcp and noaa gdas national oceanic and atmospheric administration global data assimilation system atmospheric analysis and the u s air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modelling system agrmet radiation fields the noah lsm is a 1 d column model which explicitly simulates soil moisture soil temperature snow depth etc it is used since 1996 in the operational ncep national centers for environmental prediction models the root depth corresponds to 0 100 cm depth of the lsm except for the forest 0 200 cm and tundra 0 40 cm vegetation classes the soil textures are based on the fao food and agricultural organization 16 categories the forcing variables used in the tessel lsm come from the era interim reanalysis variables to drive the model this lsm is also a 1 d column model where the rooting depth depends on the vegetation class which is represented as a distribution percentage of roots the highest percentage of roots is located within the 0 100 cm layer for example the forest vegetation class has the highest percentage of roots in the 100 289 cm layer 19 and the rest 81 in the 0 100 cm layer the tessel lsm uses only one type of soil texture for the entire world which is an important difference compared with the other lsms the lisflood is a gis based distributed hydrological rainfall runoff routing model designed to reproduce the soil moisture dynamic in three sub layers surface root zone and sub soil burek et al 2013 the version used in this study has been operationally implemented for drought monitoring in gdo and uses daily meteorological forcing maps derived from the ecmwf dataset as spatially resampled and harmonized by the jrc monitoring agricultural resources mars group the gldas 2 1 noah and bhoa were temporal averaged from 12utc to 12utc the era interim tessel outputs correspond to 12utc and lisflood 00utc the spatial resolution and soil depth for each lsm are detailed in table 1 the surface soil moisture depths from the different lsms are gldas noah 0 10 cm era interim 0 7 cm bhoa 0 15 cm the depths for the deeper soil moisture considered in this study as root zone soil moisture are gldas noah 0 100 cm era interim 0 100 cm bhoa 0 150 cm lisflood varying from 0 16 cm ataliva ata fig 1 0 75 cm venado tuerto vt to 0 95 cm anguil ang 2 4 satellite estimations the esa sm daily surface soil moisture product version 4 2 accessed on may 2018 liu et al 2011 2012 dorigo et al 2017 is here tested in this study only the passive product estimations are analysed based on the results of grings et al 2015 over the pampas region the authors highlight the sensitivity to vegetation of the active estimations compared to the passive ones furthermore the potential limitations of this product are documented in dorigo et al 2017 and dorigo et al 2012 in the period of interest see table 1 the passive product uses smos 2009 november onwards smap 2015 february onwards and amsr2 2012 july onwards the satellite soil moisture estimation depth varies from 0 to a few centimetres seneviratne et al 2010 3 results 3 1 surface soil moisture the correlation coefficients for each of the 8 sites are reported in table 3 for the surface datasets along the average result for each model these results show that the best performance is obtained for bhoa 0 74 followed by era interim 0 65 esa sm satellite estimations 0 64 and gldas noah 0 58 the average absolute bias is reported in table 3 last row in order to prevent that positive bias in some locations compensates negative bias in other locations the average absolute bias shows the lowest values for the esa sm estimation 13 0 and the highest for era interim 53 1 the rmse average shows that bhoa esa sm and gldas noah have similar values ranging between 32 8 and 35 8 meanwhile the highest rmse is observed for era interim 61 7 the mean non systematic errors unbrmse show similar percentages ranging from 24 9 for gldas noah to 29 3 for the esa sm suggesting similar performance for all the models in term of non systematic errors the bhoa shows the highest correlation values over pergamino per with r 0 89 and gldas noah the lowest correlation over venado tuerto vt r 0 30 in regard to the bias the esa sm shows the lowest absolute value in vt 0 78 and era interim shows the highest underestimation over parana par 113 1 the era interim also shows the highest rmse value in par 113 1 related to the high values of bias and the lowest rmse is shown by gldas noah in per 16 5 the unbrmse shows the highest value for esa sm 46 63 in ata and the lowest for bhoa in per 12 37 since some differences in performance could be due to the incompleteness of the time series as the observational lengths of the records are different we also contrasted the results only for the sites with records longer than 2 years i e ang vt and mb also in this case the lsms and esa sm still show a good performance even if the bhoa shows still the highest correlation 0 76 followed in this case first by esa sm 0 63 and second by era interim 0 61 and last as above by gldas noah 0 47 also the bias and unbrmse metrics averaged for ang mb and vt for the lsms and esa sm stands as described above considering all sites for the rmse the order also stands but with an increment from 23 1 to 35 9 for gldas noah complementing table 3 the spatial distribution of the correlations and relative bias are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively in fig 2 a good agreement r 0 6 is observed for the lsms and esa sm over the buenos aires province i e tan bar and per sites for the rest of the locations all soil moisture products show at least one site with correlation lower than 0 6 the lowest agreement is observed over ang for gldas noah era interim and esa sm where only bhoa estimations tend to represent local conditions satisfactorily unlike the rest of the lsms and the esa sm estimations in fig 3 era interim shows in general a dry bias i e negative values except for anguil ang gldas noah and era interim behave similarly in terms of errors showing the driest bias in par and the wettest in ang meanwhile bhoa and esa sm show the driest bias in tan see also table 3 in particular all products show a wet bias for the surface soil moisture in the ang site and a dry bias over the par site the two longest time series of surface soil moisture are shown in figs 4 mb and 5 vt the bhoa shows a similar but higher dynamical range compared to the in situ measurements in mb fig 4 panel b whereas the gldas noah and era interim show a lower dynamic range in addition both lsms show some peaks in soil moisture likely related to precipitation events that were not observed locally e g july 2015 in era interim these discrepancies can be explained by the difficulties for global and regional forcing to correctly capture some local scale meteorological conditions bhoa often reaches the saturation with values of 45 mm for mb and 40 mm for vt which is not observed in the other lsms above these values the soil moisture surplus is considered as an excess and not retained in the soil i e surface runoff the so called dry down periods i e rate at which soil moisture dries out after a precipitation event are better represented by bhoa compared to gldas noah and era interim in these locations this effect is more evident for several days after july 2013 and prior to july 2014 the esa sm 2012 2016 is able to adequately represent wet and dry events during this period of time fig 6 nevertheless it shows a higher dynamical range over both vt and mb locations similarly to the bhoa dynamics it also shows a higher day to day variability compared to the in situ measurements and to the lsm simulations which is expected given the thin layer observed by passive satellite products i e from millimetres to few centimetres depth 3 2 root zone soil moisture analogously to the results reported for the surface layer the results for root zone are summarized in table 4 overall a decrease in the performance of the lsms for the deeper layer is observed compared to the surface layer although it is worth pointing out that at this soil depth the number of analysed sites is smaller compared to the surface layer see table 3 comparing the two depths surface vs root zone the averaged correlation values show lower values for the root zone bhoa 0 69 gldas noah 0 07 and era interim 0 59 however it is interesting to note that the bhoa shows higher correlation for vt and par and lower for ang compared to the surface layer thus bhoa improves the correlation of the deeper soil moisture variability over vt and par compared to the surface soil moisture the opposite behaviour is observed for gldas noah which shows a considerable deterioration of the soil moisture representation compared to the surface layer as for the surface layer the era interim also shows a good agreement for the deeper layer the lisflood shows on average an intermediate agreement 0 38 being considerable better to gldas noah but inferior to era interim and bhoa the relative bias shows a deterioration of bhoa and gldas noah performance almost doubling the bias values in absolute terms for the root zone compared to the surface soil moisture the era interim shows an improvement of near 12 in the performance of the root zone soil moisture all lsms show a wet i e positive bias for the root zone soil moisture over ang and a dry bias over par a behaviour also observed for the surface layer soil moisture over vt era interim and lisflood show a wet bias and gldas noah and bhoa show a dry bias in particular gldas noah and bhoa show a decrease in the bias for the root zone layer over ang and era interim shows a considerable increase of almost 20 compared to the surface layer the rmse root zone soil moisture shows higher values for gldas noah and bhoa compared to surface layer and the opposite is shown by era interim the unbrmse shows lower values for bhoa and era interim and higher for gldas noah for the root zone soil moisture compared to the surface layer the temporal series of root zone soil moisture for ang par and vt are depicted in fig 7 over ang some soil moistures peaks likely following precipitation events are not captured by the lsms e g before july 2013 and during 2013 2014 austral summer however in general terms the lsms are able to reproduce the observed dry and wet periods it is worth noting that around july 2013 the gldas noah bhoa and lisflood are not able to adequately represent the drying period consistently with the error metrics lisflood and era interim show a considerable difference in the mean value in particular lisflood shows lower short term i e daily variability compared to the other lsms and shows at least three periods with near constant high soil moisture values this may be due to the real time nature of the lisflood model and the absence of any corrections for the meteorological forcing in those periods in the par site all lsms underestimated the mean soil moisture value also a dry period that lasted for several months centred in july 2016 is not well represented by the lsms in general in the vt site a good performance of all lsms is observed in agreement with the performance metrics of table 4 however in particular the gldas noah simulations present a good agreement before 2015 but with a considerable reduction in the performance after this year 3 3 soil moisture anomalies and dry wet event detection in order to analyse the soil moisture anomalies i e subtracting the seasonality of the time series as in eq 1 the correlation between the observed anomalies the lsms and esa sm surface and root zone anomalies were calculated and summarized in table 5 average correlations of surface soil moisture anomalies shown in table 5 are always equal or weaker if compared with the soil moisture correlations table 3 this is observed for bhoa 0 74 vs 0 69 gldas noah 0 58 vs 0 58 era interim 0 65 vs 0 59 and esa sm 0 64 vs 0 53 but over particular sites the correlation show equal or higher values of the surface soil moisture anomalies compared to the soil moisture series for bhoa over vt and ang gldas noah over tan vt par and mb era interim over mb and for esa sm over bar for the root zone layer the soil moisture anomalies show on average except for era interim higher correlation values compared to the soil moisture correlations bhoa 0 69 vs 0 71 gldas noah 0 26 vs 0 48 era interim 0 59 vs 0 50 and lisflood 0 40 vs 0 48 the improvement of the gldas noah correlation is remarkable this improvement could be related with a poor representation of the soil moisture seasonality in particular years in other words gldas noah shows a better agreement in representing the short term variability than the variability with the seasonal effect included in general the soil moisture anomalies show higher correlation values for the surface layer compared to the root zone layer except for bhoa over the par and vt sites a similar behaviour was observed over par and vt when comparing surface soil moisture against root zone soil moisture for bhoa in section 3 2 the plots in figs 8 and 9 show the density functions of the standardized surface soil moisture and the anomalies for the locations of mb and vt and of the root zone soil moisture and the root zone anomalies for the locations of ang par and vt respectively as shown by mo 2008 over different regions of the united states soil moisture distributions can differ from a gaussian normal shape only in the vt site the soil moisture in situ measurements fig 8c exhibit a type of gaussian distribution meanwhile the other locations show a bimodal shape it is interesting to note that there is a change in the distribution shape from the surface normal like to the deeper layer bimodal the soil moisture anomalies show in general a normal distribution shape except for the root zone soil moisture in ang fig 9d analysing the lsms in some cases they show a different type of distribution compared to the in situ measurements as in case of gldas noah surface soil moisture in mb fig 8a gldas noah and lisflood root zone soil moisture in par fig 9e and gldas noah root zone soil moisture in vt fig 9a in ang all lsms show for the root zone soil moisture a similar bimodal shape fig 9c except of era interim which presents a bimodal distribution but positively skewed with a longer right tail the esa sm shows a similar distribution shape for the vt surface soil moisture but for mb a more symmetric distribution shape instead of an observed bimodal distribution not shown in spite of the fact that soil moisture anomalies show a better agreement between the observed and simulated distributions the kolmogorov smirnov test for 2 samples was applied in order to quantify the differences the null hypothesis of this test i e that both samples are drawn from the same distribution was rejected in most cases with p 0 01 meaning that the lsm and the esa sm are not able to accurately reproduce the observed soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies distributions the null hypothesis was not rejected for the surface soil moisture anomalies of bhoa over vt and for era interim the soil moisture anomalies over mb surface and vt root zone and over par for the root zone soil moisture the lsms ability in representing wet and dry events by means of the root zone soil moisture anomalies is shown in fig 10 overall the lsms show similar values for detecting dry and wet events with slightly higher performance for detecting dry events except for era interim in vt the lsms show for the dry events lower errors over vt compared to ang and par for both dry and wet events bhoa shows the best performance in detecting extreme values with hit rate values above 63 in all sites showing the highest values over par and vt with a hit rate of 76 for dry events comparing the detection of dry and wet events in par the percentage of dry events is higher in contrast to the wet events for all lsms this behaviour is also observed in the location of vt for bhoa gldas noah and lisflood but the opposite behaviour is shown by era interim for the ang site all lsms show equal or higher hit rate percentage of dry events compared to wet events for the dry events the errors averaged over all sites show similar values between all lsms in particular bhoa shows the lowest false alarm value 9 and lisflood the highest 15 closely followed by era interim with 14 the highest false alarm percentage for dry events is observed in ang 16 and par 16 by lisflood and era interim respectively averaging all lsms over all three sites the ability for detecting dry events is of 62 and 58 for wet events and the errors are 13 and 12 respectively 4 discussion the bhoa shows the overall best performance agreement for both surface and root zone which can be attributed to the fact that this simple bucket model compared to the other lsms uses observed local precipitation radiation and soil properties data this is not the case for the other lsms where global forcing may not be able to always capture the actual dynamic of local meteorological data as an example while the overall correlation for gldas noah surface soil moisture over the vt site is equal to 0 30 if the periods june 2012 april 2015 and may 2015 december 2017 are analysed separately the correlation values are r 0 60 and r 0 37 respectively these different results can be explained by some precipitation events and consequent soil moisture peaks shown by the lsm time series that were not observed in the ground record these results are in line with several studies e g kato et al 2007 documenting that the key aspects of the lsms performance rely on the quality of the forcing data used e g precipitation the soil properties e g soil texture and on the soil physics parameterizations of the different lsms previous studies documented that 5 cm and 50 cm soil moisture measurements can be considered to be representative of the 0 10 cm and 0 100 cm depth soil moisture e g albergel et al 2012 but it must be kept in mind that among the lsms the surface layer root zone varies from 0 7 cm 0 45 cm to 0 15 cm 0 150 cm which also not exactly matches with the observed measurements therefore the difference in soil depth between measurements lsms and esa sm as well as the different spatial resolution could be another potential source of discrepancy between the outcomes of the various datasets also the different soil moisture temporal averages of the lsms e g bhoa 12 12 utc and era interim 00 00 utc could be a further source of discrepancy introducing systematic differences related to the representation of the precipitation diurnal cycle this could be more evident for the fast responding surface soil moisture whereas it may be less relevant for the root zone soil moisture due to the relative slower dynamics compared to surface soil moisture our study shows results that are consistent with the ones reported in grings et al 2015 in regard to the dynamic range of the surface soil moisture over the mb site the authors observed that smos estimations show a greater dynamic range and gldas noah shows a systematic underestimation compared to the observed soil moisture for 2012 2014 however they mention that gldas noah shows higher correlations than smos used in the esa sm product passive estimations in this study where a longer record was analysed the esa sm satellite estimations show higher correlation than gldas noah over mb a difference possible related to the forcing uncertainties in the model as mentioned above it is important to further stress that mb is the only site were the soil moisture values are representative of an area comparable to the lsms satellite spatial grid scale in general it seems that the dynamic range of the observed surface soil moisture is overestimated by bhoa and esa sm and underestimated by gldas noah and era interim over both mb and vt sites the most adequate representation is given by bhoa which could be related to the use of more accurate soil hydraulic parameters e g field capacity and wilting point these parameters seem to be critical to the other lsms showing important differences in the soil moisture dynamic range which led to a strong bias in particular in albergel et al 2012 the tessel lsm used in era interim is compared against a new version of the lsm the h tessel one of the main improvements of h tessel is related to the utilization of a global texture data because the tessel only uses a specific value of soil texture an obvious consequence of using a constant value of soil texture is an inadequate representation of the soil moisture dynamic range in this study the era interim tessel also had problems to adequately reproduce this feature showing the highest bias values among the different lsms besides this era interim showed good results albergel et al 2012 also showed that era interim tends to overestimate the soil moisture values over dry regions in this study all lsms except bhoa showed an overestimation of the soil moisture values over ang which is the driest site considered with an annual precipitation of 632 2 mm year however in our study there is not a clear impact of the soil moisture overestimation on the correlations as documented by albergel et al 2012 over the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma network in west africa in the amma network a large overestimation of era interim soil moisture led to a smaller variability and consequently to poor correlation in general the bias errors can be corrected calibrated i e bias correction but this type of correction has no effect when the overestimation reaches values near the field capacity or higher as was the case of the amma network in the case of gldas noah considerable error amplification from the surface soil moisture to the root zone soil moisture was observed based on this study it is not possible to determine if the source of error is mainly related to the data forcing or also enhanced by the soil parameter uncertainties and or physical parameterizations of the model the other lsms also show on average lower correlations for the root zone compared to the surface soil moisture however bhoa shows higher correlation over two i e vt and par of the three sites and era interim shows the same correlation value over one site i e ang a similar behaviour is documented by albergel et al 2012 over particular soil moisture networks with lower correlation values for the root zone compared with surface soil moisture but the authors observed that on average the root zone shows higher correlation values the lsms and the esa sm have difficulties in reproducing the point scale soil moisture i e surface and root zone frequency distributions nevertheless the shape of the distributions of soil moisture anomalies showed more resemblance with the in situ measurements than the soil moisture series additionally over particular sites some of the lsms i e bhoa and gldas noah showed an improvement in the correlation values of the root zone soil moisture anomalies i e short term variability compared to the soil moisture time series the latter results related to the root zone anomalies were reflected in the good degree of confidence shown by all lsms in the ability of detecting anomaly dry and wet events in particular the wet events showed higher errors which can be presumably attributed to for example underestimation of local intense precipitation events or missing of some local events 5 conclusions the lsms and the esa sm satellite soil moisture estimations showed to be able to represent the main characteristics of the local soil moisture variability in general soil moisture products based on lsms focus on anomalies in order to detect excess or deficit soil moisture conditions but this is not the case with bhoa which was designed to represent the water content available for crops in this sense it is encouraging for the different products as bhoa is able to better represent the soil moisture dynamic range and variability compared to the other lsms and gldas noah era interim and lisflood are able to adequately represent the soil moisture anomalies over the pampas region in addition to the lsm results also the esa sm anomalies proved to be valuable nevertheless the reliability of the results obtained in this study could be sensitive to different factors such as differences in soil depth between datasets differences between point scale measurements and area average estimates i e lsm spatial grid as well as differences in lsm and satellite spatial resolutions and temporal averages accurate forcing data and soil parameters are critical to substantially improve the ability to detect dry and wet events in fact even with lsms forced with local observations the percentage of false alarms is not negligible i e about 9 for dry events thus suggesting to further investigate the conditions under which the lsms are most likely to reproduce or miss the deficit conditions in order to recommend improvements on model parameterization that may still be needed even for local models a further evaluation will focus on the impact of these differences among the lsms in representing dry events in the framework of a combined drought index specifically designed for this region

lsms to detect dry and wet events is also evaluated new hydrological insights for the region the surface and root zone soil moisture of the lsms and the surface soil moisture of the esa cci european

agricultural production is one of the economic sectors most vulnerable to climate variability and long term changes verón et al 2015 meinke et al 2006 argentina is one of the world s major agricultural exporters ranking among the top oilseed and cereal grains producers calviño and monzón 2009 crops in central eastern argentina i e pampas region are mostly cultivated under rainfed conditions thus the main climatic constraint on agricultural production is the water supply hall et al 1992 maddonni 2012 aramburu merlos et al 2015 as an example during the recent 2017 18 drought the country exports of maize and soybean were reduced by more than us 4 8 billion bolsa de cereales 2018a 2018b such significant losses affect not only the local economy but also global commodity markets and food prices fao giews 2018 which could lead to food insecurity in most vulnerable countries this alone justifies the global and regional efforts carried out by different institutions and organizations e g the wmo regional climate center for southern south america rcc ssa or the european commission s global drought observatory gdo to improve the monitoring and forecasting of the key variables that define droughts currently the main regional and global drought monitoring centers covering argentina e g climate prediction center gdo use drought indices based on precipitation soil moisture estimates from land surface models lsms and or satellite and remotely sensed vegetation statuses as individual indicators or as combined drought indicators sepulcre canto et al 2012 precipitation is a key indicator for monitoring water conditions in the soil as it is the main driver of deficit or excess conditions the propagation of these anomalies through the terrestrial segment of the hydrological cycle as well as the impacts on vegetated land is commonly analysed using soil moisture and vegetation indicators during the monitoring phase accurate estimations of soil moisture anomalies can inform rain reliant farmers about potential production impacts during the different crop growth stages i e sowing flowering it is clear that soil moisture is a key variable for monitoring the evolution of excess or deficit water conditions as such it is important to describe the strengths and limitations of the main available soil moisture data sources 1 satellite microwave

measurements i e networks are needed previous studies using soil moisture networks assessed the capability of lsms and satellite soil moisture estimations over different regions e g europe north america africa and china and found that in general lsms and satellite estimations are able to reliably reproduce the seasonal cycle albergel et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in particular albergel et al

moisture networks from several countries and regions e g spain france australia and west africa the authors also concluded that era interim i e tessel lsm surface soil moisture is well represented in those regions however they highlight that over some regions the modelled surface soil moisture has a lower variability or smaller dynamical range than the in situ measurements also a lower skill is observed over dry lands e g amma network in western africa the authors observed that the root zone soil moisture i e top 1 m of soil analysed over 48 stations shows good correlation with in situ measurements in a similar research line several global studies focused on determining the performance of satellite soil moisture estimations such as the esa cci european space agency climate change initiative hereafter referred to as esa sm daily surface combined soil moisture product dorigo et al 2017 which is a combination of the different active and passive microwave sensors from 1978 onwards the study of dorigo et al 2012 analysed global trends of surface soil moisture based on esa sm era interim and the noah lsm from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 on monthly and seasonal scales highlighting the consistency across datasets they also pointed out a good agreement with the sign of precipitation and vegetation indices trends the study of fang et al 2016 documented that esa sm soil moisture shows a good agreement with 6 in situ measurements but over many observational networks the lsm simulations driven by observed precipitation performed better than the esa sm v02 2 soil moisture product in cammalleri et al 2017 a monthly anomaly evaluation of esa sm lisflood lsm roo et al 2000 simulations and satellite land surface temperature as a proxy of soil moisture was performed they concluded that esa sm performed better over dry areas meanwhile lisflood was more reliable over regions with dense meteorological ground stations over argentina few studies evaluated lsm simulations and or satellite estimations of soil moisture e g fernández long et al 2012 spennemann et al 2015 with most of them based only on cross comparisons with proxy data e g standardized precipitation index spi for example the study of spennemann et al 2015 evaluated four lsms from gldas against different spi aggregation periods the authors concluded that the gldas lsms in particular the noah lsm ek et al 2003 are capable of representing wet and dry soil moisture anomalies on monthly time scales 1980 2008 using the bhoa balance hidrológico operativo para el agro operational water balance for agriculture applications fernández long et al 2012 water balance model performed an evaluation using the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi senay and verdin 2003 against crop yields over the pampas region argentina the results showed that the model was able to represent the relationship between wrsi and crop yields in a satisfactory way only few studies using in situ measurements were performed over argentina e g ferreira et al 2011 grings et al 2015 in particular grings et al 2015 performed an evaluation of two different satellite estimations i e advanced scatterometer ascat and soil moisture ocean salinity smos the gldas noah lsm against 16 months of daily in situ measurements from the argentinian space agency conae in central argentina córdoba they also compared the results against spi to analyse the relationship of the different soil moisture estimations during extreme wet and dry conditions the gldas noah showed high correlations against in situ measurements followed by smos passive estimations however smos estimations showed a greater dynamic range while gldas noah showed a systematic underestimation of the observed soil moisture finally the authors concluded that the three products i e gldas noah smos and spi 1 month are capable of determine extreme deficit and excesses conditions over the region the above brief overview highlights the lack of soil moisture evaluations using lsms and satellite estimations against in situ observational sites with records longer than one year and using several sites over argentina this is mainly due to the absence of extensive in situ measurement networks this study aims at narrowing this gap by using several observation sites and an observational soil moisture network developed by the conae over the pampas region therefore the main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of four lsms and the esa sm soil moisture over multiple sites and over an observational network with daily in situ measurements located within the pampas region and determining the ability capability of these soil moisture datasets in detecting dry and wet events the structure of this study is as follows section 2 presents the methods and the different sm datasets results are presented in section 3 the discussion in section 4 and finally the conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the analysis of the performance of both the lsms and the satellite datasets are based on the comparison between the in situ measurements and the estimates on the nearest grid point the error metrics include the bias simulation in situ measurements indicator to quantify the systematic errors the root mean square error rmse to provide an indication of the mean deviation of the simulated values of soil moisture compared to the observed values and the unbiased rmse unbrmse to represent the non systematic errors i e the rmse removing the bias since soil moisture is usually not normally distributed mo 2008 the non parametric spearman correlation was used the spearman correlation metric is essentially a pearson correlation coefficient but computed using the ranks of the data wilks 2011 the surface soil moisture depth varies among the lsms see table 1 for example the surface layer root zone depths range from 0 7 cm 0 45 cm to 0 15 cm 0 150 cm and it is variable in the case of satellite estimations thus in order to make the different metrics comparable the bias rmse and unbrmse were divided by the mean soil moisture values of the corresponding lsm satellite estimation in this sense the different metric errors are relative to the different mean values expressed in corresponding to the different soil depths this also allows a more direct comparison between the lsm metrics mm units in this study and the satellite estimations m3 m3 the soil moisture anomalies i e without the seasonal effect were constructed using a moving window of 35 days 17 days as a departure from the 5 weeks mean values and then scaled by the standard deviation from the same time window albergel et al 2012 this procedure of calculating the soil moisture anomalies using relative short time records is able to reasonable reproduce the percentile distribution frequency of longer records ford et al 2016 in our case a minimum of 5 records during this 35 days period was required to calculate the anomalies when this criterion was not fulfilled that specific time was not considered in the analysis taking into account the differences in depths and lsms the soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies were standardised to make the different kernel density functions comparable in that sense the following standardization was applied 1 s m s t a n d s m s m 5 s m 95 s m 5 where smstand corresponds to standardized soil moisture sm5 and sm95 correspond to the 5th and 95th percentiles of soil moisture respectively thus all standardized soil moisture values fall approximately within the 0 1 range to quantify the ability of the lsms to characterize both surplus and deficit soil moisture conditions all the time series were divided in terciles upper 67 100 middle 34 66 and lower 0 33 then a hit for dry events was considered when a lsm simulation showed a value at the lowest tercile that was also observed i e hit rate an error was considered when the observation showed a value at the lowest tercile but the lsm showed a value in the upper tercile i e false alarm the same criterion was applied for the detection of wet events 2 2 in situ measurements the conae soil moisture observational network consists of 66 sites and 100 sensors distributed in the pampas region the sensors used are hydra probe ii stevens 1 1 mention of trade names does not constitute endorsement by the authors with hourly time steps at soil depths of 5 cm and or 50 cm depending on the site the original soil moisture measurements are in volumetric units m3 m3 which are converted to absolute values of column of water in the soil mm to make them comparable to the lsms outputs the 5 cm and 50 cm measurement depths are representative of 0 10 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers e g albergel et al 2012 2008 the original volumetric units were kept when comparing against the satellite estimations with the aim to perform the analysis on a dataset of consistent and long ground records only the sites with at least 1 year of in situ measurements not necessarily consecutive days were used in this analysis following this criteria 8 sites were selected for this study see spatial location in fig 1 and details in table 2 the hourly in situ measurements were aggregated to daily data considering only days with less than 33 of missing hourly data i e maximum of 8 hourly measurements missing the data were averaged over 12utc to 12utc time in order to be comparable with some of the operational lsms e g bhoa with the exception of the location of monte buey mb see location in fig 1 the rest of the sites have only 1 one sensor measuring it is worth mentioning that the mb site located in the province of córdoba in central argentina is the core site for validation of satellite missions like the soil moisture active passive smap over south america colliander et al 2017 the core site of mb started measuring in 2012 and has 43 sensors that were used during an intensive field campaign with the idea of being comparable across different spatial scales the sensor distribution is shown in thibeault et al 2015 however as the number of sensors changed over time a specific criterion was applied in order to get a spatial soil moisture value representative for that area the criteria for selecting the most representative sensor in the mb site i e being approximately representative of a 80 30 km2 area focused first on finding the sensors with the longest time record and lowest mean relative difference mrd eq 2 2 m r d j i s j s s where s corresponds to the sensor number j s corresponds to the spatial average among all sensors available for that day and i index accounts for the number of measurements of sensor j used to perform the summation the sensor identification number used based on this criteria is the n 55 following this analysis it is worth noting that this location is the only site were the soil moisture values are representative of an area comparable to the lsms satellite spatial grid scale 2 3 land surface models the land surface models lsms tested in this study are widely used by the scientific community and by operational national centers gldas noah gldas version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 ek et al 2003 era interim tessel van den hurk et al 2000v gdo lisflood roo et al 2000 and the bhoa bucket model fernández long et al 2012 the gldas noah and era interim tessel are reanalysis type products disseminated with a delay of 2 3 months whereas gdo lisflood and bhoa are operational products available in near real time the bhoa is a single layer hydrological bucket model that is locally driven by observations e g precipitation from conventional meteorological stations from the argentinean meteorological service smn all measurement sites described in table 1 used in bhoa coincide with smn meteorological stations except for mb and ata that use observations from marcos juarez 39 km and sunchales 13 km respectively it also incorporates local information about the soil types e g field capacity and wilting point despite that bhoa has only one layer a second simulation based on the 25 of the field capacity i e maximum water retained in the soil was performed in order to represent the surface soil moisture the gldas 2 1 noah uses a combination of global precipitation climatology project gpcp and noaa gdas national oceanic and atmospheric administration global data assimilation system atmospheric analysis and the u s air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modelling system agrmet radiation fields the noah lsm is a 1 d column model which explicitly simulates soil moisture soil temperature snow depth etc it is used since 1996 in the operational ncep national centers for environmental prediction models the root depth corresponds to 0 100 cm depth of the lsm except for the forest 0 200 cm and tundra 0 40 cm vegetation classes the soil textures are based on the fao food and agricultural organization 16 categories the forcing variables used in the tessel lsm come from the era interim reanalysis variables to drive the model this lsm is also a 1 d column model where the rooting depth depends on the vegetation class which is represented as a distribution percentage of roots the highest percentage of roots is located within the 0 100 cm layer for example the forest vegetation class has the highest percentage of roots in the 100 289 cm layer 19 and the rest 81 in the 0 100 cm layer the tessel lsm uses only one type of soil texture for the entire world which is an important difference compared with the other lsms the lisflood is a gis based distributed hydrological rainfall runoff routing model designed to reproduce the soil moisture dynamic in three sub layers surface root zone and sub soil burek et al 2013 the version used in this study has been operationally implemented for drought monitoring in gdo and uses daily meteorological forcing maps derived from the ecmwf dataset as spatially resampled and harmonized by the jrc monitoring agricultural resources mars group the gldas 2 1 noah and bhoa were temporal averaged from 12utc to 12utc the era interim tessel outputs correspond to 12utc and lisflood 00utc the spatial resolution and soil depth for each lsm are detailed in table 1 the surface soil moisture depths from the different lsms are gldas noah 0 10 cm era interim 0 7 cm bhoa 0 15 cm the depths for the deeper soil moisture considered in this study as root zone soil moisture are gldas noah 0 100 cm era interim 0 100 cm bhoa 0 150 cm lisflood varying from 0 16 cm ataliva ata fig 1 0 75 cm venado tuerto vt to 0 95 cm anguil ang 2 4 satellite estimations the esa sm daily surface soil moisture product version 4 2 accessed on may 2018 liu et al 2011 2012 dorigo et al 2017 is here tested in this study only the passive product estimations are analysed based on the results of grings et al 2015 over the pampas region the authors highlight the sensitivity to vegetation of the active estimations compared to the passive ones furthermore the potential limitations of this product are documented in dorigo et al 2017 and dorigo et al 2012 in the period of interest see table 1 the passive product uses smos 2009 november onwards smap 2015 february onwards and amsr2 2012 july onwards the satellite soil moisture estimation depth varies from 0 to a few centimetres seneviratne et al 2010 3 results 3 1 surface soil moisture the correlation coefficients for each of the 8 sites are reported in table 3 for the surface datasets along the average result for each model these results show that the best performance is obtained for bhoa 0 74 followed by era interim 0 65 esa sm satellite estimations 0 64 and gldas noah 0 58 the average absolute bias is reported in table 3 last row in order to prevent that positive bias in some locations compensates negative bias in other locations the average absolute bias shows the lowest values for the esa sm estimation 13 0 and the highest for era interim 53 1 the rmse average shows that bhoa esa sm and gldas noah have similar values ranging between 32 8 and 35 8 meanwhile the highest rmse is observed for era interim 61 7 the mean non systematic errors unbrmse show similar percentages ranging from 24 9 for gldas noah to 29 3 for the esa sm suggesting similar performance for all the models in term of non systematic errors the bhoa shows the highest correlation values over pergamino per with r 0 89 and gldas noah the lowest correlation over venado tuerto vt r 0 30 in regard to the bias the esa sm shows the lowest absolute value in vt 0 78 and era interim shows the highest underestimation over parana par 113 1 the era interim also shows the highest rmse value in par 113 1 related to the high values of bias and the lowest rmse is shown by gldas noah in per 16 5 the unbrmse shows the highest value for esa sm 46 63 in ata and the lowest for bhoa in per 12 37 since some differences in performance could be due to the incompleteness of the time series as the observational lengths of the records are different we also contrasted the results only for the sites with records longer than 2 years i e ang vt and mb also in this case the lsms and esa sm still show a good performance even if the bhoa shows still the highest correlation 0 76 followed in this case first by esa sm 0 63 and second by era interim 0 61 and last as above by gldas noah 0 47 also the bias and unbrmse metrics averaged for ang mb and vt for the lsms and esa sm stands as described above considering all sites for the rmse the order also stands but with an increment from 23 1 to 35 9 for gldas noah complementing table 3 the spatial distribution of the correlations and relative bias are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively in fig 2 a good agreement r 0 6 is observed for the lsms and esa sm over the buenos aires province i e tan bar and per sites for the rest of the locations all soil moisture products show at least one site with correlation lower than 0 6 the lowest agreement is observed over ang for gldas noah era interim and esa sm where only bhoa estimations tend to represent local conditions satisfactorily unlike the rest of the lsms and the esa sm estimations in fig 3 era interim shows in general a dry bias i e negative values except for anguil ang gldas noah and era interim behave similarly in terms of errors showing the driest bias in par and the wettest in ang meanwhile bhoa and esa sm show the driest bias in tan see also table 3 in particular all products show a wet bias for the surface soil moisture in the ang site and a dry bias over the par site the two longest time series of surface soil moisture are shown in figs 4 mb and 5 vt the bhoa shows a similar but higher dynamical range compared to the in situ measurements in mb fig 4 panel b whereas the gldas noah and era interim show a lower dynamic range in addition both lsms show some peaks in soil moisture likely related to precipitation events that were not observed locally e g july 2015 in era interim these discrepancies can be explained by the difficulties for global and regional forcing to correctly capture some local scale meteorological conditions bhoa often reaches the saturation with values of 45 mm for mb and 40 mm for vt which is not observed in the other lsms above these values the soil moisture surplus is considered as an excess and not retained in the soil i e surface runoff the so called dry down periods i e rate at which soil moisture dries out after a precipitation event are better represented by bhoa compared to gldas noah and era interim in these locations this effect is more evident for several days after july 2013 and prior to july 2014 the esa sm 2012 2016 is able to adequately represent wet and dry events during this period of time fig 6 nevertheless it shows a higher dynamical range over both vt and mb locations similarly to the bhoa dynamics it also shows a higher day to day variability compared to the in situ measurements and to the lsm simulations which is expected given the thin layer observed by passive satellite products i e from millimetres to few centimetres depth 3 2 root zone soil moisture analogously to the results reported for the surface layer the results for root zone are summarized in table 4 overall a decrease in the performance of the lsms for the deeper layer is observed compared to the surface layer although it is worth pointing out that at this soil depth the number of analysed sites is smaller compared to the surface layer see table 3 comparing the two depths surface vs root zone the averaged correlation values show lower values for the root zone bhoa 0 69 gldas noah 0 07 and era interim 0 59 however it is interesting to note that the bhoa shows higher correlation for vt and par and lower for ang compared to the surface layer thus bhoa improves the correlation of the deeper soil moisture variability over vt and par compared to the surface soil moisture the opposite behaviour is observed for gldas noah which shows a considerable deterioration of the soil moisture representation compared to the surface layer as for the surface layer the era interim also shows a good agreement for the deeper layer the lisflood shows on average an intermediate agreement 0 38 being considerable better to gldas noah but inferior to era interim and bhoa the relative bias shows a deterioration of bhoa and gldas noah performance almost doubling the bias values in absolute terms for the root zone compared to the surface soil moisture the era interim shows an improvement of near 12 in the performance of the root zone soil moisture all lsms show a wet i e positive bias for the root zone soil moisture over ang and a dry bias over par a behaviour also observed for the surface layer soil moisture over vt era interim and lisflood show a wet bias and gldas noah and bhoa show a dry bias in particular gldas noah and bhoa show a decrease in the bias for the root zone layer over ang and era interim shows a considerable increase of almost 20 compared to the surface layer the rmse root zone soil moisture shows higher values for gldas noah and bhoa compared to surface layer and the opposite is shown by era interim the unbrmse shows lower values for bhoa and era interim and higher for gldas noah for the root zone soil moisture compared to the surface layer the temporal series of root zone soil moisture for ang par and vt are depicted in fig 7 over ang some soil moistures peaks likely following precipitation events are not captured by the lsms e g before july 2013 and during 2013 2014 austral summer however in general terms the lsms are able to reproduce the observed dry and wet periods it is worth noting that around july 2013 the gldas noah bhoa and lisflood are not able to adequately represent the drying period consistently with the error metrics lisflood and era interim show a considerable difference in the mean value in particular lisflood shows lower short term i e daily variability compared to the other lsms and shows at least three periods with near constant high soil moisture values this may be due to the real time nature of the lisflood model and the absence of any corrections for the meteorological forcing in those periods in the par site all lsms underestimated the mean soil moisture value also a dry period that lasted for several months centred in july 2016 is not well represented by the lsms in general in the vt site a good performance of all lsms is observed in agreement with the performance metrics of table 4 however in particular the gldas noah simulations present a good agreement before 2015 but with a considerable reduction in the performance after this year 3 3 soil moisture anomalies and dry wet event detection in order to analyse the soil moisture anomalies i e subtracting the seasonality of the time series as in eq 1 the correlation between the observed anomalies the lsms and esa sm surface and root zone anomalies were calculated and summarized in table 5 average correlations of surface soil moisture anomalies shown in table 5 are always equal or weaker if compared with the soil moisture correlations table 3 this is observed for bhoa 0 74 vs 0 69 gldas noah 0 58 vs 0 58 era interim 0 65 vs 0 59 and esa sm 0 64 vs 0 53 but over particular sites the correlation show equal or higher values of the surface soil moisture anomalies compared to the soil moisture series for bhoa over vt and ang gldas noah over tan vt par and mb era interim over mb and for esa sm over bar for the root zone layer the soil moisture anomalies show on average except for era interim higher correlation values compared to the soil moisture correlations bhoa 0 69 vs 0 71 gldas noah 0 26 vs 0 48 era interim 0 59 vs 0 50 and lisflood 0 40 vs 0 48 the improvement of the gldas noah correlation is remarkable this improvement could be related with a poor representation of the soil moisture seasonality in particular years in other words gldas noah shows a better agreement in representing the short term variability than the variability with the seasonal effect included in general the soil moisture anomalies show higher correlation values for the surface layer compared to the root zone layer except for bhoa over the par and vt sites a similar behaviour was observed over par and vt when comparing surface soil moisture against root zone soil moisture for bhoa in section 3 2 the plots in figs 8 and 9 show the density functions of the standardized surface soil moisture and the anomalies for the locations of mb and vt and of the root zone soil moisture and the root zone anomalies for the locations of ang par and vt respectively as shown by mo 2008 over different regions of the united states soil moisture distributions can differ from a gaussian normal shape only in the vt site the soil moisture in situ measurements fig 8c exhibit a type of gaussian distribution meanwhile the other locations show a bimodal shape it is interesting to note that there is a change in the distribution shape from the surface normal like to the deeper layer bimodal the soil moisture anomalies show in general a normal distribution shape except for the root zone soil moisture in ang fig 9d analysing the lsms in some cases they show a different type of distribution compared to the in situ measurements as in case of gldas noah surface soil moisture in mb fig 8a gldas noah and lisflood root zone soil moisture in par fig 9e and gldas noah root zone soil moisture in vt fig 9a in ang all lsms show for the root zone soil moisture a similar bimodal shape fig 9c except of era interim which presents a bimodal distribution but positively skewed with a longer right tail the esa sm shows a similar distribution shape for the vt surface soil moisture but for mb a more symmetric distribution shape instead of an observed bimodal distribution not shown in spite of the fact that soil moisture anomalies show a better agreement between the observed and simulated distributions the kolmogorov smirnov test for 2 samples was applied in order to quantify the differences the null hypothesis of this test i e that both samples are drawn from the same distribution was rejected in most cases with p 0 01 meaning that the lsm and the esa sm are not able to accurately reproduce the observed soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies distributions the null hypothesis was not rejected for the surface soil moisture anomalies of bhoa over vt and for era interim the soil moisture anomalies over mb surface and vt root zone and over par for the root zone soil moisture the lsms ability in representing wet and dry events by means of the root zone soil moisture anomalies is shown in fig 10 overall the lsms show similar values for detecting dry and wet events with slightly higher performance for detecting dry events except for era interim in vt the lsms show for the dry events lower errors over vt compared to ang and par for both dry and wet events bhoa shows the best performance in detecting extreme values with hit rate values above 63 in all sites showing the highest values over par and vt with a hit rate of 76 for dry events comparing the detection of dry and wet events in par the percentage of dry events is higher in contrast to the wet events for all lsms this behaviour is also observed in the location of vt for bhoa gldas noah and lisflood but the opposite behaviour is shown by era interim for the ang site all lsms show equal or higher hit rate percentage of dry events compared to wet events for the dry events the errors averaged over all sites show similar values between all lsms in particular bhoa shows the lowest false alarm value 9 and lisflood the highest 15 closely followed by era interim with 14 the highest false alarm percentage for dry events is observed in ang 16 and par 16 by lisflood and era interim respectively averaging all lsms over all three sites the ability for detecting dry events is of 62 and 58 for wet events and the errors are 13 and 12 respectively 4 discussion the bhoa shows the overall best performance agreement for both surface and root zone which can be attributed to the fact that this simple bucket model compared to the other lsms uses observed local precipitation radiation and soil properties data this is not the case for the other lsms where global forcing may not be able to always capture the actual dynamic of local meteorological data as an example while the overall correlation for gldas noah surface soil moisture over the vt site is equal to 0 30 if the periods june 2012 april 2015 and may 2015 december 2017 are analysed separately the correlation values are r 0 60 and r 0 37 respectively these different results can be explained by some precipitation events and consequent soil moisture peaks shown by the lsm time series that were not observed in the ground record these results are in line with several studies e g kato et al 2007 documenting that the key aspects of the lsms performance rely on the quality of the forcing data used e g precipitation the soil properties e g soil texture and on the soil physics parameterizations of the different lsms previous studies documented that 5 cm and 50 cm soil moisture measurements can be considered to be representative of the 0 10 cm and 0 100 cm depth soil moisture e g albergel et al 2012 but it must be kept in mind that among the lsms the surface layer root zone varies from 0 7 cm 0 45 cm to 0 15 cm 0 150 cm which also not exactly matches with the observed measurements therefore the difference in soil depth between measurements lsms and esa sm as well as the different spatial resolution could be another potential source of discrepancy between the outcomes of the various datasets also the different soil moisture temporal averages of the lsms e g bhoa 12 12 utc and era interim 00 00 utc could be a further source of discrepancy introducing systematic differences related to the representation of the precipitation diurnal cycle this could be more evident for the fast responding surface soil moisture whereas it may be less relevant for the root zone soil moisture due to the relative slower dynamics compared to surface soil moisture our study shows results that are consistent with the ones reported in grings et al 2015 in regard to the dynamic range of the surface soil moisture over the mb site the authors observed that smos estimations show a greater dynamic range and gldas noah shows a systematic underestimation compared to the observed soil moisture for 2012 2014 however they mention that gldas noah shows higher correlations than smos used in the esa sm product passive estimations in this study where a longer record was analysed the esa sm satellite estimations show higher correlation than gldas noah over mb a difference possible related to the forcing uncertainties in the model as mentioned above it is important to further stress that mb is the only site were the soil moisture values are representative of an area comparable to the lsms satellite spatial grid scale in general it seems that the dynamic range of the observed surface soil moisture is overestimated by bhoa and esa sm and underestimated by gldas noah and era interim over both mb and vt sites the most adequate representation is given by bhoa which could be related to the use of more accurate soil hydraulic parameters e g field capacity and wilting point these parameters seem to be critical to the other lsms showing important differences in the soil moisture dynamic range which led to a strong bias in particular in albergel et al 2012 the tessel lsm used in era interim is compared against a new version of the lsm the h tessel one of the main improvements of h tessel is related to the utilization of a global texture data because the tessel only uses a specific value of soil texture an obvious consequence of using a constant value of soil texture is an inadequate representation of the soil moisture dynamic range in this study the era interim tessel also had problems to adequately reproduce this feature showing the highest bias values among the different lsms besides this era interim showed good results albergel et al 2012 also showed that era interim tends to overestimate the soil moisture values over dry regions in this study all lsms except bhoa showed an overestimation of the soil moisture values over ang which is the driest site considered with an annual precipitation of 632 2 mm year however in our study there is not a clear impact of the soil moisture overestimation on the correlations as documented by albergel et al 2012 over the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma network in west africa in the amma network a large overestimation of era interim soil moisture led to a smaller variability and consequently to poor correlation in general the bias errors can be corrected calibrated i e bias correction but this type of correction has no effect when the overestimation reaches values near the field capacity or higher as was the case of the amma network in the case of gldas noah considerable error amplification from the surface soil moisture to the root zone soil moisture was observed based on this study it is not possible to determine if the source of error is mainly related to the data forcing or also enhanced by the soil parameter uncertainties and or physical parameterizations of the model the other lsms also show on average lower correlations for the root zone compared to the surface soil moisture however bhoa shows higher correlation over two i e vt and par of the three sites and era interim shows the same correlation value over one site i e ang a similar behaviour is documented by albergel et al 2012 over particular soil moisture networks with lower correlation values for the root zone compared with surface soil moisture but the authors observed that on average the root zone shows higher correlation values the lsms and the esa sm have difficulties in reproducing the point scale soil moisture i e surface and root zone frequency distributions nevertheless the shape of the distributions of soil moisture anomalies showed more resemblance with the in situ measurements than the soil moisture series additionally over particular sites some of the lsms i e bhoa and gldas noah showed an improvement in the correlation values of the root zone soil moisture anomalies i e short term variability compared to the soil moisture time series the latter results related to the root zone anomalies were reflected in the good degree of confidence shown by all lsms in the ability of detecting anomaly dry and wet events in particular the wet events showed higher errors which can be presumably attributed to for example underestimation of local intense precipitation events or missing of some local events 5 conclusions the lsms and the esa sm satellite soil moisture estimations showed to be able to represent the main characteristics of the local soil moisture variability in general soil moisture products based on lsms focus on anomalies in order to detect excess or deficit soil moisture conditions but this is not the case with bhoa which was designed to represent the water content available for crops in this sense it is encouraging for the different products as bhoa is able to better represent the soil moisture dynamic range and variability compared to the other lsms and gldas noah era interim and lisflood are able to adequately represent the soil moisture anomalies over the pampas region in addition to the lsm results also the esa sm anomalies proved to be valuable nevertheless the reliability of the results obtained in this study could be sensitive to different factors such as differences in soil depth between datasets differences between point scale measurements and area average estimates i e lsm spatial grid as well as differences in lsm and satellite spatial resolutions and temporal averages accurate forcing data and soil parameters are critical to substantially improve the ability to detect dry and wet events in fact even with lsms forced with local observations the percentage of false alarms is not negligible i e about 9 for dry events thus suggesting to further investigate the conditions under which the lsms are most likely to reproduce or miss the deficit conditions in order to recommend improvements on model parameterization that may still be needed even for local models a further evaluation will focus on the impact of these differences among the lsms in representing dry events in the framework of a combined drought index specifically designed for this region
