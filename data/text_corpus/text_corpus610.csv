3050,qualitative and quantitative understandings of the origin transport and fate of organic carbon oc in forest systems is needed to advance our understanding of biogeochemical cycling as well as catchment management and forest harvesting here we present the findings from eight steep slope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams size range 15 100 ha in south eastern australia where bedload organic carbon in bedload hillslope soil carbon together with dissolved organic carbon has been measured over multiple years oc in the bedload was found to be significantly related to catchment area p 0 02 dissolved organic carbon export in stream water declined with catchment area combined bedload organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon export was significantly related to catchment area there was no significant difference between hillslope soil organic carbon and bedload organic carbon concentration when corrected for area oc export by bedload was not significantly different to that of dissolved oc export using the environmental tracer 137cs it was found that there was no significant difference in tracer concentration between bedload and hillslope soil this suggests a direct link between hillslope and channel and delivery of organic carbon to the channel of the eight catchments examined here six had been harvested for timber in previous decades with area of forest removed ranging from 25 to 60 while two catchments had minimal disturbance control catchments no harvest there was no difference in organic carbon export from the harvested and control catchments the results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term keywords sediment transport forest harvesting organic carbon dissolved organic carbon bedload hillslope and channel connectivity 1 introduction understanding water quality and sediment transport for small forested headwater catchments is a well studied topic due to the importance of these areas for forestry water supply and ecosystem services hopmans et al 1993 liu and sheu 2003 lal 2005 smith et al 2012 burrows et al 2014 lee and lajtha 2016 hancock et al 2017a hancock et al 2017b much work has focussed on soil chemistry and soil organic carbon hopmans et al 1993 liu and sheu 2003 fröberg et al 2011 smith et al 2012 bantle et al 2014 as well as over and under story vegetation soil and water and snowpack water quality brooks et al 1999 liu and sheu 2003 pelster et al 2009 while a significant body of work has been undertaken at the hillslope and single catchment scale much less work has been done to investigate how catchments with similar management and vegetation influence organic carbon oc export that is is organic carbon export related to catchment area relief slope or management practice oc here is defined as carbonaceous material sourced from living or dead matter where as inorganic c originating from minerals hewlett 1969 it has been proposed that dissolved oc may be a small part of the carbon budget for forest soils brooks et al 1999 fröberg et al 2011 lee and lajtha 2016 with the dissolved oc flux two orders of magnitude or less compared to total gross ecosystem fluxes gielen et al 2011 kleja et al 2016 it is reported that soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high soil oc content lal 2005 dissolved oc leaching from temperate forests is important as dissolved oc is transported from the soil surface down the soil profile where it may be stabilised and or modified by biogeochemical processes kalbitz et al 2000 kalbitz and kaiser 2008 bantle et al 2014 the processing of terrestrially derived oc by organisms is important in forested headwater streams where it supports aquatic food webs wipfli et al 2007 quantifying and understanding oc processing in forested headwater streams can provide insights into the local fluvial geomorphology and oc linkages wipfli et al 2007 oc in headwater streams is primarily derived from the upper organic soil horizon in most temperate catchments of which a significant component is in dissolved form schiff et al 1990 brooks et al 1999 oc is a critical component of the global carbon cycle linking the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through in stream microbial metabolism of terrestrial oc battin et al 2008 yet little is known about the contributions of small headwater streams raymond and saiers 2010 raymond et al 2013 therefore better understanding of the hydrologic pathways transporting oc from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems in headwater watersheds is needed brooks et al 1999 lee and lajtha 2016 it is known that oc transport from small watersheds increases with storm and snowmelt raymond and saiers 2010 and composition changes under different rainfall and runoff i e storm events forest harvesting can produce changes to the stream environment with implications for oc processing burrows et al 2014 burrows et al 2014 suggest that information on the impact of forest harvesting on rates of oc in forested streams is conflicting both between sites and also within the sample local area gooderham et al 2007 this is postulated to be a result of spatial and temporal heterogeneity that may exist due to differences in geology local storms and vegetation gooderham et al 2007 with this heterogeneity it is difficult to separate the major controls paired catchment studies offer some insights into the heterogeneity of these systems moore and jackson 1989 burrows et al 2014 although sediment yields and rainfall in australia are not as high as other regions of the world such as parts of asia e g xinbao et al 1990 jia et al 2012 li et al 2015 an understanding of the influences and controls on sediment transport and oc export is lacking for many natural systems hopmans et al 1993 evans 2000 burrows et al 2014 vanmaercke et al 2015 in terms of landscape use and management forested catchments represent a vital component of the timber resource and supply of high quality water barten and ernst 2004 webb 2012 burrows et al 2014 a dense coverage of vegetation often associated with undisturbed forested catchments provides both slope stability and erosional control at the land surface marden 2012 however this is somewhat counteracted as forested catchments are typically located in regions of elevated precipitation thus potentially increasing the sediment flux to streams brooks et al 2012 smith et al 2012 additionally the efficacy of vegetation coverage can often be negated by land disturbances such as logging and agricultural uses and has been documented in numerous studies throughout the world e g cornish 1993 2001 cornish 2001 bren and mcguire 2007 montgomery 2007 2012 bren et al 2010 bui et al 2011 webb et al 2012a webb et al 2012b smith et al 2012 webb and jarrett 2013 burrows et al 2014 chen et al 2015 quantifying the impact of human induced landscape change is difficult as it requires knowledge of both the pristine sediment yield i e the natural undisturbed rate of erosion and the actual yield evans 2000 vanmaercke et al 2015 paired catchments are often used to obtain information on water yield and or water quality characteristics of forestland management brooks et al 1999 bren and mcguire 2007 2012 smith et al 2012 these paired catchment studies are primarily established to assess changes in water flow and quality in response to changes in vegetation coverage by monitoring rainfall streamflow and other factors relevant to stream water dynamics bren and mcguire 2007 such a study site presents the opportunity to explore the scale of sediment transport and oc which contributes to the degradation of stream water quality hancock et al 2017a hancock et al 2017b forested catchments particularly in the eastern regions of new south wales provide a significant proportion of high quality water to the surrounding area hopmans et al 1993 webb 2012 logging operations and associated infrastructure construction such as roads skid trails and log landings can potentially result in a significant increase of surface sediment transport and can increase erosion rates to greater than 15 t ha year brooks et al 2012 although erosion in forests is suggested to be minimal with open forest typically 1 t ha 1 yr 1 increasing to 5 t ha 1 yr 1 in woodlands managed lands charman and murphy 2007 activities that disturb the land surface e g logging clearing land can expose bare soil and result in increased erosion rates and accompanying carbon transport brooks et al 2012 montgomery 2012 there is a need for data examining oc quantity and export from catchments lee and lajtha 2016 in particular there is a need for data on the major controls on oc export here we build on previous work where hancock et al 2017a examined sediment loads and hancock et al 2017b modelled these loads using a computer based landscape evolution model siberia in the forested catchments described below this work reports on oc export from eight relatively small steep slope forested catchments 15 100 ha in south eastern australia of these eight catchments six have been harvested and two were not harvested controls here oc at both the hillslope and catchment scale 1 will be examined by quantifying dissolved stream water hillslope soil as well as stream bed load oc 2 linkages between hillslope and channel investigated using the environmental tracer 137cs 3 catchment scale oc export quantified and 4 management implications discussed for both harvested and non harvested catchments together with study limitations and future work 2 site description the study area lies approximately 85 km north of newcastle new south wales australia fig 1 the site within the chichester state forest is a series of eight small 13 97 ha catchments located in the headwaters of the telegherry river a tributary of the karuah river a site referred to as the karuah hydrology research area khra cornish 1993 the experimental catchments were established in 1974 75 primarily as an investigative tool to examine the effects of logging on streamflow and water quality with each catchment located on the eastern slope of a south running ridgeline extending into the barrington tops to the north webb et al 2012b the site is located within the southern extent of the new england fold belt peou 1977 the area consists of a carboniferous sequence of sedimentary rocks belonging to the ararat formation and is primarily composed of sandstone mudstones siliceous siltstones and limestone lenses the western higher elevation section of the study area is predominantly lutite mudstone which transitions downslope eastward to predominantly arenite sandstone and mixed compositions towards the bank of the telegherry river strongly weathered sedimentary strata span much of the site and thick soil coverage is widespread peou 1977 soils are euchrozems brown and yellow podzols and xanthozems they are highly structured and friable with most containing significant organic matter and in general are regarded as deep elliott 1977 there is also little evidence of destructive fire events in the study area law and chidel 2002 the study area has a moist warm temperate climate cornish 1993 with mean annual rainfall between 1450 and 1750 mm depending on elevation from 1993 to 2020 average annual rainfall was 1659 and 1477 for raingauges 1 and 4 respectively fig 1 there is typically a seasonal maximum during summer november february months and a seasonal minimum in the winter june august months maximum temperature varies with elevation where in summer temperatures average 28 c at 450 m and 24 c at 940 m and in winter minimum temperatures throughout the area drop to an average of 3 c elevations across the study site range from approximately 950 m a s l to 450 m a s l generally descending eastwards towards the banks of the telegherry river catchment relief is variable ranging between 245 m and 407 m table 1 of the eight catchments comprising the khra six were subjected to various levels of harvesting and clearing whilst two were left undisturbed table 1 cornish 1993 2001 prior to logging activities occurring in 1983 the area was dominated by tall wet sclerophyll forest greater than 35 m tree height predominantly eucalypt comprising sydney blue gum eucalyptus saligna 43 of the experimental area silvertop stringybark e laevopinea 23 some new england blackbutt e andrewsii and rainforest 32 squire 1979 following logging activities in 1997 tree regrowth occurred at an increased stocking 3500 6100 stems per hectare in the regrowth catchments compared to the undisturbed catchments average of 744 stems per hectare cornish and vertessy 2001 law and chidel 2002 but by 2011 across all treated catchments there was a substantial reduction in total stocking rates to 1200 stems ha 1 webb et al 2012b canopy cover is quite high varying from 90 to 55 with an average coverage of 72 cornish and vertessy 2001 law and chidel 2002 3 methods oc is transported via bedload suspended load as well as in dissolved form in stream water hillslope soil also contains considerable organic carbon below we describe the field data laboratory methods as well as hydrological and topographic data we also use an environmental tracer 137cs to better understand hillslope and stream connectivity 3 1 bedload organic carbon bedload sediment transport and its organic matter content is challenging to measure einstein 1950 milliman and meade 1983 milliman and syvitski 1992 turowski et al 2010 beylich and laute 2014 here to quantify bedload each weir was emptied of water by removing a drain plug at the weir base allowing much easier removal of material the material behind each weir was manually removed by shovel and bucket each bucket 12 l in volume was carefully filled and the number of buckets counted as removal progressed deposited sediment was completely removed to the bedrock base leaving a clean and sediment free weir at each sampling occasion the material removed from each weir was relocated downslope of the respective weir volume of material was converted to units of mass using the bulk density of the stream sediment to obtain a representative sample a 20 l bucket of bedload from each weir was transported to the university of newcastle soil lab and air dried in an oven at 40 c for approximately 14 days bulk density was determined following the standard test method for bulk density of a soil core smith and atkinson 1975 cresswell and hamilton 2002 given the semi frequent as required exhumation and logistical challenge in measuring all bedload at all sites at the same time bedload is reported here in units of t yr 1 bedload oc was determined from the sample collected from the exhumed weir material described above dried bedload was passed through a 2 mm sieve a subsample of the 2 mm fraction was split from the main sample and analysed for oc using the leco dry combustion method https www leco com 3 2 soil organic carbon it was considered important to place the bedload oc in the context of hillslope soil oc at least two cores were collected from each hillslope adjacent to and upslope from each weir soil was collected using steel cores of 95 mm internal diameter and length 210 mm a cap constructed of steel was placed on the core and a hammer used to force the core until flush with the soil surface it was considered that the 210 mm sample core depth was sufficiently deep to capture a representative soil oc sample hancock et al 2019 the soil samples were placed in a labelled bag and transported to the university of newcastle samples were dried in a 40 c oven for at least one week samples were disaggregated using a mortar and pestle and the 2 mm and 2 mm size fractions separated by sieving the fine soil fraction was further disaggregated and both fractions weighed soil organic carbon was determined using the leco method 3 3 dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediment analysis dissolved oc was determined from 1l grab samples of water collected from each weir from january 2019 to february 2021 at approximately 6 8 week intervals the samples were refrigerated upon collection dissolved oc analysis was conducted at the nsw department of primary industries biosecurity laboratory operations environmental laboratory wollongbar using a shimadzu analyser employing the persulfate oxidation method see apha 1998 method 5310c a further 2l grab sample was collected at the same time for suspended sediment measurement the turbidity of the water sample was visually assessed and quantified by a greenspan turbidity probe for mass quantification of suspended sediment a 1l of this sample was passed through pre weighed filter paper with the filter paper then dried at 105c and weighed 3 4 catchment data topographic data consisted of a light detection and ranging lidar data set commissioned by the forestry commission of nsw and supplied by rps australia east pty ltd the data were collected in 2011 the data at 1 m grid resolution had an average point density of 2 points per m2 with a horizontal and vertical accuracy of 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively catchment area relief and average slope were determined from this high resolution dem data using arcgis software 3 5 hydrological data measurement a sharp crested v notch weir was installed on and concreted to bedrock at the outlet of each catchment allowing for the commencement of stage recording within stilling wells from 1975 figs 1 and 2 readings from optical shaft encoders are recorded on dataloggers at 6 min intervals rating curves to convert stage to discharge were established and refined over the years using a variety of methods as described in further detail by cornish 1993 all hydrological data have been recorded quality coded and edited where appropriate using hydstra time series data management software 3 6 environmental tracers understanding hillslope channel connectivity is important here the environmental tracer 137cs is employed to determine the sediment source the 137cs technique is a widely used and effective method for studying medium term i e 40 50 years soil erosion rates zapata et al 2002 137cs is an artificial radio isotope that is rapidly and strongly adsorbed to fine soil particles upon reaching the earth s surface thus making it an ideal soil tracer to qualitatively and quantitatively assess soil redistribution rates 137cs is an anthropogenic radionuclide half life approximately 30 years present as a consequence of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing that occurred during the 1950 s and 60 s loughran 1994 a key characteristic of 137cs is its tendency to adsorb to clays in surface soil horizons as well as exhibiting a high resistance to leaching such characteristics offer a feasible method of tracing and quantifying sediment transport studies globally have successfully applied the 137cs technique in a variety of landscapes e g loughran 1994 loughran and elliott 1996 martinez et al 2010 hancock et al 2015 here the goal was to assess similarities and or differences in 137cs concentration in bedload and hillslope soil for example if 137cs is present in hillslope soil and not in bedload then there is no connection between hillslope and channel or all labelled sediment is exiting the catchment if there is 137cs in the soil as well as in the bedload then it can be inferred that there is connection between hillslope and channel for bedload and hillslope soil assessment of 137cs the samples described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 were used in addition to the surface samples additional cores were collected vertically down the streambank to a depth of 1 m using the cores 5 samples in the sassafras and kokata catchments the aim of collecting these samples was to assess whether 137cs was present at depths greater than the 210 mm of the surface samples these samples were processes as described in section 3 2 the fines fraction 2mm was used for analysis of 137cs concentration a sample of mass of 1000 g was placed in a marinelli beaker on a hyperpure germanium detector sample count times were at least 24 h with counting errors in the order of 10 or less achieved one standard deviation the concentration of 137cs in the samples was calculated using the equation outlined by loughran 1994 and converted to areal activity loughran et al 2002 4 results since forest harvesting there has been no major disturbance in the catchments over this study period only monitoring activities occurred rainfall over this period was 1647 and 1453 mm yr 1 for raingauge 1 and 4 respectively fig 1 these values were close to the long term average 1659 and 1477 mm yr 1 for raingauge 1 and 4 respectively 4 1 bedload organic carbon bedload was manually removed from the weirs on an approximately annual basis with first data for all eight weirs obtained in may 2015 given the labour requirements and site access issues due to weather data collection for all sites took over several months to complete for all sites all bedload was removed over period of a day or less given the volume of material at all times the bedload was removed before material had deposited and filled the volume behind the weir with some freeboard available in most cases at least 150 mm below the top edge of the weir in no cases had the bedload deposited to the top edge of the weir however it is impossible to determine how much bedload had exited each weir in times of high flow bedload output ranges from 1 40 tyr 1 to 6 02 t yr 1 table 2 the results demonstrate that bedload increases with increasing catchment area fig 3 a however this relationship was not significant at the 0 05 level p 0 055 bedload t yr 1 had no relationship with slope or upslope contributing area slope and area derived from the dem of each catchment there was no relationship with bedload transport and percent area harvested catchment discharge was significantly related to catchment area r 0 98 p 0 001 and scaled linearly fig 3b bedload oc ranged from 2 9 to 6 6 average 5 44 σ 1 20 σ represents standard deviation table 2 bedload oc demonstrated no relationship with relief slope catchment area or bedload transport t yr 1 there was no relationship between bedload oc and amount of area disturbed by forest harvesting amount of oc transported within the bedload was calculated by multiplying the amount of bed load tonnes yr by the oc concentration table 2 a significant relationship was found between catchment area and oc transported in the bedload r 0 81 p 0 02 fig 4 4 2 soil organic carbon hillslope soil oc within each catchment ranged from 3 6 kokata to 9 9 crabapple with an average for all catchments of 5 64 σ 3 54 table 3 this soil oc range can be categorised as moderate to very high hazelton and murphy 2007 there was no relationship between soil oc and bedload oc or soil oc and dissolved oc there was no relationship between soil oc and any topographic attribute however interestingly there was no significant difference between average bedload oc and average soil oc for the 8 catchments suggesting a link between hillslope soil oc and channel or bedload oc converting soil oc to stocks t ha 1 produced a range of values with sassafras catchment 81 t ha 1 the lowest and barratta catchment 127 t ha 1 the highest there was no relationship with soil oc stock and any catchment variable 4 3 dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediment we report all data here as average dissolved oc from the period of february 2019 to december 2021 samples were collected at approximately 3 month intervals due to weather and accessibility streams draining forested catchments with well drained soils have been reported to have low concentrations of dissolved oc in the range 1 12 mg l moore and jackson 1989 all samples collected were at the lower end of this range average dissolved oc ranged from 1 09 mg l kokata to 2 10 mg l bollygum table 4 dissolved oc concentration displayed no relationship with relief slope catchment area the previous derived from the dem or bedload transport there was no relationship between dissolved oc and amount of area disturbed by forest harvesting a declining and non significant relationship at the 0 05 level was observed between dissolved oc and area r 0 66 p 0 07 fig 5 a the amount of dissolved oc tonnes exported annually from the catchments was determined by multiplying average flow fig 3b at each weir by the average dissolved oc concentration a significant relationship was found between catchment area and dissolved oc exported r 0 90 p 0 003 fig 5b however we recognise that this result is governed by the relationship with area and discharge i e fig 3b when corrected for area dissolved oc ranged from 0 005 t ha 1 yr 1 kokata to 0 011 mg l bollygum table 4 for all catchments and samples the water was very clear with no observable turbity ntu for all samples was 10 suggesting very little suspended sediment mass of sediment quantified from filtering produced negligible suspended sediment with no measurable mass change in filter paper 4 4 environmental tracers and hillslope and channel connectivity inspection of the creek bed and banks upstream of the weirs found that the bed and banks are largely stable with little erosion or bank instability the hillslope also has a dense tree canopy as well as a dense leaf litter cover the hillslopes do not exhibit any evidence of rill or gully erosion all hillslope and bedload samples had detectable levels of 137cs table 5 there was no significant difference between hillslope soil and bedload 137cs concentration there was no detectable 137cs in the streambank samples other than from the surface that is there was no detectable 137cs at depths greater than 210 mm this suggests that material entering the creeks is mostly from the hillslope via sheetwash processes 5 discussion 5 1 bedload hillslope and stream organic carbon the karuah study site has a well developed forest with considerable organic matter on the soil surface consisting of both leaf litter and coarse wood there has been no disturbance of the forest since the last harvest in 1983 other issues such as fire effects predate forest harvesting other than that of controlled burns at some of the harvest sites this study was conducted over a period of rainfall that was similar to the longer term rainfall average therefore the results provided here are for a site with consistent management over the study time frame and likely representative climatically brooks et al 1999 suggest a conceptual model describing the delivery of dissolved oc to a stream which consists of three processes 1 partial decomposition of terrestrially organic carbon producing dissolved oc 2 hydrologic transport of dissolved oc from the terrestrial environment to surface water and 3 modification of both quantity and composition of dissolved oc during transport complicating this are multiple and non independent effects of climate and geological variability when oc exported in bedload scaled for area from the 8 catchments 0 0057 t ha 1 yr 1 is compared to the average amount of dissolved oc exported 0 0064 t ha 1 yr 1 scaled for area they are in the same proportions and not significantly different each catchment produced similar amounts of bedload oc and dissolved oc annually tables 2 and 3 combining both bedload oc and dissolved oc produces a significant relationship with area r 0 91 p 0005 fig 6 this relationship suggests a capacity for the prediction of oc export in this environment soil in the catchment had a large organic carbon store with between 81 and 127 t ha 1 table 3 total oc export can be calculated by combining bedload oc with dissolved oc fig 6 demonstrates a significant relationship with catchment area with total oc export ranging from approximately 0 1 to 0 7 t yr 1 this suggests that for this amount of soil oc the catchments are exporting approximately 1 of the soil oc pool per annum this calculation does not include above ground biomass which may be directly contributing to bedload oc and stream water dissolved oc when expressed on an areal basis dissolved oc is significantly related to catchment area r 0 89 p 0 02 fig 5b that is larger catchments export more dissolved oc an unsurprising result however while not significant average dissolved oc mg l 1 concentration reduces with catchment area fig 5a this suggests a scaling relationship with several possible reasons there is increased soil oc storage within the catchment as the catchment size increases this is similar to the sediment delivery sdr concept where sediment storage increases as catchment size increases walling 1983 another point to note is that hydrological travel times with larger catchments will be longer with flow concentration timing also influenced longer term data may better resolve this issue however the significant influence on sediment transport and oc was catchment area that is larger catchments produce more sediment which contains more oc a non surprising result as bigger catchments produce more runoff there was no correlation of oc with any other topographic characteristic examined including elevation relief slope or percentage area disturbed in 1983 lal 2005 states that soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high soc content this is the case here for a steep slope relatively high rainfall environment soc in the catchments is high but with high variability hazelton and murphy 2007 average 5 64 σ 3 54 table 3 however interestingly there is no significant difference between the hillslope soil oc and that of the bedload oc this suggests that the hillslope surface is a potential source of both inorganic material soil and rock as well as organic material the release of dissolved organic carbon dissolved oc from decomposing coarse woody debris on the hillslope may result in large dissolved oc inputs to the forest soil bantle et al 2014 found that dissolved oc release from coarse woody debris is tree species specific in terms of quantity and quality and causes large dissolved oc fluxes to the soil particularly under coarse woody debris this oc is likely to translocate downslope into the drainage lines given the mixed species composition of the karuah catchment forests quantifying point scale dissolved oc flux would be difficult across all catchments erosionally the creek bed and banks demonstrated little erosion or bank instability this coupled with the density of trees as well as leaf litter provided additional erosion protection further there was an absence of rill or gully erosion therefore the findings here suggest that material entering the creeks is mostly from the hillslope via sheetwash processes this is supported by the use of environmental tracer 137cs sediment tracing using 137cs suggests that there is a direct connection between hillslope and channel further and more detailed tracer assessments using complementary tracers such as 210pbex would help elucidate both source and rates of transfer 5 2 management implications many studies have shown that land disturbance e g deforestation and agricultural activities can have significant implications at the catchment scale e g walling 1999 erskine et al 2002 walling 2006 montgomery 2007 vanacker et al 2007 marden 2012 smith et al 2012 marden et al 2014 vanacker et al 2014 the accurate quantification of the impact of land disturbance on sediment and nutrient loss is greatly relevant to the development and advancement of management practices to reduce sediment input to river systems and nutrient export hopmans et al 1993 evans 2000 vanmaercke et al 2015 forested landscapes are a particular concern as surface vegetation cover represents a significant resistor to increases of sediment flux and source of nutrients hopmans et al 1993 vanacker et al 2007 smith et al 2012 many studies in nsw e g cornish 1993 2001 webb et al 2012a and globally e g milliman and syvitski 1992 moore and jackson 1989 lenzi and marchi 2000 jia et al 2012 hinderer et al 2013 chen et al 2015 lazzari et al 2015 conclude that disturbance events decrease stream water quality or an increase in sediment yield at least in the short term the results here represent a series of catchments that have had approximately 35 years of recovery time since tree harvesting similar to moore and jackson 1989 we find that disturbance had a minor if any effect on oc export fig 7 while there could be a trend interpreted suggesting that more disturbance produces more carbon export if all data is used non significant correlation r 0 63 p 0 095 using all data the finding that the catchments with no area disturbed produce total organic carbon export similar to that of the majority of the other catchments suggests an alternate interpretation further if the largest value of 0 68 t yr 1 for the kokata catchment is removed there is no discernible trend therefore sediment loads including oc export can return to pre disturbance yields or even lower as new plantation and or regrowth begins to take hold with a greater stocking and sapwood area than the former mature forest cornish 1993 hancock 2017a this provides confidence in the long term management approach from this forest harvesting system ongoing monitoring which the authors plan to continue will highlight longer term trends data collection after harvesting currently not planned at this site would provide data immediately after disturbance 5 3 study limitations and future work a major strength of this study is that there are 8 catchments of different sizes with high quality runoff and topographic data available such a setup is unique globally however instrumenting and continuously monitoring for other water quality parameters such as bedload sediment load dissolved oc as well as water chemistry while possible is costly ideally automated water samples are needed to collect samples during storm events this would provide fundamental insights across a range of spatial and temporal scales the approach employed here with multiple grab samples provides an important first assessment there are several data limitations bedload was quantified by carefully filling and counting the number of buckets over a range of periods over a range of time periods although observation at each weir determined that sediment build up was not excessive there are still concerns regarding loss or spill over of sediment during large storm events gabrielli et al 2012 mcbroom et al 2012 and van daal rombouts et al 2016 there was a strong yet non significant relationship with catchment area and bedload at the 0 05 significance level with a value of 0 055 found here longer term data may strengthen this result or improved measurement of bedload may better refine this finding at all times when bedload was quantified there was storage capacity in each weir with the material never at the same level as the top of the wier we recognise in this study and many others listed above that it is extremely difficult with the available data and monitoring methods to quantify the amount of spill over that may or may not have occurred to quantify any loss would require sampling at times of high flow grab samples would provide some indication of spillover however being on site in times of high flow in this remote location would not be possible based on safety issues a collection trap could installed on the downside of the weir however construction of a trap while possible would be costly and difficult given the site conditions an additional collection device would also bring to play all the issues of accurate and reliable sediment collection with similar data reliability concerns it is also recognised that any error in bedload measurement will follow on to the calculation of both total sediment and oc loads overall the measurement of bedload is a diabolical problem there are always questions surrounding the length of data collection and in particular the role of large events sediment delivery is non linear and can be delivered as pulses or slugs leopold et al 1964 knighton 1998 willgoose 2018 we were only able to collect water samples in suitable weather due to access issues and remoteness of the site further data collection where both bedload suspended sediment and dissolved oc together with water chemistry are measured simultaneously would provide insights hopmans et al 1993 the role of large and or extreme events is an issue that cannot be examined here and is an issue that is recognised as being of high importance to understand oc dynamics we quantified both dissolved oc and oc from bedload samples collected over approximately the same period one issue that we cannot comment on is that of oc turnover i e biogeochemical cycling within the stream system and in particular the bedload repeated sampling of bedload would provide some insight into the variability of oc in the stream system however this is extremely labour intensive and difficult to envisage how this could be regularly managed 6 conclusions this study has quantified oc transport by bedload and stream discharge in eight steep average slope range for each catchment of 19 25 forested catchments with six subject to forest harvesting and 2 controls we believe that this is the first time that catchment scale erosion and oc data have been reported for both undisturbed and harvested sites in eastern australia our findings demonstrate a bedload output increases linearly with catchment area b oc in bedload and dissolved oc significantly increases with catchment area c no correlation between area harvested and catchment oc export 35 years after harvesting d oc export from harvested areas is no different to that of unharvested control catchments this demonstrates that the forest management practices employed here have had little long term detrimental effects in reference to bedload erosion and oc transport rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments bedload measurement was most ably supported by glen charlton students nicholas dunstan

3050,qualitative and quantitative understandings of the origin transport and fate of organic carbon oc in forest systems is needed to advance our understanding of biogeochemical cycling as well as catchment management and forest harvesting here we present the findings from eight steep slope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams size range 15 100 ha in south eastern australia where bedload organic carbon in bedload hillslope soil carbon together with dissolved organic carbon has been measured over multiple years oc in the bedload was found to be significantly related to catchment area p 0 02 dissolved organic carbon export in stream water declined with catchment area combined bedload organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon export was significantly related to catchment area there was no significant difference between hillslope soil organic carbon and bedload organic carbon concentration when corrected for area oc export by bedload was not significantly different to that of dissolved oc export using the environmental tracer 137cs it was found that there was no significant difference in tracer concentration between bedload and hillslope soil this suggests a direct link between hillslope and channel and delivery of organic carbon to the channel of the eight catchments examined here six had been harvested for timber in previous decades with area of forest removed ranging from 25 to 60 while two catchments had minimal disturbance control catchments no harvest there was no difference in organic carbon export from the harvested and control catchments the results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term keywords sediment transport forest harvesting organic carbon dissolved organic carbon bedload hillslope and channel connectivity 1 introduction understanding water quality and sediment transport for small forested headwater catchments is a well studied topic due to the importance of these areas for forestry water supply and ecosystem services hopmans et al 1993 liu and sheu 2003 lal 2005 smith et al 2012 burrows et al 2014 lee and lajtha 2016 hancock et al 2017a hancock et al 2017b much work has focussed on soil chemistry and soil organic carbon hopmans et al 1993 liu and sheu 2003 fröberg et al 2011 smith et al 2012 bantle et al 2014 as well as over and under story vegetation soil and water and snowpack water quality brooks et al 1999 liu and sheu 2003 pelster et al 2009 while a significant body of work has been undertaken at the hillslope and single catchment scale much less work has been done to investigate how catchments with similar management and vegetation influence organic carbon oc export that is is organic carbon export related to catchment area relief slope or management practice oc here is defined as carbonaceous material sourced from living or dead matter where as inorganic c originating from minerals hewlett 1969 it has been proposed that dissolved oc may be a small part of the carbon budget for forest soils brooks et al 1999 fröberg et al 2011 lee and lajtha 2016 with the dissolved oc flux two orders of magnitude or less compared to total gross ecosystem fluxes gielen et al 2011 kleja et al 2016 it is reported that soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high soil oc content lal 2005 dissolved oc leaching from temperate forests is important as dissolved oc is transported from the soil surface down the soil profile where it may be stabilised and or modified by biogeochemical processes kalbitz et al 2000 kalbitz and kaiser 2008 bantle et al 2014 the processing of terrestrially derived oc by organisms is important in forested headwater streams where it supports aquatic food webs wipfli et al 2007 quantifying and understanding oc processing in forested headwater streams can provide insights into the local fluvial geomorphology and oc linkages wipfli et al 2007 oc in headwater streams is primarily derived from the upper organic soil horizon in most temperate catchments of which a significant component is in dissolved form schiff et al 1990 brooks et al 1999 oc is a critical component of the global carbon cycle linking the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through in stream microbial metabolism of terrestrial oc battin et al 2008 yet little is known about the contributions of small headwater streams raymond and saiers 2010 raymond et al 2013 therefore better understanding of the hydrologic pathways transporting oc from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems in headwater watersheds is needed brooks et al 1999 lee and lajtha 2016 it is known that oc transport from small watersheds increases with storm and snowmelt raymond and saiers 2010 and composition changes under different rainfall and runoff i e storm events forest harvesting can produce changes to the stream environment with implications for oc processing burrows et al 2014 burrows et al 2014 suggest that information on the impact of forest harvesting on rates of oc in forested streams is conflicting both between sites and also within the sample local area gooderham et al 2007 this is postulated to be a result of spatial and temporal heterogeneity that may exist due to differences in geology local storms and vegetation gooderham et al 2007 with this heterogeneity it is difficult to separate the major controls paired catchment studies offer some insights into the heterogeneity of these systems moore and jackson 1989 burrows et al 2014 although sediment yields and rainfall in australia are not as high as other regions of the world such as parts of asia e g xinbao et al 1990 jia et al 2012 li et al 2015 an understanding of the influences and controls on sediment transport and oc export is lacking for many natural systems hopmans et al 1993 evans 2000 burrows et al 2014 vanmaercke et al 2015 in terms of landscape use and management forested catchments represent a vital component of the timber resource and supply of high quality water barten and ernst 2004 webb 2012 burrows et al 2014 a dense coverage of vegetation often associated with undisturbed forested catchments provides both slope stability and erosional control at the land surface marden 2012 however this is somewhat counteracted as forested catchments are typically located in regions of elevated precipitation thus potentially increasing the sediment flux to streams brooks et al 2012 smith et al 2012 additionally the efficacy of vegetation coverage can often be negated by land disturbances such as logging and agricultural uses and has been documented in numerous studies throughout the world e g cornish 1993 2001 cornish

the impact of human induced landscape change is difficult as it requires knowledge of both the pristine sediment yield i e the natural undisturbed rate of erosion and the actual yield evans 2000 vanmaercke et al 2015 paired catchments are often used to obtain information on water yield and or water quality characteristics of forestland management brooks et al 1999 bren and mcguire 2007 2012 smith et al 2012 these paired catchment studies are primarily established to assess changes in water flow and quality in response to changes in vegetation coverage by monitoring rainfall streamflow and other factors relevant to stream water dynamics bren and mcguire 2007 such a study site presents the opportunity to explore the scale of sediment transport and oc which contributes to the degradation of stream water quality hancock et al 2017a hancock et al 2017b forested catchments particularly in the eastern regions of new south wales provide a significant proportion of high quality water to the surrounding area hopmans et al 1993 webb 2012 logging operations and associated infrastructure construction such as roads skid trails and log landings can potentially result in a significant increase of surface sediment transport and can increase erosion rates to greater than 15 t ha year brooks et al 2012 although erosion in forests is suggested to be minimal with open forest typically 1 t ha 1 yr 1 increasing to 5 t ha 1 yr 1 in woodlands managed lands charman and murphy 2007 activities that disturb the land surface e g logging clearing land can expose bare soil and result in increased erosion rates and accompanying carbon transport brooks et al 2012 montgomery 2012 there is a need for data examining oc quantity and export from catchments lee and lajtha 2016 in particular there is a need for data on the major controls on oc export here we build on previous work where hancock et al 2017a examined sediment loads and hancock et al 2017b modelled these loads using a computer based landscape evolution model siberia in the forested catchments described below this work reports on oc export from eight relatively small steep slope forested catchments 15 100 ha in south eastern australia of these eight catchments six have been harvested and two were not harvested controls here oc at both the hillslope and catchment scale 1 will be examined by quantifying dissolved stream water hillslope soil as well as stream bed load oc 2 linkages between hillslope and channel investigated using the environmental tracer 137cs 3 catchment scale oc export quantified and 4 management implications discussed for both harvested and non harvested catchments together with study limitations and future work 2 site description the study area lies approximately 85 km north of newcastle new south wales australia fig 1 the site within the chichester state forest is a series of eight small 13 97 ha catchments located in the headwaters of the telegherry river a tributary of the karuah river a site referred to as the karuah hydrology research area khra cornish 1993 the experimental catchments were established in 1974 75 primarily as an investigative tool to examine the effects of logging on streamflow and water quality with each catchment located on the eastern slope of a south running ridgeline extending into the barrington tops to the north webb et al 2012b the site is located within the southern extent of the new england fold belt peou 1977 the area consists of a carboniferous sequence of sedimentary rocks belonging to the ararat formation and is primarily composed of sandstone mudstones siliceous siltstones and limestone lenses the western higher elevation section of the study area is predominantly lutite mudstone which transitions downslope eastward to predominantly arenite sandstone and mixed compositions towards the bank of the telegherry river strongly weathered sedimentary strata span much of the site and thick soil coverage is widespread peou 1977 soils are euchrozems brown and yellow podzols and xanthozems they are highly structured and friable with most containing significant organic matter and in general are regarded as deep elliott 1977 there is also little evidence of destructive fire events in the study area law and chidel 2002 the study area has a moist warm temperate climate cornish 1993 with mean annual rainfall between 1450 and 1750 mm depending on elevation from 1993 to 2020 average annual rainfall was 1659 and 1477 for raingauges 1 and 4 respectively fig 1 there is typically a seasonal maximum during summer november february months and a seasonal minimum in the winter june august months maximum temperature varies with elevation where in summer temperatures average 28 c at 450 m and 24 c at 940 m and in winter minimum temperatures throughout the area drop to an average of 3 c elevations across the study site range from approximately 950 m a s l to 450 m a s l generally descending eastwards towards the banks of the telegherry river catchment relief is variable ranging between 245 m and 407 m table 1 of the eight catchments comprising the khra six were subjected to various levels of harvesting and clearing whilst two were left undisturbed table 1 cornish 1993 2001 prior to logging activities occurring in 1983 the area was dominated by tall wet sclerophyll forest greater than 35 m

well as in dissolved form in stream water hillslope soil also contains considerable organic carbon below we describe the field data laboratory methods as well as hydrological and topographic data we also use an environmental tracer 137cs to better understand hillslope and stream connectivity 3 1 bedload organic carbon bedload sediment transport and its organic matter content is challenging to measure einstein 1950 milliman and meade 1983 milliman and syvitski 1992 turowski et al 2010 beylich and laute 2014 here to quantify bedload each weir was emptied of water by removing a drain plug at the weir base allowing much easier removal of material the material behind each weir was manually removed by shovel and bucket each bucket 12 l in volume was carefully filled and the number of buckets counted as removal progressed deposited sediment was completely removed to the bedrock base leaving a clean and sediment free weir at each sampling occasion the material removed from each weir was relocated downslope of the respective weir volume of material was converted to units of mass using the bulk density of the stream sediment to obtain a representative sample a 20 l bucket of bedload from each weir was transported to the university of newcastle soil lab and air dried in an oven at 40 c for approximately 14 days bulk density was determined following the standard test method for bulk density of a soil core smith and atkinson 1975 cresswell and hamilton 2002 given the semi frequent as required exhumation and logistical challenge in measuring all bedload at all sites at the same time bedload is reported here in units of t yr 1 bedload oc was determined from the sample collected from the exhumed weir material described above dried bedload was passed through a 2 mm sieve a subsample of the 2 mm fraction was split from the main sample and analysed for oc using the leco dry combustion method https www leco com 3 2 soil organic carbon it was considered important to place the bedload oc in the context of hillslope soil oc at least two cores were collected from each hillslope adjacent to and upslope from each weir soil was collected using steel cores of 95 mm internal diameter and length 210 mm a cap constructed of steel was placed on the core and a hammer used to force the core until flush with the soil surface it was considered that the 210 mm sample core depth was sufficiently deep to capture a representative soil oc sample hancock et al 2019 the soil samples were placed in a labelled bag and transported to the university of newcastle samples were dried in a 40 c oven for at least one week samples were disaggregated using a mortar and pestle and the 2 mm and 2 mm size fractions separated by sieving the fine soil fraction was further disaggregated and both fractions weighed soil organic carbon was determined using the leco method 3 3 dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediment analysis dissolved oc was determined from 1l grab samples of water collected from each weir from january 2019 to february 2021 at approximately 6 8 week intervals the samples were refrigerated upon collection dissolved oc analysis was conducted at the nsw department of primary industries biosecurity laboratory operations environmental laboratory wollongbar using a shimadzu analyser employing the persulfate oxidation method see apha 1998 method 5310c a further 2l grab sample was collected at the same time for suspended sediment measurement the turbidity of the water sample was visually assessed and quantified by a greenspan turbidity probe for mass quantification of suspended sediment a 1l of this sample was passed through pre weighed filter paper with the filter paper then dried at 105c and weighed 3 4 catchment data topographic data consisted of a light detection and ranging lidar data set commissioned by the forestry commission of nsw and supplied by rps australia east pty ltd the data were collected in 2011 the data at 1 m grid resolution had an average point density of 2 points per m2 with a horizontal and vertical accuracy of 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively catchment area relief and average slope were determined from this high resolution dem data using arcgis software 3 5 hydrological data measurement a sharp crested v notch weir was installed on and concreted to bedrock at the outlet of each catchment allowing for the commencement of stage recording within stilling wells from 1975 figs 1 and 2 readings from optical shaft encoders are recorded on dataloggers at 6 min intervals rating curves to convert stage to discharge were established and refined over the years using a variety of methods as described in further detail by cornish 1993 all hydrological data have been recorded quality coded and edited where appropriate using hydstra time series data management software 3 6 environmental tracers understanding hillslope channel connectivity is important here the environmental tracer 137cs is employed to determine the sediment source the 137cs technique is a widely used and effective method for studying medium term i e 40 50 years soil erosion rates zapata et al 2002 137cs is an artificial radio isotope that is rapidly and strongly adsorbed to fine soil particles upon reaching the earth s surface thus making it an ideal soil tracer to qualitatively and quantitatively assess soil redistribution rates 137cs is an anthropogenic radionuclide half life approximately 30 years present as a consequence of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing that occurred during the 1950 s and 60 s loughran 1994 a key characteristic of 137cs is its tendency to adsorb to clays in surface soil horizons as well as exhibiting a high resistance to leaching such characteristics offer a feasible method of tracing and quantifying sediment transport studies globally have successfully applied the 137cs technique in a variety of landscapes e g loughran 1994 loughran and elliott 1996 martinez et al 2010 hancock et al 2015 here the goal was to assess similarities and or differences in 137cs concentration in bedload and hillslope soil for example if 137cs is present in hillslope soil and not in bedload then there is no connection between hillslope and channel or all labelled sediment is exiting the catchment if there is 137cs in the soil as well as in the bedload then it can be inferred that there is connection between hillslope and channel for bedload and hillslope soil assessment of 137cs the samples described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 were used in addition to the surface samples additional cores were collected vertically down the streambank to a depth of 1 m using the cores 5 samples in the sassafras and kokata catchments the aim of collecting these samples was to assess whether 137cs was present at depths greater than the 210 mm of the surface samples these samples were processes as described in section 3 2 the fines fraction 2mm was used for analysis of 137cs concentration a sample of mass of 1000 g was placed in a marinelli beaker on a hyperpure germanium detector sample count times were at least 24 h with counting errors in the order of 10 or less achieved one standard deviation the concentration of 137cs in the samples was calculated using the equation outlined by loughran 1994 and converted to areal activity loughran et al 2002 4 results since forest harvesting there has been no major disturbance in the catchments over this study period only monitoring activities occurred rainfall over this period was 1647 and 1453 mm yr 1 for raingauge 1 and 4 respectively fig 1 these values were close to the long term average 1659 and 1477 mm yr 1 for raingauge 1 and 4 respectively 4 1 bedload organic carbon bedload was manually removed from the weirs on an approximately annual basis with first data for all eight weirs obtained in may 2015 given the labour requirements and site access issues due to weather data collection for all sites took over several months to complete for all sites all bedload was removed over period of a day or less given the volume of material at all times the bedload was removed before material had deposited and filled the volume behind the weir with some freeboard available in most cases at least 150 mm below the top edge of the weir in no cases had the bedload deposited to the top edge of the weir however it is impossible to determine how much bedload had exited each weir in times of high flow bedload output ranges from 1 40 tyr 1 to 6 02 t yr 1 table 2 the results demonstrate that bedload increases with increasing catchment area fig 3 a however this relationship was not significant at the 0 05 level p 0 055 bedload t yr 1 had no relationship with slope or upslope contributing area slope and area derived from the dem of each catchment there was no relationship with bedload transport and percent area harvested catchment discharge was significantly related to catchment area r 0 98 p 0 001 and scaled linearly fig 3b bedload oc ranged from 2 9 to 6 6 average 5 44 σ 1 20 σ represents standard deviation table 2 bedload oc demonstrated no relationship with relief slope catchment area or bedload transport t yr 1 there was no relationship between bedload oc and amount of area disturbed by forest harvesting amount of oc transported within the bedload was calculated by multiplying the amount of bed load tonnes yr by the oc concentration table 2 a significant relationship was found between catchment area and oc transported in the bedload r 0 81 p 0 02 fig 4 4 2 soil organic carbon hillslope soil oc within each catchment ranged from 3 6 kokata to 9 9 crabapple with an average for all catchments of 5 64 σ 3 54 table 3 this soil oc range can be categorised as moderate to very high hazelton and murphy 2007 there was no relationship between soil oc and bedload oc or soil oc and dissolved oc there was no relationship between soil oc and any topographic attribute however interestingly there was no significant difference between average bedload oc and average soil oc for the 8 catchments suggesting a link between hillslope soil oc and channel or bedload oc converting soil oc to stocks t ha 1 produced a range of values with sassafras catchment 81 t ha 1 the lowest and barratta catchment 127 t ha 1 the highest there was no relationship with soil oc stock and any catchment variable 4 3 dissolved organic carbon and suspended sediment we report all data here as average dissolved oc from the period of february 2019 to december 2021 samples were collected at approximately 3 month intervals due to weather and accessibility streams draining forested catchments with well drained soils have been reported to have low concentrations of dissolved oc in the range 1 12 mg l moore and jackson 1989 all samples collected were at the lower end of this range average dissolved oc ranged from 1 09 mg l kokata to 2 10 mg l bollygum table 4 dissolved oc concentration displayed no relationship with relief slope catchment area the previous derived from the dem or bedload transport there was no relationship between dissolved oc and amount of area disturbed by forest harvesting a declining and non significant relationship at the 0 05 level was observed between dissolved oc and area r 0 66 p 0 07 fig 5 a the amount of dissolved oc tonnes exported annually from the catchments was determined by multiplying average flow fig 3b at each weir by the average dissolved oc concentration a significant relationship was found between catchment area and dissolved oc exported r 0 90 p 0 003 fig 5b however we recognise that this result is governed by the relationship with area and discharge i e fig 3b when corrected for area dissolved oc ranged from 0 005 t ha 1 yr 1 kokata to 0 011 mg l bollygum table 4 for all catchments and samples the water was very clear with no observable turbity ntu for all samples was 10 suggesting very little suspended sediment mass of sediment quantified from filtering produced negligible suspended sediment with no measurable mass change in filter paper 4 4 environmental tracers and hillslope and channel connectivity inspection of the creek bed and banks upstream of the weirs found that the bed and banks are largely stable with little erosion or bank instability the hillslope also has a dense tree canopy as well as a dense leaf litter cover the hillslopes do not exhibit any evidence of rill or gully erosion all hillslope and bedload samples had detectable levels of 137cs table 5 there was no significant difference between hillslope soil and bedload 137cs concentration there was no detectable 137cs in the streambank samples other than from the surface that is there was no detectable 137cs at depths greater than 210 mm this suggests that material entering the creeks is mostly from the hillslope via sheetwash processes 5 discussion 5 1 bedload hillslope and stream organic carbon the karuah study site has a well developed forest with considerable organic matter on the soil surface consisting of both leaf litter and coarse wood there has been no disturbance of the forest since the last harvest in 1983 other issues such as fire effects predate forest harvesting other than that of controlled burns at some of the harvest sites this study was conducted over a period of rainfall that was similar to the longer term rainfall average therefore the results provided here are for a site with consistent management over the study time frame and likely representative climatically brooks et al 1999 suggest a conceptual model describing the delivery of dissolved oc to a stream which consists of three processes 1 partial decomposition of terrestrially organic carbon producing dissolved oc 2 hydrologic transport of dissolved oc from the terrestrial environment to surface water and 3 modification of both quantity and composition of dissolved oc during transport complicating this are multiple and non independent effects of climate and geological variability when oc exported in bedload scaled for area from the 8 catchments 0 0057 t ha 1 yr 1 is compared to the average amount of dissolved oc exported 0 0064 t ha 1 yr 1 scaled for area they are in the same proportions and not significantly different each catchment produced similar amounts of bedload oc and dissolved oc annually tables 2 and 3 combining both bedload oc and dissolved oc produces a significant relationship with area r 0 91 p 0005 fig 6 this relationship suggests a capacity for the prediction of oc export in this environment soil in the catchment had a large organic carbon store with between 81 and 127 t ha 1 table 3 total oc export can be calculated by combining bedload oc with dissolved oc fig 6 demonstrates a significant relationship with catchment area with total oc export ranging from approximately 0 1 to 0 7 t yr 1 this suggests that for this amount of soil oc the catchments are exporting approximately 1 of the soil oc pool per annum this calculation does not include above ground biomass which may be directly contributing to bedload oc and stream water dissolved oc when expressed on an areal basis dissolved oc is significantly related to catchment area r 0 89 p 0 02 fig 5b that is larger catchments export more dissolved oc an unsurprising result however while not significant average dissolved oc mg l 1 concentration reduces with catchment area fig 5a this suggests a scaling relationship with several possible reasons there is increased soil oc storage within the catchment as the catchment size increases this is similar to the sediment delivery sdr concept where sediment storage increases as catchment size increases walling 1983 another point to note is that hydrological travel times with larger catchments will be longer with flow concentration timing also influenced longer term data may better resolve this issue however the significant influence on sediment transport and oc was catchment area that is larger catchments produce more sediment which contains more oc a non surprising result as bigger catchments produce more runoff there was no correlation of oc with any other topographic characteristic examined including elevation relief slope or percentage area disturbed in 1983 lal 2005 states that soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high soc content this is the case here for a steep slope relatively high rainfall environment soc in the catchments is high but with high variability hazelton and murphy 2007 average 5 64 σ 3 54 table 3 however interestingly there is no significant difference between the hillslope soil oc and that of the bedload oc this suggests that the hillslope surface is a potential source of both inorganic material soil and rock as well as organic material the release of dissolved organic carbon dissolved oc from decomposing coarse woody debris on the hillslope may result in large dissolved oc inputs to the forest soil bantle et al 2014 found that dissolved oc release from coarse woody debris is tree species specific in terms of quantity and quality and causes large dissolved oc fluxes to the soil particularly under coarse woody debris this oc is likely to translocate downslope into the drainage lines given the mixed species composition of the karuah catchment forests quantifying point scale dissolved oc flux would be difficult across all catchments erosionally the creek bed and banks demonstrated little erosion or bank instability this coupled with the density of trees as well as leaf litter provided additional erosion protection further there was an absence of rill or gully erosion therefore the findings here suggest that material entering the creeks is mostly from the hillslope via sheetwash processes this is supported by the use of environmental tracer 137cs sediment tracing using 137cs suggests that there is a direct connection between hillslope and channel further and more detailed tracer assessments using complementary tracers such as 210pbex would help elucidate both source and rates of transfer 5 2 management implications many studies have shown that land disturbance e g deforestation and agricultural activities can have significant implications at the catchment scale e g walling 1999 erskine et al 2002 walling 2006 montgomery 2007 vanacker et al 2007 marden 2012 smith et al 2012 marden et al 2014 vanacker et al 2014 the accurate quantification of the impact of land disturbance on sediment and nutrient loss is greatly relevant to the development and advancement of management practices to reduce sediment input to river systems and nutrient export hopmans et al 1993 evans 2000 vanmaercke et al 2015 forested landscapes are a particular concern as surface vegetation cover represents a significant resistor to increases of sediment flux and source of nutrients hopmans et al 1993 vanacker et al 2007 smith et al 2012 many studies in nsw e g cornish 1993 2001 webb et al 2012a and globally e g milliman and syvitski 1992 moore and jackson 1989 lenzi and marchi 2000 jia et al 2012 hinderer et al 2013 chen et al 2015 lazzari et al 2015 conclude that disturbance events decrease stream water quality or an increase in sediment yield at least in the short term the results here represent a series of catchments that have had approximately 35 years of recovery time since tree harvesting similar to moore and jackson 1989 we find that disturbance had a minor if any effect on oc export fig 7 while there could be a trend interpreted suggesting that more disturbance produces more carbon export if all data is used non significant correlation r 0 63 p 0 095 using all data the finding that the catchments with no area disturbed produce total organic carbon export similar to that of the majority of the other catchments suggests an alternate interpretation further if the largest value of 0 68 t yr 1 for the kokata catchment is removed there is no discernible trend therefore sediment loads including oc export can return to pre disturbance yields or even lower as new plantation and or regrowth begins to take hold with a greater stocking and sapwood area than the former mature forest cornish 1993 hancock 2017a this provides confidence in the long term management approach from this forest harvesting system ongoing monitoring which the authors plan to continue will highlight longer term trends data collection after harvesting currently not planned at this site would provide data immediately after disturbance 5 3 study limitations and future work a major strength of this study is that there are 8 catchments of different sizes with high quality runoff and topographic data available such a setup is unique globally however instrumenting and continuously monitoring for other water quality parameters such as bedload sediment load dissolved oc as well as water chemistry while possible is costly ideally automated water samples are needed to collect samples during storm events this would provide fundamental insights across a range of spatial and temporal scales the approach employed here with multiple grab samples provides an important first assessment there are several data limitations bedload was quantified by carefully filling and counting the number of buckets over a range of periods over a range of time periods although observation at each weir determined that sediment build up was not excessive there are still concerns regarding loss or spill over of sediment during large storm events gabrielli et al 2012 mcbroom et al 2012 and van daal rombouts et al 2016 there was a strong yet non significant relationship with catchment area and bedload at the 0 05 significance level with a value of 0 055 found here longer term data may strengthen this result or improved measurement of bedload may better refine this finding at all times when bedload was quantified there was storage capacity in each weir with the material never at the same level as the top of the wier we recognise in this study and many others listed above that it is extremely difficult with the available data and monitoring methods to quantify the amount of spill over that may or may not have occurred to quantify any loss would require sampling at times of high flow grab samples would provide some indication of spillover however being on site in times of high flow in this remote location would not be possible based on safety issues a collection trap could installed on the downside of the weir however construction of a trap while possible would be costly and difficult given the site conditions an additional collection device would also bring to play all the issues of accurate and reliable sediment collection with similar data reliability concerns it is also recognised that any error in bedload measurement will follow on to the calculation of both total sediment and oc loads overall the measurement of bedload is a diabolical problem there are always questions surrounding the length of data collection and in particular the role of large events sediment delivery is non linear and can be delivered as pulses or slugs leopold et al 1964 knighton 1998 willgoose 2018 we were only able to collect water samples in suitable weather due to access issues and remoteness of the site further data collection where both bedload suspended sediment and dissolved oc together with water chemistry are measured simultaneously would provide insights hopmans et al 1993 the role of large and or extreme events is an issue that cannot be examined here and is an issue that is recognised as being of high importance to understand oc dynamics we quantified both dissolved oc and oc from bedload samples collected over approximately the same period one issue that we cannot comment on is that of oc turnover i e biogeochemical cycling within the stream system and in particular the bedload repeated sampling of bedload would provide some insight into the variability of oc in the stream system however this is extremely labour intensive and difficult to envisage how this could be regularly managed 6 conclusions this study has quantified oc transport by bedload and stream discharge in eight steep average slope range for each catchment of 19 25 forested catchments with six subject to forest harvesting and 2 controls we believe that this is the first time that catchment scale erosion and oc data have been reported for both undisturbed and harvested sites in eastern australia our findings demonstrate a bedload output increases linearly with catchment area b oc in bedload and dissolved oc significantly increases with catchment area c no correlation between area harvested and catchment oc export 35 years after harvesting d oc export from harvested areas is no different to that of unharvested control catchments this demonstrates that the forest management practices employed here have had little long term detrimental effects in reference to bedload erosion and oc transport rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments bedload measurement was most ably supported by glen charlton students nicholas dunstan

3051,in this study a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach was developed for reliable uncertainty quantification of hydrological predictions the proposed pcmh approach employs a mixed particle evolution scheme which integrates the gaussian perturbation and copula based dependent sampling methods the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the applicability of pcmh is elaborated for a long term data assimilation case at the river ouse in uk multiple hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes are tested by the pcmh particle filter pf and particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approaches the results indicate that the developed pcmh approach is able to generate more reliable results with less accuracy fluctuation than pf and pmcmc for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from all the hydrological models the mean values and the associated variation intervals of nse over the total 270 runs for pcmh pf and pmcmc are 0 752 variation interval of 0 534 0 866 0 661 variation interval of 0 080 0 879 and 0 655 variation interval of 0 247 0 824 respectively for the probabilistic predictions evaluated by crps the mean values and fluctuation ranges from pcmh pf and pmcmc are respectively 15 215 8 624 31 549 18 758 8 595 43 536 19 308 10 848 37 799 these results suggested that the proposed pcmh method would be more robust than pf and pmcmc in generating reliable hydrologic predictions and be less influenced by the hydrologic model structures uncertainty scenarios and its inherent randomness moreover the pcmh method can also show better robustness than the copula based particle filter method since the particle evolution scheme of pcmh would balance extreme samples from copula sampling procedure by mixing samples from gaussian perturbation and remove unacceptable candidates through the metropolis acceptance criterion keywords hydrological predictions sequential data assimilation particle filter uncertainty copula data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrologic models are proposed to conceptualize rainfall runoff processes in a water cycle through a series of mathematical equations due to the rapid development of computer sciences hydrological models have been widely used for a great number of water issues such as flood or drought prediction water resources management and so on e g zhou et al 2018a sun et al 2019 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b hu et al 2021 however extensive uncertainties may exist in hydrological models since they are generally developed based on amounts of simplifications and assumptions on water processes these uncertainties may be embedded in different components of hydrologic models such as model structures parameters and forcing data liu and gupta 2007 moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 di et al 2021 uncertainty quantification is recognized as one of the most critical issues to be addressed in the applications of hydrologic models renard et al 2010 wu et al 2019 fan 2019 as one of the core issues in hydrologic prediction uncertainty quantification has been addressed by a great number of studies in which a variety of approaches have been developed such as bayesian estimation and polynomial chaos expansion e g ghaith and li 2020 ghaith et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 sequential data assimilation approaches have been applied for many hydrologic issues such as predictions of streamflow and soil moisture e g yan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 fan et al 2017b lyu and fan 2021 these methods can continuously assimilate available measurements into the modelling process to update probabilistic features of states and parameters and generate probabilistic predictions vrugt et al 2005 ensemble kalman filter enkf and particle filter pf methods are two typical data assimilation techniques widely used in the field of hydrology the enkf and its variants use ensembles generated through the monte carlo technique to approximate state covariance matrices to achieve suboptimal estimations for parameters and states evensen 2003 moradkhani et al 2005a shen and tang 2015 wang et al 2022 thus the model derivatives which is challenging for complex hydrological models are not required in enkf moreover the enkf explicitly characterizes the uncertainty with the ensemble in which each ensemble member is equally weighted moradkhani et al 2019 however the gaussian error assumption may limit the applicability of enkf based approaches and may not fully represent the statistical properties of the model simulations khaki et al 2017 in a parallel line the particle filter pf method has also been proposed for uncertainty quantification of hydrologic predictions in the pf framework a weighted function would be employed to represent the probabilistic distributions for state and parameter variables these weights other than the original samples would be updated through sequential importance sampling sis algorithm liu et al 2001 moradkhani et al 2012 liu et al 2012 moreover resampling algorithms are employed after sis in order to mitigate weight degeneration in pf fan et al 2016 fan et al 2017a however the resampling procedure in pf may also lead to limited sample diversity which means that only a few samples are available with significant weights and thus cannot fully describe the probabilistic features in model parameters and states the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approaches have been proposed to address the above sample impoverishment issue through integrating mcmc sampling strategy into pf moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 yan et al 2015 abbaszadeh et al 2018 proposed a new data assimilation technique based on pf mcmc and genetic algorithm named as epfm to enhance hydrological data assimilation which has been demonstrated to be more effective and reliable than pmcmc in state and parameter estimations abbaszadeh et al 2019 further coupled a deterministic four dimensional variational 4dvar assimilation method with the particle filter pf ensemble data assimilation system to produce a robust approach for dual state parameter estimation this method is able to account for all sources of uncertainties involved in hydrologic predictions and thus lead to more accurate and reliable posterior distributions for both state variables and parameters in data assimilation applications abbaszadeh et al 2019 hernández and liang 2018 introduced a hybrid algorithm called optimists optimized pareto inverse modeling through integrated stochastic search to bring together ideas from particle filters pfs four dimensional variational methods 4d var evolutionary pareto optimization and kernel density estimation in a unique way which has shown to efficiently produce probabilistic forecasts with comparable accuracy to that obtained from using a particle filter however the interdependencies in model parameters can hardly be well considered in these approaches which may limit the efficiency and robustness in particle evolution recently fan et al 2017a introduced a copula based particle filter coppf method in which the copula function is employed to reflect the interdependence of model parameters and generate new samples for the next step the coppf method has shown better performances than traditional pf methods especially for small sample size scenarios nevertheless one potential issue in coppf is that extreme samples from the outlier of the copula model may exist in parameter evolution which may influence the robustness of coppf consequently this study aims to develop a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach to provide reliable quantifications for model states and parameters and further provide robust predictions the proposed pcmh approach will employ a mixed particle evolution scheme consisting of a gaussian perturbation and a copula based dependent sampling methods the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the applicability and reliability of the proposed pcmh approach will be extensively demonstrated through multiple hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes at the river ouse located in north youksire in uk 2 methodology 2 1 sequential data assimilation in a sequential data assimilation process the state space model for a general hydrological system can be described by generic non linear functions as follows moradkhani 2008 yan et al 2016 1 x t g x t 1 u t θ t ω t 2 y t h x t θ t v t where g is a nonlinear function expressing states transition in the hydrologic model x t is the state vector at time step t u t represents the forcing data θ t is parameter vector for the hydrological model h is the non linear function relates the state vector x t to the observation vector y t ω t and v t respectively describe the random errors in hydrologic model and observations in the bayesian based filtering methods such as pf the posterior probabilities of model parameters and states can be established conditional on both previous observations y 1 t 1 and current observations y t gordon et al 1993 fan et al 2016 fan et al 2017a wang et al 2018 which can be formulated as follows 3 p x t θ t y 1 t p y t x t θ t p x t θ t y 1 t 1 p y t x t θ t p x t θ t y 1 t 1 d x t d θ t 4 p x t θ t y 1 t 1 p x t θ t x t 1 θ t 1 p x t 1 θ t 1 y 1 t 1 d x t 1 d θ t 1 where p x t θ t y 1 t 1 represents the prior information p y t x t θ t denotes the likelihood function p x t θ t y 1 t and p x t 1 θ t 1 y 1 t 1 respectively describes the posterior probabilities of model parameters and states at time step t and t 1 p x t θ t x t 1 θ t 1 represents model states and parameters evolution which can be obtained by eq 1 in practice the eq 3 does not have an analytic solution except for few special cases e g the linear system with gaussian assumption since the evaluation of the integrals may be intractable yan et al 2016 consequently the estimation of posterior distributions for model states and parameters is approximated by some monte carlo based methods 2 2 particle filter method the pf method is a sequential monte carlo method that estimates the posterior distributions of states and parameters through random samples in pf a weighted function will be employed to denote the posterior distributions for state and parameter variables given observations y at previous t steps which can be formulated as follows arulampalam et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2005b moradkhani et al 2012 5 p x t θ t y 1 t i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i θ t θ t i where δ is the dirac delta function and n is the sample size w t i denotes the posterior weight for the ith particle which can be updated as follows 6 w t i w t i p y t x t i θ t i i 1 n w t i p y t x t i θ t i where w t i is the prior weight for the ith particle and x t i and θ t i denotes the prior samples for the model parameter and state vector respectively p y t x t i θ t i can be obtained through a gaussian likelihood function l y t x t i θ t i which has been widely used in a number of studies moradkhani et al 2005b salamon and feyen 2010 fan et al 2016 yan and moradkhani 2016 and is formulated as 7 l y t x t i θ t i 1 2 π m r t exp 1 2 r t y o t i y t i 2 where y o t i is the randomized observations and r t is the standard deviation of the residuals between observations and model simulations sampling importance resampling sir algorithms moradkhani et al 2005b are usually employed to replace the particles with small importance weights by those particles having large importance weights moreover a perturbation of the resampled parameters is recommended to avoid the sample impoverishment yan and moradkhani 2016 one of the well known perturbation methods is based on a random walk process as follows moradkhani et al 2005b moradkhani et al 2012 8 θ t 1 i θ t r e s a m p i ε t i ε t i n 0 s v a r θ t i where var θ t i is the variance of the prior parameters at the current time step and s is a small tuning parameter ranging from 0 005 to 0 025 moradkhani et al 2012 2 3 particle markov chain monte carlo method the particle markov chain monte carlo methods pmcmc e g moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2012 improve upon traditional pf method through integrating mcmc steps into the parameter evolution process in eq 8 the benefit of using mcmc moves is that larger noise values can be used since the metropolis acceptance criterion is employed to avoid moving outside the filtering posterior moradkhani et al 2012 this implies that even though larger noise values may produce larger particle spread and thus have more outlier samples the metropolis acceptance criterion is able to detect and eliminate those samples from the filtering posteriors therefore introducing mcmc into pf procedures can lead to better descriptions for the parameter posteriors and also mitigating sample impoverishment in the pmcmc method a candidate sample particle would be generated through perturbation of the resampled parameters as follows moradkhani et al 2012 yan and moradkhani 2016 9 θ t i p θ t r e s a m p i ε t i ε t i n 0 s v a r θ t i the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the proposed parameter candidate as follows 10 α min 1 p x t 1 i θ t i p y 1 t p x t 1 i θ t i p y 1 t if α u 0 1 the posterior state x t i and parameter θ t i samples can be obtained as 11 x t i x t i p a n d x t i p g x t 1 i u t i θ t i p ω t 12 θ t i θ t i p otherwise 13 x t i x t r e s a m p i and θ t i θ t resamp i then prior weights and prior parameter samples for the next time step can be obtained as 14 w t 1 i 1 n and θ t 1 i θ t i the main difference between pf and pmcmc is that the metropolis acceptance ratio is included in pmcmc this means that after parameters are perturbed through random walk the candidate samples will be judged through the metropolis acceptance ratio to determine whether these samples will be accepted in the parameter posteriors such a process can eliminate the outlier abnormal samples generated in the random walk process and enhance quantification of parameter posteriors in data assimilation 2 4 particle copula metropolis hastings method however one potential challenge for pf and pmcmc approaches is that the parameter evolution scheme in eqs 8 and 9 can hardly consider interdependence among model parameters and thus may influence the reliability of those two approaches especially for a long term data assimilation process to address this challenge this study is going to develop a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh method the major difference between pcmh and previous approaches pf and pmcmc is that a mixed sample evolution scheme consisting of gaussian evolution expressed by eq 8 and copula based evolution schemes is employed in pcmh to enhance the robustness of the data assimilation process copula functions have been widely used for modelling dependence structures among correlated random variables since introduced into hydrology by favre et al 2004 the copula functions have been applied to addressing a number of hydrologic issues such as multivariate risk analysis for natural hazards e g sun et al 2019 fan et al 2020 huang and fan 2021 qing et al 2022 hydrologic simulation e g bárdossy and hörning 2016 fan et al 2017a and hydroclimatic projections e g zhou et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 the copula functions are extensively applied in the past decade since in a copula model the marginal distributions and the dependence model can be established in separated processes giving flexibility in choosing both marginal and dependent models brechman and schepsmeier 2013 a number of copula functions are available for low dimensional cases e g two or three such as such as gaussian student t and archimedean copulas nelsen 2006 for high dimensional dependent variables their joint distribution can be established through a number of bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 the vine copula methods e g c vine d vine have been developed to address the above issue brechman and schepsmeier 2013 in pcmh the parameter interdependence at each time step will be quantified through a copula function a set of samples based on the established copula model will be generated this sample set will be mixed with the sample set generated by the gaussian perturbation process denoted as eq 8 to formulate the candidate samples for the next step the metropolis acceptance ratio will finally be employed to determine whether the candidate sample would be accepted the detailed parameter evolution process is described as follows for the resampled parameter particles θ t r e s a m p i i 1 ns and ns is the sample size the marginal distribution for any parameter θ d θ is firstly constructed as θ d g d θ γ d here the nonparametric kernel estimator is recommended since the distribution for the resampled particles can hardly be quantified through some parametric models e g normal distribution the joint probability distribution for the parameter vector θ θ 1 θ 2 θd can be established through a vine copula model as follows 15 c 1 d u η j 1 d 1 i 1 d j c i i j i 1 i j 1 f u i u i 1 u i j 1 f u i j u i 1 u i j 1 η 16 u d g d θ d t r e s a m p γ d the new sample set based on the copula model can then be generated through two steps firstly the sample set u i c u 1 i c u d i c i 1 2 ns can be produced through simulation of the copula model denoted in eq 15 there are several algorithms to generate samples from a multivariate copula model aas et al 2009 such a process can also be implemented based on the r package cdvine brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 secondly the new samples for the original model parameters θd t d 1 2 d can be generated through their inverse probability functions 17 θ d t i c g d 1 u d i c γ d d 1 2 d a second sample set θ t i g will be generated through the gaussian perturbation scheme expressed as eq 8 the candidate samples can then be obtained by mixing the sample sets of θ t i g and θ t i c θ t i c θ 1 t i c θ d t i c as follows 18 θ t i p r θ t i c 1 r θ t i g where r is a value between 0 1 r 1 means all the samples are generated through the copula model and r 0 indicates the gaussian perturbation scheme is merely employed in this study r 0 5 would be employed the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate parameter samples and generate the posterior distributions for both model parameters and states as expressed by eqs 10 13 the prior weights and parameter samples for the next time step are then characterized by eq 14 fig 1 presents the detailed procedure for the proposed pcmh method there are underlying assumptions for the pcmh method i the parameters in a hydrological model are correlated among each other ii those correlations may not be well quantified through the multivariate gaussian distribution and thus the multivariate copula need to be employed to reflect those interdependence iii outlier samples may be obtained from either the gaussian distribution and the copula model and thus the metropolis acceptance criterion is adopted to eliminate those unacceptable samples particularly for the second assumption the multivariate gaussian distribution used to generate the candidate samples as presented in eq 9 implies that all the posterior distributions for individual parameters would be normally distributed however such an implication may not be valid in the data assimilation process since the posterior samples after assimilating observations may have arbitrary random features consequently the gaussian distribution cannot well quantify parameter posteriors and their interdependence in the data assimilation process there are a great number of copula functions available to quantify complex dependence structures among correlated variables or parameters such as gaussian student t elliptical copula families e g clayton gumbel frank brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 in this study the vine copula model consisting of frank copula will be used in the developed pcmh model due to the two following reasons i the frank copula can reflect both positive and negative interdependence ii the bivariate copula structure is fixed in the vine copula model can accelerate computation since the selection procedure in establishing the vine model is neglected moreover we argue that the vine model with fixed bivariate copulas is acceptable in pchm since metropolis acceptance criterion is included to exclude unacceptable samples from the vine model 3 synthetic case study 3 1 experiment setup the applicability of the pcmh method will be firstly demonstrated through a conceptual model hymod as shown in fig 2 a hymod is a probability distributed model and consists of three components including a pareto distribution for reflecting soil storage capacity a slow flow tank for routing groundwater flow and three identical quick flow tanks for routing surface flow moor 1985 fan et al 2017b five parameters need to be calibrated quantified as listed in table 1 precipitation p mm day and potential evapotranspiration et mm day are the two inputs required by hymod state variables in hymod include storage in the nonlinear tank representing the watershed soil moisture content the three quick flow tank storages representing the temporary short time detentions and the slow flow tank storage subsurface storage moradkhani et al 2005a the experiment is conducted to demonstrate the capability of the pcmh method in quantifying parameter and state uncertainties in hymod the 1 year synthetic streamflow data are generated by hymod with predefined parameters listed in table 1 with the real inputs for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these synthetic streamflow data would be considered as the observations in data assimilation moreover uncertainties in model inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and outputs are characterized by random perturbations for instance consider an input at time t denoted as ut it can be perturbed as u t i u t ξ t i where ξ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate the ith sample member normal distributed errors with standard deviations being 15 of the corresponding measurements will be added to synthetic streamflow and potential evapotranspiration data e g ξ t i n 0 t u and t u γ u t for the forcing data and γ 0 15 while a log normal distributed error with a proportionality factor of 0 15 will be added the precipitation i e ξ t i log n 0 t u and t u γ u t 3 2 evaluation criteria to evaluate the performance of different data assimilation methods the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps will be used in this study which are respectively formulated as follows murphy and winkler 1987 wang et al 2015 wang and wang 2019 19 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 21 crps f f x f o x 2 d x where n is the total number of streamflow measurements or predictions qobs and qsim are streamflow observations and model predictions respectively and q obs is the mean value of observations fo and ff are cumulative distribution functions for observations and model predictions respectively the rmse and nse have been widely employed for evaluating deterministic predictions from a model while crps is a measurement for probabilistic predictions 3 3 results analysis for the synthetic experiment the synthetic experiment is initially conducted by pcmh with a sample size of 50 in addition both pf and pmcmc which have been widely adopted in hydrologic data assimilation have also applied to the synthetic experiment as the benchmark approaches fig 3 presents the sample evolution of model parameters during the data assimilation process by different approaches it can be noticed that all parameters in hymod would be well identified by pcmh with reasonable fluctuation ranges in comparison both pf and pmcmc seems to lead to over convergence for most model parameters however the parameter rs is not identifiable by pf since it generally has significant variation ranges in the data assimilation process via pf this may affect the robustness of pf and pmcmc in long term data assimilation process since the parameters can hardly be evolved within rational spaces however the developed pcmh method can effectively rejuvenate model parameters and mitigate sample impoverishment within larger spaces than those from pf and pmcmc and thus can help provide reliable results even for long term data assimilation processes in the proposed pcmh method the copula functions are employed to quantify interdependence among model parameters and then generate parameter samples under such correlation consideration these samples are mixed with those from gaussian perturbation to generate the candidate parameter particles the above processes imply that the parameter samples in a hydrological model are correlated during their evolution in data assimilation to verify this assumption the parameter correlation at different time steps in data assimilation is presented in fig 4 a it can be observed that as the data assimilation proceeds the five parameters i e cmax bexp α rs rq in hymod would show visible correlation with some of them highly correlated at some time steps also the correlation values among those parameters are varied as the data assimilation process continues which may change from positive correlation to negative correlation fig 4 b presents the probabilities of correlation values among those five parameters in the data assimilation process in which the dashed red lines show the thresholds of 0 1 and 0 1 moreover fig 4 c present the ratios of the parameter correlations larger than 0 1 or smaller than 0 1 over the data assimilation process the results indicate that during the data assimilation process the model parameters would be significantly correlated among each other at most time steps the highest ratio larger than 0 1 or smaller than 0 1 of significant correlation appears between cmax and α with a ratio of about 65 while the lowest ratio of significant parameter correlation is observed between rs and rq but such a ratio can still be more than 48 consequently parameter correlation needs to be considered in the data assimilation process nevertheless the parameter posteriors can hardly be normally distributed after data assimilation fig s1 presents the histograms of parameter posteriors at different time periods the results indicate that the parameter posteriors would be generally skewed distributed which would be unable to be modelled through gaussian and multivariate gaussian distributions consequently it is desired to quantify those parameter correlation by the copula functions during the data assimilation process for the performances of the three data assimilation approaches i e pcmh pf and pmcmc in the synthetic experiment fig 5 show comparisons between predictions of streamflow and two state variables i e xloss and xslow from different approaches with the corresponding true values the results indicate that the predictive means for streamflow from all the three approaches can well track the variations of the synthetic observations moreover the predictive intervals bounded by 5 and 95 quantiles can bracket most observations the pcmh approach may produce relatively larger predictive intervals than those from pf and pmcmc during high flow periods this can be generally attribute to the larger parameter ranges obtained by pcmh as shown in fig 3 for the nonlinear tank storage i e xloss which represents the soil moisture content both the predictive means and 90 predictive intervals agree well with the corresponding true values in the synthetic experiment also pcmh would generate relatively larger predictive intervals due to wider parameter ranges than those from pf and pmcmc for the slow tank storage i e xslow it can be observed that the pcmh performed slightly worse than pf and pmcmc which lead to underestimation for high slow tank storages one possible reason is that the state variable xslow may not be highly correlated with the streamflow rate in the hydrology model i e hymod and thus the accurate streamflow prediction does not necessary lead to accurate quantification for xslow fig 6 compared the prediction accuracy evaluated by nse between the xslow and streamflow in the synthetic experiment in 20 replications it can be seen that the prediction for xslow is most likely unacceptable even though nse value for streamflow predication higher than 0 9 consequently the worse xslow prediction from pcmh as presented in fig 5 may possibly be resulted from the poor correlation between streamflow rate and the state variable in hymod to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed pcmh approach we have run pcmh as well as pf and pmcmc for the synthetic experiment under different sample size scenarios in details sample size scenarios of 20 50 100 200 500 are adopted with each scenario being run 20 times by pcmh pf and pmcmc this means that for one sample size scenario all the three data assimilation approaches would be run independently for 20 times i e generate different particles in different runs the purpose for running multiple times for different approaches is to evaluate the robustness for those methods in uncertainty quantification the boxplots in fig 7 exhibit the performance variations of nse rmse and crps for pcmh pf and pmcmc for different runs under different sample sizes in this figure the x axis indicates the sample scenarios whilst the y axis shows the values of nse rmse or crps the indices of nse and rmse evaluate the accuracy for deterministic predictions and thus the mean prediction at each time step i e qsim in eqs 19 and 20 would be adopted to calculate these two indices in comparison the crps reflects the accuracy in probabilistic predictions therefore the ensemble predictions in each time step would be used to calculate ff and the perturbed observations are employed to generate the value of fo based on the above procedures each run would generate one set values for nse rmse and crps and 20 sets would then be obtained for each sample scenario the boxplot is adopted to display the minimum maximum median first and third quantiles for the 20 values for each index based on the results in fig 6 we can conclude that the performances of pcmh show less variation than pf and pmcmc under small sample sizes moreover table s1 presents the performances of the three data assimilation approaches evaluated by nse rmse and crps under different sample sizes the results suggest that for large sample size scenarios such as 200 and 500 all the methods performed quite well with high nse values and low rmse and crps values these performances would not vary significantly for different runs for small sample size scenarios such as 20 and 50 pf and pmcmc can generate accurate results with nse larger than 0 95 but they may also produce unacceptable results with nse values less than 0 5 in comparison the developed pcmh method can produce reliable predictions even for small sample sizes for instance nse values for pcmh range from 0 779 to 0 976 for different runs under the sample size of 20 while the nse values for pf and pmcmc vary within 0 276 0 997 and 0 400 0 994 respectively this demonstrates that the proposed pcmh method shows more robustness than pf and pmcmc especially for small sample size scenarios moreover it is visible from fig 7 and table s1 that the performance of pcmh may be slightly worse than pf and pmcmc for some larger sample scenarios the performance of pcmh is affected by different factors such as the copula function in the vine model as well as the mixing rate i e r in eq 18 we initially used the frank copula in the vine model to quantify the interdependence among model parameters and set r 0 5 to mix the samples from copula and gaussian perturbation such a setting may not lead to the better predictions from pcmh consequently the pcmh with different settings on copula structure and sample mixing rate would be further tested and compared with pf and pmcmc to explore the impacts of these two factors in detail for the copula structure the pcmh can use i fixed copula functions in the vine model e g frank copula or ii the best copula function selected through the akaike information criterion the mixing rate r in eq 18 would be specified as i r 0 5 for the whole data assimilation process or ii r 0 5 when all correlation coefficients among parameters are larger than 0 05 and otherwise r 0 05 figs s2 s4 exhibit the performances of pcmh under different settings and their comparisons with the results from pf and pmcmc it is visible that the pcmh can produce better streamflow predictions than those from pf and pmcmc with small sample size scenarios as the sample size increases the pcmh with copula selection but a fixed mixing rate as shown in fig s3 may not perform as good as pf and pmcmc however the pcmh with varied sample mixing rate i e r 0 05 or 0 5 can generated comparable predictions with those from pf and pmcmc for large sample sizes as presented in figs s2 and s4 this also implies that the copula structure in the vine model may not have a significant effect on the performance of pcmh therefore the fixed copula function e g frank is recommended in the vine model to quantify parameter interdependence in the data assimilation process 4 real case study 4 1 overview of the catchment the applicability of pcmh would be further demonstrated through a long term data assimilation problem at the river ouse the river ouse is located in north youksire which as a mainstream length of 208 km making it the sixth longest river of the united kingdom and the longest to flow entirely in one county fig 8 shows the location of the river ouse the river ouse flows from northwest to southeast with the altitude ranging from 5 6 m to 714 3 m the catchment is mostly covered by grassland 43 92 and arable horticultural crops 31 34 with some parts covered by mountain heath and bog plants as well as woodland this catchment has mixed geological structures mainly consisting of moderate permeability bedrocks and mixed permeability superficial deposits as well as highly permeable bedrocks in lower reaches the streamflow records from 1997 to 2006 at the gauge station in skelton are adopted in this study the associated precipitation data are also obtained from the national river flow archive https nrfa ceh ac uk and the potential evapotranspiration data are obtained through averaging the historic gridded potential evapotranspiration developed by tanguy et al 2017 4 2 hydrologic models in addition to the hymod used in the synthetic experiment two more hydrologic models gr4j and ihacres will also be employed to comprehensively demonstrate the applicability of the developed pcmh method the gr4j model is a lumped hydrologic model with four parameters and can be run in daily scale the structure of gr4j is shown in fig 2 b in which it consists of an interception reservoir is employed to intercept rainfall and potential evapotranspiration a soil moisture accounting procedure is adopted to generate effective rainfall and a water exchange term used to model water losses to or gains from deep aquifers the gr4j model also has a routing module including two flow components with constant volumetric split 10 90 two unit hydrographs and a non linear routing store as shown in fig 2 b more details about gr4j can be found in some literates e g perrin et al 2003 westra et al 2014 smith et al n d the ihacres model jakeman et al 1990 jakeman and hornberger 1993 is another conceptual rainfall runoff model to be employed in this study it typically has unknow parameters ranging between 5 and 7 parameters the ihacres model has many versions developed by a number of studies e g viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 shin et al 2013 shin et al 2015 in this study the catchment moisture deficit cmd version developed by croke and jakeman 2004 as it has been recognized to have more physical meaning for the parameters shin and kim 2017 as shown in fig 2 c the cmd based ihacres model is composed of two modules in which a nonlinear module is adopted to generate effective rainfall as well as the cmd output and the linear module is employed to translate effective rainfall into streamflow by routing it through two parallel linear stores based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph theory croke and jakeman 2007 table 2 presents the model parameters in gr4j and ihacres there are four unknow model parameters defined as x 1 x 4 in gr4j model there are also other modified versions of gr4j with five and six parameters i e gr5j and gr6j but the four parameter model i e gr4j will be adopted in this study the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with a daily scale will be used as the inputs for gr4j the ihacres model would have different parameters for different versions in current study six parameters will need to be estimated for the cmd based ihacres model as presented in table 2 the ihacres model can be run based on different inputs such as precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration similar with gr4j and hymod the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will be adopted to force the ihacres model 4 3 results analysis for the real case study the developed pcmh method as well as pf and pmcmc are employed to quantify uncertainties in the hydrologic models of hymod gr4j and ihacres on streamflow predictions for the river ouse a proportional factor of 0 15 is adopted for the random errors to be added to inputs and outputs to reflect their inherent uncertainties in which the normal distributed errors are used for potential evapotranspiration and streamflow whilst the log normal distributed error is used for precipitation moreover a total number of 10 year data 1997 2006 are employed to demonstrate the applicability of pcmh in hydrological data assimilation processes all the three data assimilation methods are run with a sample size of 100 fig s5 presents the flowchart for the real case experiment fig 9 exhibits the comparison between observations and predictions from different hydrologic models quantified by different data assimilation techniques in which the solid lines indicate the mean prediction at each time step from data assimilation and the cyan region shows the corresponding 90 predictive interval bounded by the by the 5 and 95 quantiles of the streamflow prediction samples the first column shows the performances of pcmh pf and pmcmc on the hymod the results indicate that the predictive means from pcmh can well track the variations of real streamflow records while in comparison both pf and pmcmc have led to underestimation for many high flow records moreover the 90 predictive intervals from pcmh can well bracket the real observations even though large predictive intervals can be observed at some high flow periods similar with the deterministic predictions pf and pmcmc also generate underestimation for probabilistic predictions at high flow periods which cannot cover the corresponding observations for the gr4j model predictions from both pcmh and pf agree well with most observations except overestimations from high flows but pcmh seems to produce slightly higher overestimations than pf however the pmcmc method would produce underestimation for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions at many high flow periods which is similar with results from hymod for the ihacres model as shown in the last column of fig 9 it can be observed that all the three approaches perform well without noticeable discrepancy between predictions and observations also the 90 predictive intervals from pcmh pf and pmcmc would well bracket the corresponding observations in general the developed pcmh method performed well on all the three hydrologic models while the pf method produced underestimations for hymod at some high flow periods and pmcmc also generated underestimations for hymod and ihacres at some high flow periods this can demonstrate the robustness of the developed pcmh method on applications to different hydrologic models to further demonstrate the reliability of pcmh we have run pcmh pf and pmcmc for different hydrological models with different input and output uncertainties as well as different sample sizes in detail a total number of 9 scenarios as presented in table 3 have been designed with different uncertainties in model inputs outputs and sample sizes moreover 10 runs will be conducted for each scenario to reveal the robustness of pcmh pf and pmcmc the boxplot shown in fig 10 exhibit the variations of nse coefficients for pcmh pf and pmcmc on different models under different uncertainty scenarios here the nse value is generated by comparing the mean predictions and observations through equation 20 under each scenario 10 runs were performed for a data assimilation i e pchm pf or pmcmc method on a hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres and thus 10 nse values would be correspondingly obtained it can be concluded that the pcmh would generate reliable predictions with acceptable variations even for the ihacres model with small sample sizes e g scenario 1 4 and 7 in comparison both pf and pmcmc show remarkable variations for their performances on all the three hydrological models especially under small sample size scenarios table s2 presents the performances of pcmh pf and pmcmc on deterministic predictions evaluated by the nse coefficient for different hydrologic models under different running scenarios for one specific uncertainty scenario the pcmh can produce acceptable predictions even for multiple replicates indicating the reliability of the pcmh method as presented in table s2 the worst case of pcmh occurred for the scenarios of 0 15 0 15 0 15 50 nevertheless the predictions from pcmh are still satisfactory with the nse coefficient ranging between 0 534 and 0 781 in comparison the pf and pmcmc would have chances to generate unacceptable predictions with the nse coefficient being as low as around 0 3 moreover the proposed pcmh approach seems not to be influenced remarkably by uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes with the nse coefficient varying within 0 72 0 80 for hymod 0 70 0 87 for gr4j and 0 53 0 79 for ihacres in comparison the performances of pf and pmcmc would vary significantly for different uncertainty scenarios even though they may produce better results e g an nse coefficient larger than 0 82 for pmcmc on hymod than pcmh their performances are not as robust as pcmh and they may also generate unacceptable predictions with the nse coefficient as low as 0 2 for some cases these conclusions are consistent with the results in fig 10 fig 11 and table s3 show the performances evaluated by rmse of pcmh pf and pmcmc on different hydrologic models under different uncertainty scenarios here the rmse values for gr4j are significantly smaller than those for hymod and ihacres this is because that the outputs of gr4j are denoted as streamflow depth in mm where the outputs from hymod and ihacres are expressed as streamflow volume in m3 s we can observe low rmse values with small variations for pcmh especially on the hydrologic models of hymod and gr4j in comparison the performances of pf and pmcmc would vary remarkably which may lead to inaccurate predictions even for a small size of 200 in addition to deterministic predictions one of the attractive advantages for pcmh pf and pmcmc is that they can also produce probabilistic predictions which can be adapted for future risk inferences the probabilistic predictions from the three data assimilation methods on different hydrologic models are evaluated by crps expressed as eq 21 table s4 and fig 12 exhibit the performance variations of pcmh pf and pmcmc for probabilistic predictions through different hydrologic models similar with rmse values the crps values from gr4j model is not comparable with those from hymod and ihacres since the outputs from gr4j are denoted as streamflow depth in mm from table s4 and fig 9 we can observe the robustness of pcmh on different hydrologic models for generating probabilistic predictions under different uncertainty scenarios in detail the crps values ranged between 11 2 and 13 5 for pcmh on hymod between 0 22 and 0 37 for gr4j and between 16 6 and 31 6 for ihacres there are large discrepancies between the crps values from gr4j and those from hymod and ihacres this is because that the crps from gr4j is calculated based on the streamflow depth whilst this index for the other two models is generated based on streamflow rate in comparison as presented in fig 12 even though pf and pmcmc can produce reliable probabilistic predictions through gr4j model under some uncertainty scenarios e g scenarios 6 to 9 for pmcmc and scenarios 3 5 6 8 9 for pf they would have much more chances to generate discrepant results than pcmh to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed pcmh method a total number of nine scenarios have been designed with each running 10 times through three hydrologic models i e hymod gr4j ihacres consequently we have run 270 replicates for pcmh as well as pf and pmcmc fig 13 exhibits the performance variations for all the replicates evaluated by nse coefficient rmse and crps here the rmse and crps values for gr4j evaluated in streamflow depth as shown in tables s3 and s4 and figs 11 and 12 are converted into streamflow rate in order to make them comparable with those from hymod and ihacres the results indicate that the proposed pcmh approach would lead to sharp distributions for its performance variations while in comparison the pf and pmcmc methods would have much flatter distributions in detail the mean values and the associated variation intervals of nse over the total 270 runs for pcmh pf and pmcmc are 0 752 with a variation interval of 0 534 0 866 0 661 with a variation interval of 0 080 0 879 and 0 655 with a variation interval of 0 247 0 824 respectively similarly for the probabilistic predictions the mean values and fluctuation ranges from pcmh pf and pmcmc are respectively 15 215 8 624 31 549 18 758 8 595 43 536 19 308 10 848 37 799 these results suggest that the proposed pcmh method is more robust than pf and pmcmc in generating reliable hydrologic predictions and seems to be influenced less by the hydrologic models to be used uncertainty scenarios and its inherent replicates 5 discussion in the proposed pcmh method the new particles for model parameters are evolved through a mixed sampling scheme consisting of both gaussian perturbation i e eq 9 and copula sampling i e eqs 15 to 17 methods the vine copula approach is introduced into pcmh to reflect parameter interdependence among model parameters and the gaussian perturbation approach aims to enhance the chosen chances for the particles around posterior samples the proposed pcmh method can rejuvenate model parameters in wider spaces than those of pf and pmcmc and effectively alleviate the sample impoverishment especially in long term data assimilation processes the coppf method proposed by fan et al 2017b has already introduced copula based sample scheme into data assimilation through particle filter however the proposed pcmh is significantly different from coppf in pcmh the candidate samples are generated by mixing the samples from gaussian perturbation i e eq 9 and vine copula i e eqs 15 to 17 methods and the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples such a scheme can i balances possible extreme samples from the vine copula method and ii remove unacceptable samples through the metropolis ratio in comparison all new sample would be from either the copula method or the gaussian perturbation method in coppf which suggests extreme samples from the outlier of the copula model even though not too many may exist in parameter evolution especially for large sample sizes table 4 present the performances of pcmh and coppf through hymod with a proportional factor of 0 15 for reflecting uncertainties in model inputs and outputs and sample sizes of 50 100 and 200 moreover 10 replicates have been conducted for coppf to make the results comparable with those from pcmh the results indicate that the coppf is also able to generate reliable predictions under different sample size scenarios however compared with pcmh the coppf performed slightly worse in both deterministic and probabilistic predictions moreover the coppf seems to be less robust than pcmh especially under large sample size scenarios for instance the nse values from coppf range between 0 740 and 0 804 for a sample size of 50 and between 0 671 and 0 789 for a sample size of 200 while in comparison the proposed pcmh in this study would bring nse values respectively ranging within 0 768 0 782 and 0 775 0 801 this is mainly because that the coppf would have more chances to involve abnormal or extreme samples generated by the copula sampling scheme expressed by eqs 15 to 17 and also it does not have a mechanism remove those abnormal samples 6 conclusions in this study a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach has been proposed to provide reliable predictions in hydrological data assimilation the proposed pcmh approach can improve the hydrological data assimilation process through a mixed sample evolution scheme consisting of gaussian evolution expressed by eq 8 and copula based evolution schemes the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the developed pcmh method is able to rejuvenate model parameters in wider spaces than those of pf and pmcmc and effectively alleviate the sample impoverishment especially in long term data assimilation processes the applicability of the pcmh approach was comprehensively demonstrated at the river ouse in uk through three hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes a total number of nine scenarios consisting of different uncertainty settings in model inputs outputs and sample sizes are designed with each scenario being replicating for 10 times for each hydrological model the obtained results indicate that the pcmh approach can generally generate reliable predictions for all hydrological models with the nse values larger than 0 53 for all 270 runs particularly the pcmh method shows more robustness than traditional pf and pcmcm methods which can produce better nse rmse and crps values with narrower fluctuation ranges than those from pf and pmcmc moreover compared with the coppf approach the developed pcmh method can bring more robust results especially under large sample size scenarios this is mainly due to the capabilities of pcmh in balancing possible extreme samples from the copula sampling procedure by the mixed evolution scheme and also removing unacceptable samples through the metropolis ratio method this study has demonstrated that the proposed pcmh approach can generate more reliable predictions in hydrological data assimilation even though only the conceptual models have been tested for the pcmh method this method can also be applicable for complex hydrological or land surface models however one challenge for the application of pchm is that when a large number of parameters are included in hydrological or land surface models it may be complex and time consuming to quantify intercedence among those model parameters nevertheless this issue can be resolved through the following ideas i parameter correlation screening is introduced and the vine copula models are built for those highly correlated parameters whilst the others are sampled independently ii the vine copula models are used for the parameters in the same module component or the same grid for complex models and thus different vine copula models will be used to quantify parameter interdependence in different modules or grids moreover it can be observed from the results that even for the same data assimilation method it will produce predictions with different accuracies from different hydrological models under different uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes it is apparent that the predictions from data assimilation would be influenced by various factors such as the hydrological models and da methods to be used as well as uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes however currently it is not clear which factor would pose dominant effects on the predictability of the data assimilation this issue is to be investigated in our companion

3051,in this study a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach was developed for reliable uncertainty quantification of hydrological predictions the proposed pcmh approach employs a mixed particle evolution scheme which integrates the gaussian perturbation and copula based dependent sampling methods the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the applicability of pcmh is elaborated for a long term data assimilation case at the river ouse in uk multiple hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes are tested by the pcmh particle filter pf and particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approaches the results indicate that the developed pcmh approach is able to generate more reliable results with less accuracy fluctuation than pf and pmcmc for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from all the hydrological models the mean values and the associated variation intervals of nse over the total 270 runs for pcmh pf and pmcmc are 0 752 variation interval of 0 534 0 866 0 661 variation interval of 0 080 0 879 and 0 655 variation interval of 0 247 0 824 respectively for the probabilistic predictions evaluated by crps the mean values and fluctuation ranges from pcmh pf and pmcmc are respectively 15 215 8 624 31 549 18 758 8 595 43 536 19 308 10 848 37 799 these results suggested that the proposed pcmh method would be more robust than pf and pmcmc in generating reliable hydrologic predictions and be less influenced by the hydrologic model structures uncertainty scenarios and its inherent randomness moreover the pcmh method can also show better robustness than the copula based particle filter method since the particle evolution scheme of pcmh would balance extreme samples from copula sampling procedure by mixing samples from gaussian perturbation and remove unacceptable candidates through the metropolis acceptance criterion keywords hydrological predictions sequential data assimilation particle filter uncertainty copula data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrologic models are proposed to conceptualize rainfall runoff processes in a water cycle through a series of mathematical equations due to the rapid development of computer sciences hydrological models have been widely used for a great number of water issues such as flood or drought prediction water resources management and so on e g zhou et al 2018a sun et al 2019 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b hu et al 2021 however extensive uncertainties may exist in hydrological models since they are generally developed based on amounts of simplifications and assumptions on water processes these uncertainties may be embedded in different components of hydrologic models such as model structures parameters and forcing data liu and gupta 2007 moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 di et al 2021 uncertainty quantification is recognized as one of the most critical issues to be addressed in the applications of hydrologic models renard et al 2010 wu et al 2019 fan 2019 as one of the core issues in hydrologic prediction uncertainty quantification has been addressed by a great number of studies in which a variety of approaches have been developed such as bayesian estimation and polynomial chaos expansion e g ghaith and li 2020 ghaith et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 sequential data assimilation approaches have been applied for many hydrologic issues such as predictions of streamflow and soil moisture e g yan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 fan et al 2017b lyu and fan 2021 these methods can continuously assimilate available measurements into the modelling process to update probabilistic features of states and parameters and generate probabilistic predictions vrugt et al 2005 ensemble kalman filter enkf and particle filter pf methods are two typical data assimilation techniques widely used in the field of hydrology the enkf and its variants use ensembles generated through the monte carlo technique to approximate state covariance matrices to achieve suboptimal estimations for parameters and states evensen 2003 moradkhani et al 2005a shen and tang 2015 wang et al 2022 thus the model derivatives which is challenging for complex hydrological models are not required in enkf moreover the enkf explicitly characterizes the uncertainty with the ensemble in which each ensemble member is equally weighted moradkhani et al 2019 however the gaussian error assumption may limit the applicability of enkf based approaches and may not fully represent the statistical properties of the model simulations khaki et al 2017 in a parallel line the particle filter pf method has also been proposed for uncertainty quantification of hydrologic predictions in the pf framework a weighted function would be employed to represent the probabilistic distributions for state and parameter variables these weights other than the original samples would be updated through sequential importance sampling sis algorithm liu et al 2001 moradkhani et al 2012 liu et al 2012 moreover resampling algorithms are employed after sis in order to mitigate weight degeneration in pf fan et al 2016 fan et al 2017a however the resampling procedure in pf may also lead to limited sample diversity which means that only a few samples are available with significant weights and thus cannot fully describe the probabilistic features in model parameters and states the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approaches have been proposed to address the above sample impoverishment issue through integrating mcmc sampling strategy into pf moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 yan et al 2015 abbaszadeh et al 2018 proposed a new data assimilation technique based on pf mcmc and genetic algorithm named as epfm to enhance hydrological data assimilation which has been demonstrated to be more effective and reliable than pmcmc in state and parameter estimations abbaszadeh et al 2019 further coupled a deterministic four dimensional variational 4dvar assimilation method with the particle filter pf ensemble data assimilation system to produce a robust approach for dual state parameter estimation this method is able to account for all sources of uncertainties involved in hydrologic predictions and thus lead to more accurate and reliable posterior distributions for both state variables and parameters in data assimilation applications abbaszadeh et al 2019 hernández and liang 2018 introduced a hybrid algorithm called optimists optimized pareto inverse modeling through integrated stochastic search to bring together ideas from particle filters pfs four dimensional variational methods 4d var evolutionary pareto optimization and kernel density estimation in a unique way which has shown to efficiently produce probabilistic forecasts with comparable accuracy to that obtained from using a particle filter however the interdependencies in model parameters can hardly be well considered in these approaches which may limit the efficiency and robustness in particle evolution recently fan et al 2017a introduced a copula based particle filter coppf method in which the copula function is employed to reflect the interdependence of model parameters and generate new samples for the next step the coppf method has shown better performances than traditional pf methods especially for small sample size scenarios nevertheless one potential issue in coppf is that extreme samples from the outlier of the copula model may exist in parameter evolution which may influence the robustness of coppf consequently this study aims to develop a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach to provide reliable quantifications for model states and parameters and further provide robust predictions the proposed pcmh approach will employ a mixed particle evolution scheme consisting of a gaussian perturbation and a copula based dependent sampling methods the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the applicability and reliability of the proposed pcmh approach will be extensively demonstrated through multiple hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes at the river ouse located in north youksire in uk 2 methodology 2 1 sequential data assimilation in a sequential data assimilation process the state space model for a general hydrological system can be described by generic non linear functions as follows moradkhani 2008 yan et al 2016 1 x t g x t 1 u t θ t ω t 2 y t h x t θ t v t where g is a nonlinear function expressing states transition in the hydrologic model x t is the state vector at time step t u t represents the forcing data θ t is parameter vector for the hydrological model h is the non linear function relates the state vector x t to the observation vector y t ω t and v t respectively describe the random errors in hydrologic model and observations in the bayesian based filtering methods such as pf the posterior probabilities of model parameters and states can be established conditional on both previous observations y 1 t 1 and current observations y t gordon et al 1993 fan et al 2016 fan et al 2017a wang et al 2018 which can be formulated as follows 3 p x t θ t y 1 t p y t x t θ t p x t θ t y 1 t 1 p y t x t θ t p x t θ t y 1 t 1 d x t d θ t 4 p x t θ t y 1 t 1 p x t θ t x t 1 θ t 1 p x t 1 θ t 1 y 1 t 1 d x t 1 d θ t 1 where p x t θ t y 1 t 1 represents the prior information p y t x t θ t denotes the likelihood function p x t θ t y 1 t and p x t 1 θ t 1 y 1 t 1 respectively describes the posterior probabilities of model parameters and states at time step t and t 1 p x t θ t x t 1 θ t 1 represents model states and parameters evolution which can be obtained by eq 1 in practice the eq 3 does not have an analytic solution except for few special cases e g the linear system with gaussian assumption since the evaluation of the integrals may be intractable yan et al 2016 consequently the estimation of posterior distributions for model states and parameters is approximated by some monte carlo based methods 2 2 particle filter method the pf method is a sequential monte carlo method that estimates the posterior distributions of states and parameters through random samples in pf a weighted function will be employed to denote the posterior distributions for state and parameter variables given observations y at previous t steps which can be formulated as follows arulampalam et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2005b moradkhani et al 2012 5 p x t θ t y 1 t i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i θ t θ t i where δ is the dirac delta function and n is the sample size w t i denotes the posterior weight for the ith particle which can be updated as follows 6 w t i w t i p y t x t i θ t i i 1 n w t i p y t x t i θ t i where w t i is the prior weight for the ith particle and x t i and θ t i denotes the prior samples for the model parameter and state vector respectively p y t x t i θ t i can be obtained through a gaussian likelihood function l y t x t i θ t i which has been widely used in a number of studies moradkhani et al 2005b salamon and feyen 2010 fan et al 2016 yan and moradkhani 2016 and is formulated as 7 l y t x t i θ t i 1 2 π m r t exp 1 2 r t y o t i y t i 2 where y o t i is the randomized observations and r t is the standard deviation of the residuals between observations and model simulations sampling importance resampling sir algorithms moradkhani et al 2005b are usually employed to replace the particles with small importance weights by those particles having large importance weights moreover a perturbation of the resampled parameters is recommended to avoid the sample impoverishment yan and moradkhani 2016 one of the well known perturbation methods is based on a random walk process as follows moradkhani et al 2005b moradkhani et al 2012 8 θ t 1 i θ t r e s a m p i ε t i ε t i n 0 s v a r θ t i where var θ t i is the variance of the prior parameters at the current time step and s is a small tuning parameter ranging from 0 005 to 0 025 moradkhani et al 2012 2 3 particle markov chain monte carlo method the particle markov chain monte carlo methods pmcmc e g moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2012 improve upon traditional pf method through integrating mcmc steps into the parameter evolution process in eq 8 the benefit of using mcmc moves is that larger noise values can be used since the metropolis acceptance criterion is employed to avoid moving outside the filtering posterior moradkhani et al 2012 this implies that even though larger noise values may produce larger particle spread and thus have more outlier samples the metropolis acceptance criterion is able to detect and eliminate those samples from the filtering posteriors therefore introducing mcmc into pf procedures can lead to better descriptions for the parameter posteriors and also mitigating sample impoverishment in the pmcmc method a candidate sample particle would be generated through perturbation of the resampled parameters as follows moradkhani et al 2012 yan and moradkhani 2016 9 θ t i p θ t r e s a m p i ε t i ε t i n 0 s v a r θ t i the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the proposed parameter candidate as follows 10 α min 1 p x t 1 i θ t i p y 1 t p x t 1 i θ t i p y 1 t if α u 0 1 the posterior state x t i and parameter θ t i samples can be obtained as 11 x t i x t i p a n d x t i p g x t 1 i u t i θ t i p ω t 12 θ t i θ t i p otherwise 13 x t i x t r e s a m p i and θ t i θ t resamp i then prior weights and prior parameter samples for the next time step can be obtained as 14 w t 1 i 1 n and θ t 1 i θ t i the main difference between pf and pmcmc is that the metropolis acceptance ratio is included in pmcmc this means that after parameters are perturbed through random walk the candidate samples will be judged through the metropolis acceptance ratio to determine whether these samples will be accepted in the parameter posteriors such a process can eliminate the outlier abnormal samples generated in the random walk process and enhance quantification of parameter posteriors in data assimilation 2 4 particle copula metropolis hastings method however one potential challenge for pf and pmcmc approaches is that the parameter evolution scheme in eqs 8 and 9 can hardly consider interdependence among model parameters and thus may influence the reliability of those two approaches especially for a long term data assimilation process to address this challenge this study is going to develop a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh method the major difference between pcmh and previous approaches pf and pmcmc is that a mixed sample evolution scheme consisting of gaussian evolution expressed by eq 8 and copula based evolution schemes is employed in pcmh to enhance the robustness of the data assimilation process copula functions have been widely used for modelling dependence structures among correlated random variables since introduced into hydrology by favre et al 2004 the copula functions have been applied to addressing a number of hydrologic issues such as multivariate risk analysis for natural hazards e g sun et al 2019 fan et al 2020 huang and fan 2021 qing et al 2022 hydrologic simulation e g bárdossy and hörning 2016 fan et al 2017a and hydroclimatic projections e g zhou et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 the copula functions are extensively applied in the past decade since in a copula model the marginal distributions and the dependence model can be established in separated processes giving flexibility in choosing both marginal and dependent models brechman and schepsmeier 2013 a number of copula functions are available for low dimensional cases e g two or three such as such as gaussian student t and archimedean copulas nelsen 2006 for high dimensional dependent variables their joint distribution can be established through a number of bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 the vine copula methods e g c vine d vine have been developed to address the above issue brechman and schepsmeier 2013 in pcmh the parameter interdependence at each time step will be quantified through a copula function a set of samples based on the established copula model will be generated this sample set will be mixed with the sample set generated by the gaussian perturbation process denoted as eq 8 to formulate the candidate samples for the next step the metropolis acceptance ratio will finally be employed to determine whether the candidate sample would be accepted the detailed parameter evolution process is described as follows for the resampled parameter particles θ t r e s a m p i i 1 ns and ns is the sample size the marginal distribution for any parameter θ d θ is firstly constructed as θ d g d θ γ d here the nonparametric kernel estimator is recommended since the distribution for the resampled particles can hardly be quantified through some parametric models e g normal distribution the joint probability distribution for the parameter vector θ θ 1 θ 2 θd can be established through a vine copula model as follows 15 c 1 d u η j 1 d 1 i 1 d j c i i j i 1 i j 1 f u i u i 1 u i j 1 f u i j u i 1 u i j 1 η 16 u d g d θ d t r e s a m p γ d the new sample set based on the copula model can then be generated through two steps firstly the sample set u i c u 1 i c u d i c i 1 2 ns can be produced through simulation of the copula model denoted in eq 15 there are several algorithms to generate samples from a multivariate copula model aas et al 2009 such a process can also be implemented based on the r package cdvine brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 secondly the new samples for the original model parameters θd t d 1 2 d can be generated through their inverse probability functions 17 θ d t i c g d 1 u d i c γ d d 1 2 d a second sample set θ t i g will be generated through the gaussian perturbation scheme expressed as eq 8 the candidate samples can then be obtained by mixing the sample sets of θ t i g and θ t i c θ t i c θ 1 t i c θ d t i c as follows 18 θ t i p r θ t i c 1 r θ t i g where r is a value between 0 1 r 1 means all the samples are generated through the copula model and r 0 indicates the gaussian perturbation scheme is merely employed in this study r 0 5 would be employed the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate parameter samples and generate the posterior distributions for both model parameters and states as expressed by eqs 10 13 the prior weights and parameter samples for the next time step are then characterized by eq 14 fig 1 presents the detailed procedure for the proposed pcmh method there are underlying assumptions for the pcmh method i the parameters in a hydrological model are correlated among each other ii those correlations may not be well quantified through the multivariate gaussian distribution and thus the multivariate copula need to be employed to reflect those interdependence iii outlier samples may be obtained from either the gaussian distribution and the copula model and thus the metropolis acceptance criterion is adopted to eliminate those unacceptable samples particularly for the second assumption the multivariate gaussian distribution used to generate the candidate samples as presented in eq 9 implies that all the posterior distributions for individual parameters would be normally distributed however such an implication may not be valid in the data assimilation process since the posterior samples after assimilating observations may have arbitrary random features consequently the gaussian distribution cannot well quantify parameter posteriors and their interdependence in the data assimilation process there are a great number of copula functions available to quantify complex dependence structures among correlated variables or parameters such as gaussian student t elliptical copula families e g clayton gumbel frank brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 in this study the vine copula model consisting of frank copula will be used in the developed pcmh model due to the two following reasons i the frank copula can reflect both positive and negative interdependence ii the bivariate copula structure is fixed in the vine copula model can accelerate computation since the selection procedure in establishing the vine model is neglected moreover we argue that the vine model with fixed bivariate copulas is acceptable in pchm since metropolis acceptance criterion is included to exclude unacceptable samples from the vine model 3 synthetic case study 3 1 experiment setup the applicability of the pcmh method will be firstly demonstrated through a conceptual model hymod as shown in fig 2 a hymod is a probability distributed model and consists of three components including a pareto distribution for reflecting soil storage capacity a slow flow tank for routing groundwater flow and three identical quick flow tanks for routing surface flow moor 1985 fan et al 2017b five parameters need to be calibrated quantified as listed in table 1 precipitation p mm day and potential evapotranspiration et mm day are the two inputs required by hymod state variables in hymod include storage in the nonlinear tank representing the watershed soil moisture content the three quick flow tank storages representing the temporary short time detentions and the slow flow tank storage subsurface storage moradkhani et al 2005a the experiment is conducted to demonstrate the capability of the pcmh method in quantifying parameter and state uncertainties in hymod the 1 year synthetic streamflow data are generated by hymod with predefined parameters listed in table 1 with the real inputs for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these synthetic streamflow data would be considered as the observations in data assimilation moreover uncertainties in model inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and outputs are characterized by random perturbations for instance consider an input at time t denoted as ut it can be perturbed as u t i u t ξ t i where ξ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate the ith sample member normal distributed errors with standard deviations being 15 of the corresponding measurements will be added to synthetic streamflow and potential evapotranspiration data e g ξ t i n 0 t u and t u γ u t for the forcing data and γ 0 15 while a log normal distributed error with a proportionality factor of 0 15 will be added the precipitation i e ξ t i log n 0 t u and t u γ u t 3 2 evaluation criteria to evaluate the performance of different data assimilation methods the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps will be used in this study which are respectively formulated as follows murphy and winkler 1987 wang et al 2015 wang and wang 2019 19 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 21 crps f f x f o x 2 d x where n is the total number of streamflow measurements or predictions qobs and qsim are streamflow observations and model predictions respectively and q obs is the mean value of observations fo and ff are cumulative distribution functions for observations and model predictions respectively the rmse and nse have been widely employed for evaluating deterministic predictions from a model while crps is a measurement for probabilistic predictions 3 3 results analysis for the synthetic experiment the synthetic experiment is initially conducted by pcmh with a sample size of 50 in addition both pf and pmcmc which have been widely adopted in hydrologic data assimilation have also applied to the synthetic experiment as the benchmark approaches fig 3 presents the sample evolution of model parameters during the data assimilation process by different approaches it can be noticed that all parameters in hymod would be well identified by pcmh with reasonable fluctuation ranges in comparison both pf and pmcmc seems to lead to over convergence for most model parameters however the parameter rs is not identifiable by pf since it generally has significant variation ranges in the data assimilation process via pf this may affect the robustness of pf and pmcmc in long term data assimilation process since the parameters can hardly be evolved within rational spaces however the developed pcmh method can effectively rejuvenate model parameters and mitigate sample impoverishment within larger spaces than those from pf and pmcmc and thus can help provide reliable results even for long term data assimilation processes in the proposed pcmh method the copula functions are employed to quantify interdependence among model parameters and then generate parameter samples under such correlation consideration these samples are mixed with those from gaussian perturbation to generate the candidate parameter particles the above processes imply that the parameter samples in a hydrological model are correlated during their evolution in data assimilation to verify this assumption the parameter correlation at different time steps in data assimilation is presented in fig 4 a it can be observed that as the data assimilation proceeds the five parameters i e cmax bexp α rs rq in hymod would show visible correlation with some of them highly correlated at some time steps also the correlation values among those parameters are varied as the data assimilation process continues which may change from positive correlation to negative correlation fig 4 b presents the probabilities of correlation values among those five parameters in the data assimilation process in which the dashed red lines show the thresholds of 0 1 and 0 1 moreover fig 4 c present the ratios of the parameter correlations larger than 0 1 or smaller than 0 1 over the data assimilation process the results indicate that during the data assimilation process the model parameters would be significantly correlated among each other at most time steps the highest ratio larger than 0 1 or smaller than 0 1 of significant correlation appears between cmax and α with a ratio of about 65 while the lowest ratio of significant parameter correlation is observed between rs and rq but such a ratio can still be more than 48 consequently parameter correlation needs to be considered in the data assimilation process nevertheless the parameter posteriors can hardly be normally distributed after data assimilation fig s1 presents the histograms of parameter posteriors at different time periods the results indicate that the parameter posteriors would be generally skewed distributed which would be unable to be modelled through gaussian and multivariate gaussian distributions consequently it is desired to quantify those parameter correlation by the copula functions during the data assimilation process for the performances of the three data assimilation approaches i e pcmh pf and pmcmc in the synthetic experiment fig 5 show comparisons between predictions of streamflow and two state variables i e xloss and xslow from different approaches with the corresponding true values the results indicate that the predictive means for streamflow from all the three approaches can well track the variations of the synthetic observations moreover the predictive intervals bounded by 5 and 95 quantiles can bracket most observations the pcmh approach may produce relatively larger predictive intervals than those from pf and pmcmc during high flow periods this can be generally attribute to the larger parameter ranges obtained by pcmh as shown in fig 3 for the nonlinear tank storage i e xloss which represents the soil moisture content both the predictive means and 90 predictive intervals agree well with the corresponding true values in the synthetic experiment also pcmh would generate relatively larger predictive intervals due to wider parameter ranges than those from pf and pmcmc for the slow tank storage i e xslow it can be observed that the pcmh performed slightly worse than pf and pmcmc which lead to underestimation for high slow tank storages one possible reason is that the state variable xslow may not be highly correlated with the streamflow rate in the hydrology model i e hymod and thus the accurate streamflow prediction does not necessary lead to accurate quantification for xslow fig 6 compared the prediction accuracy evaluated by nse between the xslow and streamflow in the synthetic experiment in 20 replications it can be seen that the prediction for xslow is most likely unacceptable even though nse value for streamflow predication higher than 0 9 consequently the worse xslow prediction from pcmh as presented in fig 5 may possibly be resulted from the poor correlation between streamflow rate and the state variable in hymod to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed pcmh approach we have run pcmh as well as pf and pmcmc for the synthetic experiment under different sample size scenarios in details sample size scenarios of 20 50 100 200 500 are adopted with each scenario being run 20 times by pcmh pf and pmcmc this means that for one sample size scenario all the three data assimilation approaches would be run independently for 20 times i e generate different particles in different runs the purpose for running multiple times for different approaches is to evaluate the robustness for those methods in uncertainty quantification the boxplots in fig 7 exhibit the performance variations of nse rmse and crps for pcmh pf and pmcmc for different runs under different sample sizes in this figure the x axis indicates the sample scenarios whilst the y axis shows the values of nse rmse or crps the indices of nse and rmse evaluate the accuracy for deterministic predictions and thus the mean prediction at each time step i e qsim in eqs 19 and 20 would be adopted to calculate these two indices in comparison the crps reflects the accuracy in probabilistic predictions therefore the ensemble predictions in each time step would be used to calculate ff and the perturbed observations are employed to generate the value of fo based on the above procedures each run would generate one set values for nse rmse and crps and 20 sets would then be obtained for each sample scenario the boxplot is adopted to display the minimum maximum median first and third quantiles for the 20 values for each index based on the results in fig 6 we can conclude that the performances of pcmh show less variation than pf and pmcmc under small sample sizes moreover table s1 presents the performances of the three data assimilation approaches evaluated by nse rmse and crps under different sample sizes the results suggest that for large sample size scenarios such as 200 and 500 all the methods performed quite well with high nse values and low rmse and crps values these performances would not vary significantly for different runs for small sample size scenarios such as 20 and 50 pf and pmcmc can generate accurate results with nse larger than 0 95 but they may also produce unacceptable results with nse values less than 0 5 in comparison the developed pcmh method can produce reliable predictions even for small sample sizes for instance nse values for pcmh range from 0 779 to 0 976 for different runs under the sample size of 20 while the nse values for pf and pmcmc vary within 0 276 0 997 and 0 400 0 994 respectively this demonstrates that the proposed pcmh method shows more robustness than pf and pmcmc especially for small sample size scenarios moreover it is visible from fig 7 and table s1 that the performance of pcmh may be slightly worse than pf and pmcmc for some larger sample scenarios the performance of pcmh is affected by different factors such as the copula function in the vine model as well as the mixing rate i e r in eq 18 we initially used the frank copula in the vine model to quantify the interdependence among model parameters and set r 0 5 to mix the samples from copula and gaussian perturbation such a setting may not lead to the better predictions from pcmh consequently the pcmh with different settings on copula structure and sample mixing rate would be further tested and compared with pf and pmcmc to explore the impacts of these two factors in detail for the copula structure the pcmh can use i fixed copula functions in the vine model e g frank copula or ii the best copula function selected through the akaike information criterion the mixing rate r in eq 18 would be specified as i r 0 5 for the whole data assimilation process or ii r 0 5 when all correlation coefficients among parameters are larger than 0 05 and otherwise r 0 05 figs s2 s4 exhibit the performances of pcmh under different settings and their comparisons with the results from pf and pmcmc it is visible that the pcmh can produce better streamflow predictions than those from pf and pmcmc with small sample size scenarios as the sample size increases the pcmh with copula selection but a fixed mixing rate as shown in fig s3 may not perform as good as pf and pmcmc however the pcmh with varied sample mixing rate i e r 0 05 or 0 5 can generated comparable predictions with those from pf and pmcmc for large sample sizes as presented in figs s2 and s4 this also implies that the copula structure in the vine model may not have a significant effect on the performance of pcmh therefore the fixed copula function e g frank is recommended in the vine model to quantify parameter interdependence in the data assimilation process 4 real case study 4 1 overview of the catchment the applicability of pcmh would be further demonstrated through a long term data assimilation problem at the river ouse the river ouse is located in north youksire which as a mainstream length of 208 km making it the sixth longest river of the united kingdom and the longest to flow entirely in one county fig 8 shows the location of the river ouse the river ouse flows from northwest to southeast with the altitude ranging from 5 6 m to 714 3 m the catchment is mostly covered by grassland 43 92 and arable horticultural crops 31 34 with some parts covered by mountain heath and bog plants as well as woodland this catchment has mixed geological structures mainly consisting of moderate permeability bedrocks and mixed permeability superficial deposits as well as highly permeable bedrocks in lower reaches the streamflow records from 1997 to 2006 at the gauge station in skelton are adopted in this study the associated precipitation data are also obtained from the national river flow archive https nrfa ceh ac uk and the potential evapotranspiration data are obtained through averaging the historic gridded potential evapotranspiration developed by tanguy et al 2017 4 2 hydrologic models in addition to the hymod used in the synthetic experiment two more hydrologic models gr4j and ihacres will also be employed to comprehensively demonstrate the applicability of the developed pcmh method the gr4j model is a lumped hydrologic model with four parameters and can be run in daily scale the structure of gr4j is shown in fig 2 b in which it consists of an interception reservoir is employed to intercept rainfall and potential evapotranspiration a soil moisture accounting procedure is adopted to generate effective rainfall and a water exchange term used to model water losses to or gains from deep aquifers the gr4j model also has a routing module including two flow components with constant volumetric split 10 90 two unit hydrographs and a non linear routing store as shown in fig 2 b more details about gr4j can be found in some literates e g perrin et al 2003 westra et al 2014 smith et al n d the ihacres model jakeman et al 1990 jakeman and hornberger 1993 is another conceptual rainfall runoff model to be employed in this study it typically has unknow parameters ranging between 5 and 7 parameters the ihacres model has many versions developed by a number of studies e g viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 shin et al 2013 shin et al 2015 in this study the catchment moisture deficit cmd version developed by croke and jakeman 2004 as it has been recognized to have more physical meaning for the parameters shin and kim 2017 as shown in fig 2 c the cmd based ihacres model is composed of two modules in which a nonlinear module is adopted to generate effective rainfall as well as the cmd output and the linear module is employed to translate effective rainfall into streamflow by routing it through two parallel linear stores based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph theory croke and jakeman 2007 table 2 presents the model parameters in gr4j and ihacres there are four unknow model parameters defined as x 1 x 4 in gr4j model there are also other modified versions of gr4j with five and six parameters i e gr5j and gr6j but the four parameter model i e gr4j will be adopted in this study the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with a daily scale will be used as the inputs for gr4j the ihacres model would have different parameters for different versions in current study six parameters will need to be estimated for the cmd based ihacres model as presented in table 2 the ihacres model can be run based on different inputs such as precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration similar with gr4j and hymod the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will be adopted to force the ihacres model 4 3 results analysis for the real case study the developed pcmh method as well as pf and pmcmc are employed to quantify uncertainties in the hydrologic models of hymod gr4j and ihacres on streamflow predictions for the river ouse a proportional factor of 0 15 is adopted for the random errors to be added to inputs and outputs to reflect their inherent uncertainties in which the normal distributed errors are used for potential evapotranspiration and streamflow whilst the log normal distributed error is used for precipitation moreover a total number of 10 year data 1997 2006 are employed to demonstrate the applicability of pcmh in hydrological data assimilation processes all the three data assimilation methods are run with a sample size of 100 fig s5 presents the flowchart for the real case experiment fig 9 exhibits the comparison between observations and predictions from different hydrologic models quantified by different data assimilation techniques in which the solid lines indicate the mean prediction at each time step from data assimilation and the cyan region shows the corresponding 90 predictive interval bounded by the by the 5 and 95 quantiles of the streamflow prediction samples the first column shows the performances of pcmh pf and pmcmc on the hymod the results indicate that the predictive means from pcmh can well track the variations of real streamflow records while in comparison both pf and pmcmc have led to underestimation for many high flow records moreover the 90 predictive intervals from pcmh can well bracket the real observations even though large predictive intervals can be observed at some high flow periods similar with the deterministic predictions pf and pmcmc also generate underestimation for probabilistic predictions at high flow periods which cannot cover the corresponding observations for the gr4j model predictions from both pcmh and pf agree well with most observations except overestimations from high flows but pcmh seems to produce slightly higher overestimations than pf however the pmcmc method would produce underestimation for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions at many high flow periods which is similar with results from hymod for the ihacres model as shown in the last column of fig 9 it can be observed that all the three approaches perform well without noticeable discrepancy between predictions and observations also the 90 predictive intervals from pcmh pf and pmcmc would well bracket the corresponding observations in general the developed pcmh method performed well on all the three hydrologic models while the pf method produced underestimations for hymod at some high flow periods and pmcmc also generated underestimations for hymod and ihacres at some high flow periods this can demonstrate the robustness of the developed pcmh method on applications to different hydrologic models to further demonstrate the reliability of pcmh we have run pcmh pf and pmcmc for different hydrological models with different input and output uncertainties as well as different sample sizes in detail a total number of 9 scenarios as presented in table 3 have been designed with different uncertainties in model inputs outputs and sample sizes moreover 10 runs will be conducted for each scenario to reveal the robustness of pcmh pf and pmcmc the boxplot shown in fig 10 exhibit the variations of nse coefficients for pcmh pf and pmcmc on different models under different uncertainty scenarios here the nse value is generated by comparing the mean predictions and observations through equation 20 under each scenario 10 runs were performed for a data assimilation i e pchm pf or pmcmc method on a hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres and thus 10 nse values would be correspondingly obtained it can be concluded that the pcmh would generate reliable predictions with acceptable variations even for the ihacres model with small sample sizes e g scenario 1 4 and 7 in comparison both pf and pmcmc show remarkable variations for their performances on all the three hydrological models especially under small sample size scenarios table s2 presents the performances of pcmh pf and pmcmc on deterministic predictions evaluated by the nse coefficient for different hydrologic models under different running scenarios for one specific uncertainty scenario the pcmh can produce acceptable predictions even for multiple replicates indicating the reliability of the pcmh method as presented in table s2 the worst case of pcmh occurred for the scenarios of 0 15 0 15 0 15 50 nevertheless the predictions from pcmh are still satisfactory with the nse coefficient ranging between 0 534 and 0 781 in comparison the pf and pmcmc would have chances to generate unacceptable predictions with the nse coefficient being as low as around 0 3 moreover the proposed pcmh approach seems not to be influenced remarkably by uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes with the nse coefficient varying within 0 72 0 80 for hymod 0 70 0 87 for gr4j and 0 53 0 79 for ihacres in comparison the performances of pf and pmcmc would vary significantly for different uncertainty scenarios even though they may produce better results e g an nse coefficient larger than 0 82 for pmcmc on hymod than pcmh their performances are not as robust as pcmh and they may also generate unacceptable predictions with the nse coefficient as low as 0 2 for some cases these conclusions are consistent with the results in fig 10 fig 11 and table s3 show the performances evaluated by rmse of pcmh pf and pmcmc on different hydrologic models under different uncertainty scenarios here the rmse values for gr4j are significantly smaller than those for hymod and ihacres this is because that the outputs of gr4j are denoted as streamflow depth in mm where the outputs from hymod and ihacres are expressed as streamflow volume in m3 s we can observe low rmse values with small variations for pcmh especially on the hydrologic models of hymod and gr4j in comparison the performances of pf and pmcmc would vary remarkably which may lead to inaccurate predictions even for a small size of 200 in addition to deterministic predictions one of the attractive advantages for pcmh pf and pmcmc is that they can also produce probabilistic predictions which can be adapted for future risk inferences the probabilistic predictions from the three data assimilation methods on different hydrologic models are evaluated by crps expressed as eq 21 table s4 and fig 12 exhibit the performance variations of pcmh pf and pmcmc for probabilistic predictions through different hydrologic models similar with rmse values the crps values from gr4j model is not comparable with those from hymod and ihacres since the outputs from gr4j are denoted as streamflow depth in mm from table s4 and fig 9 we can observe the robustness of pcmh on different hydrologic models for generating probabilistic predictions under different uncertainty scenarios in detail the crps values ranged between 11 2 and 13 5 for pcmh on hymod between 0 22 and 0 37 for gr4j and between 16 6 and 31 6 for ihacres there are large discrepancies between the crps values from gr4j and those from hymod and ihacres this is because that the crps from gr4j is calculated based on the streamflow depth whilst this index for the other two models is generated based on streamflow rate in comparison as presented in fig 12 even though pf and pmcmc can produce reliable probabilistic predictions through gr4j model under some uncertainty scenarios e g scenarios 6 to 9 for pmcmc and scenarios 3 5 6 8 9 for pf they would have much more chances to generate discrepant results than pcmh to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed pcmh method a total number of nine scenarios have been designed with each running 10 times through three hydrologic models i e hymod gr4j ihacres consequently we have run 270 replicates for pcmh as well as pf and pmcmc fig 13 exhibits the performance variations for all the replicates evaluated by nse coefficient rmse and crps here the rmse and crps values for gr4j evaluated in streamflow depth as shown in tables s3 and s4 and figs 11 and 12 are converted into streamflow rate in order to make them comparable with those from hymod and ihacres the results indicate that the proposed pcmh approach would lead to sharp distributions for its performance variations while in comparison the pf and pmcmc methods would have much flatter distributions in detail the mean values and the associated variation intervals of nse over the total 270 runs for pcmh pf and pmcmc are 0 752 with a variation interval of 0 534 0 866 0 661 with a variation interval of 0 080 0 879 and 0 655 with a variation interval of 0 247 0 824 respectively similarly for the probabilistic predictions the mean values and fluctuation ranges from pcmh pf and pmcmc are respectively 15 215 8 624 31 549 18 758 8 595 43 536 19 308 10 848 37 799 these results suggest that the proposed pcmh method is more robust than pf and pmcmc in generating reliable hydrologic predictions and seems to be influenced less by the hydrologic models to be used uncertainty scenarios and its inherent replicates 5 discussion in the proposed pcmh method the new particles for model parameters are evolved through a mixed sampling scheme consisting of both gaussian perturbation i e eq 9 and copula sampling i e eqs 15 to 17 methods the vine copula approach is introduced into pcmh to reflect parameter interdependence among model parameters and the gaussian perturbation approach aims to enhance the chosen chances for the particles around posterior samples the proposed pcmh method can rejuvenate model parameters in wider spaces than those of pf and pmcmc and effectively alleviate the sample impoverishment especially in long term data assimilation processes the coppf method proposed by fan et al 2017b has already introduced copula based sample scheme into data assimilation through particle filter however the proposed pcmh is significantly different from coppf in pcmh the candidate samples are generated by mixing the samples from gaussian perturbation i e eq 9 and vine copula i e eqs 15 to 17 methods and the metropolis acceptance ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples such a scheme can i balances possible extreme samples from the vine copula method and ii remove unacceptable samples through the metropolis ratio in comparison all new sample would be from either the copula method or the gaussian perturbation method in coppf which suggests extreme samples from the outlier of the copula model even though not too many may exist in parameter evolution especially for large sample sizes table 4 present the performances of pcmh and coppf through hymod with a proportional factor of 0 15 for reflecting uncertainties in model inputs and outputs and sample sizes of 50 100 and 200 moreover 10 replicates have been conducted for coppf to make the results comparable with those from pcmh the results indicate that the coppf is also able to generate reliable predictions under different sample size scenarios however compared with pcmh the coppf performed slightly worse in both deterministic and probabilistic predictions moreover the coppf seems to be less robust than pcmh especially under large sample size scenarios for instance the nse values from coppf range between 0 740 and 0 804 for a sample size of 50 and between 0 671 and 0 789 for a sample size of 200 while in comparison the proposed pcmh in this study would bring nse values respectively ranging within 0 768 0 782 and 0 775 0 801 this is mainly because that the coppf would have more chances to involve abnormal or extreme samples generated by the copula sampling scheme expressed by eqs 15 to 17 and also it does not have a mechanism remove those abnormal samples 6 conclusions in this study a particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh approach has been proposed to provide reliable predictions in hydrological data assimilation the proposed pcmh approach can improve the hydrological data assimilation process through a mixed sample evolution scheme consisting of gaussian evolution expressed by eq 8 and copula based evolution schemes the metropolis ratio is then employed to determine the acceptance of the candidate samples the developed pcmh method is able to rejuvenate model parameters in wider spaces than those of pf and pmcmc and effectively alleviate the sample impoverishment especially in long term data assimilation processes the applicability of the pcmh approach was comprehensively demonstrated at the river ouse in uk through three hydrological models and different uncertainty settings in inputs outputs and sample sizes a total number of nine scenarios consisting of different uncertainty settings in model inputs outputs and sample sizes are designed with each scenario being replicating for 10 times for each hydrological model the obtained results indicate that the pcmh approach can generally generate reliable predictions for all hydrological models with the nse values larger than 0 53 for all 270 runs particularly the pcmh method shows more robustness than traditional pf and pcmcm methods which can produce better nse rmse and crps values with narrower fluctuation ranges than those from pf and pmcmc moreover compared with the coppf approach the developed pcmh method can bring more robust results especially under large sample size scenarios this is mainly due to the capabilities of pcmh in balancing possible extreme samples from the copula sampling procedure by the mixed evolution scheme and also removing unacceptable samples through the metropolis ratio method this study has demonstrated that the proposed pcmh approach can generate more reliable predictions in hydrological data assimilation even though only the conceptual models have been tested for the pcmh method this method can also be applicable for complex hydrological or land surface models however one challenge for the application of pchm is that when a large number of parameters are included in hydrological or land surface models it may be complex and time consuming to quantify intercedence among those model parameters nevertheless this issue can be resolved through the following ideas i parameter correlation screening is introduced and the vine copula models are built for those highly correlated parameters whilst the others are sampled independently ii the vine copula models are used for the parameters in the same module component or the same grid for complex models and thus different vine copula models will be used to quantify parameter interdependence in different modules or grids moreover it can be observed from the results that even for the same data assimilation method it will produce predictions with different accuracies from different hydrological models under different uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes it is apparent that the predictions from data assimilation would be influenced by various factors such as the hydrological models and da methods to be used as well as uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes however currently it is not clear which factor would pose dominant effects on the predictability of the data assimilation this issue is to be investigated in our companion

the biased variance estimation in traditional multilevel factorial designs and provide more reliable impact characterization for the considered factors the proposed ifda framework is applied to quantitatively reveal the individual and interactive effects of hydrological models data assimilation da methods and uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation the results indicate that the hydrological models da methods and their interactions would have the most dominant effects on hydrological predictions this implies that different hydrological models or da methods would produce significantly distinguishable results when the hydrological model and da method have been specified uncertainties in streamflow observations would more likely have a visible effect on the accuracy of resulting predictions moreover the inherent randomness mainly caused by the monte carlo sampling procedures in data assimilation would also have noticeable effects on the da performances especially when the hydrological model and da method have been pre identified these results suggest that enhancement of hydrological models and data assimilation methods would be the most efficient pathway to generate reliable hydrological predictions keywords hydrological prediction sequential data assimilation factorial design uncertain factors 1 introduction in a hydrologic prediction context model simulations or predictions are subject to various uncertainties stemming from model inputs i e forcing data model structures and model parameters liu et al 2012 sequential data assimilation sda techniques are widely used for explicitly dealing with various uncertainties and for optimally merging observations into uncertain model predictions moradkhani et al 2005a vrugt et al 2005 clark et al 2008 xie and zhang 2013 in sda the state variables and parameters in a hydrologic model can be continuously updated when new measurements are available which can provide probabilistic quantifications for model parameters states as well as the resulting predictions the ensemble kalman filter enkf and particle filter pf are two of the most widely used sequential data assimilation schemes the approaches of enkf pf and their variants have been widely used in hydrologic data assimilation e g moradkhani et al 2005a b parrish et al 2012 pathiraja et al 2016a b fan et al 2015 2017a b for a data assimilation da scheme its performance is generally influenced by a number of factors such as the hydrological model and data assimilation algorithm to be employed uncertainty reflections in inputs and outputs e g streamflow observations as well as other factors a number of studies have been proposed in the past decades to improve hydrological data assimilation through various aspects for instance advanced data assimilation approaches based on the benchmark methods of enkf and pf have been proposed in order to alleviate the shortcomings in enkf and pf some of these approaches include the normal score ensemble kalman filter ns enkf method xu and gomez hernandez 2016 partitioned update ensemble kalman filter pu enkf method xie and zhang 2013 particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc method moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 implicit particle filter method chorin and tu 2009 rafiee et al 2013 copula based particle filter coppf method fan et al 2017a and also integrated data assimilation methods shen and tang 2015 fan et al 2017b the results indicate that those advanced data assimilation approaches are able to provide better predictions than traditional enkf and pf methods in some cases in addition to the improvement of data assimilation methods there are also studies to address other impact factors in data assimilation for example xue and zhang 2014 proposed a multimodel data assimilation method by embedding the enkf into the bayesian model averaging framework to account for the uncertainty stemming from the model itself ocio et al 2017 addressed the role of rating curve uncertainty in real time flood forecasting through data assimilation in which they has demonstrated that a standard flow measurement error can still represent a reasonable trade off between complexity and realism when the rating curve is well defined a state dependent model uncertainty estimation method named sdmu was proposed by pathiraja et al 2018 to characterize model uncertainty in data assimilation studies in which an objective data driven approach is adopted to estimate the transition uncertainty in model simulations moreover liu et al 2012 has argued that the optimality of data assimilation depends critically on the reliability of error estimates for the inputs and the model itself as well as the proper consideration of interdependencies and interactions among uncertain model components and or observations nevertheless the extensive test conducted by thiboult and anctil 2015 suggests that the updated state variables and the hyper parameters for reflecting uncertainties in forcing data and outputs should be carefully specified for the optimal implementation of enkf but there is no single and universal optimal enkf implementation for any model amounts of research works from improvement of da methods to better quantification for uncertainties in forcing data and outputs have been proposed in order to enhance the predictability of hydrological data assimilation however the performance of a data assimilation scheme is not only influenced by the individual effects from the hydrological model da approaches and uncertainties in forcing data i e inputs and outputs e g streamflow observations but also shaped by the interactive effects among these factors wang et al 2017 proposed a robust data assimilation system rdas to adopt a multi factorial design to examine the individual and interactive effects of uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes on the performances of enkf the results indicated the pairwise interaction between perturbed precipitation and streamflow observations would have the most significant impact on the performance of the enkf system however such a conclusion is obtained for enkf whilst the impacts from hydrological models and different da methods are not considered the results in our companion paper fan et al 2022 have shown that for the same uncertainty settings in inputs outputs i e streamflow observations and sample size noticeable differences in prediction accuracies can be observed in the results from different da methods over different hydrological models wang et al 2022 developed a disaggregated multi level factorial hydrological data assimilation model to investigate the impacts of enkf and its variants lyu and fan 2021 characterized the impacts of inputs and streamflow observations on different da methods through the multilevel factorial analysis nevertheless the impact from hydrological models is still overlooked moreover the applicability of the multi factorial design adopted in previous studies e g wang et al 2017 lyu and fan 2021 huang and fan 2021 is restricted by its biased variance estimator which would lead to underestimations for the variance especially in small sample sizes bosshard et al 2013 fan et al 2020 2021 di et al 2021 the iterative factorial analysis ifa approach developed by fan et al 2020 2021 is able to diminish the biased variance estimation in traditional multilevel factorial designs through a subsampling decomposition procedure for those factors with multiple levels but the ifa approach has only been applied to investigate the impacts of uncertain factors on multivariate risk inferences for compound extremes such as flood peaks and volumes the applicability of ifa in characterizing the impacts of uncertain factors on hydrological data assimilation has not been demonstrated consequently this research is to propose an iterative factorial data assimilation ifda framework to reveal both the individual and interactive effects of hydrological models da approaches uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the performances of hydrological data assimilation schemes as an extension of our companion study the data assimilation with different uncertainty scenarios will be introduced into ifa method to formulate the ifda framework compared with previous studies e g wang et al 2017 the innovations of this study include i a flexible framework is developed to explicitly quantify the effects for uncertain factors on the performances of data assimilation in which the flexibility indicates ifda is able to analyze different numbers of factors with different levels ii the ifa method in the ifda framework can generate more reliable quantification for the effects of uncertain factors on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation this research can also demonstrate the extensive application potentials of the ifa method developed by fan et al 2020 2021 for different hydrological problems the applicability of ifda framework will be demonstrated at the river ouse in uk the obtained results can help reveal the dominant impact factors for hydrological data assimilation and further identify the most efficient pathway to enhance the predictability of data assimilation 2 methodology 2 1 uncertainties in hydrological data assimilation sequential data assimilation approaches have been widely employed for real time streamflow forecasting consider a generic hydrological model consisting of functions for state transition i e g and observational operator i e h as follows 1 x t g x t 1 u t θ t ω t 2 y t h x t θ t v t extensive uncertainties exist in the data assimilation process for the above modelling system these uncertainties may be embedded in various components such as model structural uncertainty i e g and h in equations 1 and 2 uncertainties in the forcing data i e u in equation 1 different data assimilation methods and uncertainty in streamflow to be assimilated these uncertainties may pose significant impacts on the resulting hydrological predictions 1 model structural uncertainty a hydrological model is developed through a series of mathematical equations to represent the water processes in a catchment there are uncertainties in the development of hydrological models since the proposed equations are generally simplified representations of real processes different model developers would employ different equations or mechanisms to describe different components in the rainfall runoff process of a catchment a typical example is that there are two major categories of hydrologic models physical based distributed models and lumped conceptual models the physical based distributed models divide a catchment into grid cells at fine resolution and assimilate different terrain data and precipitation to different cells chen et al 2016 in comparison the lumped conceptual models would use the same value of parameters for the whole watershed ignore the spatial variability and provide catchment runoff results in a spatially averaged way tran et al 2018 jaiswal et al 2020 hu et al 2021 furthermore there are also extensive uncertainties even for the same category of hydrological models for instance the hymod proposed by moor 2007 employs three identical quick flow tanks to route surface flow while the ihacres model proposed by jakeman et al 1990 uses a linear module consisting of two parallel linear stores to translate effective rainfall into streamflow therefore the hymod and ihacres as described in our companion paper fan et al 2022 applied different mechanisms to model the rainfall runoff process this implies that for the same dataset at one catchment different models would produce distinguishable predictions due to the structural uncertainty in hydrological models 2 data assimilation methods sequential data assimilation sda approaches have been widely used to quantify uncertainties for parameters and state variables for a hydrological model and provide probabilistic predictions similar to the hydrologic model development different sda approaches are distinguishable among each other for instance the traditional particle filter pf method moradkhani et al 2005b generally employs a stochastic perturbation technique to evolve model parameters to the next step improving upon the pf method the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc moradkhani et al 2012 use the metropolis acceptance ratio mechanism to determine the acceptance of the proposed parameter candidate generated by the stochastic perturbation algorithm moreover the particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh method developed in the companion paper fan et al 2022 adopts a mixed evolution algorithm consisting of a copula sampling and stochastic perturbation schemes to generate the proposed parameter candidates and then uses the metropolis acceptance ratio mechanism to determine their acceptance also as demonstrated in the companion paper fan et al 2022 different sda approaches may have different performances on uncertainty quantification for hydrologic models and thus produce different streamflow predictions 3 uncertainties in forcing data in hydrological prediction uncertainties embedded in the forcing data i e u t in equation 1 resulting from sampling and measurement errors are one of the major uncertain sources under consideration some approaches have been proposed to reflect uncertainties in the forcing data and the stochastic perturbation method has been widely adopted in hydrological data assimilation e g clark et al 2008 liu et al 2012 fan et al 2015 leach et al 2018 a generic formulation for the stochastic perturbation approach can be formulated as follows 3 u t i u t ξ t i where u t i is the randomized forcing data at time t for sample member i ut is the original forcing data and ξ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate the ith sample member leach et al 2018 for different forcing data different noise distributions would be employed to generate ξ t i in general the gaussian distributed noise is recommended for the forcing data such as temperature and potential evapotranspiration which is formulated as moradkhani et al 2005a fan et al 2017a b leach et al 2018 4 ξ t i ñ 0 t u t u γ u t where γ is the proportional factor for the precipitation which is recognized as the most influential uncertain model input the lognormal distributed noise is recommended by some studies expressed as follows e g leisenring and moradkhani 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 leach et al 2018 5 ξ t i log n 0 t u t u γ u t 4 uncertainties in streamflow observations in additional to the uncertainties existing in the forcing data the random errors in observations is also one of the major uncertain sources need to be well reflected errors in streamflow observations arise from several sources such as errors in river stage measurement and errors in the rating curve used to transform stage to discharge mcmillan et al 2013 some approaches have been proposed to reflect observational uncertainties e g mcmillan et al 2013 ocio et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 the gaussian random error is the most common one and has been adopted in a number of hydrological data assimilation studies e g rakovec et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 leach et al 2018 liu et al 2019 which can be formulated as follows 6 q t i q t v t i v t i ñ 0 η q t where η is the proportional factor for the streamflow 2 2 iterative factorial analysis the hydrological predictions for one catchment would be greatly influenced by various uncertain factors such as the hydrologic models to be used the parameter estimation approaches random errors in forcing data and streamflow observations consequently it is of great importance to characterize both the individual and interactive effects of those uncertain factors on the resulting hydrologic predictions to address this challenge an iterative factorial analysis ifa approach would be proposed to reveal the dominant factors on hydrological predictions the proposed ifa approach improves upon traditional factorial analysis fa method in which a subsampling procedure would be adopted for those multi level factors and generate a series of two level experimental designs the main and interactive effects of the chosen factors are obtained through averaging the main and interactive effects of all the two level experimental designs such a process will be illustrated through a generic example with three factors consider a hydrologic prediction system and its predictability is assumed to be influenced by factors a b and c as follows 7 y f a b c here a b and c are factors to be considered which can be either numeric e g proportional factors in forcing data or streamflow or non numeric e g hydrologic models or data assimilation approaches f is the generic hydrologic prediction system y is the index to evaluate the predictability of the system such as root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps if each factor has m levels a subsampling procedure would be adopted in ifa to decompose the m levels into a total number of m 2 two level pairs expressed as a 2 m 2 matrix as follows 8a g a h a j a a 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a m 2 a m 2 a m 1 a 2 a 3 a m a 3 a 4 a m 1 a m a m 8b g b h b j b b 1 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b m 2 b m

multi level factor in which the column index j 1 m 2 represents one two level pair and h 1 2 shows the two corresponding levels for instance if the factor of da is assigned with three levels with each level representing a da algorithm e g pf pmcmc pcmh these three levels would be decomposed through the subsampling procedure to formulate a 2 3 2 matrix as pf p m c m c pf p c m h pmcmc p c m h moreover the factors a b and c can have different levels which also lead to decomposed two level pair matrices similar to equations 8a 8c the subsampling procedure in equations 8a 8c would result in m 2 m 2 m 2 iterations in ifa with each iteration consisting of a two level factorial design one iteration in ifa is to conduct one two level factorial design formulated by one column from the decomposed matrices for a b and c in the proposed ifa approach each iteration from the subsampling procedure will lead to a two level factorial design according to the anova theory montgomery 2000 the total variability of model 1 denoted as the total sum of the squares sst can be decomposed as follows 9a s s t i s s a i s s b i s s c i s s i i 9b s s i i s s ab i s s ac i s s bc i s s abc i s s e i where i denotes the ith iteration ssa ssb and ssc denote the main effects of factors a b and c respectively ssab ssac ssbc and ssabc present the interactive effects among those three factors and sse shows the effect of errors the values of sst ssa ssb ssc ssab ssac ssbc ssabc and sse in the ith iteration can be obtained as follows fan et al 2020 2021 10a s s t i h c 1 2 h a 1 2 h b 1 2 l 1 n y g

indicates the total iteration in ifa and n m 2 m 2 m 2 since three factors with m levels are under consideration 2 3 iterative factorial data assimilation framework the hydrological predictions are generally influenced by a number of uncertain factors particularly in hydrological data assimilation the resulting predictions would be subject to hydrological models and the da approaches to be used uncertainties in forcing data and outputs e g streamflow observations and other relevant factors such as sample sizes different factors may have different impacts on the accuracy of hydrological predictions in order to comprehensively investigate both the individual and interactive effects of uncertain factors on hydrological data assimilation those uncertain factors would be integrated into the proposed ifa approach which lead to an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework fig 1 presents the framework of the ifda framework in ifda uncertainties in inputs hydrological models streamflow observations da approaches and sample sizes are set to have different levels these levels can be numerical e g uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations and non numerical e g hydrological models and da approaches the detailed procedures of ifda are described as follows step 1 select the uncertain factors under consideration step 2 for one factor with multiple levels i e multiple choices decompose the multiple levels of the factor into two level pairs through equations 8 for instance if three hydrological models assumed as m1 m2 and m3 are considered in ifda the factor of hydrological models would have three levels such a three level factor can be decomposed into three 2 level pairs as m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 3 m 3 similar decomposition matrices can be formulated for other factors under consideration step 3 for each column in the decomposition matrices for all factors formulate the 2 k k is the factors under consideration factorial design matrix in which each row indicates a data assimilation experiment with specified hydrological model da approach sample size and uncertainty representations in forcings and streamflow observations step 4 run all data assimilation experiments listed in the 2 k factorial design matrix moreover each experiment will be run 10 times i e replicates in order to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the monte carlo based data assimilation experiment step 5 generate the total variability i e sst for the evaluation indices i e y in equation 7 of the data assimilation experiment as well as its decomposition components based on equations 9 and 10 step 6 obtain the single and interactive effects of the uncertain factors on the predictability within the 2 k factorial design based on equations 11 step 7 repeat steps 3 6 for all the combinations of the columns in the decomposition matrices and generate the associated individual and interactive effects for the uncertain factors for the generated 2 k factorial designs step 8 generate the overall single and interactive contributions for the studied factors to the predictive variabilities in hydrological prediction system through averaging the corresponding results from all the 2 k factorial designs as expressed in equations 12 3 case study 3 1 experiment setup the proposed ifda framework will be applied for river ouse in uk to explore the major factors on the accuracy and uncertainty of hydrological predictions as a companion paper the ifda framework will be applied to reveal the major impact factors on hydrological data assimilation based on some results from our first paper fan et al 2022 in detail three levels would be considered to reflect the model structural uncertainty in which each level represent one hydrological model and thus three models i e hymod gr4j and ihacres would be adopted in ifda similarly the impact from data assimilation method would be reflected through considering different da algorithms in the ifda framework in this study the factor of da method would also be assigned with three levels consisting of three different da algorithms the particle filter pf method and its two variants i e particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc and particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh would be included in the ifda framework since the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are used in all the three hydrological models the stochastic perturbation approach with different proportional factors i e equations 3 5 will be adopted to reflect the impacts of inputs uncertainties on the hydrological predictions similarly the gaussian perturbation method i e equation 6 with different proportional factor values would be employed to reflect the impact of uncertainty in streamflow observations on the resulting hydrological predictions moreover the pf pmcmc and pcmh methods are all based on monte carlo simulation and the sample sizes will be another factor under consideration in the ifda framework table 1 summarizes all the factors and their levels in the ifda framework the proposed ifda framework is a flexible framework which can be expanded or shrunken based on the factors to be addressed for instance if the proportional factors in model inputs and streamflow observations are merely under consideration the ifda framework can characterize the impacts of uncertainties in model inputs and streamflow observations on the performance of a specific data assimilation method on a specific hydrologic model moreover the ifda can also be employed to reveal whether a da method would produce a noticeable impact on the predictability of a hydrologic model when the sample size da methods and uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations are involved in ifda 3 2 experiment responses in the ifda framework the response denoted as y in equation 7 would be some criteria to evaluate the performances of the chosen hydrologic prediction system subject to specific hydrological model da method as well as uncertainty settings in inputs streamflow observations and sample size as an extension for our companion study in fan et al 2022 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps will be used as the responses in the proposed ifda framework which can be expressed as 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obsi q obs 2 15 crps f f x f o x 2 d x where n is the total number of streamflow measurements or predictions qobs and qsim are streamflow observations and model predictions respectively and q obs is the mean value of observations fo and ff are cumulative distribution functions for observations and model predictions respectively in this study the mean prediction at each time step i e qsim in equations 13 and 14 would be adopted to calculate nse and rmse in comparison the ensemble predictions in each time step would be used to calculate ff and the perturbed observations are employed to generate the value of fo 4 results analysis the proposed ifda framework is employed to characterize both the individual and interactive effects of various uncertain factors on the accuracy of hydrological predictions in detail there are six factors in total to be examined in the ifda framework as presented in table 1 with each factor having 3 levels for the factor of hydrological model each level represents a specific hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres whilst each level for the factor of data assimilation method represents a specific da algorithm i e pf pmcmc or pcmh the six factors with 3 different levels will lead to 729 i e 36 combinations of hydrologic data assimilation schemes each data assimilation scheme will consist of a specific hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres da approach i e pf pmcmc or pcmh sample size i e 50 100 or 200 and proportional factor value respectively for precipitation i e γ in equation 5 potential evapotranspiration i e γ in equation 4 and streamflow observations i e η in equation 6 moreover 10 runs will be performed for each data assimilation scheme which means that a specified da scheme would be repeated for 10 times the purpose for repeating is to reveal the inherent uncertainty in those monte carlo based data assimilation approaches consequently we would have a total number of 7290 runs in the ifda framework the computational burden is relatively high in this case since 10 replicates are used however the total number of runs in ifa is the same as the traditional multi level factorial analysis mfa method and thus ifa would not increase computational requirement compared with the mfa method nevertheless this computation requirement would be still less than some other global sensitivity analysis methods such as sobol s method as demonstrated in wang et al 2020 moreover the replicates can be reduced to mitigate the computation requirement in ifa e g 1458 runs are required if 2 replicates are adopted in addition one of the most significant merits of ifa is that it can deal with both discrete and continuous factors and get comparable results with some benchmark methods like sobol s method wang et al 2020 fig 2 presents the performance variation for different data assimilation schemes in the proposed ifda framework it indicates that for different data assimilation schemes with different hydrological models data assimilation techniques as well as uncertainties in inputs and outputs their performances would generally vary significantly in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic predictions as for the 7290 runs within the ifda framework they will lead to mean values for nse rmse and crps respectively being 0 69 34 06 17 63 nevertheless the 90 variation intervals bounded by the 5 and 95 quantiles for nse rmse and crps would be 0 45 0 84 25 24 45 05 and 9 93 28 80 presenting significant changes for different data assimilation schemes these changes may be subject to several factors such as the choice of hydrological models and data assimilation techniques uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations and also the inherent randomness in the monte carlo based data assimilation methods in ifda framework consequently it is desired to further characterize the dominant factors that influence the performances of different data assimilation schemes 4 1 impacts of uncertainties in inputs observations and sample sizes the impacts of uncertainties in inputs observations and sample sizes for different sequential data assimilation techniques over different hydrological models are firstly characterized through the proposed ifda framework in detail the proportional factors are set to be 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 for the potential evapotranspiration i e c precipitation i e d and streamflow observations i e e to reflect their uncertainties three sample scenarios i e f of 50 100 and 200 are adopted to reflect the uncertainty in sample size in data assimilation process since pf pmcmc and pcmh employed in ifda are random in nature 10 replicates would be performed for each da scheme with specific uncertainty setting for inputs streamflow observation and sample size fig 3 exhibits the contributions of the factors c d e and f to the variations of deterministic predictions from different da approaches on different hydrologic models it is apparent that the uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes pose different impacts on the deterministic predictability of different da approaches on different hydrological models in detail for the pf approach the inherent uncertainty denoted as residual in fig 3 would have the dominant effect on its predictability on hymod and ihacres whilst the uncertainty in streamflow observation will have a major effect on the deterministic predictability from pf on gr4j this suggest that more accurate quantification for inputs and streamflow observations and larger sample sizes may hardly lead to better performances for pf on hymod and ihacres nevertheless the performance of pf on gr4j can be enhanced through better uncertainty reflection in streamflow observations for the pmcmc approach it can be observed that its performances for deterministic predictions are mainly subject to its inherent randomness which can have contributions of 82 5 60 8 and 85 2 respectively to the variations of nse for hymod gr4j and ihacres however uncertainties in streamflow observation and sample sizes would have apparent impacts 15 8 and 14 5 respectively on the predictability of pmcmc on the gr4j model compared with pmcmc and pf the performances of pcmh would be less impacted by its inherent uncertainties for instance the uncertainty in streamflow observations poses a most dominant impact on the predictions of pcmh on hymod and gr4j even for ihacres the sample size i e f also has a visible impact 7 98 on the performance of pcmh the contributions of these four factors to variations of rmse show a similar pattern with the results to the nse fluctuations which is presented in figure s1 in addition to the deterministic predictions the probabilistic predictions from different da approaches on different models may also be influenced by uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample sizes i e f fig 4 presents the contributions of those four factors to the variations of crps for different da approaches on different hydrological models it indicates that the impacts of those four uncertainty factors on the probabilistic predictions would have some similar features with their impacts on deterministic predictions the inherent randomness of pf pmcmc and pcmh would have a most dominant effect on the probabilistic predictions from ihacres with a contribution of 78 for pcmh and more than 80 for pf and pmcmc for the hymod even though the inherent randomness would also have noticeable effects on all the three da approaches uncertainties in precipitation i e d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f would pose more impacts as the da approach changes from pf to pcmh the impacts of these three factors i e d e f on probabilistic predictions of hymod are different from their impacts on the deterministic results especially for the pcmh approach where the factors of d and f would have large effects i e 18 8 and 7 7 on the probabilistic predictions whilst the factor e has a much less effect i e 15 4 for the gr4j model uncertainty in streamflow observations would have a major effect on the probabilistic predictions from pf and pcmh with its contribution to pcmh as high as 86 6 moreover this factor as well as the sample size would also have visible effects on the pmcmc approach with their contributions being 33 7 and 17 6 respectively such an impact pattern is similar with the results for deterministic predictions of gr4j for the uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f their impacts on data assimilation would be different for different da approaches on different hydrological models however we can generally conclude that regardless of the inherent randomness of the da approaches the uncertainty in streamflow observations seems to more likely pose a significant impact on the data assimilation process moreover for da approaches the pcmh approach would be less influenced by its inherent randomness this is because the contributions of pcmh randomness over the three hydrological models as shown in fig 4 are always less than the corresponding contributions for the other two da methods this indicates that the pcmh is more robust than pf and pmcmc which has been elaborated in our companion paper the performance of pcmh is more easily enhanced through better quantification for uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample size 4 2 impacts of uncertainties in da approaches inputs observations and sample sizes in general different data assimilation approaches would generate different prediction results even for the same uncertainty settings in inputs streamflow observations and sample size which has been demonstrated in a number of studies however it is not well elaborated how much the da method can contribute to the improvement of the hydrological data assimilation process in current study different da approaches i e b including pf pmcmc and pcmh as well as uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f are integrated within the proposed ifda framework to explore their contributions to variations in both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from hydrological data assimilation process fig 5 presents the impacts of b c d e and f on the variations of deterministic predictions from different hydrological models the randomness of the da approaches would pose remarkable or even dominant impacts on the performances of the three hydrological models however it is noticeable that factor b i e da approaches would also have significant impacts on the deterministic predictions from all the three hydrological models with its contributions being 31 9 33 2 and 17 2 respectively for hymod gr4j and ihacres for the factors of c d e and f their impacts in such a circumstance are significantly different from their contributions when the factor of da methods is not involved the uncertainty in streamflow observation would have a visible effect on the gr4j model with its contribution less than the contribution of factor b moreover the interaction of da methods b and sample size f also has an explicit effect on the performance of gr4j model for the deterministic predictions evaluated by rmse the impacts of b c d e and f as presented in figure s2 show similar features with their impacts on the variation of nse in spite of the inherent randomness the da approaches would pose the most significant impacts on the performances of all the three hydrological models larger than other individual or interactive effects for the probabilistic predictions evaluated by crps those five factors would have similar impacts on the hymod and gr4j with their corresponding effects on the deterministic prediction nevertheless as presented in fig 6 the da methods i e b would contribute more to the probabilistic predictions than the deterministic predictions the factor of da methods would make a contribution of 44 and 37 3 to the variation of crps from hymod and gr4j respectively higher than its contribution to nse in fig 5 and rmse in figure s2 variations however the probabilistic predictions from ihacres seem to be dominated by the inherent randomness of the da approaches with only a small visible effect from the sample size i e f in fact the mean crps values from pcmh pf and pmcmc on the ihacres model over all uncertainty combinations 810 runs for each da approach for inputs streamflow observations and sample size are 21 5 23 2 and 23 0 presenting an indistinguishable difference among each other when the impact of the da approaches is under consideration the results from the ifda framework indicate that the da approach would generally have more contributions to both the deterministic and probabilistic predictions than other factors such an effect is remarkably obvious for the hymod and gr4j models these results suggest the significance of developing advanced data assimilation approaches which can very probably lead to better predictions for the hydrological data assimilation process moreover uncertainty in streamflow observations would be another factor to be considered which can have significant effects on predictions from some hydrological models 4 3 impacts of uncertainties in hydrological models da approaches inputs observations and sample sizes the predictions from hydrological data assimilation are generally affected by various factors such as the hydrological model and da technique to be adopted uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes moreover the inherence randomness in some monte carlo based da methods may also have significant effects on the resulting predictions all these factors are integrated into the proposed ifda framework to quantitatively reveal their individual and interactive effects on the predictions from hydrological data assimilation fig 7 presents the individual and interactive effects of all the six factors i e a f on the deterministic predictions from hydrological data assimilation the results indicate that even though the inherent randomness i e residuals in fig 7 has the most significant effect on the deterministic predictions the hydrological models i e a da methods i e b and their interactions also make noticeable contributions to the deterministic predictability of the hydrological data assimilation schemes as presented in fig 7 the contributions of a b and ab would be 14 8 16 4 and 9 5 respectively which are much higher than the individual and interactive effects from other factors for the predictions evaluated by rmse the effects of all the six factors as shown in figure s3 are quite similar with their effects on the nse variation since both nse and rmse reflect the accuracy of deterministic predictions in comparison for the probabilistic predictions the individual and interactive effects of factors a f are different from their impacts on the deterministic predictions here the mean predictions are adopted evaluated by nse and rmse as presented in fig 8 the hydrological model i e a would have a much higher effect 31 3 on the variation of crps than its effect 14 8 on the nse variation conversely the impact of the da methods i e b and its interaction with hydrological models would have less effects 13 2 for b and 8 5 for ab on the probabilistic predictions moreover the inherent randomness of the da scheme would pose less effect on the probabilistic predictions than the deterministic predictions when uncertainties in hydrological models da methods inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes in a data assimilation process are under consideration the results indicate that the hydrological models and da approaches would have more significant effects than other factors on the resulting predictions this would conclude an implication that we would be able to expect better predictions in data assimilation through choosing an appropriate hydrological model and advanced da method moreover the inherent randomness in the data assimilation process also has noticeable effects on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions the robustness of the da approach would be another factor to be addressed to enhance the predictability of the hydrological data assimilation process 5 discussion 5 1 impact variations for da methods and hydrological models in the proposed ifda framework a number of two level factorial designs would be generated based on those uncertain factors with multiple levels for different two level factorial designs the factor levels for a specific factor e g hydrological models da methods may be different which would further lead to different impact characterizations for this factor fig 9 presents the contribution variations of hydrologic models and da methods for different hydrologic data assimilation schemes obtained by the two level factorial designs within the ifda framework it can be observed that when different levels are applied to one factor the resulting impact on the data assimilation would vary significantly as presented in fig 9 the contribution of hydrologic model to deterministic prediction remarkably ranges within 0 0 5 with most values located within 0 0 25 similarly the da approach would have an effect significantly ranging within 0 0 5 on hydrological data assimilation compared with hydrological model a large part of the contributions of da method are located within 0 25 0 5 which lead to a higher average contribution of da method i e 16 4 in fig 7 than that for hydrological model i e 14 8 in fig 7 moreover for the probabilistic predictions the contributions of hydrological model and da method would also vary significantly for different levels under consideration as shown in fig 9 however the contribution variations of these two factors for probabilistic predictions are not consistent with the variations for deterministic predictions most contributions of hydrological model are larger than 0 25 which also leads to a higher contribution in average than that for da methods 5 2 comparison with traditional multi level factorial analysis in the proposed ifda framework six factors with each one having three levels are addressed to reveal their impacts on the predictability of hydrological data assimilation their individual and interactive effects can also be characterized by a three level i e 36 factorial design figures s4 s7 shows the main effects and their interactions of these six factors on both deterministic evaluated by nse and probabilistic evaluated by crps predictions significant effects can be observed for hydrological model da approach and their interactions on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions which have also been characterized by the developed ifda framework nevertheless for the detailed contributions for each factor and their interactions the values from the three level factorial design are visibly different from those obtained by the ifda framework as presented in fig 10 the three level factorial design would provide an overestimation for the contribution of hydrological models and underestimations for the main effects of other factors it is noticed that the contribution characterizations from three level factorial design may also lead to a different rank for these factors it is concluded from the three level factorial design that the hydrological models would have the most significant effect on the deterministic predictions while based on the proposed ifda framework the contribution 16 4 of da methods is apparently higher than the contribution 14 8 of hydrological models moreover the three level factorial design also provides an overestimation for the interactive effect of hydrological models and da approaches these discrepancies may due to the biased estimations for the total sum of the squares and its components as presented in equations 9 and 10 5 3 impacts of uncertain factors for data assimilation with calibrated models the above analyses for factor contributions to the predictability of hydrological data assimilation are based on the results from the dual state parameter estimation framework in which both model parameters and state variables are quantified simultaneously however another possible pathway for hydrological data assimilation is to quantify the uncertainty in state variables with calibrated model parameters in this case the model parameters would be calibrated before starting the data assimilation process and thus probabilistic uncertainties would be obtained only for the state variables and predictions consequently the impacts of uncertain factors may have different patterns with those in the dual state parameter estimation framework nevertheless the proposed ifda framework can also be applied to reveal the impacts of different factors on hydrological data assimilation with calibrated models in such a case the 10 year dataset at the river ouse in uk described in our companion paper fan et al 2022 has been splitted into two parts with the first 5 year data for parameter calibration and the latter 5 year data for data assimilation since the model parameters are not estimated in data assimilation and thus only the pf method is needed for this issue fig 11 presents the individual and interactive effects of uncertainties inputs i e c for potential evapotranspiration d for precipitation observations i e e and sample sizes i e f on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation it is noticeable that compared with the results in dual state parameter estimation framework presented in figs 3 and 4 the inherent randomness in pf i e residuals in fig 11 would be more controllable especially for the probabilistic predictions for instance the highest contribution from the inherent randomness of the da algorithm would be found for ihacres model in both data assimilation scenarios but the contributions of the randomness would be around 88 for deterministic predictions in fig 3 and 87 for probabilistic predictions in fig 4 in the dual state parameter framework whilst those contributions can be significantly reduced to 29 5 for deterministic predictions i e fig 11 g and 19 1 for probabilistic predictions i e fig 11 i if the calibrated ihacres model is adopted compared with the reduced contributions from pf randomness some factors would have significantly higher impacts on the data assimilation performances for calibrated models but one specific factor may have different effects when different models are adopted in which the uncertainty in precipitation would have the highest impact on data assimilation for hymod and ihacres and the uncertainty in streamflow observations would have the highest contribution for gr4j moreover another interesting promise concluded from fig 11 is that the sample size of pf would not be likely to pose visible impacts on data assimilation for calibrated models this implies that only a small sample size may be required for data assimilation through calibrated hydrological models which can significantly reduce computation burden in the data assimilation process fig 12 a c present the performance variations for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions considering all the three hydrological models and different uncertain scenarios in inputs and streamflow observations it is obvious that the histograms of nse rmse and crps values show three peaks implying a dominant factor to influence the data assimilation process fig 12 d f show the detailed individual and interactive contributions of the uncertain factors to the deterministic and probabilistic predictions of data assimilation it is concluded that the hydrological model would mainly control the performance of data assimilation process whilst impacts from other uncertainties including the inherent randomness of the da algorithm seem to be negligible this indicates that using an appropriate hydrological model with well calibrated parameters would be the most efficient way to improve the data assimilation process 6 conclusions sequential data assimilation sda techniques have been widely used for uncertainty quantification and reduction in hydrologic prediction in a data assimilation scheme its performance is critically influenced by a number of factors such as the hydrological model and data assimilation methods to be used uncertainty representation in inputs streamflow observations and also sample sizes in this study an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework has been developed to characterize both individual and interactive effects of hydrological models da approaches and uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the resulting predictions in detail three hydrological models i e hymod gr4j ihacres three da approaches i e pf pmcmc pcmh and three uncertainty settings for inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes are under consideration in the ifda framework the interactive factorial analysis ifa was then proposed to explore the impacts of these factors on deterministic and probabilistic predictions the proposed ifda framework has been applied to the river ouse in uk some key results can be concluded i when uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes are under consideration they would have discrepant effects on different data assimilation methods over different hydrological models however uncertainties in streamflow observations except the inherent randomness in data assimilation would more likely pose significant impacts on the resulting predictions ii if the choice of data assimilation methods is further considered these factors also pose different impacts on the predictions from different models however the data assimilation methods regardless of the inherent randomness would generally have more impacts than other factors on the predictions iii for uncertainties in hydrological models data assimilation approaches inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes the first two factors i e hydrological models and data assimilation approaches and their interactions would have much more impacts than uncertainties in other factors on the resulting predictions iv in addition to those uncertain factors the inherent randomness mainly caused by the monte carlo sampling process would also have noticeable effects on the resulting predictions this is particularly obvious if the hydrological model and data assimilation method are not well identified in advance such as the ihacres model in this study v parameter calibration prior to data assimilation can significantly reduce the impact from the inherent randomness the uncertainty in model structure would be dominant the data assimilation process when calibrated model parameters are adopted whilst other uncertain factors may show invisible impacts as an extension of our companion paper this study firstly proposed an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework to gives a reliable quantification for the individual and interactive impacts of uncertain factors in data assimilation process such a framework is flexible and can explore the impacts for different numbers of factors the obtained results in this study indicate that enhancement of hydrological models and data assimilation methods would be the most efficient pathway to generate reliable hydrological predictions moreover the robustness of a data assimilation method can also enhance the predictability of the hydrological model which is able to alleviate the effect of the inherent randomness in data assimilation 7 data availability daily precipitation and streamflow data

3052,in this study an iterative factorial data assimilation ifda framework is developed to holistically characterize the individual and interactive effects of various uncertain factors on hydrological predictions the ifda framework is flexible and is able to reveal the impacts from different numbers of uncertain factors an iterative factorial analysis ifa approach is proposed in ifda to diminish the biased variance estimation in traditional multilevel factorial designs and provide more reliable impact characterization for the considered factors the proposed ifda framework is applied to quantitatively reveal the individual and interactive effects of hydrological models data assimilation da methods and uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation the results indicate that the hydrological models da methods and their interactions would have the most dominant effects on hydrological predictions this implies that different hydrological models or da methods would produce significantly distinguishable results when the hydrological model and da method have been specified uncertainties in streamflow observations would more likely have a visible effect on the accuracy of resulting predictions moreover the inherent randomness mainly caused by the monte carlo sampling procedures in data assimilation would also have noticeable effects on the da performances especially when the hydrological model and da method have been pre identified these results suggest that enhancement of hydrological models and data assimilation methods would be the most efficient pathway to generate reliable hydrological predictions keywords hydrological prediction sequential data assimilation factorial design uncertain factors 1 introduction in a hydrologic prediction context model simulations or predictions are subject to various uncertainties stemming from model inputs i e forcing data model structures and model parameters liu et al 2012 sequential data assimilation sda techniques are widely used for explicitly dealing with various uncertainties and for optimally merging observations into uncertain model predictions moradkhani et al 2005a vrugt et al 2005 clark et al 2008 xie and zhang 2013 in sda the state variables and parameters in a hydrologic model can be continuously updated when new measurements are available which can provide probabilistic quantifications for model parameters states as well as the resulting predictions the ensemble kalman filter enkf and particle filter pf are two of the most widely used sequential data assimilation schemes the approaches of enkf pf and their variants have been widely used in hydrologic data assimilation e g moradkhani et al 2005a b parrish et al 2012 pathiraja et al 2016a b fan et al 2015 2017a b for a data assimilation da scheme its performance is generally influenced by a number of factors such as the hydrological model and data assimilation algorithm to be employed uncertainty reflections in inputs and outputs e g streamflow observations as well as other factors a number of studies have been proposed in the past decades to improve hydrological data assimilation through various aspects for instance advanced data assimilation approaches based on the benchmark methods of enkf and pf have been proposed in order to alleviate the shortcomings in enkf and pf some of these approaches include the normal score ensemble kalman filter ns enkf method xu and gomez hernandez 2016 partitioned update ensemble kalman filter pu enkf method xie and zhang 2013 particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc method moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 implicit particle filter method chorin and tu 2009 rafiee et al 2013 copula based particle filter coppf method fan et al 2017a and also integrated data assimilation methods shen and tang 2015 fan et al 2017b the results indicate that those advanced data assimilation approaches are able to provide better predictions than traditional enkf and pf methods in some cases in addition to the improvement of data assimilation methods there are also studies to address other impact factors in data assimilation for example xue and zhang 2014 proposed a multimodel data assimilation method by embedding the enkf into the bayesian model averaging framework to account for the uncertainty stemming from the model itself ocio et al 2017 addressed the role of rating curve uncertainty in real time flood forecasting through data assimilation in which they has demonstrated that a standard flow measurement error can still represent a reasonable trade off between complexity and realism when the rating curve is well defined a state dependent model uncertainty estimation method named sdmu was proposed by pathiraja et al 2018 to characterize model uncertainty in data assimilation studies in which an objective data driven approach is adopted to estimate the transition uncertainty in model simulations moreover liu et al 2012 has argued that the optimality of data assimilation depends critically on the reliability of error estimates for the inputs and the model itself as well as the proper consideration of interdependencies and interactions among uncertain model components and or observations nevertheless the extensive test conducted by thiboult and anctil 2015 suggests that the updated state variables and the hyper parameters for reflecting uncertainties in forcing data and outputs should be carefully specified for the optimal implementation of enkf but there is no single and universal optimal enkf implementation for any model amounts of research works from improvement of da methods to better quantification for uncertainties in forcing data and outputs have been proposed in order to enhance the predictability of hydrological data assimilation however the performance of a data assimilation scheme is not only influenced by the individual effects from the hydrological model da approaches and uncertainties in forcing data i e inputs and outputs e g streamflow observations but also shaped by the interactive effects among these factors wang et al 2017 proposed a robust data assimilation system rdas to adopt a multi factorial design to examine the individual and interactive effects of uncertainties in inputs outputs and sample sizes on the performances of enkf the results indicated the pairwise interaction between perturbed precipitation and streamflow observations would have the most significant impact on the performance of the enkf system however such a conclusion is obtained for enkf whilst the impacts from hydrological models and different da methods are not considered the results in our companion paper fan et al 2022 have shown that for the same uncertainty settings in inputs outputs i e streamflow observations and sample size noticeable differences in prediction accuracies can be observed in the results from different da methods over different hydrological models wang et al 2022 developed a disaggregated multi level factorial hydrological data assimilation model to investigate the impacts of enkf and its variants lyu and fan 2021 characterized the impacts of inputs and streamflow observations on different da methods through the multilevel factorial analysis nevertheless the impact from hydrological models is still overlooked moreover the applicability of the multi factorial design adopted in previous studies e g wang et al 2017 lyu and fan 2021 huang and fan 2021 is restricted by its biased variance estimator which would lead to underestimations for the variance especially in small sample sizes bosshard et al 2013 fan et al 2020 2021 di et al 2021 the iterative factorial analysis ifa approach developed by fan et al 2020 2021 is able to diminish the biased variance estimation in traditional multilevel factorial designs through a subsampling decomposition procedure for those factors with multiple levels but the ifa approach has only been applied to investigate the impacts of uncertain factors on multivariate risk inferences for compound extremes such as flood peaks and volumes the applicability of ifa in characterizing the impacts of uncertain factors on hydrological data assimilation has not been demonstrated consequently this research is to propose an iterative factorial data assimilation ifda framework to reveal both the individual and interactive effects of hydrological models da approaches uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the performances of hydrological data assimilation schemes as an extension of our companion study the data assimilation with different uncertainty scenarios will be introduced into ifa method to formulate the ifda framework compared with previous studies e g wang et al 2017 the innovations of this study include i a flexible framework is developed to explicitly quantify the effects for uncertain factors on the performances of data assimilation in which the flexibility indicates ifda is able to analyze different numbers of factors with different levels ii the ifa method in the ifda framework can generate more reliable quantification for the effects of uncertain factors on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation this research can also demonstrate the extensive application potentials of the ifa method developed by fan et al 2020 2021 for different hydrological problems the applicability of ifda framework will be demonstrated at the river ouse in uk the obtained results can help reveal the dominant impact factors for hydrological data assimilation and further identify the most efficient pathway to enhance the predictability of data assimilation 2 methodology 2 1 uncertainties in hydrological data assimilation sequential data assimilation approaches have been widely employed for real time streamflow forecasting consider a generic hydrological model consisting of functions for state transition i e g and observational operator i e h as follows 1 x t g x t 1 u t θ t ω t 2 y t h x t θ t v t extensive uncertainties exist in the data assimilation process for the above modelling system these uncertainties may be embedded in various components such as model structural uncertainty i e g and h in equations 1 and 2 uncertainties in the forcing data i e u in equation 1 different data assimilation methods and uncertainty in streamflow to be assimilated these uncertainties may pose significant impacts on the resulting hydrological predictions 1 model structural uncertainty a hydrological model is developed through a series of mathematical equations to represent the water processes in a catchment there are uncertainties in the development of hydrological models since the proposed equations are generally simplified representations of real processes different model developers would employ different equations or mechanisms to describe different components in the rainfall runoff process of a catchment a typical example is that there are two major categories of hydrologic models physical based distributed models and lumped conceptual models the physical based distributed models divide a catchment into grid cells at fine resolution and assimilate different terrain data and precipitation to different cells chen et al 2016 in comparison the lumped conceptual models would use the same value of parameters for the whole watershed ignore the spatial variability and provide catchment runoff results in a spatially averaged way tran et al 2018 jaiswal et al 2020 hu et al 2021 furthermore there are also extensive uncertainties even for the same category of hydrological models for instance the hymod proposed by moor 2007 employs three identical quick flow tanks to route surface flow while the ihacres model proposed by jakeman et al 1990 uses a linear module consisting of two parallel linear stores to translate effective rainfall into streamflow therefore the hymod and ihacres as described in our companion paper fan et al 2022 applied different mechanisms to model the rainfall runoff process this implies that for the same dataset at one catchment different models would produce distinguishable predictions due to the structural uncertainty in hydrological models 2 data assimilation methods sequential data assimilation sda approaches have been widely used to quantify uncertainties for parameters and state variables for a hydrological model and provide probabilistic predictions similar to the hydrologic model development different sda approaches are distinguishable among each other for instance the traditional particle filter pf method moradkhani et al 2005b generally employs a stochastic perturbation technique to evolve model parameters to the next step improving upon the pf method the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc moradkhani et al 2012 use the metropolis acceptance ratio mechanism to determine the acceptance of the proposed parameter candidate generated by the stochastic perturbation algorithm moreover the particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh method developed in the companion paper fan et al 2022 adopts a mixed evolution algorithm consisting of a copula sampling and stochastic perturbation schemes to generate the proposed parameter candidates and then uses the metropolis acceptance ratio mechanism to determine their acceptance also as demonstrated in the companion paper fan et al 2022 different sda approaches may have different performances on uncertainty quantification for hydrologic models and thus produce different streamflow predictions 3 uncertainties in forcing data in hydrological prediction uncertainties embedded in the forcing data i e u t in equation 1 resulting from sampling and measurement errors are one of the major uncertain sources under consideration some approaches have been proposed to reflect uncertainties in the forcing data and the stochastic perturbation method has been widely adopted in hydrological data assimilation e g clark et al 2008 liu et al 2012 fan et al 2015 leach et al 2018 a generic formulation for the stochastic perturbation approach can be formulated as follows 3 u t i u t ξ t i where u t i is the randomized forcing data at time t for sample member i ut is the original forcing data and ξ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate the ith sample member leach et al 2018 for different forcing data different noise distributions would be employed to generate ξ t i in general the gaussian distributed noise is recommended for the forcing data such as temperature and potential evapotranspiration which is formulated as moradkhani et al 2005a fan et al 2017a b leach et al 2018 4 ξ t i ñ 0 t u t u γ u t where γ is the proportional factor for the precipitation which is recognized as the most influential uncertain model input the lognormal distributed noise is recommended by some studies expressed as follows e g leisenring and moradkhani 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 leach et al 2018 5 ξ t i log n 0 t u t u γ u t 4 uncertainties in streamflow observations in additional to the uncertainties existing in the forcing data the random errors in observations is also one of the major uncertain sources need to be well reflected errors in streamflow observations arise from several sources such as errors in river stage measurement and errors in the rating curve used to transform stage to discharge mcmillan et al 2013 some approaches have been proposed to reflect observational uncertainties e g mcmillan et al 2013 ocio et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 the gaussian random error is the most common one and has been adopted in a number of hydrological data assimilation studies e g rakovec et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 leach et al 2018 liu et al 2019 which can be formulated as follows 6 q t i q t v t i v t i ñ 0 η q t where η is the proportional factor for the streamflow 2 2 iterative factorial analysis the hydrological predictions for one catchment would be greatly influenced by various uncertain factors such as the hydrologic models to be used the parameter estimation approaches random errors in forcing data and streamflow observations consequently it is of great importance to characterize both the individual and interactive effects of those uncertain factors on the resulting hydrologic predictions to address this challenge an iterative factorial analysis ifa approach would be proposed to reveal the dominant factors on hydrological predictions the proposed ifa approach improves upon traditional factorial analysis fa method in which a subsampling procedure would be adopted for those multi level factors and generate a series of two level experimental designs the main and interactive effects of the chosen factors are obtained through averaging the main and interactive effects of all the two level experimental designs such a process will be illustrated through a generic example with three factors consider a hydrologic prediction system and its predictability is assumed to be influenced by factors a b and c as follows 7 y f a b c here a b and c are factors to be considered which can be either numeric e g proportional factors in forcing data or streamflow or non numeric e g hydrologic models or data assimilation approaches f is the generic hydrologic prediction system y is the index to evaluate the predictability of the system such as root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps if each factor has m levels a subsampling procedure would be adopted in ifa to decompose the m levels into a total number of m 2 two level pairs expressed as a 2 m 2 matrix as follows 8a g a h a j a a 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a m 2 a m 2 a m 1 a 2 a 3 a m a 3 a 4 a m 1 a m a m 8b g b h b j b b 1 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b m 2 b m

multi level factor in which the column index j 1 m 2 represents one two level pair and h 1 2 shows the two corresponding levels for instance if the factor of da is assigned with three levels with each level representing a da algorithm e g pf pmcmc pcmh these three levels would be decomposed through the subsampling procedure to formulate a 2 3 2 matrix as pf p m c m c pf p c m h pmcmc p c m h moreover the factors a b and c can have different levels which also lead to decomposed two level pair matrices similar to equations 8a 8c the subsampling procedure in equations 8a 8c would result in m 2 m 2 m 2 iterations in ifa with each iteration consisting of a two level factorial design one iteration in ifa is to conduct one two level factorial design formulated by one column from the decomposed matrices for a b and c in the proposed ifa approach each iteration from the subsampling procedure will lead to a two level factorial design according to the anova theory montgomery 2000 the total variability of model 1 denoted as the total sum of the squares sst can be decomposed as follows 9a s s t i s s a i s s b i s s c i s s i i 9b s s i i s s ab i s s ac i s s bc i s s abc i s s e i where i denotes the ith iteration ssa ssb and ssc denote the main effects of factors a b and c respectively ssab ssac ssbc and ssabc present the interactive effects among those three factors and sse shows the effect of errors the values of sst ssa ssb ssc ssab ssac ssbc ssabc and sse in the ith iteration can be obtained as follows fan et al 2020 2021 10a s s t i h c 1 2 h a 1 2 h b 1 2 l 1 n y g

indicates the total iteration in ifa and n m 2 m 2 m 2 since three factors with m levels are under consideration 2 3 iterative factorial data assimilation framework the hydrological predictions are generally influenced by a number of uncertain factors particularly in hydrological data assimilation the resulting predictions would be subject to hydrological models and the da approaches to be used uncertainties in forcing data and outputs e g streamflow observations and other relevant factors such as sample sizes different factors may have different impacts on the accuracy of hydrological predictions in order to comprehensively investigate both the individual and interactive effects of uncertain factors on hydrological data assimilation those uncertain factors would be integrated into the proposed ifa approach which lead to an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework fig 1 presents the framework of the ifda framework in ifda uncertainties in inputs hydrological models streamflow observations da approaches and sample sizes are set to have different levels these levels can be numerical e g uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations and non numerical e g hydrological models and da approaches the detailed procedures of ifda are described as follows step 1 select the uncertain factors under consideration step 2 for one factor with multiple levels i e multiple choices decompose the multiple levels of the factor into two level pairs through equations 8 for instance if three hydrological models assumed as m1 m2 and m3 are considered in ifda the factor of hydrological models would have three levels such a three level factor can be decomposed into three 2 level pairs as m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 3 m 3 similar decomposition matrices can be formulated for other factors under consideration step 3 for each column in the decomposition matrices for all factors formulate the 2 k k is the factors under consideration factorial design matrix in which each row indicates a data assimilation experiment with specified hydrological model da approach sample size and uncertainty representations in forcings and streamflow observations step 4 run all data assimilation experiments listed in the 2 k factorial design matrix moreover each experiment will be run 10 times i e replicates in order to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the monte carlo based data assimilation experiment step 5 generate the total variability i e sst for the evaluation indices i e y in equation 7 of the data assimilation experiment as well as its decomposition components based on equations 9 and 10 step 6 obtain the single and interactive effects of the uncertain factors on the predictability within the 2 k factorial design based on equations 11 step 7 repeat steps 3 6 for all the combinations of the columns in the decomposition matrices and generate the associated individual and interactive effects for the uncertain factors for the generated 2 k factorial designs step 8 generate the overall single and interactive contributions for the studied factors to the predictive variabilities in hydrological prediction system through averaging the corresponding results from all the 2 k factorial designs as expressed in equations 12 3 case study 3 1 experiment setup the proposed ifda framework will be applied for river ouse in uk to explore the major factors on the accuracy and uncertainty of hydrological predictions as a companion paper the ifda framework will be applied to reveal the major impact factors on hydrological data assimilation based on some results from our first paper fan et al 2022 in detail three levels would be considered to reflect the model structural uncertainty in which each level represent one hydrological model and thus three models i e hymod gr4j and ihacres would be adopted in ifda similarly the impact from data assimilation method would be reflected through considering different da algorithms in the ifda framework in this study the factor of da method would also be assigned with three levels consisting of three different da algorithms the particle filter pf method and its two variants i e particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc and particle copula metropolis hastings pcmh would be included in the ifda framework since the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are used in all the three hydrological models the stochastic perturbation approach with different proportional factors i e equations 3 5 will be adopted to reflect the impacts of inputs uncertainties on the hydrological predictions similarly the gaussian perturbation method i e equation 6 with different proportional factor values would be employed to reflect the impact of uncertainty in streamflow observations on the resulting hydrological predictions moreover the pf pmcmc and pcmh methods are all based on monte carlo simulation and the sample sizes will be another factor under consideration in the ifda framework table 1 summarizes all the factors and their levels in the ifda framework the proposed ifda framework is a flexible framework which can be expanded or shrunken based on the factors to be addressed for instance if the proportional factors in model inputs and streamflow observations are merely under consideration the ifda framework can characterize the impacts of uncertainties in model inputs and streamflow observations on the performance of a specific data assimilation method on a specific hydrologic model moreover the ifda can also be employed to reveal whether a da method would produce a noticeable impact on the predictability of a hydrologic model when the sample size da methods and uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations are involved in ifda 3 2 experiment responses in the ifda framework the response denoted as y in equation 7 would be some criteria to evaluate the performances of the chosen hydrologic prediction system subject to specific hydrological model da method as well as uncertainty settings in inputs streamflow observations and sample size as an extension for our companion study in fan et al 2022 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and continuous ranked probability score crps will be used as the responses in the proposed ifda framework which can be expressed as 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obsi q obs 2 15 crps f f x f o x 2 d x where n is the total number of streamflow measurements or predictions qobs and qsim are streamflow observations and model predictions respectively and q obs is the mean value of observations fo and ff are cumulative distribution functions for observations and model predictions respectively in this study the mean prediction at each time step i e qsim in equations 13 and 14 would be adopted to calculate nse and rmse in comparison the ensemble predictions in each time step would be used to calculate ff and the perturbed observations are employed to generate the value of fo 4 results analysis the proposed ifda framework is employed to characterize both the individual and interactive effects of various uncertain factors on the accuracy of hydrological predictions in detail there are six factors in total to be examined in the ifda framework as presented in table 1 with each factor having 3 levels for the factor of hydrological model each level represents a specific hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres whilst each level for the factor of data assimilation method represents a specific da algorithm i e pf pmcmc or pcmh the six factors with 3 different levels will lead to 729 i e 36 combinations of hydrologic data assimilation schemes each data assimilation scheme will consist of a specific hydrological model i e hymod gr4j or ihacres da approach i e pf pmcmc or pcmh sample size i e 50 100 or 200 and proportional factor value respectively for precipitation i e γ in equation 5 potential evapotranspiration i e γ in equation 4 and streamflow observations i e η in equation 6 moreover 10 runs will be performed for each data assimilation scheme which means that a specified da scheme would be repeated for 10 times the purpose for repeating is to reveal the inherent uncertainty in those monte carlo based data assimilation approaches consequently we would have a total number of 7290 runs in the ifda framework the computational burden is relatively high in this case since 10 replicates are used however the total number of runs in ifa is the same as the traditional multi level factorial analysis mfa method and thus ifa would not increase computational requirement compared with the mfa method nevertheless this computation requirement would be still less than some other global sensitivity analysis methods such as sobol s method as demonstrated in wang et al 2020 moreover the replicates can be reduced to mitigate the computation requirement in ifa e g 1458 runs are required if 2 replicates are adopted in addition one of the most significant merits of ifa is that it can deal with both discrete and continuous factors and get comparable results with some benchmark methods like sobol s method wang et al 2020 fig 2 presents the performance variation for different data assimilation schemes in the proposed ifda framework it indicates that for different data assimilation schemes with different hydrological models data assimilation techniques as well as uncertainties in inputs and outputs their performances would generally vary significantly in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic predictions as for the 7290 runs within the ifda framework they will lead to mean values for nse rmse and crps respectively being 0 69 34 06 17 63 nevertheless the 90 variation intervals bounded by the 5 and 95 quantiles for nse rmse and crps would be 0 45 0 84 25 24 45 05 and 9 93 28 80 presenting significant changes for different data assimilation schemes these changes may be subject to several factors such as the choice of hydrological models and data assimilation techniques uncertainties in inputs and streamflow observations and also the inherent randomness in the monte carlo based data assimilation methods in ifda framework consequently it is desired to further characterize the dominant factors that influence the performances of different data assimilation schemes 4 1 impacts of uncertainties in inputs observations and sample sizes the impacts of uncertainties in inputs observations and sample sizes for different sequential data assimilation techniques over different hydrological models are firstly characterized through the proposed ifda framework in detail the proportional factors are set to be 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 for the potential evapotranspiration i e c precipitation i e d and streamflow observations i e e to reflect their uncertainties three sample scenarios i e f of 50 100 and 200 are adopted to reflect the uncertainty in sample size in data assimilation process since pf pmcmc and pcmh employed in ifda are random in nature 10 replicates would be performed for each da scheme with specific uncertainty setting for inputs streamflow observation and sample size fig 3 exhibits the contributions of the factors c d e and f to the variations of deterministic predictions from different da approaches on different hydrologic models it is apparent that the uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes pose different impacts on the deterministic predictability of different da approaches on different hydrological models in detail for the pf approach the inherent uncertainty denoted as residual in fig 3 would have the dominant effect on its predictability on hymod and ihacres whilst the uncertainty in streamflow observation will have a major effect on the deterministic predictability from pf on gr4j this suggest that more accurate quantification for inputs and streamflow observations and larger sample sizes may hardly lead to better performances for pf on hymod and ihacres nevertheless the performance of pf on gr4j can be enhanced through better uncertainty reflection in streamflow observations for the pmcmc approach it can be observed that its performances for deterministic predictions are mainly subject to its inherent randomness which can have contributions of 82 5 60 8 and 85 2 respectively to the variations of nse for hymod gr4j and ihacres however uncertainties in streamflow observation and sample sizes would have apparent impacts 15 8 and 14 5 respectively on the predictability of pmcmc on the gr4j model compared with pmcmc and pf the performances of pcmh would be less impacted by its inherent uncertainties for instance the uncertainty in streamflow observations poses a most dominant impact on the predictions of pcmh on hymod and gr4j even for ihacres the sample size i e f also has a visible impact 7 98 on the performance of pcmh the contributions of these four factors to variations of rmse show a similar pattern with the results to the nse fluctuations which is presented in figure s1 in addition to the deterministic predictions the probabilistic predictions from different da approaches on different models may also be influenced by uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample sizes i e f fig 4 presents the contributions of those four factors to the variations of crps for different da approaches on different hydrological models it indicates that the impacts of those four uncertainty factors on the probabilistic predictions would have some similar features with their impacts on deterministic predictions the inherent randomness of pf pmcmc and pcmh would have a most dominant effect on the probabilistic predictions from ihacres with a contribution of 78 for pcmh and more than 80 for pf and pmcmc for the hymod even though the inherent randomness would also have noticeable effects on all the three da approaches uncertainties in precipitation i e d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f would pose more impacts as the da approach changes from pf to pcmh the impacts of these three factors i e d e f on probabilistic predictions of hymod are different from their impacts on the deterministic results especially for the pcmh approach where the factors of d and f would have large effects i e 18 8 and 7 7 on the probabilistic predictions whilst the factor e has a much less effect i e 15 4 for the gr4j model uncertainty in streamflow observations would have a major effect on the probabilistic predictions from pf and pcmh with its contribution to pcmh as high as 86 6 moreover this factor as well as the sample size would also have visible effects on the pmcmc approach with their contributions being 33 7 and 17 6 respectively such an impact pattern is similar with the results for deterministic predictions of gr4j for the uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f their impacts on data assimilation would be different for different da approaches on different hydrological models however we can generally conclude that regardless of the inherent randomness of the da approaches the uncertainty in streamflow observations seems to more likely pose a significant impact on the data assimilation process moreover for da approaches the pcmh approach would be less influenced by its inherent randomness this is because the contributions of pcmh randomness over the three hydrological models as shown in fig 4 are always less than the corresponding contributions for the other two da methods this indicates that the pcmh is more robust than pf and pmcmc which has been elaborated in our companion paper the performance of pcmh is more easily enhanced through better quantification for uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample size 4 2 impacts of uncertainties in da approaches inputs observations and sample sizes in general different data assimilation approaches would generate different prediction results even for the same uncertainty settings in inputs streamflow observations and sample size which has been demonstrated in a number of studies however it is not well elaborated how much the da method can contribute to the improvement of the hydrological data assimilation process in current study different da approaches i e b including pf pmcmc and pcmh as well as uncertainties in inputs i e c d streamflow observations i e e and sample size i e f are integrated within the proposed ifda framework to explore their contributions to variations in both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from hydrological data assimilation process fig 5 presents the impacts of b c d e and f on the variations of deterministic predictions from different hydrological models the randomness of the da approaches would pose remarkable or even dominant impacts on the performances of the three hydrological models however it is noticeable that factor b i e da approaches would also have significant impacts on the deterministic predictions from all the three hydrological models with its contributions being 31 9 33 2 and 17 2 respectively for hymod gr4j and ihacres for the factors of c d e and f their impacts in such a circumstance are significantly different from their contributions when the factor of da methods is not involved the uncertainty in streamflow observation would have a visible effect on the gr4j model with its contribution less than the contribution of factor b moreover the interaction of da methods b and sample size f also has an explicit effect on the performance of gr4j model for the deterministic predictions evaluated by rmse the impacts of b c d e and f as presented in figure s2 show similar features with their impacts on the variation of nse in spite of the inherent randomness the da approaches would pose the most significant impacts on the performances of all the three hydrological models larger than other individual or interactive effects for the probabilistic predictions evaluated by crps those five factors would have similar impacts on the hymod and gr4j with their corresponding effects on the deterministic prediction nevertheless as presented in fig 6 the da methods i e b would contribute more to the probabilistic predictions than the deterministic predictions the factor of da methods would make a contribution of 44 and 37 3 to the variation of crps from hymod and gr4j respectively higher than its contribution to nse in fig 5 and rmse in figure s2 variations however the probabilistic predictions from ihacres seem to be dominated by the inherent randomness of the da approaches with only a small visible effect from the sample size i e f in fact the mean crps values from pcmh pf and pmcmc on the ihacres model over all uncertainty combinations 810 runs for each da approach for inputs streamflow observations and sample size are 21 5 23 2 and 23 0 presenting an indistinguishable difference among each other when the impact of the da approaches is under consideration the results from the ifda framework indicate that the da approach would generally have more contributions to both the deterministic and probabilistic predictions than other factors such an effect is remarkably obvious for the hymod and gr4j models these results suggest the significance of developing advanced data assimilation approaches which can very probably lead to better predictions for the hydrological data assimilation process moreover uncertainty in streamflow observations would be another factor to be considered which can have significant effects on predictions from some hydrological models 4 3 impacts of uncertainties in hydrological models da approaches inputs observations and sample sizes the predictions from hydrological data assimilation are generally affected by various factors such as the hydrological model and da technique to be adopted uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes moreover the inherence randomness in some monte carlo based da methods may also have significant effects on the resulting predictions all these factors are integrated into the proposed ifda framework to quantitatively reveal their individual and interactive effects on the predictions from hydrological data assimilation fig 7 presents the individual and interactive effects of all the six factors i e a f on the deterministic predictions from hydrological data assimilation the results indicate that even though the inherent randomness i e residuals in fig 7 has the most significant effect on the deterministic predictions the hydrological models i e a da methods i e b and their interactions also make noticeable contributions to the deterministic predictability of the hydrological data assimilation schemes as presented in fig 7 the contributions of a b and ab would be 14 8 16 4 and 9 5 respectively which are much higher than the individual and interactive effects from other factors for the predictions evaluated by rmse the effects of all the six factors as shown in figure s3 are quite similar with their effects on the nse variation since both nse and rmse reflect the accuracy of deterministic predictions in comparison for the probabilistic predictions the individual and interactive effects of factors a f are different from their impacts on the deterministic predictions here the mean predictions are adopted evaluated by nse and rmse as presented in fig 8 the hydrological model i e a would have a much higher effect 31 3 on the variation of crps than its effect 14 8 on the nse variation conversely the impact of the da methods i e b and its interaction with hydrological models would have less effects 13 2 for b and 8 5 for ab on the probabilistic predictions moreover the inherent randomness of the da scheme would pose less effect on the probabilistic predictions than the deterministic predictions when uncertainties in hydrological models da methods inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes in a data assimilation process are under consideration the results indicate that the hydrological models and da approaches would have more significant effects than other factors on the resulting predictions this would conclude an implication that we would be able to expect better predictions in data assimilation through choosing an appropriate hydrological model and advanced da method moreover the inherent randomness in the data assimilation process also has noticeable effects on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions the robustness of the da approach would be another factor to be addressed to enhance the predictability of the hydrological data assimilation process 5 discussion 5 1 impact variations for da methods and hydrological models in the proposed ifda framework a number of two level factorial designs would be generated based on those uncertain factors with multiple levels for different two level factorial designs the factor levels for a specific factor e g hydrological models da methods may be different which would further lead to different impact characterizations for this factor fig 9 presents the contribution variations of hydrologic models and da methods for different hydrologic data assimilation schemes obtained by the two level factorial designs within the ifda framework it can be observed that when different levels are applied to one factor the resulting impact on the data assimilation would vary significantly as presented in fig 9 the contribution of hydrologic model to deterministic prediction remarkably ranges within 0 0 5 with most values located within 0 0 25 similarly the da approach would have an effect significantly ranging within 0 0 5 on hydrological data assimilation compared with hydrological model a large part of the contributions of da method are located within 0 25 0 5 which lead to a higher average contribution of da method i e 16 4 in fig 7 than that for hydrological model i e 14 8 in fig 7 moreover for the probabilistic predictions the contributions of hydrological model and da method would also vary significantly for different levels under consideration as shown in fig 9 however the contribution variations of these two factors for probabilistic predictions are not consistent with the variations for deterministic predictions most contributions of hydrological model are larger than 0 25 which also leads to a higher contribution in average than that for da methods 5 2 comparison with traditional multi level factorial analysis in the proposed ifda framework six factors with each one having three levels are addressed to reveal their impacts on the predictability of hydrological data assimilation their individual and interactive effects can also be characterized by a three level i e 36 factorial design figures s4 s7 shows the main effects and their interactions of these six factors on both deterministic evaluated by nse and probabilistic evaluated by crps predictions significant effects can be observed for hydrological model da approach and their interactions on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions which have also been characterized by the developed ifda framework nevertheless for the detailed contributions for each factor and their interactions the values from the three level factorial design are visibly different from those obtained by the ifda framework as presented in fig 10 the three level factorial design would provide an overestimation for the contribution of hydrological models and underestimations for the main effects of other factors it is noticed that the contribution characterizations from three level factorial design may also lead to a different rank for these factors it is concluded from the three level factorial design that the hydrological models would have the most significant effect on the deterministic predictions while based on the proposed ifda framework the contribution 16 4 of da methods is apparently higher than the contribution 14 8 of hydrological models moreover the three level factorial design also provides an overestimation for the interactive effect of hydrological models and da approaches these discrepancies may due to the biased estimations for the total sum of the squares and its components as presented in equations 9 and 10 5 3 impacts of uncertain factors for data assimilation with calibrated models the above analyses for factor contributions to the predictability of hydrological data assimilation are based on the results from the dual state parameter estimation framework in which both model parameters and state variables are quantified simultaneously however another possible pathway for hydrological data assimilation is to quantify the uncertainty in state variables with calibrated model parameters in this case the model parameters would be calibrated before starting the data assimilation process and thus probabilistic uncertainties would be obtained only for the state variables and predictions consequently the impacts of uncertain factors may have different patterns with those in the dual state parameter estimation framework nevertheless the proposed ifda framework can also be applied to reveal the impacts of different factors on hydrological data assimilation with calibrated models in such a case the 10 year dataset at the river ouse in uk described in our companion paper fan et al 2022 has been splitted into two parts with the first 5 year data for parameter calibration and the latter 5 year data for data assimilation since the model parameters are not estimated in data assimilation and thus only the pf method is needed for this issue fig 11 presents the individual and interactive effects of uncertainties inputs i e c for potential evapotranspiration d for precipitation observations i e e and sample sizes i e f on both deterministic and probabilistic predictions from data assimilation it is noticeable that compared with the results in dual state parameter estimation framework presented in figs 3 and 4 the inherent randomness in pf i e residuals in fig 11 would be more controllable especially for the probabilistic predictions for instance the highest contribution from the inherent randomness of the da algorithm would be found for ihacres model in both data assimilation scenarios but the contributions of the randomness would be around 88 for deterministic predictions in fig 3 and 87 for probabilistic predictions in fig 4 in the dual state parameter framework whilst those contributions can be significantly reduced to 29 5 for deterministic predictions i e fig 11 g and 19 1 for probabilistic predictions i e fig 11 i if the calibrated ihacres model is adopted compared with the reduced contributions from pf randomness some factors would have significantly higher impacts on the data assimilation performances for calibrated models but one specific factor may have different effects when different models are adopted in which the uncertainty in precipitation would have the highest impact on data assimilation for hymod and ihacres and the uncertainty in streamflow observations would have the highest contribution for gr4j moreover another interesting promise concluded from fig 11 is that the sample size of pf would not be likely to pose visible impacts on data assimilation for calibrated models this implies that only a small sample size may be required for data assimilation through calibrated hydrological models which can significantly reduce computation burden in the data assimilation process fig 12 a c present the performance variations for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions considering all the three hydrological models and different uncertain scenarios in inputs and streamflow observations it is obvious that the histograms of nse rmse and crps values show three peaks implying a dominant factor to influence the data assimilation process fig 12 d f show the detailed individual and interactive contributions of the uncertain factors to the deterministic and probabilistic predictions of data assimilation it is concluded that the hydrological model would mainly control the performance of data assimilation process whilst impacts from other uncertainties including the inherent randomness of the da algorithm seem to be negligible this indicates that using an appropriate hydrological model with well calibrated parameters would be the most efficient way to improve the data assimilation process 6 conclusions sequential data assimilation sda techniques have been widely used for uncertainty quantification and reduction in hydrologic prediction in a data assimilation scheme its performance is critically influenced by a number of factors such as the hydrological model and data assimilation methods to be used uncertainty representation in inputs streamflow observations and also sample sizes in this study an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework has been developed to characterize both individual and interactive effects of hydrological models da approaches and uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes on the resulting predictions in detail three hydrological models i e hymod gr4j ihacres three da approaches i e pf pmcmc pcmh and three uncertainty settings for inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes are under consideration in the ifda framework the interactive factorial analysis ifa was then proposed to explore the impacts of these factors on deterministic and probabilistic predictions the proposed ifda framework has been applied to the river ouse in uk some key results can be concluded i when uncertainties in inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes are under consideration they would have discrepant effects on different data assimilation methods over different hydrological models however uncertainties in streamflow observations except the inherent randomness in data assimilation would more likely pose significant impacts on the resulting predictions ii if the choice of data assimilation methods is further considered these factors also pose different impacts on the predictions from different models however the data assimilation methods regardless of the inherent randomness would generally have more impacts than other factors on the predictions iii for uncertainties in hydrological models data assimilation approaches inputs streamflow observations and sample sizes the first two factors i e hydrological models and data assimilation approaches and their interactions would have much more impacts than uncertainties in other factors on the resulting predictions iv in addition to those uncertain factors the inherent randomness mainly caused by the monte carlo sampling process would also have noticeable effects on the resulting predictions this is particularly obvious if the hydrological model and data assimilation method are not well identified in advance such as the ihacres model in this study v parameter calibration prior to data assimilation can significantly reduce the impact from the inherent randomness the uncertainty in model structure would be dominant the data assimilation process when calibrated model parameters are adopted whilst other uncertain factors may show invisible impacts as an extension of our companion paper this study firstly proposed an interactive factorial data assimilation ifda framework to gives a reliable quantification for the individual and interactive impacts of uncertain factors in data assimilation process such a framework is flexible and can explore the impacts for different numbers of factors the obtained results in this study indicate that enhancement of hydrological models and data assimilation methods would be the most efficient pathway to generate reliable hydrological predictions moreover the robustness of a data assimilation method can also enhance the predictability of the hydrological model which is able to alleviate the effect of the inherent randomness in data assimilation 7 data availability daily precipitation and streamflow data

3053,attribution analysis of runoff evolution under changing environmental conditions is currently a hot yet challenging topic in hydrology research in this study the budyko method was used to quantitatively identify the effects of climate conditions and the underlying surface such as topography land use and vegetation cover on the runoff changes in the yellow river basin during 1961 2018 and to clarify the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff evolution by dividing the entire basin into sub basins the results show that the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface and precipitation changes than to the potential evaporation the sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased the contribution rates of the climatic and the underlying surface changes to the runoff changes were 10 3 36 8 and 62 9 88 7 respectively and the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river the quantified spatial differences in the runoff evolution attribution can help improve regional water resource management and provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism in the yellow river basin keywords runoff evolution attribution analysis spatial differences budyko hypothesis yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has become the dominant trend of climate change in the past century ipcc 2021 along with the change of underlying surface such as topography land use and vegetation cover the runoff in different scale watersheds has changed to varying degrees wang et al 2019 xu 2012 the runoff of major rivers in china has decreased shapely especially in the yellow river basin zhang et al 2020 as the second longest river in china the yellow river basin plays a very important role in china s economic and social development and ecological security it supports 30 3 of the population in 8 of the land area and accounts for 26 5 of the gross domestic product gdp xi 2019 however an evaluation of the water resources in the yellow river basin revealed that the natural runoff in the yellow river basin has decreased by 20 since the beginning of the 21st century liu 2020 the average annual runoff from 1956 to 2016 60 years decreased from 56 8 billion m3 to 45 3 billion m3 wang et al 2021 and the measured runoff has decreased by more than 40 due to the uneven spatial distribution of the water resources the polarization between drought and floods in different areas of the yellow river basin is serious and extreme water events occur frequently therefore it is necessary to identify the spatial differences and underlying mechanism of the runoff evolution attribution many studies have analyzed the attribution of runoff changes under changing environmental conditions and have quantified the impacts of the different environmental factors bharat and mishra 2021 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2020b guo et al 2021 saha et al 2020 mianabadi et al 2020 li and quiring 2021 accurate quantitative assessment of the evaporation is very necessary for understanding changes in the water cycle recent research has shown that the global evaporation increased by 10 from 2003 to 2019 precipitation is increasingly removed through evaporation rather than runoff and the changes in the global water cycle will likely intensify madeleine pascolini campbell et al 2021 runoff observations and analyses in nearly natural catchments are also of great significance to studying runoff evolution attribution stahl et al 2010 investigated the runoff trends of nearly natural runoff in 441 small catchments in 15 european countries and they largely verified and supplemented the results of national and regional scale trends and attribution analyses considering the complex impacts of the climate underlying surface and human activities on the water cycle it is difficult to accurately locate and evaluate their impacts on runoff changes vörösmarty et al 2000 berghuijs and woods 2016 revealed the relative roles of the climate and underlying surface in the water cycle and evaluated the effects of the temporal and spatial asymmetry of the climate and underlying surface changes on runoff evolution in a continental study li and quiring 2021 identified the dominant factors affecting runoff changes in the us and found that the dominant factors affecting runoff changes in the us change over time rather than remaining constant at present the attribution of the runoff changes in the yellow river basin over the past 60 years is still inconclusive and the roles that climate change and underlying surface changes play are controversial therefore it is urgent to adopt more effective methods of quantifying the causes of the runoff changes in the yellow river basin which may provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism the attribution analysis methods for hydrological process evolution under changing environmental conditions can be primarily

analysis the study period can be divided into a base period and a change period based on the abrupt change point the δr δp δe0 and δω are the mean value changes between the two periods the runoff change δr can be attributed to the influences of changes in the climate and underlying surface the impacts of the changes in the climatic factors on the runoff can be divided into the effects of precipitation δrp and potential evaporation δ r e 0 wang et al 2019 and the runoff change caused by the changes in the underlying surface parameter was expressed as δrω all of the above can be

attribution analysis the interannual change trend of the hydro meteorological data from 1961 to 2018 in the yellow river basin show that the natural runoff and precipitation decreased while the potential evaporation and temperature increased fig 2 according to the results of the m k test only the runoff and temperature changed significantly and the runoff exhibited an abrupt change point in 1985 fig 3 the runoff series were divided into a base period 1961 1984 and a change period 1985 2018 by the abrupt change point compared with the average runoff during the base period that during the change period was 14 2 23 9 lower table 2 the underlying surface parameters ω were calculated using the least squares method and the sensitivity coefficients were obtained by substituting the results into equations 4 6 the contribution rates of the changes in p e0 and ω to the decrease in the runoff were calculated using equations 7 13 the results are shown in table 2 the underlying surface parameters ω were calculated to be 1 87 2 40 the sensitivity coefficients of the runoff to the precipitation r p potential evaporation r e 0 and underlying surface parameter r ω ranged from 0 35 to 0 56 from 0 08 to 0 16 and from 81 19 to 149 95 respectively the change in the underlying surface parameter led to a 62 86 88 71 decrease in the runoff that of climate change resulted in a 10 34 36 75 decrease in which the contribution rate of the changes in precipitation were ranged from 3 39 to 27 52 while those of the changes in the potential evaporation only accounted for 1 29 14 69 these results indicate that the underlying surface changes were the primary factor controlling the runoff changes 3 2 runoff change sensitivity analysis the relationship between the sensitivity coefficients and the climate conditions is represented by the aridity index e0 p and is shown in fig 4 a b the absolute value of the runoff sensitivity coefficients gradually decreased from upstream to downstream and there was a negative correlation between the runoff sensitivity coefficients and the aridity index the absolute value of the runoff sensitivity coefficients decreased as the aridity index increased the sensitivity coefficient of the underlying surface was positively correlated with the underlying surface parameter and decreased as ω increased fig 4c both the underlying surface parameter and the aridity index increased from upstream to downstream gradually approaching the water limit fig 4d the sensitivity coefficients of the runoff to the precipitation potential evaporation and underlying surface ranged from 0 0665 to 0 7385 0 4006 to 0 0051 and 166 1460 to 9 9918 respectively exhibiting significant regional differences fig 5 the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficients from lanzhou to toudaoguai in the upper reaches was the lowest and that of the source region was the highest the aridity index of the source area was the lowest and that of the lanzhou to toudaoguai section was the highest 3 3 spatial differences in the runoff change attribution similarly in this study the spatial differences in the runoff change attribution in the eight catchments were analyzed the contribution rates of the underlying surface changes were greater than 60 fig 6 and it was the leading factor causing the runoff changes in the yellow river basin the contribution rates of the climate change varied greatly in the different regions the region with the lowest contributions from climate change was located in the upper reaches of the yellow river i e only about 10 in the source area and the qingtongxia toudaoguai section the regions with the greatest contributions from climate change were located in the lanzhou qingtongxia section in the upper reaches and the longmen sanmenxia section in the middle reaches with a maximum value of nearly 40 climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches fig 7 the underlying surface change led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches based on the impacts of climate change and the underlying surface changes it was concluded that the decrease in the runoff in the middle reaches was the most significant under the changing environmental conditions and the runoff changes in the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai were the least significant 4 discussion 4 1 attribution analysis previous studies have reported that the main reason for the runoff changes in the yellow river basin is the combined effects of human activities and climate change and the contribution rate of human activities reached 78 40 83 27 wang et al 2020 ji 2020 zhang 2015 which is slightly higher than that of the underlying surface changes determined in this study 73 43 this is because previous studies did not separate the impact of artificial water extraction from the impact of human activities which indicates that the results of this study are reasonable and more credible similarly many other scholars have conducted attribution analysis of the runoff changes of the various tributaries of the yellow river li et al 2020a b and wang et al 2019 2018 quantified and identified the runoff change attribution in the upper reaches of the yellow river and their results indicate that the upper reaches of the yellow river are ecologically fragile and the runoff is more sensitive to the underlying surface changes in this area studies of the runoff changes in the middle reaches revealed that the contribution of human activities to the runoff changes was about 50 90 ning et al 2021 hu et al 2020 lv et al 2019 zhang 2008 underlying surface changes caused by human activities were the main factor causing the reduction in runoff yang et al 2014 the results of this study are consistent with the above research conclusions of previous studies previous studies have shown that the parameters of the underlying surface reflect the characteristics of the underlying surface in the basin such as the soil topography and vegetation since the soil and topography change little on a short time scale it can be assumed that the changes in the underlying surface parameters are mainly caused by changes in the vegetation in order to further reveal the contribution of the vegetation to the runoff changes based on the 30 m resolution normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data univariate linear regression analysis was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variations in the ndvi from 1981 to 2018 the results show that the vegetation coverage in the yellow river basin increased at a rate of 0 03 10 a during the study period fig 8 in terms of the spatial scale most of the vegetation in the study area improved during the change period in which the vegetation coverage in the middle reaches increased the most significantly since the 1980s soil and water conservation measures such as vegetation planting terraces and warping dams have been widely implemented in the middle reaches of the yellow river gao et al 2020 these measures have significantly changed the underlying surface conditions and have directly affected the relationship between the rainfall and runoff previous studies have shown that the area of vegetation measures in the middle reaches was much larger than that of the terraces and warping dams and the construction of terraces and warping dams ultimately supported the vegetation restoration in areas where the vegetation coverage increased significantly the runoff significantly decreased which indicates that the change in the underlying surface factors which is represented by vegetation plays an important role in the runoff evolution in the yellow river basin 4 2 spatial differences 4 2 1 spatial differences in the sensitivity there are spatial differences in the sensitivity of the runoff to climate conditions which are significantly correlated with the dryness index runoff is more sensitive to potential evaporation in humid areas and is more sensitive to precipitation in arid areas wang et al 2018 in areas with less precipitation and a lower runoff coefficient the sensitivity coefficients of the runoff to precipitation and potential evaporation are smaller that is in arid areas the sensitivity of runoff to climate change is lower wang et al 2016 it can be concluded that the factors to which runoff is sensitive to are related to the climatic conditions in the basin under the background of a dry climate runoff in humid areas is most sensitive to precipitation and runoff in arid and semi arid areas is more sensitive to the underlying surface factors li and quiring 2021 the region around the southern boundary of the basin is located in the humid and semi humid region and the aridity index is lower than in the northern region of the basin which is located in the arid and semi arid region the aridity index was the highest in the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai which mainly contains the aeolian sand areas and arid grass areas of the maowusu sandy land and the kubuqi desert located in the middle temperate and arid climate zone the annual average temperature in this region is 7 8 c and the annual average precipitation is only 277 mm yr making it the most arid area in the yellow river basin the aridity indexes of the heihe river and baihe river basins in the source region were the lowest the heihe river and baihe river basins are located in the plateau climate region and the humid climate zone the annual average precipitation is as high as 722 mm yr which is 1 5 times that of the entire basin and they are the regions with the most abundant precipitation previous research results have shown that an increase in the climate aridity index directly leads to a decrease in runoff and the sensitivity coefficients wang et al 2021 with the continuous warming and drying of the climate in the yellow river basin the available water is gradually decreasing which will eventually lead to the runoff becoming gradually less sensitive to the climate conditions and underlying surface changes therefore the runoff sensitivity coefficient of the yellow river basin exhibited a significant north south trend that is the runoff sensitivity coefficients were higher in the south than in the north the source region of the upper reaches of the yellow river was the most sensitive region of runoff change and the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai was the least sensitive 4 2 2 spatial differences in the attribution precipitation is an influencing factor that directly leads to changes in the runoff and the underlying surface factor is the main influencing factor leading to changes in the runoff underlying surface changes can enhance or weaken the impact of precipitation on runoff li and quiring 2021 in most parts of china climate change has led to increased runoff while the impact of the underlying surface has led to decreased runoff xu et al 2019 in the upper reaches of the yellow river especially in the source region precipitation and evaporation have increased and the comprehensive impact of climate change on the runoff reduction was negative that is climate change led to increased runoff the impact of human activities in the upper reaches of the yellow river was small the changes in the underlying surface were mainly grassland degradation caused by overgrazing glacier melting and wetland frozen soil degradation caused by climate warming the change in the transpiration caused by the grassland degradation was very small and it hardly affected the runoff the glacier area in the source region of the yellow river was very small so the impact of the glacier melting on the runoff could be ignored the degradation of the wetlands and permafrost will increase the soil water storage capacity and will eventually lead to decreased runoff the precipitation decreased and the evaporation increased in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river and according to the principle of water balance these changes in the precipitation and evaporation will lead to decreased runoff under the superimposed influences of the precipitation and evaporation the decrease in the runoff was more significant therefore the climate change in the middle and lower reaches led to decreased runoff in addition with the implementation of the returning farmland to forest and grassland project in the last 40 years and the rapid acceleration of urbanization the characteristics of the underlying surface have been greatly changed vegetation restoration leads to increased transpiration increased soil water consumption and drying of the soil especially in arid and semi arid areas however vegetation restoration also increases the soil porosity leads to increased soil evaporation and decreases the runoff coefficient therefore under the combined influence of climate change and underlying surface changes the runoff was significantly reduced to further reveal the spatial differences in the attribution of the runoff changes we calculated the contributions of the runoff changes in the eight sections of the basin based on the total runoff changes the results fig 9 indicate that the contribution of the upper reaches was 39 55 the contribution of the catchment controlled by guide station in the upper reaches of the yellow river to the decrease in the runoff in the yellow river basin was 26 43 making it the largest contributing region in the upper reaches the middle reaches were the main region contributing to the decrease in the runoff with a contribution rate of 53 96 it can be inferred that the middle reaches were the area with the most significant decrease in runoff in the entire basin and this region contributed the most to the decrease in runoff and dominated the change in the runoff 4 3 uncertainties it is important to highlight that some uncertainties remain in this study in this study the budyko hypothesis theory was used to quantitatively evaluate the attribution of the runoff changes but this theory often assumes that the annual soil water storage variable is zero thus ignoring the influence of the soil water storage variable which leads to some errors in the calculated results therefore when doing further related research in the future we will consider using the surface soil water database for short term attribution analysis on the annual or monthly scale 5 conclusions in this study the effects of climate change and underlying surface changes on the runoff changes in the yellow river basin were quantitatively evaluated based on the budyko theory and the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff changes were analyzed the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the average natural runoff decreased significantly in most regions with an abrupt change point in 1985 compared with the base period 1961 1984 the natural runoff in the change period 1985 2018 decreased by 14 2 23 9 2 climate change contributed 10 3 36 8 and underlying surface changes contributed 62 9 88 7 to the runoff changes so the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff 3 the sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased for the different environmental factors the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface changes and precipitation changes than to the potential evaporation changes 4 there were spatial differences in the impacts of the climate change and the underlying surface changes climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

3053,attribution analysis of runoff evolution under changing environmental conditions is currently a hot yet challenging topic in hydrology research in this study the budyko method was used to quantitatively identify the effects of climate conditions and the underlying surface such as topography land use and vegetation cover on the runoff changes in the yellow river basin during 1961 2018 and to clarify the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff evolution by dividing the entire basin into sub basins the results show that the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface and precipitation changes than to the potential evaporation the sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased the contribution rates of the climatic and the underlying surface changes to the runoff changes were 10 3 36 8 and 62 9 88 7 respectively and the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river the quantified spatial differences in the runoff evolution attribution can help improve regional water resource management and provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism in the yellow river basin keywords runoff evolution attribution analysis spatial differences budyko hypothesis yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has become the dominant trend of climate change in the past century ipcc 2021 along with the change of underlying surface such as topography land use and vegetation cover the runoff in different scale watersheds has changed to varying degrees wang et al 2019 xu 2012 the runoff of major rivers in china has decreased shapely especially in the yellow river basin zhang et al 2020 as the second longest river in china the yellow river basin plays a very important role in china s economic and social development and ecological security it supports 30 3 of the population in 8 of the land area and accounts for 26 5 of the gross domestic product gdp xi 2019 however an evaluation of the water resources in the yellow river basin revealed that the natural runoff in the yellow river basin has decreased by 20 since the beginning of the 21st century liu 2020 the average annual runoff from 1956 to 2016 60 years decreased from 56 8 billion m3 to 45 3 billion m3 wang et al 2021 and the measured runoff has decreased by more than 40 due to the uneven spatial distribution of the water resources the polarization between drought and floods in different areas of the yellow river basin is serious and extreme water events occur frequently therefore it is necessary to identify the spatial differences and underlying mechanism of the runoff evolution attribution many studies have analyzed the attribution of runoff changes under changing environmental conditions and have quantified the impacts of the different environmental factors bharat and mishra 2021 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2020b guo et al 2021 saha et al 2020 mianabadi et al 2020 li and quiring 2021 accurate quantitative assessment of the evaporation is very necessary for understanding changes in the water cycle recent research has shown that the global evaporation increased by 10 from 2003 to 2019 precipitation is increasingly removed through evaporation rather than runoff and the changes in the global water cycle will likely intensify madeleine pascolini campbell et al 2021 runoff observations and analyses in nearly natural catchments are also of great significance to studying runoff evolution attribution stahl et al 2010 investigated the runoff trends of nearly natural runoff in 441 small catchments in 15 european countries and they largely verified and supplemented the results of national and regional scale trends and attribution analyses considering the complex impacts of the climate underlying surface and human activities on the water cycle it is difficult to accurately locate and evaluate their impacts on runoff changes vörösmarty et al 2000 berghuijs and woods 2016 revealed the relative roles of the climate and underlying surface in the water cycle and evaluated the effects of the temporal and spatial asymmetry of the climate and underlying surface changes on runoff evolution in a continental study li and quiring 2021 identified the dominant factors affecting runoff changes in the us and found that the dominant factors affecting runoff changes in the us change over time rather than remaining constant at present the attribution of the runoff changes in the yellow river basin over the past 60 years is still inconclusive and the roles that climate change and underlying surface changes play are controversial therefore it is urgent to adopt more effective methods of quantifying the causes of the runoff changes in the yellow river basin which may provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism the attribution analysis methods for hydrological process evolution under changing environmental conditions can be primarily divided into statistical methods hydrological modelling methods and coupled water energy balance methods the statistical methods are simple and easy to use but lack sufficient physical significance and rational explanations the hydrological model methods require large quantities of high quality data and involve many parameters and complex calculations compared with the traditional methods

climatic factors and attributed the influence of non climate factors to human activities hu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 underlying surface changes deng et al 2020 land use changes he et

56 from 0 08 to 0 16 and from 81 19 to 149 95 respectively the change in the underlying surface parameter led to a 62 86 88 71 decrease in the runoff that of climate change resulted in a 10 34 36 75 decrease in which the contribution rate of the changes in precipitation were ranged from 3 39 to 27 52 while those of the changes in the potential evaporation only accounted for 1 29 14 69 these results indicate that the underlying surface changes were the primary factor controlling the runoff changes 3 2 runoff change sensitivity analysis the relationship between the sensitivity coefficients and the climate conditions is represented by the aridity index e0 p and is shown in fig 4 a b the absolute value of the runoff sensitivity coefficients gradually decreased from upstream to downstream and there was a negative correlation between the runoff sensitivity coefficients and the aridity index the absolute value of the runoff sensitivity coefficients decreased as the aridity index increased the sensitivity coefficient of the underlying surface was positively correlated with the underlying surface parameter and decreased as ω increased fig 4c both the underlying surface parameter and the aridity index increased from upstream to downstream gradually approaching the water limit fig 4d the sensitivity coefficients of the runoff to the precipitation potential evaporation and underlying surface ranged from 0 0665 to 0 7385 0 4006 to 0 0051 and 166 1460 to 9 9918 respectively exhibiting significant regional differences fig 5 the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficients from lanzhou to toudaoguai in the upper reaches was the lowest and that of the source region was the highest the aridity index of the source area was the lowest and that of the lanzhou to toudaoguai section was the highest 3 3 spatial differences in the runoff change attribution similarly in this study the spatial differences in the runoff change attribution in the eight catchments were analyzed the contribution rates of the underlying surface changes were greater than 60 fig 6 and it was the leading factor causing the runoff changes in the yellow river basin the contribution rates of the climate change varied greatly in the different regions the region with the lowest contributions from climate change was located in the upper reaches of the yellow river i e only about 10 in the source area and the qingtongxia toudaoguai section the regions with the greatest contributions from climate change were located in the lanzhou qingtongxia section in the upper reaches and the longmen sanmenxia section in the middle reaches with a maximum value of nearly 40 climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches fig 7 the underlying surface change led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches based on the impacts of climate change and the underlying surface changes it was concluded that the decrease in the runoff in the middle reaches was the most significant under the changing environmental conditions and the runoff changes in the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai were the least significant 4 discussion 4 1 attribution analysis previous studies have reported that the main reason for the runoff changes in the yellow river basin is the combined effects of human activities and climate change and the contribution rate of human activities reached 78 40 83 27 wang et al 2020 ji 2020 zhang 2015 which is slightly higher than that of the underlying surface changes determined in this study 73 43 this is because previous studies did not separate the impact of artificial water extraction from the impact of human activities which indicates that the results of this study are reasonable and more credible similarly many other scholars have conducted attribution analysis of the runoff changes of the various tributaries of the yellow river li et al 2020a b and wang et al 2019 2018 quantified and identified the runoff change attribution in the upper reaches of the yellow river and their results indicate that the upper reaches of the yellow river are ecologically fragile and the runoff is more sensitive to the underlying surface changes in this area studies of the runoff changes in the middle reaches revealed that the contribution of human activities to the runoff changes was about 50 90 ning et al 2021 hu et al 2020 lv et al 2019 zhang 2008 underlying surface changes caused by human activities were the main factor causing the reduction in runoff yang et al 2014 the results of this study are consistent with the above research conclusions of previous studies previous studies have shown that the parameters of the underlying surface reflect the characteristics of the underlying surface in the basin such as the soil topography and vegetation since the soil and topography change little on a short time scale it can be assumed that the changes in the underlying surface parameters are mainly caused by changes in the vegetation in order to further reveal the contribution of the vegetation to the runoff changes based on the 30 m resolution normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data univariate linear regression analysis was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variations in the ndvi from 1981 to 2018 the results show that the vegetation coverage in the yellow river basin increased at a rate of 0 03 10 a during the study period fig 8 in terms of the spatial scale most of the vegetation in the study area improved during the change period in which the vegetation coverage in the middle reaches increased the most significantly since the 1980s soil and water conservation measures such as vegetation planting terraces and warping dams have been widely implemented in the middle reaches of the yellow river gao et al 2020 these measures have significantly changed the underlying surface conditions and have directly affected the relationship between the rainfall and runoff previous studies have shown that the area of vegetation measures in the middle reaches was much larger than that of the terraces and warping dams and the construction of terraces and warping dams ultimately supported the vegetation restoration in areas where the vegetation coverage increased significantly the runoff significantly decreased which indicates that the change in the underlying surface factors which is represented by vegetation plays an important role in the runoff evolution in the yellow river basin 4 2 spatial differences 4 2 1 spatial differences in the sensitivity there are spatial differences in the sensitivity of the runoff to climate conditions which are significantly correlated with the dryness index runoff is more sensitive to potential evaporation in humid areas and is more sensitive to precipitation in arid areas wang et al 2018 in areas with less precipitation and a lower runoff coefficient the sensitivity coefficients of the runoff to precipitation and potential evaporation are smaller that is in arid areas the sensitivity of runoff to climate change is lower wang et al 2016 it can be concluded that the factors to which runoff is sensitive to are related to the climatic conditions in the basin under the background of a dry climate runoff in humid areas is most sensitive to precipitation and runoff in arid and semi arid areas is more sensitive to the underlying surface factors li and quiring 2021 the region around the southern boundary of the basin is located in the humid and semi humid region and the aridity index is lower than in the northern region of the basin which is located in the arid and semi arid region the aridity index was the highest in the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai which mainly contains the aeolian sand areas and arid grass areas of the maowusu sandy land and the kubuqi desert located in the middle temperate and arid climate zone the annual average temperature in this region is 7 8 c and the annual average precipitation is only 277 mm yr making it the most arid area in the yellow river basin the aridity indexes of the heihe river and baihe river basins in the source region were the lowest the heihe river and baihe river basins are located in the plateau climate region and the humid climate zone the annual average precipitation is as high as 722 mm yr which is 1 5 times that of the entire basin and they are the regions with the most abundant precipitation previous research results have shown that an increase in the climate aridity index directly leads to a decrease in runoff and the sensitivity coefficients wang et al 2021 with the continuous warming and drying of the climate in the yellow river basin the available water is gradually decreasing which will eventually lead to the runoff becoming gradually less sensitive to the climate conditions and underlying surface changes therefore the runoff sensitivity coefficient of the yellow river basin exhibited a significant north south trend that is the runoff sensitivity coefficients were higher in the south than in the north the source region of the upper reaches of the yellow river was the most sensitive region of runoff change and the region from lanzhou to toudaoguai was the least sensitive 4 2 2 spatial differences in the attribution precipitation is an influencing factor that directly leads to changes in the runoff and the underlying surface factor is the main influencing factor leading to changes in the runoff underlying surface changes can enhance or weaken the impact of precipitation on runoff li and quiring 2021 in most parts of china climate change has led to increased runoff while the impact of the underlying surface has led to decreased runoff xu et al 2019 in the upper reaches of the yellow river especially in the source region precipitation and evaporation have increased and the comprehensive impact of climate change on the runoff reduction was negative that is climate change led to increased runoff the impact of human activities in the upper reaches of the yellow river was small the changes in the underlying surface were mainly grassland degradation caused by overgrazing glacier melting and wetland frozen soil degradation caused by climate warming the change in the transpiration caused by the grassland degradation was very small and it hardly affected the runoff the glacier area in the source region of the yellow river was very small so the impact of the glacier melting on the runoff could be ignored the degradation of the wetlands and permafrost will increase the soil water storage capacity and will eventually lead to decreased runoff the precipitation decreased and the evaporation increased in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river and according to the principle of water balance these changes in the precipitation and evaporation will lead to decreased runoff under the superimposed influences of the precipitation and evaporation the decrease in the runoff was more significant therefore the climate change in the middle and lower reaches led to decreased runoff in addition with the implementation of the returning farmland to forest and grassland project in the last 40 years and the rapid acceleration of urbanization the characteristics of the underlying surface have been greatly changed vegetation restoration leads to increased transpiration increased soil water consumption and drying of the soil especially in arid and semi arid areas however vegetation restoration also increases the soil porosity leads to increased soil evaporation and decreases the runoff coefficient therefore under the combined influence of climate change and underlying surface changes the runoff was significantly reduced to further reveal the spatial differences in the attribution of the runoff changes we calculated the contributions of the runoff changes in the eight sections of the basin based on the total runoff changes the results fig 9 indicate that the contribution of the upper reaches was 39 55 the contribution of the catchment controlled by guide station in the upper reaches of the yellow river to the decrease in the runoff in the yellow river basin was 26 43 making it the largest contributing region in the upper reaches the middle reaches were the main region contributing to the decrease in the runoff with a contribution rate of 53 96 it can be inferred that the middle reaches were the area with the most significant decrease in runoff in the entire basin and this region contributed the most to the decrease in runoff and dominated the change in the runoff 4 3 uncertainties it is important to highlight that some uncertainties remain in this study in this study the budyko hypothesis theory was used to quantitatively evaluate the attribution of the runoff changes but this theory often assumes that the annual soil water storage variable is zero thus ignoring the influence of the soil water storage variable which leads to some errors in the calculated results therefore when doing further related research in the future we will consider using the surface soil water database for short term attribution analysis on the annual or monthly scale 5 conclusions in this study the effects of climate change and underlying surface changes on the runoff changes in the yellow river basin were quantitatively evaluated based on the budyko theory and the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff changes were analyzed the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the average natural runoff decreased significantly in most regions with an abrupt change point in 1985 compared with the base period 1961 1984 the natural runoff in the change period 1985 2018 decreased by 14 2 23 9 2 climate change contributed 10 3 36 8 and underlying surface changes contributed 62 9 88 7 to the runoff changes so the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff 3 the sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased for the different environmental factors the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface changes and precipitation changes than to the potential evaporation changes 4 there were spatial differences in the impacts of the climate change and the underlying surface changes climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

3054,the estimation of sediment deposited behind dams and reservoirs is of great significance for quantifying soil erosion rate and sediment flux however existing methods of sediment volume estimation often require detailed field measurements and historical topographic data limiting the broader application of these methods in this paper focusing on the region that suffers the world s most severe soil erosion we combine unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry and simulate submerging analysis to propose a novel method for estimating sediment silted by check dams under complex topography we obtained 1339 groups of topographic factors and ascertained the corresponding volumes of sediment deposited behind check dams in the loess hilly region of china lhrc and established five different models combined with regression analysis two different sets of data were used for method validation and optimal model determination the results showed that the error of the optimal model in the volume estimation of single check dam and regional check dams is 12 13 and 2 3 respectively additionally the area volume model has the potential to evaluate the sediment retention capacity of check dams in the order of billions of cubic meters in the whole lhrc because the variables are easy to obtain and the model accuracy is relatively high the further application of this method will help to evaluate the watershed sediment yield and regional soil and water conservation benefits and is of great significance for explaining the future changes in water and sediment in the yellow river basin keywords check dam sediment volume chinese loess plateau soil erosion unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion significantly affects the nutrient and carbon cycles land productivity and socio economic conditions worldwide alewell et al 2020 borrelli et al 2020 according to the assessment of sartori et al 2019 soil erosion causes an annual loss in gdp of 8 billion a reduction in grain output of 34 million tonnes and an increase in water abstraction of 48 billion m3 globally the food and agriculture organization of the united nations stated that soil erosion remained one of the greatest environmental threats in the world and proposed the initiative of stop soil erosion save our future fao 2019 accurate quantification of soil erosion rate is vital for policymakers involved in land use decision making and it is also an essential prerequisite for understanding and controlling soil erosion quine and van oost 2020 previous studies have used different methods to estimate soil erosion rates at different scales including soil erosion model prediction borrelli et al 2017 sediment delivery ratio estimation alatorre et al 2012 lal 2003 and runoff plot monitoring anache et al 2017 guo et al 2015 however the estimation of soil erosion rate at the catchment scale using these methods is still limited because of inaccuracy or because they are time consuming rose 2017 recently a new method combined with the volume estimation of check dams has been widely used to evaluate soil erosion rate at the catchment scale alfonso torreño et al 2019 fang et al 2019 quiñonero rubio et al 2016 check dams are a worldwide soil and water conservation measure used to regulate hydrological process and intercept eroded sediment in severely eroded regions lucas borja et al 2021 xu et al 2004 when the sediment silted by a check dam is accurately measured researchers can combine this finding with data such as trapping efficiency construction year of the check dam and the area and sediment delivery ratio of the catchment to quickly estimate the soil erosion rate of the catchment zeng et al 2020a the geometric methods and the topographic methods have been widely applied to estimate the sediment silted by check dams bellin et al 2011 boix fayos et al 2008 castillo et al 2007 geometric methods usually assume the depositional area of check dam takes the form of regular shapes such as trapezoids or pyramids which will lead to significant errors for depositional areas with complex topography ramos diez et al 2017b by contrast the topographic method estimates the sediment volume by comparing the current silted land surface of the check dam with the past gully topography before the check dam construction which is limited by the availability of high resolution topographic data and historical gully topography data alfonso torreño et al 2019 therefore there is still a lack of accurate and convenient sediment volume estimation methods for check dams which affects the further use of check dam data to estimate soil erosion rate at the catchment scale fang et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017a the chinese loess plateau clp is a hotspot region of check dam research globally with the largest number of check dams in the world wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 check dams have been widely built to control soil and water loss since the 1950s zhang and she 2021 by 2013 over 50 000 check dams had been built in tens of thousands of erosion gullies and maintained in good operation zeng et al 2020b the estimation of the sediment silted by check dams on the clp is critical as it can evaluate the soil erosion rate at the catchment scale and the soil and water conservation benefits of check dams at the regional scale fang et al 2019 jin et al 2012 liu et al 2021 however due to the lack of suitable methods and systematic evaluation there are significant differences in the volume estimation of check dams on the clp wang et al 2011 pointed out that the check dams on the clp intercepted a combined 21 billion m3 of sediment in comparison official data reported that the sediment silted by check dams on the clp is 5 7 billion m3 cmwr 2013 the considerable gap indicates the need for further estimation of the sediment silted by check dams previous studies on the clp tended to directly apply the geometric and topographic methods applicable in europe to estimate the sediment silted by check dam li et al 2016 zhao et al 2017a differences in topography and lack of historical terrain data may cause non negligible errors considering that the sediment silted by check dams is used to estimate soil erosion rate zhao et al 2015 retrieve catchment erosion history wei et al 2017 and verify the soil erosion model zhao et al 2017a in these studies a more convenient and accurate method for estimating the sediment silted by check dams needs to be further explored wei et al 2021 the fast growth of unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry in recent years has given rise to a novel idea for accurately estimating the sediment silted by check dams javernick et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2021 smith and vericat 2015 uav photogrammetry can efficiently generate high resolution digital elevation model dem in a relatively large region uysal et al 2015 and reconstruct the structure of reservoirs or gullies with an unparalleled level of detail brosens et al 2021 langhammer et al 2018 the method of sediment volume calculation for check dams based on high resolution dem analysis is more accurate and efficient than the traditional method huang et al 2021 some studies have used uav photogrammetry to estimate the sediment silted by check dams alfonso torreño et al 2019 de haas et al 2020 however relevant research is still absent for the clp region which features complex topography and widespread check dams therefore we apply uav photogrammetry to estimate the sediment silted by check dams on the clp for the first time the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a new method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams based on uav photogrammetry 2 use this method to determine the empirical equation for estimating the sediment silted by check dams on the lhrc 3 evaluate the accuracy and applicability of this method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lhrc with the most typical geomorphological features on the clp was selected as the study area 108 12 10 e to 114 31 58 e 35 41 40 n to 40 43 35 n this region covers an area of 211 800 km2 accounting for 33 of the total area of the clp fig 1 a deep loess is widely distributed in lhrc and has the characteristics of erodibility and collapsibility the lhrc has a semi arid continental climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 6 69 9 95 c and 454 5 mm respectively rainfall during the wet season june to september usually accounts for more than 70 of the total annual rainfall and is characterized by high intensity and short duration special soil properties terrain and rainfall features make the lhrc the most severely eroded region on the clp with an average annual soil erosion rate of 50 t ha 1 fu et al 2011 severe soil erosion directly leads to a total of 123 292 erosion gullies gully length 1000 m distributed in this region and the gully density is about 2 7 6 km km 2 cmwr 2013 the gully structure in the lhrc is relatively uniform and is typically composed of a gentle gully bed and a steep gully slope the elevation difference between the gully bed and the hilltop is usually 100 300 m and the complex slope and gully system further aggravates the soil erosion in the lhrc to control severe soil erosion more than 30 000 check dams have been built in erosion gullies in the lhrc accounting for about 85 of the total check dams on the clp fig 1b these check dams intercept the sediment mobilized by erosive rainfall forming silted land and masking the complex gully topography fig 2 additionally most of the other gullies without a check dam hereinafter referred to as empty gullies in the lhrc maintain the original gully topography fig 2 however according to a government report 56 161 check dams will also be built in these empty gullies in the next decade ndrc 2010 2 2 methodology the premise of this method is that gullies with check dams and the surrounding empty gullies have the expected geographical similarities under the same geographical division such as the loess hilly region in this study the gully topography is determined by factors such as geological structure climate and hydrology although the gully topography has spatial heterogeneity in different regions it usually shows topographic similarity within the same geographical division liu et al 2020 we first analyzed the characteristics of 102 real check dams in the lhrc and selected 102 empty gullies with similar topography then we combined uav photogrammetry to construct ultra high resolution 3 d terrain models of these empty gullies next we simulated the construction of check dams and subsequent sediment siltation in the empty gullies through submerging analysis and quantified the corresponding topographic factors and sediment volume finally we established different sediment volume estimation models based on regression analysis and verified the accuracy fig 3 2 2 1 selection of real check dams and empty gullies we carried out a large number of investigations of real check dams and empty gullies in the lhrc in 2018 in order to provide a reference for the selection of empty gullies we firstly selected 102 real check dams in the lhrc according to the following criteria 1 the dams were randomly distributed in areas dense with check dams 2 the catchment controlled by any selected real check dam must be a headwater catchment for more accurate measurement of catchment and check dam topographic factors fig 1a next we measured the area length slope and elevation difference of 102 dam controlled catchments as well as the silted land area and length of the corresponding check dams fig 4 shows the distribution and probability density of different topographic factors of real check dams and dam controlled catchments in the lhrc then we selected 102 empty gullies for simulation of dam construction fig 1b the selection of empty gullies was subject to the following conditions 1 the topographic factors of the simulated check dam and the corresponding dam controlled catchments are within the range shown in fig 4 real check dam 2 these empty gullies are distributed near the catchments with a real check dam fig 5 3 there are plans to build real check dams in these empty gullies in a word the simulated check dams in these empty gullies are comparable with the real check dams which ensures that the empirical equation obtained from the simulated check dams can be directly applied to the real check dams 2 2 2 uav photogrammetry uav photogrammetry was carried out with the dji phantom 4 rtk real time kinematic uav in april 2021 to obtain a high resolution dem of the selected empty gullies the dji phantom 4 rtk uav is equipped with a 20 mpix camera and a multi frequency multi constellation gnss receiver that can receive signals of gps glonass and beidou combined with the built in network rtk direct georeferencing techniques with a centimeter level accuracy can be carried out mulakala 2019 taddia et al 2020 more details about the dji phantom 4 rtk uav and the accuracy of network rtk can be found in mulakala 2019 which verified that the dji phantom 4 rtk could deliver a centimeter level horizontal vertical accuracy through several pre flights in each catchment we set the flying altitude heading phase and side phase overlap parameters at 100 200 m depending on the elevation difference of each catchment 80 and 70 respectively to ensure the best shooting effect we used agisoft photoscan professional 1 2 6 to produce the uav imagery the imagery processing included aligning photos constructing dense point clouds classifying ground points generating grids building dems and building orthomosaics langhammer et al 2018 through the above steps we obtained the dem of these empty gullies with a resolution of 0 12 0 24 m because of the heavy flight task to cover 102 empty gullies in lhrc it was difficult to arrange the ground control points gcp in each catchment however considering the huge difference between the centimeter level error caused by the lack of gcp and the length width of the check dam and gully hundreds of meters the resulting error is acceptable 2 2 3 simulation of check dams through the processed high resolution dem we could directly observe the real gully topography before the construction of the check dam then we simulated the construction of the check dams in these empty gullies based on the following steps first we imported the dem data obtained in the previous step into arcgis 10 5 software and added the check dam vector layer at the appropriate location usually the outlet of a gully then the location of the check dam was used as the outlet of the catchment to obtain the catchment area next we assigned elevation information to the check dam vector layer which was equal to the elevation of the gully plus the dam body heights finally the processed check dam vector layer was transformed into a grid layer and embedded in the dem of the empty gullies through the above steps the check dam was simulated in the empty gully fig 6 at this time the check dam was in the initial state and sediment siltation had not yet started 2 2 4 simulation of sediment siltation traditional bathymetric modelling refers to the dynamic simulation of the submersion process of water level rising from the minimum elevation to the maximum elevation from a given seed point langhammer et al 2018 here we used the fill a lake tool in the hydrologic modelling of qgis software to simulate the sediment siltation of all the selected empty gullies fig 7 this tool can easily obtain the silted land area and sediment volume corresponding to different silted depths in our study the seed point was located at the bottom of the simulated check dam that is the lowest point of the catchment in the process of simulating sediment siltation a total of 1339 data were obtained from 102 empty gullies by continuously increasing the silted depth at intervals of 1 m these data included the silted depth silted land area and sediment volume additionally the topographic factors of each dam controlled catchment and of the silted land of check dams were obtained by using the spatial analysis tool in arcgis 10 5 table 1 2 2 5 fitting the relationship between topographic factors and sediment volume considering different application scenarios we use both a single factor silted land area and a multi factor approach to predict sediment volume for the former to achieve better prediction results check dams were divided into small silted land area is 0 2 hm2 and check dam height is 5 15 m and large sized silted land area is 2 7 hm2 and check dam height is 15 25 m check dams according to regulation of techniques for comprehensive control of soil erosion technique for erosion control of gullies gbt16453 3 1996 https ishare iask sina com cn f 18800916 html the power regression model was used to determine the area volume relationship which is the most commonly used model for reservoir or check dam volume estimation liu et al 2020 tian et al 2013 for the latter we used multiple stepwise regression and multiple nonlinear regression to analyze the relationship between different topographic factors and sediment volume all the statistical analysis was completed in spps 25 0 2 2 6 assessment of sediment volume estimation considering the ultra high resolution 3 d terrain models obtained by uav we referred to the research of alfonso torreño et al 2019 and ramos diez et al 2017b to take the sediment volume obtained from the above submerging analysis as the real volume of sediment deposited behind check dams then we substituted 1339 silted land areas into different equations to obtain the predicted volume and compare it with the real volume additionally we also compiled the data such as silted land area silted depth and volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in our previous research and other related literature these studies use high density electrical resistivity tomography ert fang et al 2019 differential gps wang et al 2009 or geometric methods wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 combined with detailed field surveys measurement and drilling to obtain the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc at high confidence we take the sediment volume in the literature as the real sediment volume the area and depth parameters obtained in the literature are substituted into our optimal empirical equation to obtain the predicted sediment volume the percentage error pe mean absolute percentage error mape

similar across the lhrc and is composed of the hillslope gully slope and gully bed the cross section of a typical gully shows that the hillslope is relatively gentle and the gully slope is relatively steep and the slope between them is not continuous fig 8 b additionally severe soil erosion leads to the rapid development of gullies in the lhrc taking the representative gullies in this study as an example the width of the main gully ranges from 10 m to 130 m and the length ranges from 200 m to 3470 m dozens of large tributary gullies are distributed on both sides of each main gully fig 8a fig 8c and d show the 3 d topographic structure of the empty gullies before and after sediment siltation the complex gully topography leads to the extremely irregular 3 d structures of sediment silted by check dams 3 2 relationship between sediment volume and topographic factors the topographic factors of the catchments affect the morphological characteristics of the depositional area to a certain extent large catchments usually have deeper silted depths and smoother gully slopes compared with the topographic factors of the catchments the topographic factors of the gully are the most important factors that limit the sediment volume among them the area of silted land has the most significant correlation with the sediment volume r 0 97 followed by the perimeter r 0 89 length r 0 73 depth r 0 54 and width r 0 53 of the silted dam land respectively in contrast the circularity ratio and average slope of the silted dam land are significantly negatively correlated with the sediment volume and the corresponding correlation coefficient are 0 48 and 0 36 respectively fig 9 3 3 estimation of sediment volume 3 3 1 area volume relationships compared with the gully outlet the middle of the gully usually has a steeper slope and narrower gully width therefore a small check dam built in the middle has a relatively smaller silted land area when the sediment volume is the same there is an obvious difference in the fitting curve of check dams in different locations fig 10 indicating that the classified fitting classified as small sized and large sized check dams may have better prediction accuracy the fitting results show that the power function has the highest fitting accuracy the fitting equation equation 1 is as follows 4 v 6 31 0 03 d a r e a 1 33 0 01 0 d a r e a 2 3 80 0 07 d a r e a 1 51 0 01 2 d a r e a 7 fig 11 shows that the determination coefficient r2 of the fitting curves for both small sized and large sized check dams are quite high r2 0 93 and r2 0 98 3 3 2 multifactor volume relationships multiple stepwise regression was used to determine the factors influencing sediment volume the analysis results indicated that selecting more topographic factors does not significantly improve the prediction accuracy but causes serious autocorrelation therefore we chose two optimal models to estimate the sediment volume the predicted independent variables are silted land area silted depth and catchment length which are significantly related to sediment volume when the limiting factor is gradually added r2 increased from 0 945 to 0 953 table 2 additionally we also used multiple nonlinear regression to fit the relationship between silted land area silted depth and sediment volume which is the most commonly used form for volume estimation the results show that equation 5 demonstrates a better fitting effect than multiple stepwise regression models equation 2 and equation 3 and the corresponding r2 is 0 961 table 2 3 4 comparison and accuracy between different volume estimation methods we first used 1339 simulated real volume data to verify the error of different empirical equations table 3 for univariate regression only considering silted land area equation 1 power regression shows a good estimation result of sediment volume for large sized check dams table 3 the multivariate linear regression equation 2 and equation 3 significantly underestimates the sediment volume of small check dams and even produces negative values which leads to large mape and small nes fig 12 the pyramid method equation 4 has a small mape 15 but underestimates the sediment volume overall fig 12 multiple nonlinear regression equation 5 has the best prediction result with mape and nes of 12 and 0 97 respectively moreover equation 5 shows low errors in all types of check dams especially in small check dams the scatter points are more concentrated near the 1 1 line fig 12 for the estimation of the total sediment volume of all check dams equation 1 and equation 5 show good prediction results with errors of 7 and 2 respectively we also used real volume obtained by previous literature to verify the error of the optimal empirical equations equation 1 and equation 5 the result shows that the mape of equation 1 and equation 5 are 37 and 13 respectively figures which are consistent with the mape of simulated real volumes 35 and 12 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of our volume estimation method with previous studies previous studies usually used geometric methods and topographic methods to estimate the sediment silted by check dams in europe mongil manso et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017b in recent years these volume estimation methods have also been widely used in the lhrc zhao et al 2017a assumed the depositional area of check dam to be a pyramidal shape in order to estimate the sediment silted by check dams li et al 2016 determined the original gully topography and estimated the sediment volume through a 1 10000 scale topographic map before the construction of the check dam zhao et al 2017b combined the topography measurement above the silted land to infer the structure of the original gully buried by the sediment and obtained the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams however the direct application of traditional geometric or topographic methods in the above studies may lead to certain errors due to the complexity of the topography of the depositional area formed by check dams in the lhrc fig 8 firstly the silted depth of check dams is usually 5 50 m and the sediment volume is 0 01 5 million m3 which far exceeds that of check dams in other regions in the world abbasi et al 2019 secondly the typical depositional area has an irregular cross section composed of a steep gully slope and a gentle gully bed ni et al 2019 limiting the inversion of the underground structure of real check dams based on topographic continuity alfonso torreño et al 2019 finally many branch gullies extend on both sides of the main gullies greatly increasing the complexity of the structure of the depositional area our research combined with uav photogrammetry obtained a large number of ultra high resolution dem data of empty gullies and determined the near real 3 d topographic structure of the original gullies before the construction of the check dams the ultra high resolution dem data ensure the accuracy of the topographic factors and sediment volumes obtained in the subsequent simulation of dam construction and submerging analysis some studies improve the accuracy of the above geometric or topographic methods based on field measurements including boreholes drilling wei et al 2017 differential gps wang et al 2009 and high density electrical resistivity tomography fang et al 2019 however these methods require a lot of manpower and material resources and are usually aimed at a specific single check dam and cannot be expanded to other watersheds or regions in contrast our method has wide applicability and can easily be expanded to different regions and scales we can use this method to build different models according to the research requirements additionally this method is low cost and easy to implement cucchiaro et al 2019 when applied to catchment scale research the method only needs to obtain high resolution dem data of the empty gully around the target catchment through the uav lower costs and higher efficiency help to obtain enough high resolution dem of the empty gullies to build more accurate models more importantly the accuracy and applicability of these methods in the lhrc have not been systematically evaluated and direct application may generate unknown errors fang et al 2019 compared with the unverified accuracy or low accuracy of the above methods our method exhibits high accuracy by comparing with two different sets of validation data the results show that the average error is 12 for the volume estimation of single check dam equation 5 moreover the estimation error of the total amount of sediment at the regional scale is only 2 equation 5 4 2 applications using this method we established an empirical equation for estimating the sediment silted by check dams in the lhrc when applied to the catchment scale equation 5 has the optimal sediment volume estimation result depth parameters can be obtained by manual drilling high density resistance or height difference measurement fang et al 2019 gonzález romero et al 2018 when the study scale is expanded to the regional scale it is difficult to obtain the topographic factors of each check dam therefore we suggest that studies at the regional scale should use the silted land area equation 1 to estimate the sediment volume the silted land area at regional scale can be obtained by pixel or object based classification methods li et al 2021 tian et al 2013 this method can also be tried in other catchments regions where check dams are distributed we recommend the following steps 1 determine the target catchments regions 2 select as many empty gullies around the target catchments regions as possible 3 use uav to obtain high resolution dem of these empty gullies 4 simulate the dam construction and sediment siltation process to obtain the topographic factors and sediment volume corresponding to different silted depths 5 determine the optimal model by fitting the relationship between topographic factors and sediment volume 6 obtain the topographic factors of the real check dams in the target catchments regions and estimate the corresponding sediment volume 4 3 limitations at present there is no method to obtain the true volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc fang et al 2019 so we do not have real volume data available to verify our empirical equation all the known literature related to the volume estimation of check dams in the lhrc is based on the above geometric methods and topographic methods and all of them are uncertain estimated values wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a therefore we take the volume obtained from the high resolution dem as the true volume of deposited sediment to verify different equations alfonso torreño et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017b however considering the huge gap between the dem accuracy obtained by the uav 0 12 0 24 m and the length width of the check dam hundreds of meters the resulting error is acceptable additionally the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in some literature is verified by detailed field measurements and drilling table 4 the comparison with these data can also reflect the reliability of our method to some extent finally to ensure geomorphological similarity and achieve a better fitting result the study area can be divided in more detail according to geomorphological features 4 4 implications according to the outline of the comprehensive management plan for the loess plateau 2010 2030 56 161 new check dams will be built on the clp in the next decade ndrc 2010 under such circumstances it is very important to find a simple and reliable method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams this paper provides a new idea and method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams and further uses this method to determine the empirical equation for estimating the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc the findings obtained in this work can be further applied to assessing soil erosion rate at the catchment scale and estimating total sediment retention of check dams at the regional scale our research is of great significance for understanding the sediment retention capacity of check dams on the clp and for making soil and water conservation plans in the future 5 conclusion in this study a new method for estimating the sediment silted by check dams is proposed which only requires the high resolution dem of empty gullies around the check dam provided by the uav this method simulates the construction of check dams and sediment siltation in empty gullies which have similar topography to gullies with real check dams the optimal sediment volume estimation model is determined by regression analysis based on quantifying the corresponding topographic factors and sediment volume the results show that the method has good applicability in lhrc and can accurately estimate the sediment silted by check dams at different scales compared with the traditional geometric and topographic methods this method avoids the limitation of tedious field surveys and reliance on historical topographic data owing to the unavailability of field measurements when original gully topography has been obscured by sediment this method is essential to the volume estimation of check dams without historical topographic data for catchment scale studies that require high precision we suggest that the silted land area and silted depth should be used to estimate the sediment volume for regional studies estimation results with high accuracy can be obtained by only using the silted land area finally to ensure geomorphological similarity the study area can be divided in more detail according to geomorphological features our study provides a convenient and accurate method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams in the lhrc which can serve as a reference for the volume estimation of check dams in other regions of the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

3054,the estimation of sediment deposited behind dams and reservoirs is of great significance for quantifying soil erosion rate and sediment flux however existing methods of sediment volume estimation often require detailed field measurements and historical topographic data limiting the broader application of these methods in this paper focusing on the region that suffers the world s most severe soil erosion we combine unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry and simulate submerging analysis to propose a novel method for estimating sediment silted by check dams under complex topography we obtained 1339 groups of topographic factors and ascertained the corresponding volumes of sediment deposited behind check dams in the loess hilly region of china lhrc and established five different models combined with regression analysis two different sets of data were used for method validation and optimal model determination the results showed that the error of the optimal model in the volume estimation of single check dam and regional check dams is 12 13 and 2 3 respectively additionally the area volume model has the potential to evaluate the sediment retention capacity of check dams in the order of billions of cubic meters in the whole lhrc because the variables are easy to obtain and the model accuracy is relatively high the further application of this method will help to evaluate the watershed sediment yield and regional soil and water conservation benefits and is of great significance for explaining the future changes in water and sediment in the yellow river basin keywords check dam sediment volume chinese loess plateau soil erosion unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion significantly affects the nutrient and carbon cycles land productivity and socio economic conditions worldwide alewell et al 2020 borrelli et al 2020 according to the assessment of sartori et al 2019 soil erosion causes an annual loss in gdp of 8 billion a reduction in grain output of 34 million tonnes and an increase in water abstraction of 48 billion m3 globally the food and agriculture organization of the united nations stated that soil erosion remained one of the greatest environmental threats in the world and proposed the initiative of stop soil erosion save our future fao 2019 accurate quantification of soil erosion rate is vital for policymakers involved in land use decision making and it is also an essential prerequisite for understanding and controlling soil erosion quine and van oost 2020 previous studies have used different methods to estimate soil erosion rates at different scales including soil erosion model prediction borrelli et al 2017 sediment delivery ratio estimation alatorre et al 2012 lal 2003 and runoff plot monitoring anache et al 2017 guo et al 2015 however the estimation of soil erosion rate at the catchment scale using these methods is still limited because of inaccuracy or because they are time consuming rose 2017 recently a new method combined with the volume estimation of check dams has been widely used to evaluate soil erosion rate at the catchment scale alfonso torreño et al 2019 fang et al 2019 quiñonero rubio et al 2016 check dams are a worldwide soil and water conservation measure used to regulate hydrological process and intercept eroded sediment in severely eroded regions lucas borja et al 2021 xu et al 2004 when the sediment silted by a check dam is accurately measured researchers can combine this finding with data such as trapping efficiency construction year of the check dam and the area and sediment delivery ratio of the catchment to quickly estimate the soil erosion rate of the catchment zeng et al 2020a the geometric methods and the topographic methods have been widely applied to estimate the sediment silted by check dams bellin et al 2011 boix fayos et al 2008 castillo et al 2007 geometric methods usually assume the depositional area of check dam takes the form of regular shapes such as trapezoids or pyramids which will lead to significant errors for depositional areas with complex topography ramos diez et al 2017b by contrast the topographic method estimates the sediment volume by comparing the current silted land surface of the check dam with the past gully topography before the check dam construction which is limited by the availability of high resolution topographic data and historical gully topography data alfonso torreño et al 2019 therefore there is still a lack of accurate and convenient sediment volume estimation methods for check dams which affects the further use of check dam data to estimate soil erosion rate at the catchment scale fang et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017a the chinese loess plateau clp is a hotspot region of check dam research globally with the largest number of check dams in the world wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 check dams have been widely built to control soil and water loss since the 1950s zhang and she 2021 by 2013 over 50 000 check dams had been built in tens of thousands of erosion gullies and maintained in good operation zeng et al 2020b the estimation of the sediment silted by check dams on the clp is critical as it can evaluate the soil erosion rate at the catchment scale and the soil and water conservation benefits of check dams at the regional scale fang et al 2019 jin et al 2012 liu et al 2021 however due to the lack of suitable methods and systematic evaluation there are significant differences in the volume estimation of check dams on the clp wang et al 2011 pointed out that the check dams on the clp intercepted a combined 21 billion m3 of sediment in comparison official data reported that the sediment silted by check dams on the clp is 5 7 billion m3 cmwr 2013 the considerable gap indicates the need for further estimation of the sediment silted by check dams previous studies on the clp tended to directly apply the geometric and topographic methods applicable in europe to estimate the sediment silted by check dam li et al 2016 zhao et al 2017a differences in topography and lack of historical terrain data may cause non negligible errors considering that the sediment silted by check dams is used to estimate soil erosion rate zhao et al 2015 retrieve catchment erosion history wei et al 2017 and verify the soil erosion model zhao et al 2017a in these studies a more convenient and accurate method for estimating the sediment silted by check dams needs to be further explored wei et al 2021 the fast growth of unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry in recent years has given rise to a novel idea for accurately estimating the sediment silted by check dams javernick et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2021 smith and vericat 2015 uav photogrammetry can efficiently generate high resolution digital elevation model dem in a relatively large region uysal et al 2015 and reconstruct the structure of reservoirs or gullies with an unparalleled level of detail brosens et al 2021 langhammer et al 2018 the method of sediment volume calculation for check dams based on high resolution dem analysis is more accurate and efficient than the traditional method huang et al 2021 some studies have used uav photogrammetry to estimate the sediment silted by check dams alfonso torreño et al 2019 de haas et al 2020 however relevant research is still absent for the clp region which features complex topography and widespread check dams therefore we apply uav photogrammetry to estimate the sediment silted by check dams on the clp for the first time the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a new method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams based on uav photogrammetry 2 use this method to determine the empirical equation for estimating the sediment silted by check dams on the lhrc 3 evaluate the accuracy and applicability of this method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lhrc with the most typical geomorphological features on the clp was selected as the study area 108 12 10 e to 114 31 58 e 35 41 40 n to 40 43 35 n this region covers an area of 211 800 km2 accounting for 33 of the total area of the clp fig 1 a deep loess is widely distributed in lhrc and has the characteristics of erodibility and collapsibility the lhrc has a semi arid continental climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 6 69 9 95 c and 454 5 mm respectively rainfall during the wet season june to september usually accounts for more than 70 of the total annual rainfall and is characterized by high intensity and short duration special soil properties terrain and rainfall features make the lhrc the most severely eroded region on the clp with an average annual soil erosion rate of 50 t ha 1 fu et al 2011 severe soil erosion directly leads to a total of 123 292 erosion gullies gully length 1000 m distributed in this region and the gully density is about 2 7 6 km km 2 cmwr 2013 the gully structure in the lhrc is relatively uniform and is typically composed of a gentle gully bed and a steep gully slope the elevation difference between the gully bed and the hilltop is usually 100 300 m and the complex slope and gully system further aggravates the soil erosion in the lhrc to control severe soil erosion more than 30 000 check dams have been built in erosion gullies in the lhrc accounting for about 85 of the total check dams on the clp fig 1b these check dams intercept the sediment mobilized by erosive rainfall forming silted land and masking the complex gully topography fig 2 additionally most of the other gullies without a check dam hereinafter referred to as empty gullies in the lhrc maintain the original gully topography fig 2 however according to a government report 56 161 check dams will also be built in these empty gullies in the next decade ndrc 2010 2 2 methodology the premise of this method is that gullies with check dams and the surrounding empty gullies have the expected geographical similarities under the same geographical division such as the loess hilly region in this study the gully topography is determined by factors such as geological structure climate and hydrology although the gully topography has spatial heterogeneity in different regions it usually shows topographic similarity within the same geographical division liu et al 2020 we first analyzed the characteristics of 102 real check dams in the lhrc and selected 102 empty gullies with similar topography then we combined uav photogrammetry to construct ultra high resolution 3 d terrain models of these empty gullies next we simulated the construction of check dams and subsequent sediment siltation in the empty gullies through submerging analysis and quantified the corresponding topographic factors and sediment volume finally we established different sediment volume estimation models based on regression analysis and verified the accuracy fig 3 2 2 1 selection of real check dams and empty gullies we carried out a large number of investigations of real check dams and empty gullies in the lhrc in 2018 in order to provide a reference for the selection of empty gullies we firstly selected 102 real check dams in the lhrc according to the following criteria 1 the dams were randomly distributed in areas dense with check dams 2 the catchment controlled by any selected real check dam must be a headwater catchment for more accurate measurement of catchment and check dam topographic factors fig 1a next we measured the area length slope and elevation difference of 102 dam controlled catchments as well as the silted land area and length of the corresponding check dams fig 4 shows the distribution and probability density of different topographic factors of real check dams and dam controlled catchments in the lhrc then we selected 102 empty gullies for simulation of dam construction fig 1b the selection of empty gullies was subject to the following conditions 1 the topographic factors of the simulated check dam and the corresponding dam controlled catchments are within the range shown in fig 4 real check dam 2 these empty gullies are distributed near the catchments with a real check dam fig 5 3 there are plans to build real check dams in these empty gullies in a word the simulated check dams in these empty gullies are comparable with the real check dams which ensures that the empirical equation obtained from the simulated check dams can be directly applied to the real check dams 2 2 2 uav photogrammetry uav photogrammetry was carried out with the dji phantom 4 rtk real time kinematic uav in april 2021 to obtain a high resolution dem of the selected empty gullies the dji phantom 4 rtk uav is equipped with a 20 mpix camera and a multi frequency multi constellation gnss receiver that can receive signals of gps glonass and beidou combined with the built in network rtk direct georeferencing techniques with a centimeter level accuracy can be carried out mulakala 2019 taddia et al 2020 more details about the dji phantom 4 rtk uav and the accuracy of network rtk can be found in mulakala 2019 which verified that the dji phantom 4 rtk could deliver a centimeter level horizontal vertical accuracy through several pre flights in each catchment we set the flying altitude heading phase and side phase overlap parameters at 100 200 m depending on the elevation difference of each catchment 80 and 70 respectively to ensure the best shooting effect we used agisoft photoscan professional 1 2 6 to produce the uav imagery the imagery processing included aligning photos constructing dense point clouds classifying ground points generating grids building dems and building orthomosaics langhammer et al 2018 through the above steps we obtained the dem of these empty gullies with a resolution of 0 12 0 24 m because of the heavy flight task to cover 102 empty gullies in lhrc it was difficult to arrange the ground control points gcp in each catchment however considering the huge difference between the centimeter level error caused by the lack of gcp and the length width of the check dam and gully hundreds of meters the resulting error is acceptable 2 2 3 simulation of check dams through the processed high resolution dem we could directly observe the real gully topography before the construction of the check dam then we simulated the construction of the check dams in these empty gullies based on the following steps first we imported the dem data obtained in the previous step into arcgis 10 5 software and added the check dam vector layer at the appropriate location usually the outlet of a gully then the location of the check dam was used as the outlet of the catchment to obtain the catchment area next we assigned elevation information to the check dam vector layer which was equal to the elevation of the gully plus the dam body heights finally the processed check dam vector layer was transformed into a grid layer and embedded in the dem of the empty gullies through the above steps the check dam was simulated in the empty gully fig 6 at this time the check dam was in the initial state and sediment siltation had not yet started 2 2 4 simulation of sediment siltation traditional bathymetric modelling refers to the dynamic simulation of the submersion process of water level rising from the minimum elevation to the maximum elevation from a given seed point langhammer et al 2018 here we used the fill a lake tool in the hydrologic modelling of qgis software to simulate the sediment siltation of all the selected empty gullies fig 7 this tool can easily obtain the silted land area and sediment volume corresponding to different silted depths in our study the seed point was located at the bottom of the simulated check dam that is the lowest point of the catchment in the process of simulating sediment siltation a total of 1339 data were obtained from 102 empty gullies by continuously increasing the silted depth at intervals of 1 m these data included the silted depth silted land area and sediment volume additionally the topographic factors of each dam controlled catchment and of the silted land of check dams were obtained by using the spatial analysis tool in arcgis 10 5 table 1 2 2 5 fitting the relationship between topographic factors and sediment volume considering different application scenarios we use both a single factor silted land area and a multi factor approach to predict sediment volume for the former to achieve better prediction results check dams were divided into small silted land area is 0 2 hm2 and check dam height is 5 15 m and large sized silted land area is 2 7 hm2 and check dam height is 15 25 m check dams according to regulation of techniques for comprehensive control of soil erosion technique for erosion control of gullies gbt16453 3 1996 https ishare iask sina com cn f 18800916 html the power regression model was used to determine the area volume relationship which is the most commonly used model for reservoir or check dam volume estimation liu et al 2020 tian et al 2013 for the latter we used multiple stepwise regression and multiple nonlinear regression to analyze the relationship between different topographic factors and sediment volume all the statistical analysis was completed in spps 25 0 2 2 6 assessment of sediment volume estimation considering the ultra high resolution 3 d terrain models obtained by uav we referred to the research of alfonso torreño et al 2019 and ramos diez et al 2017b to take the sediment volume obtained from the above submerging analysis as the real volume of sediment deposited behind check dams then we substituted 1339 silted land areas into different equations to obtain the predicted volume and compare it with the real volume additionally we also compiled the data such as silted land area silted depth and volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in our previous research and other related literature these studies use high density electrical resistivity tomography ert fang et al 2019 differential gps wang et al 2009 or geometric methods wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 combined with detailed field surveys measurement and drilling to obtain the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc at high confidence we take the sediment volume in the literature as the real sediment volume the area and depth parameters obtained in the literature are substituted into our optimal empirical equation to obtain the predicted sediment volume the percentage error pe mean absolute percentage error mape

similar across the lhrc and is composed of the hillslope gully slope and gully bed the cross section of a typical gully shows that the hillslope is relatively gentle and the gully slope is relatively steep and the slope between them is not continuous fig 8 b additionally severe soil erosion leads to the rapid development of gullies in the lhrc taking the representative gullies in this study as an example the width of the main gully ranges from 10 m to 130 m and the length ranges from 200 m to 3470 m dozens of large tributary gullies are distributed on both sides of each main gully fig 8a fig 8c and d show the 3 d topographic structure of the empty gullies before and after sediment siltation the complex gully topography leads to the extremely irregular 3 d structures of sediment silted by check dams 3 2 relationship between sediment volume and topographic factors the topographic factors of the catchments affect the morphological characteristics of the depositional area to a certain extent large catchments usually have deeper silted depths and smoother gully slopes compared with the topographic factors of the catchments the topographic factors of the gully are the most important factors that limit the sediment volume among them the area of silted land has the most significant correlation with the sediment volume r 0 97 followed by the perimeter r 0 89 length r 0 73 depth r 0 54 and width r 0 53 of the silted dam land respectively in contrast the circularity ratio and average slope of the silted dam land are significantly negatively correlated with the sediment volume and the corresponding correlation coefficient are 0 48 and 0 36 respectively fig 9 3 3 estimation of sediment volume 3 3 1 area volume relationships compared with the gully outlet the middle of the gully usually has a steeper slope and narrower gully width therefore a small check dam built in the middle has a relatively smaller silted land area when the sediment volume is the same there is an obvious difference in the fitting curve of check dams in different locations fig 10 indicating that the classified fitting classified as small sized and large sized check dams may have better prediction accuracy the fitting results show that the power function has the highest fitting accuracy the fitting equation equation 1 is as follows 4 v 6 31 0 03 d a r e a 1 33 0 01 0 d a r e a 2 3 80 0 07 d a r e a 1 51 0 01 2 d a r e a 7 fig 11 shows that the determination coefficient r2 of the fitting curves for both small sized and large sized check dams are quite high r2 0 93 and r2 0 98 3 3 2 multifactor volume relationships multiple stepwise regression was used to determine the factors influencing sediment volume the analysis results indicated that selecting more topographic factors does not significantly improve the prediction accuracy but causes serious autocorrelation therefore we chose two optimal models to estimate the sediment volume the predicted independent variables are silted land area silted depth and catchment length which are significantly related to sediment volume when the limiting factor is gradually added r2 increased from 0 945 to 0 953 table 2 additionally we also used multiple nonlinear regression to fit the relationship between silted land area silted depth and sediment volume which is the most commonly used form for volume estimation the results show that equation 5 demonstrates a better fitting effect than multiple stepwise regression models equation 2 and equation 3 and the corresponding r2 is 0 961 table 2 3 4 comparison and accuracy between different volume estimation methods we first used 1339 simulated real volume data to verify the error of different empirical equations table 3 for univariate regression only considering silted land area equation 1 power regression shows a good estimation result of sediment volume for large sized check dams table 3 the multivariate linear regression equation 2 and equation 3 significantly underestimates the sediment volume of small check dams and even produces negative values which leads to large mape and small nes fig 12 the pyramid method equation 4 has a small mape 15 but underestimates the sediment volume overall fig 12 multiple nonlinear regression equation 5 has the best prediction result with mape and nes of 12 and 0 97 respectively moreover equation 5 shows low errors in all types of check dams especially in small check dams the scatter points are more concentrated near the 1 1 line fig 12 for the estimation of the total sediment volume of all check dams equation 1 and equation 5 show good prediction results with errors of 7 and 2 respectively we also used real volume obtained by previous literature to verify the error of the optimal empirical equations equation 1 and equation 5 the result shows that the mape of equation 1 and equation 5 are 37 and 13 respectively figures which are consistent with the mape of simulated real volumes 35 and 12 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of our volume estimation method with previous studies previous studies usually used geometric methods and topographic methods to estimate the sediment silted by check dams in europe mongil manso et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017b in recent years these volume estimation methods have also been widely used in the lhrc zhao et al 2017a assumed the depositional area of check dam to be a pyramidal shape in order to estimate the sediment silted by check dams li et al 2016 determined the original gully topography and estimated the sediment volume through a 1 10000 scale topographic map before the construction of the check dam zhao et al 2017b combined the topography measurement above the silted land to infer the structure of the original gully buried by the sediment and obtained the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams however the direct application of traditional geometric or topographic methods in the above studies may lead to certain errors due to the complexity of the topography of the depositional area formed by check dams in the lhrc fig 8 firstly the silted depth of check dams is usually 5 50 m and the sediment volume is 0 01 5 million m3 which far exceeds that of check dams in other regions in the world abbasi et al 2019 secondly the typical depositional area has an irregular cross section composed of a steep gully slope and a gentle gully bed ni et al 2019 limiting the inversion of the underground structure of real check dams based on topographic continuity alfonso torreño et al 2019 finally many branch gullies extend on both sides of the main gullies greatly increasing the complexity of the structure of the depositional area our research combined with uav photogrammetry obtained a large number of ultra high resolution dem data of empty gullies and determined the near real 3 d topographic structure of the original gullies before the construction of the check dams the ultra high resolution dem data ensure the accuracy of the topographic factors and sediment volumes obtained in the subsequent simulation of dam construction and submerging analysis some studies improve the accuracy of the above geometric or topographic methods based on field measurements including boreholes drilling wei et al 2017 differential gps wang et al 2009 and high density electrical resistivity tomography fang et al 2019 however these methods require a lot of manpower and material resources and are usually aimed at a specific single check dam and cannot be expanded to other watersheds or regions in contrast our method has wide applicability and can easily be expanded to different regions and scales we can use this method to build different models according to the research requirements additionally this method is low cost and easy to implement cucchiaro et al 2019 when applied to catchment scale research the method only needs to obtain high resolution dem data of the empty gully around the target catchment through the uav lower costs and higher efficiency help to obtain enough high resolution dem of the empty gullies to build more accurate models more importantly the accuracy and applicability of these methods in the lhrc have not been systematically evaluated and direct application may generate unknown errors fang et al 2019 compared with the unverified accuracy or low accuracy of the above methods our method exhibits high accuracy by comparing with two different sets of validation data the results show that the average error is 12 for the volume estimation of single check dam equation 5 moreover the estimation error of the total amount of sediment at the regional scale is only 2 equation 5 4 2 applications using this method we established an empirical equation for estimating the sediment silted by check dams in the lhrc when applied to the catchment scale equation 5 has the optimal sediment volume estimation result depth parameters can be obtained by manual drilling high density resistance or height difference measurement fang et al 2019 gonzález romero et al 2018 when the study scale is expanded to the regional scale it is difficult to obtain the topographic factors of each check dam therefore we suggest that studies at the regional scale should use the silted land area equation 1 to estimate the sediment volume the silted land area at regional scale can be obtained by pixel or object based classification methods li et al 2021 tian et al 2013 this method can also be tried in other catchments regions where check dams are distributed we recommend the following steps 1 determine the target catchments regions 2 select as many empty gullies around the target catchments regions as possible 3 use uav to obtain high resolution dem of these empty gullies 4 simulate the dam construction and sediment siltation process to obtain the topographic factors and sediment volume corresponding to different silted depths 5 determine the optimal model by fitting the relationship between topographic factors and sediment volume 6 obtain the topographic factors of the real check dams in the target catchments regions and estimate the corresponding sediment volume 4 3 limitations at present there is no method to obtain the true volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc fang et al 2019 so we do not have real volume data available to verify our empirical equation all the known literature related to the volume estimation of check dams in the lhrc is based on the above geometric methods and topographic methods and all of them are uncertain estimated values wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a therefore we take the volume obtained from the high resolution dem as the true volume of deposited sediment to verify different equations alfonso torreño et al 2019 ramos diez et al 2017b however considering the huge gap between the dem accuracy obtained by the uav 0 12 0 24 m and the length width of the check dam hundreds of meters the resulting error is acceptable additionally the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in some literature is verified by detailed field measurements and drilling table 4 the comparison with these data can also reflect the reliability of our method to some extent finally to ensure geomorphological similarity and achieve a better fitting result the study area can be divided in more detail according to geomorphological features 4 4 implications according to the outline of the comprehensive management plan for the loess plateau 2010 2030 56 161 new check dams will be built on the clp in the next decade ndrc 2010 under such circumstances it is very important to find a simple and reliable method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams this paper provides a new idea and method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams and further uses this method to determine the empirical equation for estimating the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in the lhrc the findings obtained in this work can be further applied to assessing soil erosion rate at the catchment scale and estimating total sediment retention of check dams at the regional scale our research is of great significance for understanding the sediment retention capacity of check dams on the clp and for making soil and water conservation plans in the future 5 conclusion in this study a new method for estimating the sediment silted by check dams is proposed which only requires the high resolution dem of empty gullies around the check dam provided by the uav this method simulates the construction of check dams and sediment siltation in empty gullies which have similar topography to gullies with real check dams the optimal sediment volume estimation model is determined by regression analysis based on quantifying the corresponding topographic factors and sediment volume the results show that the method has good applicability in lhrc and can accurately estimate the sediment silted by check dams at different scales compared with the traditional geometric and topographic methods this method avoids the limitation of tedious field surveys and reliance on historical topographic data owing to the unavailability of field measurements when original gully topography has been obscured by sediment this method is essential to the volume estimation of check dams without historical topographic data for catchment scale studies that require high precision we suggest that the silted land area and silted depth should be used to estimate the sediment volume for regional studies estimation results with high accuracy can be obtained by only using the silted land area finally to ensure geomorphological similarity the study area can be divided in more detail according to geomorphological features our study provides a convenient and accurate method to estimate the sediment silted by check dams in the lhrc which can serve as a reference for the volume estimation of check dams in other regions of the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
