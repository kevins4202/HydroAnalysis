ppris chen et al 2017 fu et al 2016 li et al 2019 wan et al 2021 bc is the pyrolysis product of fresh or fossilized biomass pignatello et al 2017 and is widespread in waters atmosphere soils and

studies bc was prepared from multiple biomasses i e pine needle shell straw and wood collected from jilin hainan jiangsu and guangxi provinces respectively the fresh biomass was pulverized into fine powder 5 20 mm and pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace under oxygen limited condition the heating temperature was set to first rize at 5 c min and maintained at the designed temperature for 6 h under air condition the obtained bc was ground passed through a 100 300 mesh sieve dispersed in 100 ml deionized water sonicated for 30 min and filtered through a 0 45 µm membranes the filtrate was stored at room temperature under dark condition 2 2 photolysis setup photolysis experiments were conducted using a high sample throughput photochemical reactor equipped with monochromatic led lights solution ph

quantifications of four environmentally important ppris i e 3bc 1o2 h2o2 and oh were conducted using respective chemical probes chen et al 2017 wu et al 2021 briefly 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp initial concentration 200 µm and furfuryl alcohol ffa initial concentration 200 µm were used to probe the steady state concentrations of 3bc 3bc ss and 1o2 1o2 ss respectively direct photodegradation of tmp was minor under investigated irradiation conditions fig s3 and bc inhibition on tmp direct photodegradation would be negligible similarly quenching of 1o2 by 200 µm ffa would be acceptable bacuase it accounts for 7 3 of entire 1o2 quenching in water 3bc ss was calculated by dividing the pseudo first order rate constant of tmp degradation k obs tmp by the bimolecular reaction rate constant of tmp

mol m 2 s 1 the calculation of i abs was described in text s2 we note that the quantum yield determined at each wavelength was the weighted average of all the wavelength of photons emitted by the monochromatic led light at 1 nm wavelength resolution assuming the same ppris quantum yields of photons emitted by one monochromatic led light given that bands of led lights were considerably narrow

monochromatic led lights i e 375 387 425 461 490 531 591 and 632 nm the selected wavelengths from uv a to red light were representative in natural sunlight spectrum uv b or uv c lights were not included due to their minor existence in natural sunlight spectrum 0 21 showing noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example fig s4 also infrared light 700 nm was excluded due to the negligible absorption of bc in this range fig s5a generally all ppris productions rapidly decreased with increasing wavelength with minor ppris productions under irraidations of 490 nm fig 1 a d resembling the wavelength dependence of ppris productions from nom wu et al 2021 3 2 ppris quantum yield spectrum we further assessed the wavelength dependent ppris qys from bc ppris qys under 365 nm irradiation stood for results of uv a light conditions similar to those under 375 nm irradiation fig s6 all investigated ppri qys decreased with increasing incident light wavelength fig 1e h for instance the qys of 3bc sharply decreased from 2 9 to 0 6 with light wavelength increasing from 375 to 490 nm and to 0 above 490 nm the qy spectrum of 1o2 were similar to that of 3bc distinct from those of 3bc and 1o2 the qys of h2o2 and oh sharply decreased with light wavelength increasing from 375 to 387 nm stayed relatively stable between 387 and 490 nm and decreased to 0 above 490 nm the discrepancy in ppris qy spectrum indicate different wavelength dependence of energy transfer i e 3bc and 1o2 productions and electron transfer i e h2o2 and oh productions processes for bc photochemistry the obtained ppris qys spectrum from bc enabled the contribution evaluations of different wavelength band sunlight spectrum to ppris productions fig 1i l showing noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example uv a light contributes to the largest portion of ppris productions for all four investigated ppris species i e 56 9 for 3bc 63 7 for 1o2 51 0 for h2o2 and 58 0 for oh given that uv a only accounts for 6 2 of sunlight spectrum it plays an outsized role in ppris production we note that the current estimation of uv a contribution is based on the qy measured at 375 nm while accouting for the likely higher ppri qys at wavelength 375 nm the practical contribution of uv a light might be even higher than current estimation visible light from 400 to 520 nm was the second largest contributor to ppris productions i e 37 2 for 3bc 29 9 for 1o2 43 6 for h2o2 and 30 9 for oh in stark contrast long wavelength photons e g yellow to red light display minor contributions to ppris productions with sharp decline in ppris production rates at 520 nm corresponding to green light together the above results suggest that uv a purple and blue lights dominates bc sourced ppris productions as well as subsequent ppris mediated processes 3 3 impacts of bc biomass source pyrolysis temperature and size on ppris quantum yields bc from different sources exhibit distinct physicochemical properties which may greatly affect their capabilities in producing ppris here we systematically assessed the ppris qys from bc of different biomass sources pyrolysis temperatures and sizes the photolyses were conducted using 365 nm uv a irradiation because uv a light dominate ppris productions from bc a thorough comparison on the ppris production qy with reported values was conducted tables s3 5 3 3 1 bc biomass source bc from four representative biomasses i e pine needle shell straw and wood were chosen based on their high natural abundance fig 2 a those source materials and resultant bc differed in physical structures and chemical compositions e g cellulose hemicellulose lignin volatile oil etc genally all investigated bc produced ppris fig s7a and the production efficiencies of ppris species varied among bc biomass sources fig 2a for instance bc from pine needle shows highest 3bc qy yet lowest oh qy in the contrast while bc from wood shows lowest 3bc qy its oh qy was highest among investigated bc nevertheless the variations of ppris qys among different bc biomass sources were much smaller than those among literature values with 1 2 magnitude differences fu et al 2016 li et al 2019 lian et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 3 2 bc pyrolysis temperature pyrolysis temperature determines the carbonization extent pore and surface structures of bc therefore may affect its ppris productions here as a paradigm we assessed ppris productions from wood bc prepared at 300 500 700 and 900 c the results show that pyrolysis temperatures largely affected ppris qys with variation of 1 84 30 3 fold among four investigated ppris fig 2b bc pyrolyzed at 500 c exhibit high qys of 3bc and 1o2 and the qys dramatically decline as pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 c the qys of h2o2 exhibits the most evident dependence on pyrolysis temperature with 30 3 fold decrease when pyrolysis temerapture increased from 300 c to 900 c compared to the qys of h2o2 a well known precusor of oh the oh qys exhibit lower dependence on bc pyrolysis temperature this result indicates that either the oh production is dependent on h2o2 activation rather than h2o2 avalability or there exists another pathway for photochemical oh production from bc 3 3 3 bc size we further assessed the impact of size on ppris qys from bc 0 22 10 and 80 µm wood derived bcs were produced by being filtered through a 0 45 µm membranes and being passed through 300 and 100 mesh sieve respectively size distribution and microstructure shown in figs s8 and s9 as a paradigm ppris productions from these three bcs suggest that bc particle size may greatly affect ppris qys with all measured ppris productions decreased with increasing bc size fig s7c for instance 3bc and 1o2 qys from 0 22 µm bc were 4 7 and 7 1 fold higher than those from 80 µm bc fig 2c the qys of h2o2 and oh also decreased from 1 2 10 6 to 6 3 10 7 and 7 0 10 8 to 2 2 10 8 with bc size increasing from 0 22 µm to 80 µm 3 4 dependence of bc ppris quantum yields on physicochemical properties the prior section has established the high dependence of ppris productions on bc pyrolysis temperature and size and moderate dependence on bc biomass source here we intended to further reveal the underlying correlations of ppris productions to bc physicochemical properties previous studies have reported correlation between optical properties and qys of 3nom and 1o2 from nom berg et al 2019 hence we first examined whether 3bc and 1o2 from bc follow similar trend with nom e2 e3 ratio 254 nm absorbance divided by that at 365 nm a parameter positively and strongly related to molecular weight de haan and de boer 1987 sharpless et al 2014 varied from 0 94 to 10 2 among investigated bc species fig 3 a comparable to those of nom berg et al 2019 mccabe and arnold 2017 e2 e3 ratio generally decreased with increasing bc pyrolysis temperature indicating an increase in molecular weight and aromaticity in good agreement of e2 e3 ratio ft ir spectra display an increased c c content and aromaticity with increasing bc pyrolysis temeparature fig s10 fig 3b c show positive correlations between e2 e3 ratio and qys of 3bc and 1o2 resembling those from nom berg et al 2019 sharpless et al 2014 hence 3bc and 1o2 production efficiencies from bc are related to its aromaticity and subsequent optical properties unlike 3bc and 1o2 h2o2 and oh were produced via electrons transfer mediated by surface functional groups e g oxygen containing functional groups wu et al 2022 yu et al 2022 therefore we further investigated the redox properties of bc fig 3d shows that bc displays high electron accepting capacities eac coupled with relatively low electron donating capacities edc these results are consistent with previous findings klupfel et al 2014 and suggest that quinone rather than hydroquinone moieties dominate the redox characteristics of bc under environmental conditions pine needle and wood sourced bc exhibits relatively higher electron exchange capacities eec eec eac edc of 1 4 1 6 mmole gc in addition pyrolysis temperature largely affect the bc redox properties the eac value increased from 0 76 to 1 3 mmole gc and edc value decreased from 0 69 to 0 30 mmole gc with pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 500 c with eec values remained constant this result indicates shift of bc surface oxygen containing functional groups to oxidized forms e g quinone as pyrolysis temperature further increased to 700 c both eac and eec values dramatically declined suggesting the depletion of surface oxygen containing functional groups this is paralleled by the increase of c c bond as indicted by ft ir spectra fig s10 further eec values slight decrease with increasing bc size this is reasonable because large size bc contains less mass equivalent surface funcational groups fig 3e f shows that the h2o2 and oh qys were positively correlated to edc values confirming the key role of surface electron exchange groups for photochemical productions of h2o2 and oh 3 5 comparison of ppris quantum yields from bc om and minerals we further compared ppris qys from bc nom and iron minerals im three naturally abundant and photoactive materials figs 4 and s13 in general statistical analysis shows no significant difference on the qys of ppris beween bc and nom except for h2o2 the 3om qys for bc 0 015 0 010 were consistent with those of nom 0 010 0 006 the 1o2 qys for bc and nom were also in the same range 0 009 0 008 and 0 013 0 004 respectively further bc and nom display similar capabilities in producing oh with average qys of 3 6 10 7 and 8 8 10 7 respectively the h2o2 qys for bc were slightly lower than those for nom likely attributed to the large variations among nom samples fig 4d for instance h2o2 qys from srnom top three points were much higher than from other nom and h2o2 qys from other nom were similar to those from bc we thus infer that ppris productions from bc and nom follow similar paths and efficiencies those findingly based on systematic investigations of ppris qys from numerous samples largely complemented previous findings li et al 2019 on comparison of ppris production from bc and nom in stark contrast im were not capable of producing triplet exicited state or 1o2 production and the h2o2 production was 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those from bc and nom oh production from im varied among mineral species with magnetite showing higher qys than those of bc and nom ppris from nom have demonstrated great impacts on the element cycles and transformation of pollutants given the similar ppris productions from bc and nom ppris from bc could also affect biogeochemical processes in natural waters depending on the abundance of bc for instance bc under sunlight irradiation could mediate rapid transformation of atenolol half life 3 7 h cimetidine hall life 15 9 h dominated by 3bc and 1o2 respectively using noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example 4 conclusions our study provided a systematic investigation on ppris production qys from bc to our knowledge this work was the first to assess the ppris qys spectrum of bc which can be applied for estimating ppris productions under varying spatio temporal and climatic conditions given the increasing natural abundance of bc with more frequent wildfires coppola et al 2018 those results can help advance our understandings on the role of bc sourced ppris on biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in natural sunlit waters such as rivers and lakes unlike those in fresh water we expect that ppris qys in seawater would be more complicated because high content of ions will likely affect electron transfer processes parker et al 2013 wan et al 2019 e g inhibited electron transfer from 3bc and quench reactive radicals grebel et al 2010 e g oh br br oh atmospheric aerosol droplet is another major natural pool of bc traditional studies on atmospheric bc mostly focus on its light absorption and resultant contribution to global warming liu et al 2017 ramanathan and carmichael 2008 randerson et al 2006 leaving the photochemical activities largely untapped he et al 2022 our results suggest that there might exist substantial ppris productions and subsequent ppris mediated reactions in bc containing droplets further our study reveals higher ppris qys from at short wavelength sunlight compared to the sunlight irradiation on the ground bc in atmospheric droplets receive higher intensity and portion of uv light irradiation which could be translated to more efficient ppris productions therefore bc photochemistry may play a previous overlooked role in cycles of atmospheric elements e g sulfur and transformation of

monochromatic led light at 1 nm wavelength resolution assuming the same ppris quantum yields of photons emitted by one monochromatic led light given that bands of led lights were considerably narrow

size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 and mastersizer 2000 britain the surface morphology of bc was characterized by scanning electron microscope geminisem 300 germany fourier transform infrared

monochromatic led lights i e 375 387 425 461 490 531 591 and 632 nm the selected wavelengths from uv a to red light were representative in natural sunlight spectrum uv b or uv c lights were not included due to their minor existence in natural sunlight spectrum 0 21 showing noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example fig s4 also infrared light 700 nm was excluded due to the negligible absorption of bc in this range fig s5a generally all ppris productions rapidly decreased with increasing wavelength with minor ppris productions under irraidations of 490 nm fig 1 a d resembling the wavelength dependence of ppris productions from nom wu et al 2021 3 2 ppris quantum yield spectrum we further assessed the wavelength dependent ppris qys from bc ppris qys under 365 nm irradiation stood for results of uv a light conditions similar to those under 375 nm irradiation fig s6 all investigated ppri qys decreased with increasing incident light wavelength fig 1e h for instance the qys of 3bc sharply decreased from 2 9 to 0 6 with light wavelength increasing from 375 to 490 nm and to 0 above 490 nm the qy spectrum of 1o2 were similar to that of 3bc distinct from those of 3bc and 1o2 the qys of h2o2 and oh sharply decreased with light wavelength increasing from 375 to 387 nm stayed relatively stable between 387 and 490 nm and decreased to 0 above 490 nm the discrepancy in ppris qy spectrum indicate different wavelength dependence of energy transfer i e 3bc and 1o2 productions and electron transfer i e h2o2 and oh productions processes for bc photochemistry the obtained ppris qys spectrum from bc enabled the contribution evaluations of different wavelength band sunlight spectrum to ppris productions fig 1i l showing noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example uv a light contributes to the largest portion of ppris productions for all four investigated ppris species i e 56 9 for 3bc 63 7 for 1o2 51 0 for h2o2 and 58 0 for oh given that uv a only accounts for 6 2 of sunlight spectrum it plays an outsized role in ppris production we note that the current estimation of uv a contribution is based on the qy measured at 375 nm while accouting for the likely higher ppri qys at wavelength 375 nm the practical contribution of uv a light might be even higher than current estimation visible light from 400 to 520 nm was the second largest contributor to ppris productions i e 37 2 for 3bc 29 9 for 1o2 43 6 for h2o2 and 30 9 for oh in stark contrast long wavelength photons e g yellow to red light display minor contributions to ppris productions with sharp decline in ppris production rates at 520 nm corresponding to green light together the above results suggest that uv a purple and blue lights dominates bc sourced ppris productions as well as subsequent ppris mediated processes 3 3 impacts of bc biomass source pyrolysis temperature and size on ppris quantum yields bc from different sources exhibit distinct physicochemical properties which may greatly affect their capabilities in producing ppris here we systematically assessed the ppris qys from bc of different biomass sources pyrolysis temperatures and sizes the photolyses were conducted using 365 nm uv a irradiation because uv a light dominate ppris productions from bc a thorough comparison on the ppris production qy with reported values was conducted tables s3 5 3 3 1 bc biomass source bc from four representative biomasses i e pine needle shell straw and wood were chosen based on their high natural abundance fig 2 a those source materials and resultant bc differed in physical structures and chemical compositions e g cellulose hemicellulose lignin volatile oil etc genally all investigated bc produced ppris fig s7a and the production efficiencies of ppris species varied among bc biomass sources fig 2a for instance bc from pine needle shows highest 3bc qy yet lowest oh qy in the contrast while bc from wood shows lowest 3bc qy its oh qy was highest among investigated bc nevertheless the variations of ppris qys among different bc biomass sources were much smaller than those among literature values with 1 2 magnitude differences fu et al 2016 li et al 2019 lian et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 3 2 bc pyrolysis temperature pyrolysis temperature determines the carbonization extent pore and surface structures of bc therefore may affect its ppris productions here as a paradigm we assessed ppris productions from wood bc prepared at 300 500 700 and 900 c the results show that pyrolysis temperatures largely affected ppris qys with variation of 1 84 30 3 fold among four investigated ppris fig 2b bc pyrolyzed at 500 c exhibit high qys of 3bc and 1o2 and the qys dramatically decline as pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 c the qys of h2o2 exhibits the most evident dependence on pyrolysis temperature with 30 3 fold decrease when pyrolysis temerapture increased from 300 c to 900 c compared to the qys of h2o2 a well known precusor of oh the oh qys exhibit lower dependence on bc pyrolysis temperature this result indicates that either the oh production is dependent on h2o2 activation rather than h2o2 avalability or there exists another pathway for photochemical oh production from bc 3 3 3 bc size we further assessed the impact of size on ppris qys from bc 0 22 10 and 80 µm wood derived bcs were produced by being filtered through a 0 45 µm membranes and being passed through 300 and 100 mesh sieve respectively size distribution and microstructure shown in figs s8 and s9 as a paradigm ppris productions from these three bcs suggest that bc particle size may greatly affect ppris qys with all measured ppris productions decreased with increasing bc size fig s7c for instance 3bc and 1o2 qys from 0 22 µm bc were 4 7 and 7 1 fold higher than those from 80 µm bc fig 2c the qys of h2o2 and oh also decreased from 1 2 10 6 to 6 3 10 7 and 7 0 10 8 to 2 2 10 8 with bc size increasing from 0 22 µm to 80 µm 3 4 dependence of bc ppris quantum yields on physicochemical properties the prior section has established the high dependence of ppris productions on bc pyrolysis temperature and size and moderate dependence on bc biomass source here we intended to further reveal the underlying correlations of ppris productions to bc physicochemical properties previous studies have reported correlation between optical properties and qys of 3nom and 1o2 from nom berg et al 2019 hence we first examined whether 3bc and 1o2 from bc follow similar trend with nom e2 e3 ratio 254 nm absorbance divided by that at 365 nm a parameter positively and strongly related to molecular weight de haan and de boer 1987 sharpless et al 2014 varied from 0 94 to 10 2 among investigated bc species fig 3 a comparable to those of nom berg et al 2019 mccabe and arnold 2017 e2 e3 ratio generally decreased with increasing bc pyrolysis temperature indicating an increase in molecular weight and aromaticity in good agreement of e2 e3 ratio ft ir spectra display an increased c c content and aromaticity with increasing bc pyrolysis temeparature fig s10 fig 3b c show positive correlations between e2 e3 ratio and qys of 3bc and 1o2 resembling those from nom berg et al 2019 sharpless et al 2014 hence 3bc and 1o2 production efficiencies from bc are related to its aromaticity and subsequent optical properties unlike 3bc and 1o2 h2o2 and oh were produced via electrons transfer mediated by surface functional groups e g oxygen containing functional groups wu et al 2022 yu et al 2022 therefore we further investigated the redox properties of bc fig 3d shows that bc displays high electron accepting capacities eac coupled with relatively low electron donating capacities edc these results are consistent with previous findings klupfel et al 2014 and suggest that quinone rather than hydroquinone moieties dominate the redox characteristics of bc under environmental conditions pine needle and wood sourced bc exhibits relatively higher electron exchange capacities eec eec eac edc of 1 4 1 6 mmole gc in addition pyrolysis temperature largely affect the bc redox properties the eac value increased from 0 76 to 1 3 mmole gc and edc value decreased from 0 69 to 0 30 mmole gc with pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 500 c with eec values remained constant this result indicates shift of bc surface oxygen containing functional groups to oxidized forms e g quinone as pyrolysis temperature further increased to 700 c both eac and eec values dramatically declined suggesting the depletion of surface oxygen containing functional groups this is paralleled by the increase of c c bond as indicted by ft ir spectra fig s10 further eec values slight decrease with increasing bc size this is reasonable because large size bc contains less mass equivalent surface funcational groups fig 3e f shows that the h2o2 and oh qys were positively correlated to edc values confirming the key role of surface electron exchange groups for photochemical productions of h2o2 and oh 3 5 comparison of ppris quantum yields from bc om and minerals we further compared ppris qys from bc nom and iron minerals im three naturally abundant and photoactive materials figs 4 and s13 in general statistical analysis shows no significant difference on the qys of ppris beween bc and nom except for h2o2 the 3om qys for bc 0 015 0 010 were consistent with those of nom 0 010 0 006 the 1o2 qys for bc and nom were also in the same range 0 009 0 008 and 0 013 0 004 respectively further bc and nom display similar capabilities in producing oh with average qys of 3 6 10 7 and 8 8 10 7 respectively the h2o2 qys for bc were slightly lower than those for nom likely attributed to the large variations among nom samples fig 4d for instance h2o2 qys from srnom top three points were much higher than from other nom and h2o2 qys from other nom were similar to those from bc we thus infer that ppris productions from bc and nom follow similar paths and efficiencies those findingly based on systematic investigations of ppris qys from numerous samples largely complemented previous findings li et al 2019 on comparison of ppris production from bc and nom in stark contrast im were not capable of producing triplet exicited state or 1o2 production and the h2o2 production was 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those from bc and nom oh production from im varied among mineral species with magnetite showing higher qys than those of bc and nom ppris from nom have demonstrated great impacts on the element cycles and transformation of pollutants given the similar ppris productions from bc and nom ppris from bc could also affect biogeochemical processes in natural waters depending on the abundance of bc for instance bc under sunlight irradiation could mediate rapid transformation of atenolol half life 3 7 h cimetidine hall life 15 9 h dominated by 3bc and 1o2 respectively using noon sunlight at the equator on the day of spring equinox as an example 4 conclusions our study provided a systematic investigation on ppris production qys from bc to our knowledge this work was the first to assess the ppris qys spectrum of bc which can be applied for estimating ppris productions under varying spatio temporal and climatic conditions given the increasing natural abundance of bc with more frequent wildfires coppola et al 2018 those results can help advance our understandings on the role of bc sourced ppris on biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in natural sunlit waters such as rivers and lakes unlike those in fresh water we expect that ppris qys in seawater would be more complicated because high content of ions will likely affect electron transfer processes parker et al 2013 wan et al 2019 e g inhibited electron transfer from 3bc and quench reactive radicals grebel et al 2010 e g oh br br oh atmospheric aerosol droplet is another major natural pool of bc traditional studies on atmospheric bc mostly focus on its light absorption and resultant contribution to global warming liu et al 2017 ramanathan and carmichael 2008 randerson et al 2006 leaving the photochemical activities largely untapped he et al 2022 our results suggest that there might exist substantial ppris productions and subsequent ppris mediated reactions in bc containing droplets further our study reveals higher ppris qys from at short wavelength sunlight compared to the sunlight irradiation on the ground bc in atmospheric droplets receive higher intensity and portion of uv light irradiation which could be translated to more efficient ppris productions therefore bc photochemistry may play a previous overlooked role in cycles of atmospheric elements e g sulfur and transformation of

15231,this study investigated the roles of diverse free available chlorine fac species including hocl ocl h2ocl cl2o and cl2 in the degradation of micropollutants the degradation of 5 micropollutants was significantly affected by ph fac dosage and chloride cl concentration the reaction orders in fac n of 5 micropollutants acetaminophen carbamazepine naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop ranged from 1 4 0 2 to 2 1 0 3 at ph 3 5 evidencing the importance of cl2o and cl2 for micropollutant abatement a simplified method for the determination of second order rate constants k of specific fac species with micropollutants was developed herein the k for neutral dissociated forms of 5 micropollutants with cl2 and cl2o were determined in the ranges of 9 3 0 2 102 2 9 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 0 1 104 3 7 0 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively they were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl whereas those of ocl and h2ocl were negligible by using kinetic modeling cl2 was more important under acidic conditions and higher cl levels with contributions of 37 9 99 2 at ph 5 in pure water cl2o played a dominant role in micropollutant degradation in pure water 56 4 87 3 under neutral conditions furthermore both cl2 and cl2o played vital roles in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorination of carbamazepine and natural organic matter this study highlights the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 in micropollutant abatement and dbp formation during chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine micropollutants disinfection byproducts dbps kinetics water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorine also known as free available chlorine fac is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment worldwide fac is commonly used for pretreatment and or post treatment in drinking water for disinfection which can efficiently inactivate microorganisms lechevallier et al 1988 bois et al 1997 mcguire 2006 fac as a chemical oxidant also reacts quickly with numerous inorganic and organic micropollutants e g fe2 as3 cn no2 phenols amines pesticides and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps etc deborde et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 duirk and collette 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 the concentrations of most organic micropollutants range from ng l to μg l in aquatic environments yang et al 2022 the most abundant fac species in solutions are hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ions ocl in which hocl e0 1 49 v is much more important for its higher oxidation capacity than ocl e0 0 89 v deborde and von gunten 2008 garcia segura et al 2018 therefore hocl is usually considered as the predominant chlorinating agent in water treatment in fact other fac species such as dichlorine monoxide cl2o molecular chlorine cl2 and the conjugate acid of hocl h2ocl also exist lau et al 2016 rose et al 2020 cl2o exists in equilibrium with hocl and its formation is favored at a high fac dosage eqs 1 2 in table 1 acidic conditions accelerate the formation of h2ocl eq 3 in table 1 and cl2 eqs 4 5 in table 1 especially in solutions containing abundant chloride cl the concentrations of cl2o cl2 and h2ocl are 1 7 10 12 m 3 3 10 13 m and 1 4 10 14 m respectively in chlorination under typical drinking water conditions 28 µm fac and 0 3 mm cl at ph 7 5 which are 7 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of hocl 1 4 10 5 m and ocl 1 4 10 5 m lau et al 2016 cl2 is important at ph 6 and higher cl concentrations sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 lau et al 2016 for instance the concentration of cl2 increased by 4 orders of magnitude with ph declining from 6 to 2 at 28 µm fac and 0 3 mm cl lau et al 2016 the importance of other fac species for micropollutant abatement was recognized under acidic conditions the conclusions however were inconsistent some early works conjectured that h2ocl or cl2 played dominant roles in the degradation of bisphenol a gemfibrozil naproxen and trimethoprim in chlorination under acidic conditions and the second order rate constants k of h2ocl or cl2 104 106 m 1 s 1 were reported to be 3 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl gallard et al 2004 pinkston and sedlak 2004 dodd and huang 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 later raman spectroscopy marked out cl2 rather than h2ocl as the reactive fac species responsible for the degradation of secondary alcohols at ph 5 cherney et al 2006 meanwhile cl2 rather than h2ocl was reported to degrade dimethenamid at ph 6 sivey et al 2010 in contrast the rapid degradation of benzophenone 3 and β triketone herbicides was attributable to hocl at ph 7 while the role of cl2 or h2ocl was not recognized abdallah et al 2015 tawk et al 2015 therefore the specific roles of cl2 and or h2ocl in the abatement of micropollutants are largely unknown cl2o is another commonly overlooked fac species for the degradation of some organic compounds sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 lau et al 2016 lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 the k for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with dimethenamid were reported to be 0 18 1 37 106 and 1 21 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and the contribution of cl2o was up to 50 under typical drinking water conditions sivey et al 2010 also cl2o and cl2 played important roles in the chlorination of phenolics compounds lau et al 2016 broadwater et al 2018 and olefins lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 under neutral conditions and high fac cl concentrations respectively since the k of cl2o and cl2 were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl overall the available kinetic results suggested that the less abundant fac species such as cl2o and cl2 displayed significant roles in chlorination of several micropollutants to differentiate the roles of different fac species during chlorination it is vital to develop a method to determine their kinetics sivey et al 2010 employed a nonlinear least squares regression model to simulate the k of different fac species reacting with micropollutants based on experimental data with varying ph fac dosages and cl concentrations the k of cl2o and cl2 were fitted iteratively under specific conditions this method requires a large amount of kinetic data sivey et al 2010 although the chlorination of micropollutants such as plasticizer bisphenol a β blockers atenolol metoprolol nadolol and propranolol fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin analgesic naproxen lipid regulator gemfibrozil pyrimidine trimethoprim and sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole sulfamethizole sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole was reported gallard et al 2004 pinkston and sedlak 2004 dodd et al 2005 chamberlain and adams 2006 dodd and huang 2007 these studies mainly focused on the reactivities of hocl ocl with micropollutants however the specific reactivities of fac species such as cl2 and cl2o with structurally diverse micropollutants remains unknown this study developed a simplified method to evaluate the reactivity of specific fac species toward diverse micropollutants during chlorination of natural organic matter nom a representative disinfection byproduct dbp precursor the formed dbps were deemed to be attributable to hocl ocl in previous studies shah et al 2011 bond et al 2014 sivey et al 2012 proposed that cl2 and cl2o oxidation of dbp precursors might enhance the formation rate of trihalomethanes thms however no evidence was provided as discussed above changing of fac cl concentrations and ph significantly altered the conversion from hocl to cl2 cl2o however the roles of cl2 and cl2o dbp formation during chlorination are largely unclear the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a simplified method for the determination of k of various fac species of cl2 cl2o h2ocl hocl and ocl reacting with micropollutants 2 to quantify specific roles of fac species in micropollutant degradation and 3 to evaluate the roles of cl2 and cl2o in dbp formation during chlorination of micropollutants and nom five micropollutants including 4 ppcps acetaminophen a substituted phenol carbamazepine an olefin naproxen a naphthalene ring derivative gemfibrozil and a typical herbicide mecoprop two aromatic ethers with different functional groups were selected as target compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all solutions were prepared with reagent grade chemicals in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a milli q system millipore a fac stock solution was prepared from 4 4 99 sodium hypochlorite naocl sigma aldrich the sources of the chemicals are provided in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 2 experimental procedures the kinetic experiments were conducted in a 250 ml conical flask with continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature 25 2 c as for the degradation kinetics of 5 micropollutants acetaminophen carbamazepine naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop a 200 ml testing solution containing any micropollutant without or with extra cl 1 2 5 and 10 mm was dosed with fac 100 μm 2 mm at ph 3 11 solution ph was controlled by adding 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 5 5 8 5 and small volumes of h2so4 or naoh note that phosphate buffer did not affect the degradation of micropollutants measurement revealed that the ph changed by less than 0 1 ph unit over the course of each experiment samples 1 ml were quenched by na2s2o3 the ionic strength was adjusted to 0 1 m by nano3 the degradation of micropollutants was also evaluated in two kinds of real water drinking water and groundwater the groundwater was sampled from suishi village guangzhou china as for dbp formation nom 3 mg l and carbamazepine 10 μm were used to evaluate the formation of dbps in cl2 and cl2o driven systems also total organic chlorine tocl was measured during chlorination of carbamazepine text s2 all tests were performed at least twice and the error bars in the plots represent the maximum and minimum of experimental data from the duplicated test results 2 3 analytical

employed to explore the relationship between the structures of 5 aromatic micropollutants and their reactivities towards cl2 and cl2o respectively hammett σp constants were calculated to represent the electron donating large negative value or electron withdrawing large positive value properties of substituents on aromatic compounds hansch et al 1991 hansch et al 1995 lee and von gunten 2012 to simplify the complex structures of micropollutants a structural approximation was used in which only one or two neighboring atoms from an aromatic ring determined the inductive resonance effects of whole substituents details shown in text s3 lee and von gunten 2012 2 5 kinetic model a kinetic model for the chlorination of micropollutants was first developed using kintecus software ianni 2012 which aimed to quantify the specific roles of chlorine species for micropollutant degradation the model contains 14 reactions table 1 and the reaction rate constants were obtained from literatures or determined in this study arotsky and symons 1962 eigen and kustin 1962 wang and margerum 1994 sivey et al 2010 hou et al 2018 huang and zhang 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of micropollutants by chlorination chlorination experiments were carried out under pseudo first order conditions in which fac fac 0 constant p 0 to elucidate the influence of various fac species on the reaction kinetics pseudo first order rate constant k obs s 1 for the degradation of each micropollutant was obtained from exponential decay of p p 0 vs time data figs s1 s5 the overall rate for the degradation of each micropollutant can be described in eq 1 1 d p t dt k obs p 0 herein p 0 represents the initial concentration of any micropollutant and p t represents the specific concentration of micropollutant at different reaction times 3 1 1 effect of ph ph significantly altered the degradation kinetics of 5 micropollutants by chlorination in pure water fig 1 the k obs of carbamazepine mecoprop gemfibrozil and naproxen monotonically decreased from 0 12 4 12 10 3 s 1 to 3 33 10 5 s 1 and negligible with increasing ph from 3 to 11 fig 1a and d in contrast as ph rose from 4 to 7 the k obs of acetaminophen had a decrease and then increase pattern with the minimum of 1 47 10 4 s 1 at ph 5 fig 1e the variations of k obs of micropollutants at different phs depend on the forms of both fac species and micropollutants which can be explained as follows 1 ph affects the species of fac pk a 7 5 for hocl ocl eqs 6 7 in table 1 and the conversion from hocl to h2ocl and cl2 eqs 3 4 in table 1 generally cl2 is more important at ph 6 lau et al 2016 the k obs of carbamazepine mecoprop gemfibrozil and naproxen decreased with increasing ph due to the decreased concentration of h2ocl or and cl2 2 ph alters the dissociation of micropollutants generally hocl has different reactivities toward micropollutants with neutral and anionic cationic forms deborde and von gunten 2008 soufan et al 2013 krkošek et al 2014 cao et al 2016 the higher k obs of acetaminophen at a higher ph was presumably due to the dissociation of its phenolic group as the k of hocl reacting with its dissociated form 7000 m 1 s 1 is much higher than its neutral form 3 1 m 1 s 1 pinkston and sedlak 2004 3 1 2 effect of chloride concentration fig 2 shows that adding extra cl concentration cl added 1 2 5 and 10 mm greatly increased the k obs of 5 micropollutants at ph 5 the k obs of 5 micropollutants monotonically increased with increasing cl added from 0 to 10 mm and they were around 2 72 times at 1 10 mm cl added higher than those in the absence of extra cl cl 0 0 1 or 0 2 mm as cl concentration is equal to chlorine concentration in fac stock solutions the enhancement in reaction rates with increasing cl concentration at acidic conditions was attributed to reactions toward cl2 as cl and h accelerate the conversion from hocl to cl2 eq 4 in table 1 cl concentration at ph 6 had no obvious effect on the k obs of micropollutants indicating the negligible role of cl2 at neutral or alkaline conditions fig s6 3 1 3 effect of fac dosage fig 3 shows the effect of fac dosage on the k obs of 5 micropollutants by chlorination at ph 5 the k obs of 5 micropollutants monotonically increased by around 3 2 138 times with increasing fac dosage from 0 1 to 2 mm furthermore the reaction orders n for the chlorination of the selected 5 micropollutants were investigated at specific ph with varying initial fac dosages fac 0 experiments of different fac 0 were conducted under pseudo first order conditions and the k obs can be expressed via eq 2 2 k obs k app fac 0 n k app here is a ph dependent total apparent rate constant lau et al 2019 a log transformation of eq 2 yields eq 3 3 log k obs log k app n log fac 0 therefore the reaction order in fac i e values of n can be determined via linear regressions of log k obs versus log fac 0 fig 3 also shows that log fac 0 had a positive relationship with the log k obs values of 5 micropollutants by chlorination the slopes n of the linear regressions were 1 4 0 2 for acetaminophen 1 6 0 3 for carbamazepine 2 0 0 3 for mecoprop 2 1 0 7 for naproxen and 2 1 0 3 for gemfibrozil respectively based on the obtained n values the roles of other fac species such as cl2o cl2 and h2ocl were verified 1 considering that h2ocl is proportional to hocl eq 3 in table 1 the reaction should be first order in chlorination when h2ocl plays a dominant role 2 if cl2o is the predominant fac species the reaction is second order in chlorination because cl2o is proportional to hocl 2 eqs 1 2 in table 1 3 the reaction is also considered as a second order reaction if cl2 is the major fac species since cl2 depended on both hocl and cl which is equal to hocl 2 due to the approximately equimolar concentrations of cl and hocl in fac solutions eqs 4 5 in table 1 sivey et al 2010 lau et al 2019 herein the obtained n values were larger than 1 0 indicating that cl2o and cl2 also participated in chlorination besides the most abundant hocl overall these results indicate that the degradation of micropollutants by chlorination was significantly affected by ph cl concentration and fac dosage presumably due to the alteration of different chlorine species 3 2 second order rate constants of micropollutants with fac species the k of specific fac species hocl ocl h2ocl cl2 and cl2o reacting with the 5 micropollutants were determined based on the degradation kinetics at a wide range of phs cl concentrations and fac dosages the k obs of any micropollutant during chlorination can be expressed via eq 4 4 k obs k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k h 2 oc l h 2 oc l k oc l oc l k hocl k cl2o k cl2 k h2ocl and k ocl here represent apparent k for the reaction of hocl cl2o cl2 h2ocl and ocl with specific micropollutant at a certain ph respectively an iterative fitting method was employed to fit k of specific fac species as reported by sivey et al 2010 first k cl2 was simulated by the data varying cl levels at ph 7 0 second a data set at lower ph without cl was used to estimate k cl2o by assuming that the reactivities of hocl with micropollutants were negligible k hocl 0 then k hocl was simulated at higher ph finally k cl2 and k cl2o were re fitted based on the obtained k hocl this method assumes that k hocl is negligible to fit k cl2 and k cl2o and it requires extensive kinetic data therefore a simplified method was developed in this study based on the aforementioned k obs data at different phs and fac cl concentrations scheme 1 shows the flowchart for the determination of k of specific chlorine species with target micropollutant which includes the following steps 1 to determine reactivities of ocl at ph 8 and h2ocl at acidic conditions 2 to calculate the specific k cl2 of neutral k cl2 ha and dissociated forms k cl2 a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k cl2 obtained by varying cl levels at two different phs ph 6 along with the obtained k h2ocl and k ocl 3 to calculate specific k hocl of neutral k hocl ha and dissociated forms k hocl a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k hocl determined by varying fac dosages at two different phs ph 8 together with the known k h2ocl k ocl k cl2 ha and k cl2 a and 4 to calculate k cl2o of the neutral k cl2o ha and dissociated forms k cl2o a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k cl2o which were obtained from step 3 more details shown in text s4 unlike the iterative fitting method reported by sivey et al 2010 this method does not assume that k hocl is negligible and does not include complicated iterative steps specifically k h2ocl k ocl k cl2 k hocl and k cl2o of neutral and dissociated forms of micropollutants were determined by apparent k of each fac species at certain phs sequentially the ks of 5 micropollutants with specific fac are summarized in table 2 step 1 k h2ocl and k ocl the acid catalysis experiments were employed to investigate the reactivity of h2ocl the k obs of a certain micropollutant was analyzed as a function of cl concentration at different phs fig s7 shows the intercept values were mostly consistent and they were not varied with changing phs details shown in text s5 thereby excluding the roles of h2ocl for micropollutant abatement the k h2ocl of 5 micropollutants were negligible besides carbamazepine gemfibrozil naproxen and mecoprop were resistant to chlorination at alkaline conditions fig s8 and fig 1 evidencing that k ocl was negligible step 2 k cl2 based on eqs 1 and 4 in table 1 and the results in step 1 eq 4 was simplified to eq 5 by considering the negligible reactivities of h2ocl and ocl 5 k obs k cl 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k cl 2 k 2 hocl cl h k c l 2 o k 1 hocl 2 k hocl hocl a c l b herein a equals to k cl2 k2 hocl h and b equals to k cl2o k1 hocl 2 k hocl hocl by analyzing the k obs as a function of cl concentration at a fixed fac dosage and ph ph 6 the apparent k cl2 at certain ph was determined via the value of a in eq 5 by linear regression figs 2 and s3 the k cl2 ha and k cl2 a were further calculated by combining two apparent k cl2 at two phs via eq 6 scheme 1 and text s4 6 k c l 2 i k c l 2 ha α ha i k c l 2 a α a i here i represents the different ph conditions αha and αa represent the neutral and dissociated fractions of a certain micropollutant respectively as shown in table 2 the k cl2 ha values were calculated to be 6 8 0 5 104 m 1 s 1 for acetaminophen 4 9 0 5 107 m 1 s 1 for naproxen 6 0 0 1 105 m 1 s 1 for carbamazepine 4 1 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 for gemfibrozil and 1 1 0 1 103 m 1 s 1 for mecoprop respectively the k cl2 a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 2 9 0 2 109 1 6 0 1 107 6 3 0 5 106 and 9 3 0 2 102 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible step 3 k hocl by using the determined k cl2 ha and k cl2 a in step 2 the apparent k

gemfibrozil and 0 04 0 01 m 1 s 1 for mecoprop respectively the k hocl a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 5 3 0 2 103 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 and 0 03 0 01 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible the results of k hocl for acetaminophen are consistent with those reported in the literatures table 2 pinkston and sedlak 2004 cao et al 2016 step 4 k cl2o combining two apparent k cl2o at two phs ph 8 obtained from step 3 the k cl2o ha and k cl2o a were calculated via eq 9 fig s5 scheme 1 and text s4 9 k c l 2 o i k c l 2 o ha α ha i k c l 2 o a α a i as shown in table 2 the k cl2o ha of acetaminophen naproxen carbamazepine gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 2 4 0 2 105 2 9 0 7 107 4 2 0 8 104 5 8 0 1 107 and 3 8 0 3 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the k cl2o a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 3 7 0 6 109 4 5 0 2 106 4 8 0 5 106 and 1 8 0 1 104 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible as can be seen both k cl2 and k cl2o were approximately 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than k hocl presumably due to the higher electrophilic capacity of cl2 and cl2o than hocl lau et al 2019 additionally the difference on k cl2 and k cl2o among 5 micropollutants can be rationalized by their different structures in which micropollutants containing the strong electron donating groups aromatic ethers for gemfibrozil and naproxen are susceptible to cl2 and cl2o compared to mecoprop containing the electron withdrawing group cl dodd and huang 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 sivey and roberts 2012 to better explain the reactivities of fac species toward the aromatic micropollutants a primary qsar was established based on the assumption that the benzene ring was the main attacking site fig s9 shows a good correlation between hammett constants and apparent k hocl k cl2 and k cl2o respectively the reactivities of both cl2 and cl2o toward micropollutants increased significantly as hammett constants decreased this result evidences that cl2 and cl2o reacting with aromatic micropollutants rely on the electron donating properties of substituents on aromatic ring which was consistent to the electrophilicity of hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 3 3 contributions of cl2 cl2o and hocl to micropollutant degradation by model simulation to quantify the specific contributions of different fac species for micropollutant abatement by chlorination a kinetic model containing 14 reactions was developed shown in table 1 by multiplying the individual fac species concentrations with the molecular reaction rate constants the roles of hocl cl2 and cl2o were determined fig s10 shows the modeling k obs k model fitted the experimental results well as shown in fig 4 a cl2 dominated the degradation of carbamazepine naproxen and mecoprop with fractions of cl2 f cl2 of 65 2 54 3 and 57 6 respectively followed by f cl2o of 29 3 28 2 and 29 4 and f hocl of 5 5 17 5 and 13 0 respectively at ph 5 without extra cl cl2o 46 2 54 5 dominated the degradation of acetaminophen and gemfibrozil while cl2 18 6 37 9 was less significant relatively fig 4a the presence of extra 10 mm cl significantly altered the fractions of fac species for micropollutant degradation at ph 5 specifically cl2 dominated the degradation of all the 5 micropollutants with f cl2 of 91 9 99 2 while f cl2o and f hocl were less important 8 1 10 mm cl promoted the conversion from hocl to cl2 at acidic conditions eqs 4 5 in table 1 resulting in the significantly increased contribution of cl2 fig 4b evaluates the effects of ph on the specific roles of fac species for micropollutant degradation in the absence of extra cl by kinetic modeling increasing ph decreased contribution of cl2 for 5 micropollutant abatement but increased those of both cl2o and hocl at ph 6 cl2o dominated the abatement of 5 micropollutants with f cl2o of 53 7 83 0 which roles were 1 2 2 6 times higher compared to ph 5 the roles of cl2 3 5 20 2 were 3 2 6 8 times lower than those at ph 5 except for mecoprop with a negligible role of cl2 0 1 while hocl 11 6 33 3 was 1 2 2 4 times higher at ph 7 the degradation of 5 micropollutants was primarily ascribed to cl2o 56 4 87 3 followed by hocl 12 2 43 2 and cl2 2 47 the contributions of cl2o were 1 2 2 8 times higher than those at ph 5 the above results suggest that cl2 contributes slightly to the chlorination kinetics at ph 6 and cl2o dominated micropollutant degradation at neutral conditions 3 4 roles of cl2 and cl2o on dbp formation to create the cl2 and cl2o driven systems during chlorination we increased cl concentrations at ph 5 2 and increased fac dosages at ph 6 1 respectively the concentration of cl2 increased by 2 orders of magnitude with increasing cl added from 0 to 50 mm fig 5 a as fac dosage rose from 0 5 to 2 mm the concentration of cl2o increased from 2 2 10 9 to 3 8 10 8 m although the co existence of cl in fac solution promoted cl2 formation its concentration was around 1 orders of magnitude lower than that of cl2o in the created cl2o driven system fig 5b thus the cl2 and cl2o driven systems can be created as expected then we evaluated the dbp formation driven by cl2 and cl2o as follows fig 5c and d show the dbp formation driven by cl2 and cl2o during carbamazepine chlorination respectively tcm tcaa and dcaa were the dominant dbps in the cl2 driven system and their yields at 2 5 h increased by 1 8 9 2 and 5 5 times with increasing cl added from 0 to 50 mm respectively the increase of dbps was consistent with the increase of cl2 concentration fig 5a indicating the dominant role of cl2 for dbp formation meanwhile in the cl2o driven system the yields of tcm tcaa and dcaa increased by 3 8 10 8 and 5 4 times respectively when fac dosage increased from 0 5 to 2 mm fig 5d this result verifies that cl2o played a vital role on dbp formation as carbamazepine was inert to hocl and ocl furthermore the formation of tocl was negligible in both hocl and ocl driven systems while it significantly increased in cl2 and cl2o driven systems the yields of tocl increased by 1 6 times with increasing cl add from 0 to 5 mm at ph 5 while it increased by 3 9 times when fac dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 5 mm at ph 6 fig 5e indicating the contribution of cl2 and cl2o to the tocl formation during carbamazepine chlorination as nom is the most representative dbp precursor during chlorination of surface water and drinking water we also evaluated the dbp formation from nom in cl2 and cl2o driven systems as shown in fig 6 in the cl2 driven system the yields of total dbps at 24 h increased from 183 4 to 249 6 μg l with increasing cl added from 0 to 100 mm fig s11 among them tcm tcaa and dcaa were the dominant dbps which yields increased from 77 7 62 0 and 18 3 μg l at 0 mm cl added to 97 6 89 5 and 22 8 μg l at 100 mm cl added respectively fig 6a the formation of dbps during nom chlorination like carbamazepine were consistent with the alteration of cl2 concentration indicating the important roles of cl2 in dbp formation as for the cl2o driven system the yields of total dbps monotonically increased from 172 9 to 281 7 μg l with increasing fac from 10 to 60 mg l during nom chlorination fig s11 the yields of tcm tcaa and dcaa at 24 h increased from 70 9 57 5 and 18 7 μg l at 10 mg l fac to 133 4 92 8 and 22 0 μg l at 60 mg l fac respectively fig 6b the formation of dbps includes multi step reactions during chlorination in which cl2o and cl2 might play multiple roles 1 some precursors which are inert to hocl and ocl such as carbamazepine can be activated by cl2o and cl2 table 2 and fig 4 the activated products are likely to be more sensitive toward hocl resulting in the enhanced formation of dbps and tocl on the other hand cl2o and cl2 are important for less reactive products toward hocl to further increase the dbp formation for instance hocl transforms phenol to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol rapidly via sequential chlorine substitution at ortho and para position lau et al 2016 then 2 4 6 trichlorophenol reacts with hocl at a low rate constant of 3 4 m 1 s 1 lau et al 2016 which is a rate limiting step for dbp formation however the reactivities of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol towards cl2o and cl2 are 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than that toward hocl thus cl2 and cl2o are likely to contribute to subsequent dbp formation lau et al 2016 2 as compared to hocl cl2o and cl2 dominate the transformation of some aromatic compounds such as phenolics and aromatic esters sivey and roberts 2012 which may form chlorinated products for example the rate constants of 3 methylanisole and salicylic acid towards cl2o and cl2 are 5 7 orders of magnitude higher than those towards hocl sivey and roberts 2012 broadwater et al 2018 the concentrations of cl2o and cl2 can be 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of hocl under the abovementioned conditions by multiplying the concentrations of cl2o cl2 with the reaction rate constants the roles of cl2o cl2 are vital in the transformation of these compounds compared to hocl further research is warranted to differentiate the specific roles of cl2o and cl2 in dbp formation 4 conclusions and engineering implications in this work the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 in chlorination were elucidated with respects on micropollutant transformation as well as dbp formation a simplified method was developed to obtain more accurate k of various fac species with 5 micropollutants among which the reactivities of cl2o and cl2 were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those with hocl a relatively linear relationship was found between the reactivities of cl2 cl2o and the hammett σσp constants for aromatic micropollutants indicating that electron donating groups promoted the attack of benzene derivatives by cl2 cl2o by using a kinetic model cl2o played dominant roles on micropollutant degradation in pure water 56 4 87 3 at ph 7 and cl2 was more pronounced at acidic conditions and higher cl levels with the contribution of 37 9 99 2 at ph 5 both cl2 and cl2o played vital roles for dbp formation and tcm dcaa and tcaa were the major dbps by chlorination of carbamazepine and nom the roles of cl2 and cl2o as chlorinating agents were often neglected due to their low concentrations under typical water treatment conditions fig s12 shows the degradation of carbamazepine gemfibrozil and naproxen under typical conditions of groundwater and drinking water at ph 7 water quality parameters is shown in table s2 cl2o dominated the degradation of 3 micropollutants in drinking water 84 3 89 3 and groundwater 81 7 88 2 while cl2 and hocl played minor roles of 2 6 12 2 and 3 3 11 5 respectively in summary the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 for micropollutant abatement and dbp formation deserve more attention during chlorination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15231,this study investigated the roles of diverse free available chlorine fac species including hocl ocl h2ocl cl2o and cl2 in the degradation of micropollutants the degradation of 5 micropollutants was significantly affected by ph fac dosage and chloride cl concentration the reaction orders in fac n of 5 micropollutants acetaminophen carbamazepine naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop ranged from 1 4 0 2 to 2 1 0 3 at ph 3 5 evidencing the importance of cl2o and cl2 for micropollutant abatement a simplified method for the determination of second order rate constants k of specific fac species with micropollutants was developed herein the k for neutral dissociated forms of 5 micropollutants with cl2 and cl2o were determined in the ranges of 9 3 0 2 102 2 9 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 0 1 104 3 7 0 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively they were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl whereas those of ocl and h2ocl were negligible by using kinetic modeling cl2 was more important under acidic conditions and higher cl levels with contributions of 37 9 99 2 at ph 5 in pure water cl2o played a dominant role in micropollutant degradation in pure water 56 4 87 3 under neutral conditions furthermore both cl2 and cl2o played vital roles in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorination of carbamazepine and natural organic matter this study highlights the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 in micropollutant abatement and dbp formation during chlorination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine micropollutants disinfection byproducts dbps kinetics water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorine also known as free available chlorine fac is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment worldwide fac is commonly used for pretreatment and or post treatment in drinking water for disinfection which can efficiently inactivate microorganisms lechevallier et al 1988 bois et al 1997 mcguire 2006 fac as a chemical oxidant also reacts quickly with numerous inorganic and organic micropollutants e g fe2 as3 cn no2 phenols amines pesticides and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps etc deborde et al 2004 dodd et al 2006 duirk and collette 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 the concentrations of most organic micropollutants range from ng l to μg l in aquatic environments yang et al 2022 the most abundant fac species in solutions are hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ions ocl in which hocl e0 1 49 v is much more important for its higher oxidation capacity than ocl e0 0 89 v deborde and von gunten 2008 garcia segura et al 2018 therefore hocl is usually considered as the predominant chlorinating agent in water treatment in fact other fac species such as dichlorine monoxide cl2o molecular chlorine cl2 and the conjugate acid of hocl h2ocl also exist lau et al 2016 rose et al 2020 cl2o exists in equilibrium with hocl and its formation is favored at a high fac dosage eqs 1 2 in table 1 acidic conditions accelerate the formation of h2ocl eq 3 in table 1 and cl2 eqs 4 5 in table 1 especially in solutions containing abundant chloride cl the concentrations of cl2o cl2 and h2ocl are 1 7 10 12 m 3 3 10 13 m and 1 4 10 14 m respectively in chlorination under typical drinking water conditions 28 µm fac and 0 3 mm cl at ph 7 5 which are 7 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of hocl 1 4 10 5 m and ocl 1 4 10 5 m lau et al 2016 cl2 is important at ph 6 and higher cl concentrations sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 lau et al 2016 for instance the concentration of cl2 increased by 4 orders of magnitude with ph declining from 6 to 2 at 28 µm fac and 0 3 mm cl lau et al 2016 the importance of other fac species for micropollutant abatement was recognized under acidic conditions the conclusions however were inconsistent some early works conjectured that h2ocl or cl2 played dominant roles in the degradation of bisphenol a gemfibrozil naproxen and trimethoprim in chlorination under acidic conditions and the second order rate constants k of h2ocl or cl2 104 106 m 1 s 1 were reported to be 3 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl gallard et al 2004 pinkston and sedlak 2004 dodd and huang 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 later raman spectroscopy marked out cl2 rather than h2ocl as the reactive fac species responsible for the degradation of secondary alcohols at ph 5 cherney et al 2006 meanwhile cl2 rather than h2ocl was reported to degrade dimethenamid at ph 6 sivey et al 2010 in contrast the rapid degradation of benzophenone 3 and β triketone herbicides was attributable to hocl at ph 7 while the role of cl2 or h2ocl was not recognized abdallah et al 2015 tawk et al 2015 therefore the specific roles of cl2 and or h2ocl in the abatement of micropollutants are largely unknown cl2o is another commonly overlooked fac species for the degradation of some organic compounds sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 lau et al 2016 lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 the k for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with dimethenamid were reported to be 0 18 1 37 106 and 1 21 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and the contribution of cl2o was up to 50 under typical drinking water conditions sivey et al 2010 also cl2o and cl2 played important roles in the chlorination of phenolics compounds lau et al 2016 broadwater et al 2018 and olefins lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 under neutral conditions and high fac cl concentrations respectively since the k of cl2o and cl2 were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those of hocl overall the available kinetic results suggested that the less abundant fac species such as cl2o and cl2 displayed significant roles in chlorination of several micropollutants to differentiate the roles of different fac species during chlorination it is vital to develop a method to determine their kinetics sivey et al 2010 employed a nonlinear least squares regression model to simulate the k of different fac species reacting with micropollutants based on experimental data with varying ph fac dosages and cl concentrations the k of cl2o and cl2 were fitted iteratively under specific conditions this method requires a large amount of kinetic data sivey et al 2010 although the chlorination of micropollutants such as plasticizer bisphenol a β blockers atenolol metoprolol nadolol and propranolol fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin analgesic naproxen lipid regulator gemfibrozil pyrimidine trimethoprim and sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole sulfamethizole sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole was reported gallard et al 2004 pinkston and sedlak 2004 dodd et al 2005 chamberlain and adams 2006 dodd and huang 2007 these studies mainly focused on the reactivities of hocl ocl with micropollutants however the specific reactivities of fac species such as cl2 and cl2o with structurally diverse micropollutants remains unknown this study developed a simplified method to evaluate the reactivity of specific fac species toward diverse micropollutants during chlorination of natural organic matter nom a representative disinfection byproduct dbp precursor the formed dbps were deemed to be attributable to hocl ocl in previous studies shah et al 2011 bond et al 2014 sivey et al 2012 proposed that cl2 and cl2o oxidation of dbp precursors might enhance the formation rate of trihalomethanes thms however no evidence was provided as discussed above changing of fac cl concentrations and ph significantly altered the conversion from hocl to cl2 cl2o however the roles of cl2 and cl2o dbp formation during chlorination are largely unclear the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a simplified method for the determination of k of various fac species of cl2 cl2o h2ocl

micropollutants measurement revealed that the ph changed by less than 0 1 ph unit over the course of each experiment samples 1 ml were quenched by na2s2o3 the ionic strength was adjusted to 0 1 m by nano3 the degradation of micropollutants was also evaluated in two kinds of real water drinking water and groundwater the groundwater was sampled from suishi village guangzhou china as for dbp

employed to explore the relationship between the structures of 5 aromatic micropollutants and their reactivities towards cl2 and cl2o respectively hammett σp constants were calculated to represent the electron donating large negative value or electron withdrawing large positive value properties of substituents on aromatic compounds hansch et al 1991 hansch et al 1995 lee and von gunten 2012 to simplify the complex structures of micropollutants a structural approximation was used in which only one or two neighboring atoms from an aromatic ring determined the inductive resonance effects of whole substituents details shown in text s3 lee and von gunten 2012 2 5 kinetic model a kinetic model for the chlorination of micropollutants was first developed using kintecus software ianni 2012 which aimed to quantify the specific roles of chlorine species for micropollutant degradation the model contains 14 reactions table 1 and the reaction rate constants were obtained from literatures or determined in this study arotsky and symons 1962 eigen and kustin 1962 wang and margerum 1994 sivey et al 2010 hou et al 2018 huang and zhang 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of micropollutants by chlorination chlorination experiments were carried out under pseudo first order conditions in which fac fac 0 constant p 0 to elucidate the influence of various fac species on the reaction kinetics pseudo first order rate constant k obs s 1 for the degradation of each micropollutant was obtained from exponential decay of p p 0 vs time data figs s1 s5 the overall rate for the degradation of each micropollutant can be described in eq 1 1 d p t dt k obs p 0 herein p 0 represents the initial concentration of any micropollutant and p t represents the specific concentration of micropollutant at different reaction times 3 1 1 effect of ph ph significantly altered the degradation kinetics of 5 micropollutants by chlorination in pure water fig 1 the k obs of carbamazepine mecoprop gemfibrozil and naproxen monotonically decreased from 0 12 4 12 10 3 s 1 to 3 33 10 5 s 1 and negligible with increasing ph from 3 to 11 fig 1a and d in contrast as ph rose from 4 to 7 the k obs of acetaminophen had a decrease and then increase pattern with the minimum of 1 47 10 4 s 1 at ph 5 fig 1e the variations of k obs of micropollutants at different phs depend on the forms of both fac species and micropollutants which can be explained as follows 1 ph affects the species of fac pk a 7 5 for hocl ocl eqs 6 7 in table 1 and the conversion from hocl to h2ocl and cl2 eqs 3 4 in table 1 generally cl2 is more important at ph 6 lau et al 2016 the k obs of carbamazepine mecoprop gemfibrozil and naproxen decreased with increasing ph due to the decreased concentration of h2ocl or and cl2 2 ph alters the dissociation of micropollutants generally hocl has different reactivities toward micropollutants with neutral and anionic cationic forms deborde and von gunten 2008 soufan et al 2013 krkošek et al 2014 cao et al 2016 the higher k obs of acetaminophen at a higher ph was presumably due to the dissociation of its phenolic group as the k of hocl reacting with its dissociated form 7000 m 1 s 1 is much higher than its neutral form 3 1 m 1 s 1 pinkston and sedlak 2004 3 1 2 effect of chloride concentration fig 2 shows that adding extra cl concentration cl added 1 2 5 and 10 mm greatly increased the k obs of 5 micropollutants at ph 5 the k obs of 5 micropollutants monotonically increased with increasing cl added from 0 to 10 mm and they were around 2 72 times at 1 10 mm cl added higher than those in the absence of extra cl cl 0 0 1 or 0 2 mm as cl concentration is equal to chlorine concentration in fac stock solutions the enhancement in reaction rates with increasing cl concentration at acidic conditions was attributed to reactions toward cl2 as cl and h accelerate the conversion from hocl to cl2 eq 4 in table 1 cl concentration at ph 6 had no obvious effect on the k obs of micropollutants indicating the negligible role of cl2 at neutral or alkaline conditions fig s6 3 1 3 effect of fac dosage fig 3 shows the effect of fac dosage on the k obs of 5 micropollutants by chlorination at ph 5 the k obs of 5 micropollutants monotonically increased by around 3 2 138 times with increasing fac dosage from 0 1 to 2 mm furthermore the reaction orders n for the chlorination of the selected 5 micropollutants were investigated at specific ph with varying initial fac dosages fac 0 experiments of different fac 0 were conducted under pseudo first order conditions and the k obs can be expressed via eq 2 2 k obs k app fac 0 n k app here is a ph dependent total apparent rate constant lau et al 2019 a log transformation of eq 2 yields eq 3 3 log k obs log k app n log fac 0 therefore the reaction order in fac i e values of n can be determined via linear regressions of log k obs versus log fac 0 fig 3 also shows that log fac 0 had a positive relationship with the log k obs values of 5 micropollutants by chlorination the slopes n of the linear regressions were 1 4 0 2 for acetaminophen 1 6 0 3 for carbamazepine 2 0 0 3 for mecoprop 2 1 0 7 for naproxen and 2 1 0 3 for gemfibrozil respectively based on the obtained n values the roles of other fac species such as cl2o cl2 and h2ocl were verified 1 considering that h2ocl is proportional to hocl eq 3 in table 1 the reaction should be first order in chlorination when h2ocl plays a dominant role 2 if cl2o is the predominant fac species the reaction is second order in chlorination because cl2o is proportional to hocl 2 eqs 1 2 in table 1 3 the reaction is also considered as a second order reaction if cl2 is the major fac species since cl2 depended on both hocl and cl which is equal to hocl 2 due to the approximately equimolar concentrations of cl and hocl in fac solutions eqs 4 5 in table 1 sivey et al 2010 lau et al 2019 herein the obtained n values were larger than 1 0 indicating that cl2o and cl2 also participated in chlorination besides the most abundant hocl overall these results indicate that the degradation of micropollutants by chlorination was significantly affected by ph cl concentration and fac dosage presumably due to the alteration of different chlorine species 3 2 second order rate constants of micropollutants with fac species the k of specific fac species hocl ocl h2ocl cl2 and cl2o reacting with the 5 micropollutants were determined based on the degradation kinetics at a wide range of phs cl concentrations and fac dosages the k obs of any micropollutant during chlorination can be expressed via eq 4 4 k obs k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k h 2 oc l h 2 oc l k oc l oc l k hocl k cl2o k cl2 k h2ocl and k ocl here represent apparent k for the reaction of hocl cl2o cl2 h2ocl and ocl with specific micropollutant at a certain ph respectively an iterative fitting method was employed to fit k of specific fac species as reported by sivey et al 2010 first k cl2 was simulated by the data varying cl levels at ph 7 0 second a data set at lower ph without cl was used to estimate k cl2o by assuming that the reactivities of hocl with micropollutants were negligible k hocl 0 then k hocl was simulated at higher ph finally k cl2 and k cl2o were re fitted based on the obtained k hocl this method assumes that k hocl is negligible to fit k cl2 and k cl2o and it requires extensive kinetic data therefore a simplified method was developed in this study based on the aforementioned k obs data at different phs and fac cl concentrations scheme 1 shows the flowchart for the determination of k of specific chlorine species with target micropollutant which includes the following steps 1 to determine reactivities of ocl at ph 8 and h2ocl at acidic conditions 2 to calculate the specific k cl2 of neutral k cl2 ha and dissociated forms k cl2 a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k cl2 obtained by varying cl levels at two different phs ph 6 along with the obtained k h2ocl and k ocl 3 to calculate specific k hocl of neutral k hocl ha and dissociated forms k hocl a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k hocl determined by varying fac dosages at two different phs ph 8 together with the known k h2ocl k ocl k cl2 ha and k cl2 a and 4 to calculate k cl2o of the neutral k cl2o ha and dissociated forms k cl2o a of a certain micropollutant by combining two apparent k cl2o which were obtained from step 3 more details shown in text s4 unlike the iterative fitting method reported by sivey et al 2010 this method does not assume that k hocl is negligible and does not include complicated iterative steps specifically k h2ocl k ocl k cl2 k hocl and k cl2o of neutral and dissociated forms of micropollutants were determined by apparent k of each fac species at certain phs sequentially the ks of 5 micropollutants with specific fac are summarized in table 2 step 1 k h2ocl and k ocl the acid catalysis experiments were employed to investigate the reactivity of h2ocl the k obs of a certain micropollutant was analyzed as a function of cl concentration at different phs fig s7 shows the intercept values were mostly consistent and they were not varied with changing phs details shown in text s5 thereby excluding the roles of h2ocl for micropollutant abatement the k h2ocl of 5 micropollutants were negligible besides carbamazepine gemfibrozil naproxen and mecoprop were resistant to chlorination at alkaline conditions fig s8 and fig 1 evidencing that k ocl was negligible step 2 k cl2 based on eqs 1 and 4 in table 1 and the results in step 1 eq 4 was simplified to eq 5 by considering the negligible reactivities of h2ocl and ocl 5 k obs k cl 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k cl 2 k 2 hocl cl h k c l 2 o k 1 hocl 2 k hocl hocl a c l b herein a equals to k cl2 k2 hocl h and b equals to k cl2o k1 hocl 2 k hocl hocl by analyzing the k obs as a function of cl concentration at a fixed fac dosage and ph ph 6 the apparent k cl2 at certain ph was determined via the value of a in eq 5 by linear regression figs 2 and s3 the k cl2 ha and k cl2 a were further calculated by combining two apparent k cl2 at two phs via eq 6 scheme 1 and text s4 6 k c l 2 i k c l 2 ha α ha i k c l 2 a α a i here i represents the different ph conditions αha and αa represent the neutral and dissociated fractions of a certain micropollutant respectively as shown in table 2 the k cl2 ha values were calculated to be 6 8 0 5 104 m 1 s 1 for acetaminophen 4 9 0 5 107 m 1 s 1 for naproxen 6 0 0 1 105 m 1 s 1 for carbamazepine 4 1 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 for gemfibrozil and 1 1 0 1 103 m 1 s 1 for mecoprop respectively the k cl2 a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 2 9 0 2 109 1 6 0 1 107 6 3 0 5 106 and 9 3 0 2 102 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible step 3 k hocl by using the determined k cl2 ha and k cl2 a in step 2 the apparent k hocl and k cl2o at a certain ph ph 8 were obtained by combining two equations by varying fac dosages without extra cl eq 7 7 k obs k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k c l 2 ha α ha k c l 2 a α a cl 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl then the k hocl ha and k hocl a were further calculated by combining two apparent k hocl at two phs via eq 8 fig s5 scheme 1 and text s4 8 k hocl i k hocl ha α ha i k hocl a α a i as shown in table 2 the k hocl ha values were calculated to be 0 3 0 1 m 1 s 1 for acetaminophen 5 6 1 0 m 1 s 1 for naproxen 0 1 m 1 s 1 for carbamazepine 8 1 1 0 m 1 s 1 for gemfibrozil and 0 04 0 01 m 1 s 1 for mecoprop respectively the k hocl a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 5 3 0 2 103 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 and 0 03 0 01 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible the results of k hocl for acetaminophen are consistent with those reported in the literatures table 2 pinkston and sedlak 2004 cao et al 2016 step 4 k cl2o combining two apparent k cl2o at two phs ph 8 obtained from step 3 the k cl2o ha and k cl2o a were calculated via eq 9 fig s5 scheme 1 and text s4 9 k c l 2 o i k c l 2 o ha α ha i k c l 2 o a α a i as shown in table 2 the k cl2o ha of acetaminophen naproxen carbamazepine gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 2 4 0 2 105 2 9 0 7 107 4 2 0 8 104 5 8 0 1 107 and 3 8 0 3 104 m 1 s 1 respectively the k cl2o a of acetaminophen naproxen gemfibrozil and mecoprop were 3 7 0 6 109 4 5 0 2 106 4 8 0 5 106 and 1 8 0 1 104 m 1 s 1 respectively while that of carbamazepine was negligible as can be seen both k cl2 and k cl2o were approximately 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than k hocl presumably due to the higher electrophilic capacity of cl2 and cl2o than hocl lau et al 2019 additionally the difference on k cl2 and k cl2o among 5 micropollutants can be rationalized by their different structures in which micropollutants containing the strong electron donating groups aromatic ethers for gemfibrozil and naproxen are susceptible to cl2 and cl2o compared to mecoprop containing the electron withdrawing group cl dodd and huang 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 sivey and roberts 2012 to better explain the reactivities of fac species toward the aromatic micropollutants a primary qsar was established based on the assumption that the benzene ring was the main attacking site fig s9 shows a good correlation between hammett constants and apparent k hocl k cl2 and k cl2o respectively the reactivities of both cl2 and cl2o toward micropollutants increased significantly as hammett constants decreased this result evidences that cl2 and cl2o reacting with aromatic micropollutants rely on the electron donating properties of substituents on aromatic ring which was consistent to the electrophilicity of hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 3 3 contributions of cl2 cl2o and hocl to micropollutant degradation by model simulation to quantify the specific contributions of different fac species for micropollutant abatement by chlorination a kinetic model containing 14 reactions was developed shown in table 1 by multiplying the individual fac species concentrations with the molecular reaction rate constants the roles of hocl cl2 and cl2o were determined fig s10 shows the modeling k obs k model fitted the experimental results well as shown in fig 4 a cl2 dominated the degradation of carbamazepine naproxen and mecoprop with fractions of cl2 f cl2 of 65 2 54 3 and 57 6 respectively followed by f cl2o of 29 3 28 2 and 29 4 and f hocl of 5 5 17 5 and 13 0 respectively at ph 5 without extra cl cl2o 46 2 54 5 dominated the degradation of acetaminophen and gemfibrozil while cl2 18 6 37 9 was less significant relatively fig 4a the presence of extra 10 mm cl significantly altered the fractions of fac species for micropollutant degradation at ph 5 specifically cl2 dominated the degradation of all the 5 micropollutants with f cl2 of 91 9 99 2 while f cl2o and f hocl were less important 8 1 10 mm cl promoted the conversion from hocl to cl2 at acidic conditions eqs 4 5 in table 1 resulting in the significantly increased contribution of cl2 fig 4b evaluates the effects of ph on the specific roles of fac species for micropollutant degradation in the absence of extra cl by kinetic modeling increasing ph decreased contribution of cl2 for 5 micropollutant abatement but increased those of both cl2o and hocl at ph 6 cl2o dominated the abatement of 5 micropollutants with f cl2o of 53 7 83 0 which roles were 1 2 2 6 times higher compared to ph 5 the roles of cl2 3 5 20 2 were 3 2 6 8 times lower than those at ph 5 except for mecoprop with a negligible role of cl2 0 1 while hocl 11 6 33 3 was 1 2 2 4 times higher at ph 7 the degradation of 5 micropollutants was primarily ascribed to cl2o 56 4 87 3 followed by hocl 12 2 43 2 and cl2 2 47 the contributions of cl2o were 1 2 2 8 times higher than those at ph 5 the above results suggest that cl2 contributes slightly to the chlorination kinetics at ph 6 and cl2o dominated micropollutant degradation at neutral conditions 3 4 roles of cl2 and cl2o on dbp formation to create the cl2 and cl2o driven systems during chlorination we increased cl concentrations at ph 5 2 and increased fac dosages at ph 6 1 respectively the concentration of cl2 increased by 2 orders of magnitude with increasing cl added from 0 to 50 mm fig 5 a as fac dosage rose from 0 5 to 2 mm the concentration of cl2o increased from 2 2 10 9 to 3 8 10 8 m although the co existence of cl in fac solution promoted cl2 formation its concentration was around 1 orders of magnitude lower than that of cl2o in the created cl2o driven system fig 5b thus the cl2 and cl2o driven systems can be created as expected then we evaluated the dbp formation driven by cl2 and cl2o as follows fig 5c and d show the dbp formation driven by cl2 and cl2o during carbamazepine chlorination respectively tcm tcaa and dcaa were the dominant dbps in the cl2 driven system and their yields at 2 5 h increased by 1 8 9 2 and 5 5 times with increasing cl added from 0 to 50 mm respectively the increase of dbps was consistent with the increase of cl2 concentration fig 5a indicating the dominant role of cl2 for dbp formation meanwhile in the cl2o driven system the yields of tcm tcaa and dcaa increased by 3 8 10 8 and 5 4 times respectively when fac dosage increased from 0 5 to 2 mm fig 5d this result verifies that cl2o played a vital role on dbp formation as carbamazepine was inert to hocl and ocl furthermore the formation of tocl was negligible in both hocl and ocl driven systems while it significantly increased in cl2 and cl2o driven systems the yields of tocl increased by 1 6 times with increasing cl add from 0 to 5 mm at ph 5 while it increased by 3 9 times when fac dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 5 mm at ph 6 fig 5e indicating the contribution of cl2 and cl2o to the tocl formation during carbamazepine chlorination as nom is the most representative dbp precursor during chlorination of surface water and drinking water we also evaluated the dbp formation from nom in cl2 and cl2o driven systems as shown in fig 6 in the cl2 driven system the yields of total dbps at 24 h increased from 183 4 to 249 6 μg l with increasing cl added from 0 to 100 mm fig s11 among them tcm tcaa and dcaa were the dominant dbps which yields increased from 77 7 62 0 and 18 3 μg l at 0 mm cl added to 97 6 89 5 and 22 8 μg l at 100 mm cl added respectively fig 6a the formation of dbps during nom chlorination like carbamazepine were consistent with the alteration of cl2 concentration indicating the important roles of cl2 in dbp formation as for the cl2o driven system the yields of total dbps monotonically increased from 172 9 to 281 7 μg l with increasing fac from 10 to 60 mg l during nom chlorination fig s11 the yields of tcm tcaa and dcaa at 24 h increased from 70 9 57 5 and 18 7 μg l at 10 mg l fac to 133 4 92 8 and 22 0 μg l at 60 mg l fac respectively fig 6b the formation of dbps includes multi step reactions during chlorination in which cl2o and cl2 might play multiple roles 1 some precursors which are inert to hocl and ocl such as carbamazepine can be activated by cl2o and cl2 table 2 and fig 4 the activated products are likely to be more sensitive toward hocl resulting in the enhanced formation of dbps and tocl on the other hand cl2o and cl2 are important for less reactive products toward hocl to further increase the dbp formation for instance hocl transforms phenol to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol rapidly via sequential chlorine substitution at ortho and para position lau et al 2016 then 2 4 6 trichlorophenol reacts with hocl at a low rate constant of 3 4 m 1 s 1 lau et al 2016 which is a rate limiting step for dbp formation however the reactivities of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol towards cl2o and cl2 are 5 6 orders of magnitude higher than that toward hocl thus cl2 and cl2o are likely to contribute to subsequent dbp formation lau et al 2016 2 as compared to hocl cl2o and cl2 dominate the transformation of some aromatic compounds such as phenolics and aromatic esters sivey and roberts 2012 which may form chlorinated products for example the rate constants of 3 methylanisole and salicylic acid towards cl2o and cl2 are 5 7 orders of magnitude higher than those towards hocl sivey and roberts 2012 broadwater et al 2018 the concentrations of cl2o and cl2 can be 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of hocl under the abovementioned conditions by multiplying the concentrations of cl2o cl2 with the reaction rate constants the roles of cl2o cl2 are vital in the transformation of these compounds compared to hocl further research is warranted to differentiate the specific roles of cl2o and cl2 in dbp formation 4 conclusions and engineering implications in this work the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 in chlorination were elucidated with respects on micropollutant transformation as well as dbp formation a simplified method was developed to obtain more accurate k of various fac species with 5 micropollutants among which the reactivities of cl2o and cl2 were 4 7 orders of magnitude higher than those with hocl a relatively linear relationship was found between the reactivities of cl2 cl2o and the hammett σσp constants for aromatic micropollutants indicating that electron donating groups promoted the attack of benzene derivatives by cl2 cl2o by using a kinetic model cl2o played dominant roles on micropollutant degradation in pure water 56 4 87 3 at ph 7 and cl2 was more pronounced at acidic conditions and higher cl levels with the contribution of 37 9 99 2 at ph 5 both cl2 and cl2o played vital roles for dbp formation and tcm dcaa and tcaa were the major dbps by chlorination of carbamazepine and nom the roles of cl2 and cl2o as chlorinating agents were often neglected due to their low concentrations under typical water treatment conditions fig s12 shows the degradation of carbamazepine gemfibrozil and naproxen under typical conditions of groundwater and drinking water at ph 7 water quality parameters is shown in table s2 cl2o dominated the degradation of 3 micropollutants in drinking water 84 3 89 3 and groundwater 81 7 88 2 while cl2 and hocl played minor roles of 2 6 12 2 and 3 3 11 5 respectively in summary the overlooked roles of cl2o and cl2 for micropollutant abatement and dbp formation deserve more attention during chlorination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15232,while sludge bulking often occurring in activated sludge processes generally leads to serious membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbr the underlying causes are still unclear in this study fouling behaviors of a mbr operated at stages of normal and sludge bulking were compared and the fouling mechanisms of the different behaviors were explored it was found that the mbr could be stably operated in normal stage without membrane cleaning for about 60 days whereas daily membrane cleaning had to be carried out when operated in sludge bulking stage the bulking sludge possessed a rather high specific filtration resistance sfr of about 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is over 5 33 times than that of the normal sludge a series of characterizations demonstrated that the bulking sludge had rather lower dewaterability smaller particle size higher fractal dimension higher viscosity abundant filamentous bacteria and different functional groups of extracellular polymer sustains eps it was suggested that microbial community transition was responsible for the occurrence of sludge bulking further affecting membrane fouling based on these characterizations it was reported that adhesion propensity indicated by the thermodynamic interaction of the bulking sludge to the membrane surface is about 3 6 times than that of the normal sludge it was proposed that extra force should be provided to offset a chemical potential gap caused by foulant layer structure transition during sludge bulking in order to sustain filtration of the bulking sludge resulting in extremely high sfr this

out that bulking sludge had greater potential to build a dense cake layer and the filamentous index fi well reflected membrane fouling tendency pan et al 2010 found that filamentous bacteria yielded more polysaccharides and proteins thus causing serious membrane fouling meanwhile wang et al 2010 reported that bulking sludge mitigated membrane fouling because filamentous bacteria facilitated to the formation of larger sludge particles the inconsistent results suggest that effects of sludge bulking on membrane fouling are very complicated and further efforts should be made to reveal the fouling mechanisms in the occurrence of sludge bulking in mbrs the above mentioned literature studies generally only characterized membrane fouling behaviors and sludge properties and then linked these two aspects obviously there is a knowledge gap between fouling behaviors and sludge properties during the occurrence of sludge bulking when we linked them and no deep fouling mechanism has been revealed in these studies in these previous studies this gap might be put down to short of efficient tools to reveal the underlying fouling mechanisms currently a consensus has been reached that membrane fouling in mbrs involves processes of foulants adhesion and foulant layer filtration meng et al 2017 pan et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 recent studies have highlighted the thermodynamic nature of these two processes as both correspond to significant thermodynamic changes teng et al 2019 zeng et al 2022 for the foulants adhesion process the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory has been developed to identify the short ranged thermodynamic interactions between foulants and membrane surface li et al 2019 teng et al 2020 teng et al 2019 meanwhile the flory huggins lattice theory has been extended and further introduced to quantify chemical potential changes during the filtration process through a foulant layer chen et al 2019 long et al 2020 this extended theory the so called lin s theory in the literature assumes that filtration through a homogeneous foulant layer equals dragging out the bound water from the foulant layer to the permeate and thus needs extra energy to overcome a chemical potential gap between free water and bound water the thermodynamic changes gave a quantitative assessment method of membrane fouling and thus brought deeper and more essential insights into membrane fouling regarding sludge bulking in mbrs in addition although the relevance of filamentous bacteria and sludge bulking has been extensively explored li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 information regarding the involvement of filamentous bacteria in the above two thermodynamic processes and membrane fouling is still rare 16s rdna gene sequencing technology can provide an efficient tool to explore the community of microorganisms wu et al 2020 therefore it can be speculated that the microbial community information together with the thermodynamic changes will facilitate to giving more profound insights into fouling mechanisms during occurrence of sludge bulking in the current work a lab scale mbr system was operated during periods of normal state and occurrence of sludge bulking although no significant difference in biological degradation performance was observed for the mbr with and without sludge bulking the membrane fouling performance significantly deteriorated due to the sludge bulking therefore the fouling behaviors of the two periods were recorded and compared normal sludge bulking sludge and cake sludge were sampled and characterized in terms of morphological chemical physical and microbial properties based on these characterizations thermodynamic fouling mechanisms in processes of foulant adhesion and filtration through the foulant layer were revealed by using xdlvo theory and the extended flory huggins lattice theory respectively meanwhile the microbial community related to membrane fouling was analyzed by using 16s rdna gene sequencing technology this study will provide essential insights into membrane fouling regarding sludge bulking 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental setup and operation a lab scale submerged mbrs was operated to treat municipal wastewater in this work the mbr apparatus has a 26 l volume reactor where four plate membrane elements of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were vertically immersed the pvdf membrane was supplied by sinap membrane technology co ltd the total effective area of the membrane was 0 3 m2 there existed an aeration pipe below the membrane elements to supply shear force and oxygen for membrane cleaning and microorganism growth respectively synthetic municipal sewage was selected as the feed for mbr operation and the composition is presented in table 1 it is a common operation using synthetic wastewater to test new concepts or study universal mechanism of membrane fouling lin et al 2013 the mbr was suspended for 1 min after every 4 min operation to slow down membrane fouling the hydraulic retention time hrt of the mbr was set to 5 5 h when transmembrane pressure tmp exceeded 20 kpa the mbr was suspended to perform a physical cleaning the mbr was operated during two distinct periods stage i and ii lasted for 100 d and 90 d respectively after the end of stage i the mbr was restarted by inoculating sludge stage ii the inoculated sludges for the two stages were taken from jinhua wastewater treatment plant for both stages sludge concentration gradually increased to 12 g mlss l 1 after mbr started up and then was kept stable by sludge discharge during stage i the aeration rate was set at 4 l min 1 corresponding to the specific aeration demand per membrane area sadm of 0 8 m3 m 2 h 1 the aeration rate maintained stable throughout the operation period and no obvious sludge bulking occurred for stage ii the aeration rate 0 8 m3 m 2 h 1 kept stable in the first 60 d and then significantly reduced below 0 4 m3 m 2 h 1 after around 60th d thereafter there was significant sludge bulking occurred corresponding to significantly different fouling performance 2 2 sample preparation for comparison samples of normal sludge suspension and bulking sludge suspension were taken from the mbr operated in stage i and ii in order to exclude the effects of supernatants sludge suspension samples were centrifuged under conditions of 3000 g force and 4 temperature for 10 min to get the supernatant and sludge the centrifuged sludge was resuspended in a phosphate buffer solution pbs 2 mm na3po4 4 mm nah2po4 9 mm nacl and 1 mm kcl to prepare sludge suspension samples named stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge for filtration experiments sfr experiments extracellular polymeric substance eps was extracted based on the cation exchange resin cer method frølund et al 1996 the detailed process could refer to previous studies lin et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 the resultant supernatant sample was extracted through a 0 45 μm filtration membrane to get the eps samples named as stage i normal eps and stage ii bulking eps respectively 2 3 batch filtration tests specific filtration resistance sfr was used to assess the fouling potential of a foulant solution which was determined by a batch filtration test wisniewski and grasmick 1998 the filtration test was performed on a 50 ml volume stirred cell msc 050 shanghai sinap co ltd china the stirred cell was equipped with a pvdf membrane 0 1 μm normalized pore size and 0 00119 m2 effective filtration area the filtration process was performed by filtrating a 30 ml sample under a constant 60 kpa pressure a digital balance was used to record the permeate volume sfr can be calculated by wisniewski and grasmick 1998 1 s f r 2 k a m 2 δ p μ c where δp am μ and c are trans membrane pressure tmp kpa membrane area m2 dynamic viscosity of permeate pa s and biomass concentration kg m3 respectively for the batch filtration test plotting the ratio of filtration time to filtration volume t v versus filtration volume v yields a filtration curve k is the slope of the filtration curve after filtration the membrane was rinsed with pure water and suffered ultrasonication for 10 min to remove foulants on the membrane surface then further membrane cleaning was performed by filtration of pure water each sample was tested for three parallel cycles 2 4

typically described by the flory huggins lattice theory flory 1942 huggins 1942 accordingly the mixing free energy change during polymer solution formation can be expressed as 12 δ g m i x r t n 1 ln

scattering vector q data can be obtained according to these data the relationship between log i and log q was plotted and fitted to a straight line the negative value of the slope of the line is df of the sludge flocs cai et al 2017 2 6 3 chemical analysis the samples of sludge suspension and eps extracted solution were filtered by negative pressure and the interception of solid content was dried at 40 for 24 h to remove the water the dried samples were used for the following characterizations the functional groups were characterized by a nexus 670 ft ir spectrum analyzer the elemental composition was analyzed by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa with the excitation source of alek x rays wang et al 2018 contents of polysaccharides and proteins in eps were measured by the methods proposed by dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 respectively an anton paar economists 3 was applied to measure the zeta potential of pvdf membrane

throughput sequencing illumina miseq hiseq of 16s rdna detection petrovski et al 2011a petrovski et al 2011b in this study sludge suspension samples obtained at two stages were subjected to characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr operation and fouling behaviors fig 1 shows operation pressure change profiles with operational time and pictures regarding the foulant layer on the membrane surface for the mbr operated during the normal and sludge bulking stages in the initial part of period 1 the sludge was just taken from the wastewater treatment plant and needs to adapt to the new cultivation conditions the first tmp increase at 10 d over 20 kpa was thus mainly attributed to the substances secreted by the sludge after physical cleaning the tmp restores to a normal level during 10 to 40 d the sludge concentration gradually increased and reached 12 g mlss l 1 near 40th d at the same time the tmp also increases steadily over 20 kpa fig 1 a1 and the membrane was physically cleaned it should be noted that there is an operation accident at 83 d in stage i due to a problem with the inlet pump corresponding to a pressure jump thereafter a membrane cleaning was conducted and the operation resumed fig 1 a1 in stage i the tmp is relatively stable and does not exceed 10 kpa for most of the duration in contrast as shown in fig 1 a2 when sludge bulking occurs in stage ii serious membrane fouling can be observed and tmp increases rapidly and exceeds 30 kpa in one day during the latter half of period 2 70 to 90 d meanwhile the cake layer corresponding to the operation at end of stage i is in form of granulation flocculation fig 1b1 whereas the cake layer at stage ii is rather sticky and gelatinous fig 1b2 showing gel like morphology the sludge suspensions in the mbr for the two stages are also rather different fig 1c the foulant layer after filtration for stage i shows gray color and granulation status fig 1c1 and the counterpart for stage ii shows yellow color and homogeneous form fig 1c2 in all fig 1 shows that the fouling behaviors and sludge statuses of the two stages are rather different and the underlying causes should be investigated fig 2 shows the comparison of specific filtration resistance sfr of sludge suspensions prepared for stage i and stage ii under the same filtration conditions the sludge suspension for stage ii has a sfr of 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is about 5 33 times than that for stage i normal sludge suspension 2 55 1013 m kg 1 this comparison clearly shows that bulking sludge has a rather higher fouling propensity both the long term and short term experiments evidenced that bulking sludge corresponded to much higher membrane fouling in the mbr and the underlying causes have not been well studied previously deserving further exploration 3 2 comparison of sludge properties 3 2 1 viscosity and dewaterability fig 3 shows viscosity and dewaterability indicated by cst of normal sludge and bulking sludge suspension obtained in stage i and stage ii it can be seen from fig 3a that the cst of the stage ii bulking sludge suspension were about 3 times higher than that of stage i normal sludge suspension indicating much worse dewaterability of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge meanwhile the viscosity of stage ii bulking sludge suspension is much higher than that of stage i normal sludge suspension fig 3b this result indicates that the bulking sludge is stickier and apt to form a more homogeneous foulant layer when it is subjected to filtration the results in fig 3 are consistent with the fouling and sfr level trend shown in fig 2 suggesting that sludge properties of dewaterability and viscosity play key roles in membrane fouling in the mbr previous studies also reported that dewaterability and viscosity of sludge critically affect membrane fouling wang et al 2006 wu et al 2007 however it is still not clear how dewaterability and viscosity of sludge take a role in membrane fouling calling for further exploration 3 2 2 particle size distribution and fractal dimension fig 4 shows psd profiles and df levels of the sludge suspension samples it can be seen that stage ii bulking sludge 143 9 μm had a smaller average floc size than stage i normal sludge 272 43 μm it was reported that smaller size floc had a higher tendency to adhere to the membrane surface bae and tak 2005 shen et al 2015 this can be verified by the smaller average floc size 111 47 μm of cake sludge suspension as compared with bulking sludge 143 9 μm meanwhile it is generally accepted that smaller flocs are likely to form a denser cake layer lin et al 2009 the higher adhesion tendency and higher propensity to form a denser cake layer of the smaller size flocs in stage ii should significantly contribute to its higher fouling propensity as shown in fig 4 df of the stage ii bulking sludge suspension 2 032 is larger than the stage i normal sludge suspension 1 868 this indicates that stage ii bulking sludge is denser and tighter than stage i normal sludge previous literature suggested smaller floc size is generally associated with larger df massé et al 2006 these results indicate that the morphology of bulking sludge critically affects its fouling propensity its underlying causes should be studied 3 2 3 analysis of eps content and properties it is generally believed that eps critically determine the membrane fouling propensity of sludge by participating foulant adhesion process and foulant layer formation process soluble microbial products smp by definition are in soluble state which can turn into eps during adhesion and foulant layer formation processes and take important roles in membrane fouling therefore this work focused on eps characterizations fig s1 compares polysaccharide and protein content in eps samples extracted from sludges in stage i and stage ii both samples have similar polysaccharide and protein content suggesting that eps content is not the cause of the significantly different fouling behaviors of the two sludge suspensions fig s2 shows the ftir spectra in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 of the sludge floc and eps samples in the two stages all samples show similar spectral profiles indicating that proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of eps and sludge floc surface in addition the element composition of eps was further analyzed by xps and the results are illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the elemental compositions of eps extracted from two stages are very similar except for oxygen the area of each sub peak in the o element profile is listed in table 2 the o1s a peak area corresponding to the content of co coh and co c bonds for stage ii bulking eps 57 21 is higher than that 46 86 for stage i normal eps in contrast the o1s b peak area corresponding to the content of c o bonds for stage ii bulking eps 42 79 is lower than that 53 13 for stage i normal eps xps analyses indicate the significant differences in chemical compositions of the two different epss extracted from the bulking and normal sludge which should be partly responsible for the significantly different fouling behaviors of the two sludge suspensions 3 2 4 microscopic observation fig 6 shows the biomicroscopic images of normal sludge and bulking sludge samples it is clear that bulking sludge contains abundant filamentous bacteria the filament index fi of the filamentous bacteria in stage ii bulking sludge is higher than 5 compared with 0 or 1 for the stage i normal sludge according to the eikelboom scale eikelboom 2000 the abundant hyphae stretch out of the sludge flocs and form denser and tighter flocs with a net catching structure eikelboom 2000 meanwhile it is reported that sludge suspension viscosity increases with the abundance of filamentous bacteria meng et al 2006 in this context it can be concluded that presence of filamentous bacteria is highly associated with other sludge properties and they together affect membrane fouling 3 2 5 analyses of microbial community fig 7 shows the relative abundance of sludge microbial communities at the bacteria level between normal sludge and bulking sludge analyzed by 16s rdna gene sequence technology as shown in fig 7 for both samples the nine most abundant bacteria are bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria ignavibacteriae candidatus saccharibacteria acidobacteria firmicutes planctomycetes verrucomicrobia nitrospirae and among them bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria are most prevailing in abundance a similar phenomenon has been reported in the literature yao et al 2020 it is worth noting that the most typical bacteria causing bulking in the mbr system are different from those in casp zhang et al 2019 probably due to the different environment in the two systems it can be observed that the microbial community in terms of abundance for the two sludge samples is significantly different the bulking sludge contains more bacteroidetes and chloroflexi which are usually related to the production of filamentous bacteria pan et al 2010 reported that filamentous bacteria produced more soluble biomass products eps in the sludge suspension accordingly it can be generally considered that occurrence of sludge bulking is associated with the change in bacteria abundance which in turn affects sludge properties table 3 lists the diversity data of the bacterial populations for the two sludge samples chao1 and ace are used to estimate the total number of species in the samples shannon index and simpson diversity index are used to estimate the microbial diversity indexes the coverage index refers to the coverage rate of each sample library zhang et al 2020 it can be seen that stage i normal sludge has a higher chao1 ace shannon index and lower simpson index than stage ii bulking sludge suggesting higher diversity of microbial populations of the normal sludge table s1 lists the top 30 genera with the highest relative abundance among stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria are the main genus level microorganisms particularly the abundance of hyphomicrobium and dechloromonas in the bulking sludge is higher than that in the normal sludge these results confirm that there is a significant difference in microbial diversity and abundance it can be concluded that microbial community transition is responsible for the occurrence of sludge bulking such a transition may also affect the higher fouling propensity of the bulking sludge 3 3 mechanisms of high fouling propensity of bulking sludge fig 4 confirms the smaller particle size and higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge herein the total interaction energy u f w m t o l d per unit mass defined in xdlvo theory was used as a quantitative measure of the adhesion propensity of a sludge floc to the membrane surface the sludge density was measured to be ρ 1 15 g cm3 in this study combining equation m 4 3 π ρ r 3 with eqs 9 11 in the da approximation method the following equations can be obtained shen et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 16 u f w m l w h δ g h 0 l w h 0 2 h 3 2 r 2 ρ 17 u f w m a b h δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 2 h λ 3 2 r 2 ρ 18 u f w m e l h ε r ε 0 2 ζ f ζ m ln 1 e κ h 1 e κ h ζ f 2 ζ m 2 ln 1 e 2 κ h 3 4 r 2 ρ taking the surface properties of the sludge and the membrane samples as input eqs 16 18 yield fig 8 shows the profiles of specific interaction energy with the separation distance between a sludge floc and membrane surface the floc size of bulking sludge and normal sludge for calculation is 143 9 μm and 272 43 μm fig 4c respectively as shown in fig 8 u f w m t o l d per unit mass at the minimum distance for stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge samples is 28 85 1010 and 103 91 1010 kt g mlss respectively this means that the adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge to the membrane surface is about 3 6 times than that of the normal sludge the higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge should stem from its smaller particle size fig 4c and stickier property fig 3b this analysis provides a reasonable thermodynamic mechanism well explaining the rather higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge in the mbr after sludge foulants adhere to the membrane surface the operation of a mbr will be subject to filtration through a foulant layer considering the higher cst fig 4 and gel like morphology fig 1b2 of the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge the following mechanism as shown in fig 9 is proposed to explain the much higher sfr of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge as shown in fig 9a and c normal sludge has a larger floc size and limited filamentous bacteria which would form a cake layer with a porous structure the cross section of the cake layer fig 9a shows the existence of some visible connected channels through the cake layer water can directly go through these connected channels fig 9c such a cake layer is a physically porous material whose filtration resistance can be measured by the carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 as a result the sfr of the normal sludge suspension is relatively low in contrast bulking sludge suspension contains smaller size flocs and abundant filamentous bacteria the abundant hyphae stretch out of the sludge flocs hook the membrane surface like tentacles and form a net catching structure on the membrane surface as a result the formed foulant layer is relatively homogeneous and in a viscous fluid state it is a kind of intermediate state of the cake layer and gel layer there is no obvious connected pore in the cross section of the foulant layer fig 9b and water cannot directly go through the foulant layer fig 9d sustaining filtration through such a foulant layer resides in other mechanisms fig 10 presents a schematic diagram of the proposed thermodynamic mechanism underlying filtration through the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge from the thermodynamic viewpoint filtration through a gel like foulant layer corresponds to a chemical potential gap the gel layer contains abundant bound water with lower chemical potential than free water the permeate since there is no obvious connected pore in the gel like layer it needs to drag bound water out to the permeate free water in order to sustain the filtration process as a result extra force should be exerted to offset the chemical potential gap corresponding to a high filtration resistance eq 15 in the extended flory huggins theory provides a measure of sfr of a gel layer originating from the mixing chemical potential change filtration of eps solution will generally form a standard gel layer on the membrane surface by setting φ 0 075 and χ 0 50 for the bulking sludge eps the simulated sfr according to eq 15 is 1 32 1016 m kg 1 very close to the really measured sfr 1 29 1016 m kg 1 of the bulking sludge eps this simulation result well verifies the real existence of such a thermodynamic mechanism governing the gel layer filtration process the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge is a kind of intermediate state between the cake layer and the gel layer therefore the bulking sludge possesses a sfr lower than eps but rather higher than the normal sludge the proposed mechanism can satisfactorily explain the high sfr of the bulking sludge it should be noted that the proposed mechanisms regarding high fouling propensity of bulking sludge are independent of membrane model type reactor scale and wastewater type and have universal significance for membrane fouling mitigation and mbr operation the above results suggest that the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria is the underlying cause of the occurrence of sludge bulking the net catching structure formed by the abundant filamentous bacteria favors the stick of sludge flocs on the membrane surface and the formation of a homogeneous foulant layer which corresponds to the higher membrane fouling the causes of the overgrowth of filamentous are various it can be the result of shifts in temperature toxic compounds ph dissolved oxygen concentration and substrate loading meng and yang 2007 xia et al 2016 in most cases such as the unsuitable temperature existence of toxic matters and ph shock the mbr system should be less propensity to develop sludge bulking than the conventional activated sludge process because it has stronger impact resistance however as mbr has a higher mlss concentration a low aeration rate in mbr may easier lead to the occurrence of sludge bulking because the oxygen mass transfer capacity is decreased under the higher concentration of mlss in the current study sludge bulking occurred when the aeration rate dropped due to the blocked aeration holes therefore during the operation and maintenance of the mbr system attention should be paid to the aeration pipe to keep the normal aeration rate and bubble size which can significantly minimize the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria and the occurrence of sludge bulking as well as the aggravation of membrane fouling strictly speaking sludge foaming and sludge bulking should be two different conceptions which correspond to different production and properties of polysaccharides and proteins in mbrs previous study well explored adhesion filtration and biological mechanisms underlying membrane fouling caused by the foaming sludge wu et al 2020 different from the previous study this work revealed the thermodynamic membrane fouling mechanisms during sludge bulking for the first time the operational conditions seeded sludge and fouling behaviors reported in these two studies are totally different the revealed mechanisms in this work well explained the high filtration resistance and strong adhesive force of the membrane fouling phenomenon during sludge bulking period facilitating to develop efficient membrane fouling control strategies 4 conclusions both long term and short term experiments evidenced that the occurrence of sludge bulking led to an easier fouling formation for mbr than in the normal stage the sfr of bulking sludge was as high as 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is over 5 33 times that of the normal sludge a series of characterizations suggest that as compared to normal sludge the bulking sludge has a lower dewaterability smaller particle size larger fractal dimension higher viscosity and more abundant filamentous bacteria in addition the occurrence of sludge bulking was attributed to the microbial community transition in the mbr system thermodynamic analyses showed that the adhesion energy of bulking sludge at the contact distance was about 3 6 times of the normal sludge indicating the higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge therefore bulking sludge tended to form a relatively homogeneous gel like foulant layer corresponding to an extremely high sfr the chemical potential gap described by the flory huggins theory can satisfactorily explain the above mentioned high sfr of bulking sludge this study provided universal thermodynamic mechanisms of membrane fouling caused by bulking sludge which should be independent of membrane type this work facilitates avoidance of sludge bulking and optimization of mbr treatment process declaration of

15232,while sludge bulking often occurring in activated sludge processes generally leads to serious membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbr the underlying causes are still unclear in this study fouling behaviors of a mbr operated at stages of normal and sludge bulking were compared and the fouling mechanisms of the different behaviors were explored it was found that the mbr could be stably operated in normal stage without membrane cleaning for about 60 days whereas daily membrane cleaning had to be carried out when operated in sludge bulking stage the bulking sludge possessed a rather high specific filtration resistance sfr of about 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is over 5 33 times than that of the normal sludge a series of characterizations demonstrated that the bulking sludge had rather lower dewaterability smaller particle size higher fractal dimension higher viscosity abundant filamentous bacteria and different functional groups of extracellular polymer sustains eps it was suggested that microbial community transition was responsible for the occurrence of sludge bulking further affecting membrane fouling based on these characterizations it was reported that adhesion propensity indicated by the thermodynamic interaction of the bulking sludge to the membrane surface is about 3 6 times than that of the normal sludge it was proposed that extra force should be provided to offset a chemical potential gap caused by foulant layer structure transition during sludge bulking in order to sustain filtration of the bulking sludge resulting in extremely high sfr this

membrane bioreactor thermodynamic mechanism chemical potential data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr has been extensively applied to treat and reclaim wastewater owing to its improved treatment efficiency and effluent quality over the conventional activated sludge process casp however membrane fouling is a major obstacle hindering further applications of membrane technology bai et al 2021 krzeminski et al 2017 meng et al 2017 santos and judd 2010 similar to casp mbr systems would encounter the occurrence of sludge bulking when normal operating conditions are shocked dissolved oxygen ph value the organic load etc meng and yang 2007 xia et al 2016 which may exert profound effects on the performance of mbrs shen et al 2020 some efforts have been devoted to investigating the effects of sludge bulking occurrence on membrane fouling meng and yang 2007 meng et al 2006 pan et al 2010 tian et al 2011 wang et al 2010 it was reported that bulking sludge contained abundant filamentous bacteria and had an irregular outer contour shape which significantly aggravated membrane fouling meng et al 2006 meng and yang 2007 pointed out that bulking sludge had greater potential to build a dense cake layer and the filamentous index fi well reflected membrane fouling tendency pan et al 2010 found that filamentous bacteria yielded more polysaccharides and proteins thus causing serious membrane fouling meanwhile wang et al 2010 reported that bulking sludge mitigated membrane fouling because filamentous bacteria facilitated to the formation of larger sludge particles the inconsistent results suggest that effects of sludge bulking on membrane fouling are very complicated and further efforts should be made to reveal the fouling mechanisms in the occurrence of sludge bulking in mbrs the above mentioned literature studies generally only characterized membrane fouling behaviors and sludge properties and then linked these two aspects obviously there is a knowledge gap between fouling behaviors and sludge properties during the occurrence of sludge bulking when we linked them and no deep fouling mechanism has been revealed in these studies in these previous studies this gap might be put down to short of efficient tools to reveal the underlying fouling mechanisms currently a consensus has been reached that membrane fouling in mbrs involves processes of foulants adhesion and foulant layer filtration meng et al 2017 pan et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 recent studies have highlighted the thermodynamic nature of these two processes as both correspond to significant thermodynamic changes teng et al 2019 zeng et al 2022 for the foulants adhesion process the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory has been developed to identify the short ranged thermodynamic interactions between foulants and membrane surface li et al 2019 teng et al 2020 teng et al 2019 meanwhile the flory huggins lattice theory has been extended and further introduced to quantify chemical potential changes during the filtration process through a foulant layer chen et al 2019 long et al 2020 this extended theory the so called lin s theory in the literature assumes that filtration through a homogeneous foulant layer equals dragging out the bound water from the foulant layer to the permeate and thus needs extra energy to overcome a chemical potential gap between free water and bound water the thermodynamic changes gave a quantitative assessment method of membrane fouling and thus brought deeper and more essential insights into membrane fouling regarding sludge bulking in mbrs in addition although the relevance of filamentous bacteria and sludge bulking has been extensively explored li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 information regarding the involvement of filamentous bacteria in the above two thermodynamic processes and membrane fouling is still rare 16s rdna gene sequencing technology can provide an efficient tool to explore the community of microorganisms wu et al 2020 therefore it can be speculated that the microbial community information together with the thermodynamic changes will facilitate to giving more profound insights into fouling mechanisms during occurrence of sludge bulking in the current work a lab scale mbr system was operated during periods of normal state and occurrence of sludge bulking although no significant difference in biological degradation performance was observed for the mbr with and without sludge bulking the membrane fouling performance significantly deteriorated due to the sludge bulking therefore the fouling behaviors of the two periods were recorded and compared normal sludge bulking sludge and cake sludge were sampled and characterized in terms of morphological chemical physical and microbial properties based on these characterizations thermodynamic fouling mechanisms in processes of foulant adhesion and filtration through the foulant layer were revealed by using xdlvo theory and the extended flory huggins lattice theory respectively meanwhile the microbial community related to membrane fouling was analyzed by using 16s rdna gene sequencing technology this study will provide essential insights into membrane fouling regarding sludge bulking 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental setup and operation a lab scale submerged mbrs was operated to treat municipal wastewater in this work the mbr apparatus has a 26 l volume reactor where four plate membrane elements of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were vertically immersed the pvdf membrane was supplied by sinap membrane technology co ltd the total effective area of the membrane was 0 3 m2 there existed an aeration pipe below the membrane elements to supply shear force and oxygen for membrane cleaning and microorganism growth respectively synthetic municipal sewage was selected as the feed for mbr operation and the composition is presented in table 1 it is a common operation using synthetic wastewater to test new concepts or study universal mechanism of membrane fouling lin et al 2013 the mbr was suspended for 1 min after every 4 min operation to slow down membrane fouling the hydraulic retention time hrt of the mbr was set to 5 5 h when transmembrane pressure tmp exceeded 20 kpa the mbr was suspended to perform a physical cleaning the mbr was operated during two distinct periods stage i and ii lasted for 100 d and 90 d respectively after the end of stage i the mbr was restarted by inoculating sludge stage ii the inoculated sludges for the two stages were taken from jinhua wastewater treatment plant for both stages sludge concentration gradually increased to 12 g mlss l 1 after mbr started up and then was kept stable by sludge discharge during stage i the aeration rate was set at 4 l min 1 corresponding to the specific aeration demand per membrane area sadm of 0 8 m3 m 2 h 1 the aeration rate maintained stable throughout the operation period and no obvious sludge bulking occurred for stage ii the aeration rate 0 8 m3 m 2 h 1 kept stable in the first 60 d and then significantly reduced below 0 4 m3 m 2 h 1 after around 60th d thereafter there was significant sludge bulking occurred corresponding to significantly different fouling performance 2 2 sample preparation for comparison samples of normal sludge suspension and bulking sludge suspension were taken from the mbr operated in stage i and ii in order to exclude the effects of supernatants sludge suspension samples were centrifuged under conditions of 3000 g force and 4 temperature for 10 min to get the supernatant and sludge the centrifuged sludge was resuspended in a phosphate buffer solution pbs 2 mm na3po4 4 mm nah2po4 9 mm nacl and 1 mm kcl to prepare sludge suspension samples named stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge for filtration experiments sfr experiments extracellular polymeric substance eps was extracted based on the cation exchange resin cer method frølund et al 1996 the detailed process could refer to previous studies lin et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 the resultant supernatant sample was extracted through a 0 45 μm filtration membrane to get the eps samples named as stage i normal eps and stage ii bulking eps respectively 2 3 batch filtration tests specific filtration resistance sfr was used to assess the fouling potential of a foulant solution which was determined by a batch filtration test wisniewski and grasmick 1998 the filtration test was performed on a 50 ml volume stirred cell msc 050 shanghai sinap co ltd china the stirred cell was equipped with a pvdf membrane 0 1 μm normalized pore size and 0 00119 m2 effective filtration area the filtration process was performed by filtrating a 30 ml sample under a constant 60 kpa pressure a digital balance was used to record the permeate volume sfr can be calculated by wisniewski and grasmick 1998 1 s f r 2 k a m 2 δ p μ c where δp am μ and c are trans membrane pressure tmp kpa membrane area m2 dynamic viscosity of permeate pa s and biomass concentration kg m3 respectively for the batch filtration test plotting the ratio of filtration time to filtration volume t v versus filtration volume v yields a filtration curve k is the slope of the filtration curve after filtration the membrane was rinsed with pure water and suffered ultrasonication for 10 min to remove foulants on the membrane surface then further membrane cleaning was performed by filtration of pure water each sample was tested for three parallel cycles 2 4

typically described by the flory huggins lattice theory flory 1942 huggins 1942 accordingly the mixing free energy change during polymer solution formation can be expressed as 12 δ g m i x r t n 1 ln

significantly extended this theory and developed the extended flory huggins theory the so called lin s theory in the literature to depict the gel layer filtration process long et al 2021 teng et al

the sludge flocs cai et al 2017 2 6 3 chemical analysis the samples of sludge suspension and eps extracted solution were filtered by negative pressure and the interception of solid content was dried at 40 for 24 h to remove the water the dried samples were used for the following characterizations the functional groups were characterized by a nexus 670 ft ir spectrum analyzer the elemental composition was analyzed by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa with the excitation source of alek x rays wang et al 2018 contents of polysaccharides and proteins in eps were measured by the methods proposed by dubois et al 1956 and lowry et al 1951 respectively an anton paar economists 3 was applied to measure the zeta potential of pvdf membrane

throughput sequencing illumina miseq hiseq of 16s rdna detection petrovski et al 2011a petrovski et al 2011b in this study sludge suspension samples obtained at two stages were subjected to characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr operation and fouling behaviors fig 1 shows operation pressure change profiles with operational time and pictures regarding the foulant layer on the membrane surface for the mbr operated during the normal and sludge bulking stages in the initial part of period 1 the sludge was just taken from the wastewater treatment plant and needs to adapt to the new cultivation conditions the first tmp increase at 10 d over 20 kpa was thus mainly attributed to the substances secreted by the sludge after physical cleaning the tmp restores to a normal level during 10 to 40 d the sludge concentration gradually increased and reached 12 g mlss l 1 near 40th d at the same time the tmp also increases steadily over 20 kpa fig 1 a1 and the membrane was physically cleaned it should be noted that there is an operation accident at 83 d in stage i due to a problem with the inlet pump corresponding to a pressure jump thereafter a membrane cleaning was conducted and the operation resumed fig 1 a1 in stage i the tmp is relatively stable and does not exceed 10 kpa for most of the duration in contrast as shown in fig 1 a2 when sludge bulking occurs in stage ii serious membrane fouling can be observed and tmp increases rapidly and exceeds 30 kpa in one day during the latter half of period 2 70 to 90 d meanwhile the cake layer corresponding to the operation at end of stage i is in form of granulation flocculation fig 1b1 whereas the cake layer at stage ii is rather sticky and gelatinous fig 1b2 showing gel like morphology the sludge suspensions in the mbr for the two stages are also rather different fig 1c the foulant layer after filtration for stage i shows gray color and granulation status fig 1c1 and the counterpart for stage ii shows yellow color and homogeneous form fig 1c2 in all fig 1 shows that the fouling behaviors and sludge statuses of the two stages are rather different and the underlying causes should be investigated fig 2 shows the comparison of specific filtration resistance sfr of sludge suspensions prepared for stage i and stage ii under the same filtration conditions the sludge suspension for stage ii has a sfr of 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is about 5 33 times than that for stage i normal sludge suspension 2 55 1013 m kg 1 this comparison clearly shows that bulking sludge has a rather higher fouling propensity both the long term and short term experiments evidenced that bulking sludge corresponded to much higher membrane fouling in the mbr and the underlying causes have not been well studied previously deserving further exploration 3 2 comparison of sludge properties 3 2 1 viscosity and dewaterability fig 3 shows viscosity and dewaterability indicated by cst of normal sludge and bulking sludge suspension obtained in stage i and stage ii it can be seen from fig 3a that the cst of the stage ii bulking sludge suspension were about 3 times higher than that of stage i normal sludge suspension indicating much worse dewaterability of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge meanwhile the viscosity of stage ii bulking sludge suspension is much higher than that of stage i normal sludge suspension fig 3b this result indicates that the bulking sludge is stickier and apt to form a more homogeneous foulant layer when it is subjected to filtration the results in fig 3 are consistent with the fouling and sfr level trend shown in fig 2 suggesting that sludge properties of dewaterability and viscosity play key roles in membrane fouling in the mbr previous studies also reported that dewaterability and viscosity of sludge critically affect membrane fouling wang et al 2006 wu et al 2007 however it is still not clear how dewaterability and viscosity of sludge take a role in membrane fouling calling for further exploration 3 2 2 particle size distribution and fractal dimension fig 4 shows psd profiles and df levels of the sludge suspension samples it can be seen that stage ii bulking sludge 143 9 μm had a smaller average floc size than stage i normal sludge 272 43 μm it was reported that smaller size floc had a higher tendency to adhere to the membrane surface bae and tak 2005 shen et al 2015 this can be verified by the smaller average floc size 111 47 μm of cake sludge suspension as compared with bulking sludge 143 9 μm meanwhile it is generally accepted that smaller flocs are likely to form a denser cake layer lin et al 2009 the higher adhesion tendency and higher propensity to form a denser cake layer of the smaller size flocs in stage ii should significantly contribute to its higher fouling propensity as shown in fig 4 df of the stage ii bulking sludge suspension 2 032 is larger than the stage i normal sludge suspension 1 868 this indicates that stage ii bulking sludge is denser and tighter than stage i normal sludge previous literature suggested smaller floc size is generally associated with larger df massé et al 2006 these results indicate that the morphology of bulking sludge critically affects its fouling propensity its underlying causes should be studied 3 2 3 analysis of eps content and properties it is generally believed that eps critically determine the membrane fouling propensity of sludge by participating foulant adhesion process and foulant layer formation process soluble microbial products smp by definition are in soluble state which can turn into eps during adhesion and foulant layer formation processes and take important roles in membrane fouling therefore this work focused on eps characterizations fig s1 compares polysaccharide and protein content in eps samples extracted from sludges in stage i and stage ii both samples have similar polysaccharide and protein content suggesting that eps content is not the cause of the significantly different fouling behaviors of the two sludge suspensions fig s2 shows the ftir spectra in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 of the sludge floc and eps samples in the two stages all samples show similar spectral profiles indicating that proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of eps and sludge floc surface in addition the element composition of eps was further analyzed by xps and the results are illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the elemental compositions of eps extracted from two stages are very similar except for oxygen the area of each sub peak in the o element profile is listed in table 2 the o1s a peak area corresponding to the content of co coh and co c bonds for stage ii bulking eps 57 21 is higher than that 46 86 for stage i normal eps in contrast the o1s b peak area corresponding to the content of c o bonds for stage ii bulking eps 42 79 is lower than that 53 13 for stage i normal eps xps analyses indicate the significant differences in chemical compositions of the two different epss extracted from the bulking and normal sludge which should be partly responsible for the significantly different fouling behaviors of the two sludge suspensions 3 2 4 microscopic observation fig 6 shows the biomicroscopic images of normal sludge and bulking sludge samples it is clear that bulking sludge contains abundant filamentous bacteria the filament index fi of the filamentous bacteria in stage ii bulking sludge is higher than 5 compared with 0 or 1 for the stage i normal sludge according to the eikelboom scale eikelboom 2000 the abundant hyphae stretch out of the sludge flocs and form denser and tighter flocs with a net catching structure eikelboom 2000 meanwhile it is reported that sludge suspension viscosity increases with the abundance of filamentous bacteria meng et al 2006 in this context it can be concluded that presence of filamentous bacteria is highly associated with other sludge properties and they together affect membrane fouling 3 2 5 analyses of microbial community fig 7 shows the relative abundance of sludge microbial communities at the bacteria level between normal sludge and bulking sludge analyzed by 16s rdna gene sequence technology as shown in fig 7 for both samples the nine most abundant bacteria are bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria ignavibacteriae candidatus saccharibacteria acidobacteria firmicutes planctomycetes verrucomicrobia nitrospirae and among them bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria are most prevailing in abundance a similar phenomenon has been reported in the literature yao et al 2020 it is worth noting that the most typical bacteria causing bulking in the mbr system are different from those in casp zhang et al 2019 probably due to the different environment in the two systems it can be observed that the microbial community in terms of abundance for the two sludge samples is significantly different the bulking sludge contains more bacteroidetes and chloroflexi which are usually related to the production of filamentous bacteria pan et al 2010 reported that filamentous bacteria produced more soluble biomass products eps in the sludge suspension accordingly it can be generally considered that occurrence of sludge bulking is associated with the change in bacteria abundance which in turn affects sludge properties table 3 lists the diversity data of the bacterial populations for the two sludge samples chao1 and ace are used to estimate the total number of species in the samples shannon index and simpson diversity index are used to estimate the microbial diversity indexes the coverage index refers to the coverage rate of each sample library zhang et al 2020 it can be seen that stage i normal sludge has a higher chao1 ace shannon index and lower simpson index than stage ii bulking sludge suggesting higher diversity of microbial populations of the normal sludge table s1 lists the top 30 genera with the highest relative abundance among stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria are the main genus level microorganisms particularly the abundance of hyphomicrobium and dechloromonas in the bulking sludge is higher than that in the normal sludge these results confirm that there is a significant difference in microbial diversity and abundance it can be concluded that microbial community transition is responsible for the occurrence of sludge bulking such a transition may also affect the higher fouling propensity of the bulking sludge 3 3 mechanisms of high fouling propensity of bulking sludge fig 4 confirms the smaller particle size and higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge herein the total interaction energy u f w m t o l d per unit mass defined in xdlvo theory was used as a quantitative measure of the adhesion propensity of a sludge floc to the membrane surface the sludge density was measured to be ρ 1 15 g cm3 in this study combining equation m 4 3 π ρ r 3 with eqs 9 11 in the da approximation method the following equations can be obtained shen et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 16 u f w m l w h δ g h 0 l w h 0 2 h 3 2 r 2 ρ 17 u f w m a b h δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 2 h λ 3 2 r 2 ρ 18 u f w m e l h ε r ε 0 2 ζ f ζ m ln 1 e κ h 1 e κ h ζ f 2 ζ m 2 ln 1 e 2 κ h 3 4 r 2 ρ taking the surface properties of the sludge and the membrane samples as input eqs 16 18 yield fig 8 shows the profiles of specific interaction energy with the separation distance between a sludge floc and membrane surface the floc size of bulking sludge and normal sludge for calculation is 143 9 μm and 272 43 μm fig 4c respectively as shown in fig 8 u f w m t o l d per unit mass at the minimum distance for stage i normal sludge and stage ii bulking sludge samples is 28 85 1010 and 103 91 1010 kt g mlss respectively this means that the adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge to the membrane surface is about 3 6 times than that of the normal sludge the higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge should stem from its smaller particle size fig 4c and stickier property fig 3b this analysis provides a reasonable thermodynamic mechanism well explaining the rather higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge in the mbr after sludge foulants adhere to the membrane surface the operation of a mbr will be subject to filtration through a foulant layer considering the higher cst fig 4 and gel like morphology fig 1b2 of the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge the following mechanism as shown in fig 9 is proposed to explain the much higher sfr of the bulking sludge than the normal sludge as shown in fig 9a and c normal sludge has a larger floc size and limited filamentous bacteria which would form a cake layer with a porous structure the cross section of the cake layer fig 9a shows the existence of some visible connected channels through the cake layer water can directly go through these connected channels fig 9c such a cake layer is a physically porous material whose filtration resistance can be measured by the carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 as a result the sfr of the normal sludge suspension is relatively low in contrast bulking sludge suspension contains smaller size flocs and abundant filamentous bacteria the abundant hyphae stretch out of the sludge flocs hook the membrane surface like tentacles and form a net catching structure on the membrane surface as a result the formed foulant layer is relatively homogeneous and in a viscous fluid state it is a kind of intermediate state of the cake layer and gel layer there is no obvious connected pore in the cross section of the foulant layer fig 9b and water cannot directly go through the foulant layer fig 9d sustaining filtration through such a foulant layer resides in other mechanisms fig 10 presents a schematic diagram of the proposed thermodynamic mechanism underlying filtration through the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge from the thermodynamic viewpoint filtration through a gel like foulant layer corresponds to a chemical potential gap the gel layer contains abundant bound water with lower chemical potential than free water the permeate since there is no obvious connected pore in the gel like layer it needs to drag bound water out to the permeate free water in order to sustain the filtration process as a result extra force should be exerted to offset the chemical potential gap corresponding to a high filtration resistance eq 15 in the extended flory huggins theory provides a measure of sfr of a gel layer originating from the mixing chemical potential change filtration of eps solution will generally form a standard gel layer on the membrane surface by setting φ 0 075 and χ 0 50 for the bulking sludge eps the simulated sfr according to eq 15 is 1 32 1016 m kg 1 very close to the really measured sfr 1 29 1016 m kg 1 of the bulking sludge eps this simulation result well verifies the real existence of such a thermodynamic mechanism governing the gel layer filtration process the foulant layer formed by the bulking sludge is a kind of intermediate state between the cake layer and the gel layer therefore the bulking sludge possesses a sfr lower than eps but rather higher than the normal sludge the proposed mechanism can satisfactorily explain the high sfr of the bulking sludge it should be noted that the proposed mechanisms regarding high fouling propensity of bulking sludge are independent of membrane model type reactor scale and wastewater type and have universal significance for membrane fouling mitigation and mbr operation the above results suggest that the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria is the underlying cause of the occurrence of sludge bulking the net catching structure formed by the abundant filamentous bacteria favors the stick of sludge flocs on the membrane surface and the formation of a homogeneous foulant layer which corresponds to the higher membrane fouling the causes of the overgrowth of filamentous are various it can be the result of shifts in temperature toxic compounds ph dissolved oxygen concentration and substrate loading meng and yang 2007 xia et al 2016 in most cases such as the unsuitable temperature existence of toxic matters and ph shock the mbr system should be less propensity to develop sludge bulking than the conventional activated sludge process because it has stronger impact resistance however as mbr has a higher mlss concentration a low aeration rate in mbr may easier lead to the occurrence of sludge bulking because the oxygen mass transfer capacity is decreased under the higher concentration of mlss in the current study sludge bulking occurred when the aeration rate dropped due to the blocked aeration holes therefore during the operation and maintenance of the mbr system attention should be paid to the aeration pipe to keep the normal aeration rate and bubble size which can significantly minimize the excessive proliferation of filamentous bacteria and the occurrence of sludge bulking as well as the aggravation of membrane fouling strictly speaking sludge foaming and sludge bulking should be two different conceptions which correspond to different production and properties of polysaccharides and proteins in mbrs previous study well explored adhesion filtration and biological mechanisms underlying membrane fouling caused by the foaming sludge wu et al 2020 different from the previous study this work revealed the thermodynamic membrane fouling mechanisms during sludge bulking for the first time the operational conditions seeded sludge and fouling behaviors reported in these two studies are totally different the revealed mechanisms in this work well explained the high filtration resistance and strong adhesive force of the membrane fouling phenomenon during sludge bulking period facilitating to develop efficient membrane fouling control strategies 4 conclusions both long term and short term experiments evidenced that the occurrence of sludge bulking led to an easier fouling formation for mbr than in the normal stage the sfr of bulking sludge was as high as 1 36 1014 m kg 1 which is over 5 33 times that of the normal sludge a series of characterizations suggest that as compared to normal sludge the bulking sludge has a lower dewaterability smaller particle size larger fractal dimension higher viscosity and more abundant filamentous bacteria in addition the occurrence of sludge bulking was attributed to the microbial community transition in the mbr system thermodynamic analyses showed that the adhesion energy of bulking sludge at the contact distance was about 3 6 times of the normal sludge indicating the higher adhesion propensity of the bulking sludge therefore bulking sludge tended to form a relatively homogeneous gel like foulant layer corresponding to an extremely high sfr the chemical potential gap described by the flory huggins theory can satisfactorily explain the above mentioned high sfr of bulking sludge this study provided universal thermodynamic mechanisms of membrane fouling caused by bulking sludge which should be independent of membrane type this work facilitates avoidance of sludge bulking and optimization of mbr treatment process declaration of

from near zero to a maximum of 2 1 0 11 particles m 3 depending on the location relative to the jet we found four relevant categories of droplets based on their trajectories following their emission at the jet s free surface particles with inertia high enough to escape the immediate vicinity of the jet category 1 particles moving towards the jet category 2 particles drawn into the aerator which only included particles with a diameter smaller than 50 μ m category 3 and particles with a near vertical trajectory category 4 tracing category 1 particles to their generation location on the water interface shows a higher emission rate near the aerator finally we employ a numerical model to compute the subsequent trajectories of droplets detected at the limits of the sampled domain we find that particles whose diameter is smaller than 55 μ m completely dry and become airborne larger droplets deposit within a radius of 7 cm around the jet assuming a surface is located 20 cm below the aerator tip these results increase the fundamental understanding of the emission mechanisms of droplets in aerated jets and their fate in the sink environment graphical abstract keywords phase doppler

estrada perez et al 2018 toilets schreck et al 2021 and as recently studied in faucet aerators benoit et al 2021 consequently microorganisms present in the source water can spread through the droplets formed the focus of the present work is on aerosols emitted by faucet aerators as a route for pathogen transmission the size of the emitted droplets strongly influences their behavior larger droplets tend to settle before they completely dry out and within a small distance from their source thus contaminating the surrounding surfaces or equipment and infecting individuals near the particle source conversely evaporation occurs more rapidly for smaller water particles which may dry out completely resulting in dried droplet nuclei the latter remain longer in the air and are transported by air currents thus reaching further these particles can be inhaled by individuals far from the aerosol source and the viability of pathogens in such particles depends on environmental factors such as temperature relative humidity ultraviolet light exposure and atmospheric pollutants tang 2009 the idea of one cut off particle diameter classifying droplets within the droplet airborne dichotomy is convenient for devising safety guidelines w h o 2020 however after emission the droplet trajectory and size evolution are coupled and depend on its initial content temperature size ejection velocity ambient temperature and relative humidity de oliveira et al 2021 bourouiba 2021 therefore the idea of a general cut off diameter and the corresponding dichotomy is insufficient and the dispersion of the droplets needs to be quantified and characterized for each aerosolization configuration to have accurate predictions additionally the size of a droplet determines among other factors its likelihood to deposit at infection sites in the respiratory tract darquenne 2012 which is of concern for respiratory pathogens such as legionella hence the characterization of the size distribution when coupled with the study of the dispersal pattern of aerosols generated from a water using device is essential to estimate the risk associated with exposure to these droplets and quantify it for instance through quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies hamilton et al 2018 faucet aerators the subject of the present study are devices that can be mounted at the tip of a faucet and serve several purposes flow restriction and water conservation improved pressure feeling and reduced splashing different types of aerators result in various water flow rates and water streams the latter include aerated streams non aerated streams and shower spray it has been shown in a previous work that the very common aerated jet configurations produced the highest particle counts and mass benoit et al 2021 in such jets air drawn into the jet from the surroundings mixes with water and results in a large number of air bubbles when these bubbles reach the free surface of the jet they burst and produce droplets of different sizes although other droplet production mechanisms can intervene such as splashing from the bottom of the sink bubble bursting remains the primary inhalable aerosol production mechanism even though drinking water is treated to minimize the level of pathogens within it biofilms still develop in water distribution systems embedding microbial cells and providing them with nutrients and protection from external stressors simoes and simões 2013 hence faucet aerators can become contaminated from infected individuals using the faucet reuter et al 2002 splashing from contaminated drains kotay et al 2017 or contaminated water ahead of the faucet outlet in the latter case aerators were shown to amplify the initial concentration of contaminants present in the water weber et al 1999 kappstein et al 2000 bédard et al 2015 consequently faucet aerators have been associated with outbreaks of several opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa in the hospital environment where most patients are vulnerable walker et al 2014 lv et al 2019 knoester et al 2014 yet rarely has the aerosol production been studied quantitatively bollin et al 1985 and never has the link with bursting bubbles been pointed out to until recently benoit et al 2021 bursting bubbles have been widely studied due to their prevalence in a wide range of contexts such as champagne tasting ghabache et al 2016 sea spray aerosol blanco rodriguez and gordillo 2020 viability of cells in bioreactors walls et al 2017 and pathogen spread blanchard and syzdek 1970 poulain and bourouiba 2018 an air bubble in a fluid at rest rises due to buoyancy forces until it reaches the free surface and remains at equilibrium the liquid cap entrapped between the bubble and the interface then drains and ultimately punctures as the thin film retracts it disintegrates into film droplets poulain et al 2018 the remaining cavity collapses due to capillary effects giving rise to a jet that can later decompose into jet droplets which are generally bigger than film droplets moreover several works derived relations between the bubble size and fluid properties on the one hand and the size of jet drops and their ejection velocities on the other hand the previous studies on bubble bursting involve a horizontal free surface at rest an axisymmetric configuration on the other hand when a bubble bursts at the free surface of a cylindrical water jet this is no longer the case several studies showed that the bursting dynamics occurring in configurations that did not present cylindrical symmetry were different from those observed in the axisymmetric case for instance the bursting dynamics for cavitation bubbles in a jet were found to be different from those in the case of a planar free surface see robert et al 2007 for a bubble in a jet and li et al 2019 for a bubble at a planar free surface and the bursting dynamics of an air bubble in the asymmetric case and the symmetric one were found to differ liger belair 2012 singh and das 2019 therefore the extent to which one can apply the findings from previous studies to predict the size distribution of droplets generated from an aerated jet is unknown in addition the bubble size distribution of the bubbles in the jet that result from the mixing of air with the water in a faucet aerator is unknown several studies characterized the aeration in free falling jets downstream of dams carrillo et al 2021 2020 castillo et al 2015 however the main aeration mechanism is air entrainment along the water jet interface resulting from turbulence shear stress overcoming the stabilizing capillary effects ervine and falvey 1987 the latter mechanism does not occur in faucet aerators where the air is entrained into the aerator due to the venturi effect moreover some results such as bubble sizes cannot be extrapolated if the scale difference is large and scaling effects are known to appear when a froude similarity is applied the problem depends on a large number of dimensionless numbers including the reynolds number which makes achieving a complete dynamic similarity extremely challenging chanson 2009 the main objective of this paper is to characterize experimentally the size and dispersal pattern of droplets generated from an aerated water jet we present detailed quantitative measurements of the size distribution and velocities of the particles at different locations relative to the jet and discuss them supported by high speed video imaging of the particle trajectories and a prediction of their ultimate fate finally we assess the droplet emission conditions as a function of their emission location within the jet 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of an aerator master plumber model uln 400 mounted at the extremity of a hose connected to a faucet the hose was used to increase the range of positions from the water jet radially and vertically accessible during the experiments accounting for geometrical constraints in the sink and measurement equipment the presence of the hose in the flow path therefore does not affect the relevance of the results to characterize faucet aerators as they are implemented in practice municipal tap water originating from surface water in montreal the quality of which was extensively characterized in doré et al 2019 was supplied at an average flow rate of 10 3 lpm with minor fluctuations less than 6 typical of those occurring within the supply line when the valve opening is maintained constant two techniques were used to characterize the droplets in the surroundings of the aerated water jet a phase doppler anemometer pda and particle tracking using high speed imaging 2 1 1 pda measurements the pda consisted of a laser transmitter dantec dynamics flowexplorer model number 9066x0701 receiver probes dantec dynamics fiberpda model number 9060x0421 a processor dantec dynamics burst spectrum analyser bsa s n 9063n0532 267 with the bsa flow software dantec dynamics v7 11 0 0 for equipment control and data analysis the pda was mounted on a traverse dantec dynamics iselgermany model number 9041t0332 allowing it to move in three directions phase doppler anemometry is a mature non intrusive method using fundamental theories of light propagation and scattering to measure the size and velocity of particles suspended in transparent media albrecht et al 2013 dantec 2011 four laser beams are emitted along the x z and y z planes fig 1 two in each plane all four beams intersect forming the illuminated volume comprising interference fringes when a particle passes through this volume the scattered light is captured by three detectors and results in a doppler burst the scattered light corresponding to each pair of intersecting laser beams is used to determine one of the two velocity components measured v y and v z the measurement principle exploits the doppler effect the frequency of the light scattered off a moving particle and detected by the receiver is different from that of the light originally emitted from the transmitter the frequency shift resulting from the superposition of both scattered laser beams is measured through the modulated amplitude of the light detected by the receiver its dependence on the velocity is expressed as follows 1 f d 2 s i n θ l 2 λ u i where f d is the doppler frequency θ l is the angle between the pair of laser beams incident on the particle λ is the laser wavelength and u i is the i th component of the velocity where i y z finally the size of the particle is calculated by considering the phase shift between the doppler burst signals from the different detectors the measurable size range of the pda depends on several factors including the focal length of the transmitter s lens the focal length of the receiver s lens the mask used in front of the detectors and the scattering angle of the detected light it was also shown that the sensitivity of the photomultipliers the signal gain and the laser power affect the measured size distribution kapulla and najera 2006 thus preliminary tests were made to ensure that this was not the case with the values chosen in the experiments the parameters used in the current study are shown in table 1 and allow the detection of particles with diameters situated in the range 0 5 150 μ m at the beginning of each experiment the illuminated volume was placed at the lower extremity of the aerator which was taken as a reference point two spatial scans were thus made one in the y z plane and another along the vertical near the interface at y 1 75 mm leading to spatial mappings of the size and velocity distributions at each location the sampling time was chosen such that the obtained size distribution reached a steady state i e until the overall distribution did not change significantly with time and was thus representative of the particles passing through the measurement location this constraint represented a limitation for the number of positions that could be mapped within a reasonable time frame thus limiting the spatial resolution and boundaries of the spatial domain where measurements were taken the maximum acquisition time for a complete scan was chosen here as ten continuous hours of measurements the domain boundaries were y 2 5 10 5 mm z 0 60 mm with a resolution of δ y 2 mm and δ z 10 mm for the planar scan and y 1 75 mm z 0 80 mm with δ z 2 mm for the longitudinal scan for sampling locations where the number of particles was excessively low the size distribution was shown in the results to illustrate the scarcity of droplets and is not statistically meaningful 2 1 2 high speed imaging the water jet was illuminated with a nila varsa light source a high speed camera photron fastcam mini ax200 was placed on the opposite side of the water jet as shown in fig 2 the frame rate used was 4000 fps and the shutter speed was 1 10000 s the image resolution was 1024 1024 and the spatial resolution was approximately 30 μ m pixel with the lens used 105 mm f2 8 macro ex dg hsm sigma these parameters are appropriate for the tracking of the particles observed which were expected to have a velocity on the order of 1 m s deike et al 2018 particles appeared as illuminated pixels in the acquired images the latter were processed for particle detection and tracking using an in house code the tracking code employed the hungarian algorithm buehren 2008 particles in two successive frames are matched together such that the sum of the distances between the centroids of all the resulting pairs of particles is minimal thus particle positions are stored across consecutive frames allowing the determination of their trajectories it should be noted that the image plane is the y z plane meaning that the trajectories observed are the projection on this plane of the three dimensional particle trajectory however if we assume that the aerosol production is axisymmetric the dispersal pattern is maintained furthermore the number of particles observed in the images was highly affected by the position of the light source also the size of the smallest detectable particle is limited by the image s spatial resolution consequently the high speed imaging experiments do not provide quantitative particle size and velocity distributions nonetheless they are used for illustrative purposes and offer complementary information to interpret pda results 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 pda data analysis as previously mentioned two spatial mappings of the aerosol sizes and velocities in the aerated jet surroundings are presented in this article the first is a coarse scan performed in the y z plane to identify patterns in the size distribution of particles and their trajectories as a function of spatial location the second is limited to the region near the jet s interface along the z axis to provide a higher spatial resolution allowing the prediction of the droplet emission points the size distribution and the mean particle diameter at each position were extracted with the bsa software a probe volume correction was applied to the size distribution to account for the actual measurement volume dependence on the size of the particles dantec 2011 when the number of sampled particles was too small to apply this correction the size distribution is presented without any statistical correction the raw data including the size and velocity of each particle passing through the measurement volume without any statistical correction were also used to represent the particle trajectories it should be noted that particles with a diameter smaller than 3 μ m were excluded from the analysis due to low pda accuracy in this size range when calculating the location of droplet production in the jet we consider particles detected in the scan along the z axis and moving away from the water jet with a downward trajectory 180 θ 100 see fig 3 for orientation convention indeed as observed in the high speed imaging recordings see supplemental material particles are initially mostly emitted from the jet with a downward trajectory before being affected by the surrounding airflow since the radial distance from the jet free surface was approximately 1 75 mm for these measurements and assuming linear trajectories the origin on the jet of each particle s trajectory z o was computed as follows 2 z o z 1 75 tan θ z being the sampling location where the particle was detected and θ the angle computed with the convention shown in fig 3 since the maximum z value sampled was 80 mm the lowest origin of particles highest z o value that can be retraced reliably for all trajectory directions is at z o 70 mm limit case for θ 100 droplets produced at z o between 70 and 80 mm with trajectories close to the vertical limit depending on the z o value would be found at positions lower than the measurement domain boundary 1 75 mm away from the interface fig 3a thus droplets from our data traced back to z o 70 80 mm would represent only part of the particles emitted at that interface position and the study is limited to z o 0 70 mm even though the measurements along the z axis have a high resolution taken every 2 mm they are still taken at discrete locations a simplified approach is implemented to fill the missing data between the sampling points the acquired data is taken over the z dimension of the illuminated volume d z measurement distance shown in red in 3b the unsampled distance between the sampling points distance in black in 3b δ z d z is divided by d z to get n v the number of measurement volumes needed to fill the gap fig 3 3 n v δ z d z d z the data taken at each sampling point is therefore counted n v more times except at the last sampling point to provide an estimate of the true number of droplets that would be detected if the spatial locations were spanned continuously instead of measuring at discrete locations once the droplet generation rate is obtained it is multiplied by the ratio of the jet perimeter to that of the pda measurement volume thickness d x to account for the droplet production at the jet periphery rotational symmetry 2 2 2 end fate of the droplets as previously mentioned the bounds of the sampled domain are limited by measurement time constraints to better assess the transmission risk linked to the dispersion pattern of the droplets beyond the spatial boundaries considered in the pda measurements we implement an in house code based on the physical model presented in xie et al 2007 the equations employed model the evaporation and movement of the emitted droplets and incorporate relative humidity air temperature and water temperature the mass balance heat balance and momentum

respectively subscripts g and p refer to the surrounding gas and droplet respectively although the effect of a surrounding airflow is included in the gas velocity v g in the present work the trajectories of the droplets are computed in still air v g 0 for further details refer to xie et al 2007 eqs 4 6 are discretized with the forward euler method with a timestep of 1 0 4 s the conditions of the simulation were chosen to mimic the standard indoor environment health canada recommends maintaining a relative humidity in the buildings of approximately 30 in the winter and 50 during the summer healthcanada 2016 and a drinking water temperature less than 20 c healthcanada 2021 while the world health organization suggests an indoor temperature between 18 and 24 c although the higher limit is not resolved precisely w h o 2018 consequently the simulations were run at a droplet temperature of 15 c an air temperature of 20 c and two values of relative humidity 30 and 50 the in house code was validated by comparing results from the free falling droplets test case to corresponding results in xie et al 2007 the test case consists of pure water droplets at a temperature of 33 c falling from a position at rest in dry air r h 0 at a temperature of 18 c simulations were stopped when the droplets reach a diameter of 1 μ m the evolution of the diameter of the droplets modeled with time and the variation of the falling velocity with the droplet diameters are in good agreement with the results presented in xie et al 2007 as shown in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 high speed imaging high speed imaging was used to understand the spatial trajectory tendencies observed with the pda measurements shown in the following section the jet and its surroundings were filmed at 4 locations covering z 0 25 mm z 25 55 mm z 55 85 mm and z 85 105 mm the particle tracking algorithm is used to extract trajectories from the acquired images the results are shown in fig 5 yellow markers represent points of the particles trajectories where they are moving downward and away from the jet 180 θ 90 red markers correspond to particles moving downstream toward the interface 90 θ 0 and green markers correspond to particles moving upstream towards the aerator 0 θ 90 it can be observed in fig 5a that droplets emitted early from the jet yellow markers near the aerator are decelerated and then aspirated towards the aerator green markers indeed the aerator pulls air to mix it with water thus entraining these particles upwards this behavior is observed in the region corresponding to 0 z 18 mm for higher z values the airflow is no longer strong enough to carry the particles to the aerator yet still influences the particles trajectories by decelerating them and changing the track characteristic of droplets emitted from bubbles bursting as can be seen in the high speed videos shown in the supplemental material the latter particles mostly move with a slope angle 180 θ 90 once decelerated the particles are drawn towards the jet reversing the sign of the y component of their velocities red markers the decelerating effect of the airflow near the aerator can still be seen on the trajectories of particles at z 55 85 mm in fig 5b trajectories with yellow and red markers when the decelerated particles are far from the jet they move in a near vertical gravity dominated trajectory on the other hand when the particles are close enough to the jet and far enough from the aerator z 40 mm they appear to be caught in a boundary layer accelerated by the water stream the thickness of the boundary layer is approximately 2 5 mm derived from the videos the presence of the boundary layer is more visible in fig 5 c d where the two groups of particles described are identified in addition the videos show qualitatively that the emission of droplets from the jet decreases when moving downwards the latter observation along with the fact that the particles gradually reach a near vertical motion starting from z 40 mm suggests a size distribution that varies minimally with further movement downstream therefore explaining the asymptotic size distribution and θ scatter plots reached in the scan along the z axis figs 12 13 presented subsequently it should be noted that several particles are seen in the videos to have high inertia they maintain their trajectory from emission and escape the camera frame as discussed in the introduction pathogens can spread within droplets when the water is contaminated and the resulting particles can either deposit on surfaces and equipment near the sink or evaporate and remain suspended in the air long enough to be inhaled the droplets end fate depends on their emission size and velocity among other factors the trajectories observed in the high speed images taken near the faucet exhibit several distinct patterns suggesting different potential contamination routes while particles that are aspirated by the aerator or drawn by the boundary layer of the jet are not likely to be dispersed far away from the vicinity of the sink this is not the case for particles moving in a decelerated near vertical motion 100 θ 80 nor those with inertia high enough to preserve an inclined trajectory with 180 θ 100 in the former case the particles can deposit at the bottom of the sink or get dispersed by ambient currents if they dry to droplet nuclei similarly particles of high inertia either dry depending on the ambient conditions and become airborne or deposit on surfaces within or around the sink however they may deposit further from the sink basin than particles with a near vertical trajectory due to the inclined path they follow thus creating a risk of pathogen transmission through indirect contact fomites as explained earlier not all particles can be visualized with the settings used in high speed imaging experiments consequently to further quantify the data observed in the high speed camera videos and gain insight into the process of droplet emission from the jet a thorough mapping of the particles size and velocity was conducted with the pda and is presented in the following sections 3 2 spatial mapping in the longitudinal plane a coarse scan in the y z plane is performed to obtain information on the global number and sizes of particles emitted by the jet the sampled positions were in the range y 2 5 10 5 mm and z 0 60 mm in this section the particle size distribution the variation of particle counts and the mean particle diameter at the different spatial positions will be presented as a broad view of the particles spread in space 3 2 1 particle size distribution the size distributions of the particles as a function of position relative to the aerated jet are shown in fig 6 the ordinate of the histograms represents the fraction of particles that fall within each size range the color represents the number of particles detected per cubic meter of air at each position particles up to a diameter of 150 μ m are detected generally with a bell shaped size distribution which becomes broader when moving downstream at each radial position also the mode of the size distribution increases when z increases at a fixed radial distance from the jet 32 μ m at y 2 5 mm and 73 μ m at z 10 mm and y 2 5 mm z 60 mm this can have two potential explanations the first one consists of a broader distribution of bursting bubbles at the interface when moving downstream from the jet with a higher fraction of bubbles with a larger diameter the second explanation is that smaller particles are detected as a larger fraction of the total population near the aerator lower z values where they are aspirated naturally this fraction decreases when moving downstream finally the total number of particles varied from 0 0411 particles m 3 at y 8 5 mm z 0 to 2 0129 1 0 11 particles m 3 at y 6 5 mm z 10 mm the lowest concentration of particles is found at z 0 highlighting the low background concentration in the laboratory air and the scarcity of particles reaching a height higher than the aerator s tip the number of particles per second detected in the measurement volume 0 0742 μ m 3 at each position and the corresponding mean diameter and mass are shown in fig 7 while the concentration of particles is relevant when assessing the number of particles that may enter the airways when inhaling the number of particles detected at a position per second mirrors the hydrodynamic aspect of the problem the particle count is the highest in the lower vicinity of the aerator 10 765 particles s at y 2 5 mm z 20 mm it reaches a minimum of 0 022 particles s at y 8 5 mm at the same level as the aerator the highest number of particles is detected within the region y 8 5 mm 10 z 40 mm as for the mean diameter it increases with both radial and longitudinal distance from the aerator and reaches a maximum of 72 6 μ m at the lower left extremity of the domain measured y 10 5 mm z 60 mm indeed the largest droplets are less prone to entrainment by the airflow near the aerator or within the boundary layer near the water stream and can maintain their original downwards trajectory departing from the jet over a longer distance finally the mass of the particles detected per second is the highest within the triangular region near the jet delimited by the extremities y 8 5 mm z 60 mm and y 0 z 20 mm its maximum value is 0 9377 μ g s corresponding to the mass flux passing through the measurement volume at y 0 z 40 mm it is worth noting that at the domain boundary the largest aerosol mass is within the lower region z 20 mm thus unless adverse upwards air currents exist the highest potential pathogen load is associated with particles deposited on the sink basin or surrounding surfaces and particles that remain suspended beneath the aerator 3 2 2 droplet trajectories the modulus and orientation of the velocity vector of the particles are shown as a function of the different droplets diameters in fig 8 these parameters describe the trajectories of particles at several locations from the jet the slope angles of the particles trajectories are computed relative to the y axis and follow the convention shown in fig 3 in each plot 90 0 and 90 slope angles are marked by black horizontal lines while 180 and 180 angles are at the bounds of the y axis at points located at the same height of the aerator tip z 0 very few particles are found highlighting again that particles reaching the region above the aerator are scarce at y 2 5 mm z 10 mm two main particle clusters can be distinguished particles moving upwards toward the water jet and particles moving downward away from it a third cluster corresponding to particles moving downwards and toward the stream appears further downstream at a constant radial location the number of particles heading toward the aerator decreases at lower positions this is also true for particles heading downwards and away from the jet with a steep slope the two groups gradually merge into one group of particles with slope angles ranging from 180 to 90 starting from z 20 mm the more z increases the more the particles are found with a trajectory slope of approximately 90 referring to a vertical downward trajectory this tendency holds at different radial locations no clear correlation can be seen between the slope of the particle s path and its size however it can be seen qualitatively that particles with a diameter larger than a threshold value almost only move downwards and away from the jet at each sampling location this threshold value varies between approximately 60 and 110 μ m and increases with increasing z at a constant y furthermore when moving downwards and away from the jet smaller particles move closer to a near vertical path in contrast only particles of a diameter smaller than a threshold value are drawn towards the aerator the latter threshold varies between 45 and 50 μ m since particles emitted from the jet move downwards and away from it as previously seen in the high speed videos the previous observations can be explained by the following particles of different sizes are emitted by the bubbles bursting at the interface of the jet the smallest particles can be drawn to the aerator diameter smaller than 45 μ m when moving further downstream or in other terms moving further away from the point of emission of droplets produced near the aerator the trajectory of larger droplets is affected to a different extent depending on their size by the airflow near the aerator and in the boundary layer near the water jet this results in the merging of the different clusters observed only the largest particles diameter bigger than 110 μ m preserve their trajectory for most sampled positions additionally the velocity modulus of the droplets was computed from the two components v y and v z and is represented by the color scale in fig 8 thus it represents the velocity in the y z plane although it does not provide the precise three dimensional velocity modulus value it preserves the overall velocity tendencies since the velocity component in the direction perpendicular to the y z plane is assumed to be negligible for particles detected in the y z plane again no clear trend can be seen between the particles diameters and their velocities exclusively however it can be seen that particles moving downwards and away from the jet and consequently particles that are emitted from the jet and not yet affected by the airflow have the highest velocity that can reach values up to 3 8 m s another observation is that for constant y when z increases the smallest particles of the previously described group are gradually decelerated for instance smaller than 25 μ m at y 0 z 30 mm or 50 μ m at y 0 z 50 mm and their number decreases this means that some of the droplets described are hindered by the airflow and change trajectories this behavior confirms the observations of the near vertical trajectories of the smaller particles appearing with higher z values detailed in the previous paragraph and seen in the high speed videos based on the different types of trajectories droplets may have five categories of particles can be defined the first category consists of droplets moving downwards and away from the jet 180 θ 100 the second class englobes particles moving downwards toward the water jet 80 θ 0 the third one includes particles moving upwards toward the aerator 0 θ 90 the fourth category comprises particles with a near vertical trajectory 100 θ 80 and the fifth moves upwards and away from the jet 90 θ 180 according to fig 9a particles moving downwards and toward the jet have the highest count fraction between 45 to 50 for particles moving downwards and away from the jet the count fraction varied between 34 to 36 particles moving in a near vertical trajectory have a count fraction of 9 and 10 at y 2 5 and 4 5 mm respectively the latter fraction increases with a further increase of radial distance from the jet reaching 18 at y 10 5 mm this variation reflects the decreasing influence the airflow in the boundary layer near the jet or near the aerator has on the particles motion with increasing radial distance as expected figs 5 and 8 the fraction of particles aspirated by the aerator induced airflow is highest at the nearest radial position from the jet and is almost null at y 10 5 mm finally particles moving upwards and away from the jet are practically nonexistent category 1 downward and away from the jet has the highest mass fraction which varied between 46 and 51 at y 10 5 mm 34 58 μ g s of particles of category 1 are detected and thus escape the immediate vicinity of the jet the mass fraction of category 2 downward and toward the jet fluctuated between 32 and 35 this permutation of fraction order is due to particles affected by the aerator induced airflow being smaller than particles retaining their original motion deviating from the stream leading to a lower mass fraction despite the higher count category 4 near vertical trajectory has a mass fraction between 15 and 20 finally the mass fraction of category 3 upward toward the aerator is 1 6 at y 2 5 mm and reaches 0 at y 6 5 mm and is considerably smaller than its count fraction since only the smallest particles are aspirated toward the aerator thus the highest mass of the droplets may surpass the sink boundaries and either deposit on the surrounding surfaces or become airborne 3 2 3 end fate of the droplets to better assess the risk associated with the aerosol studied the model presented in section 2 2 2 is employed to simulate the end fate of the droplets detected at y 10 5 mm at two relative humidity values 30 and 50 the results are shown in fig 10 we simulate the trajectory and diameter variation of 6 particle sizes 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 μ m we subsample among category 1 droplets since they are the most likely to escape the vicinity of the jet and reach the furthest distances we assume that the sink counter is at 20 cm from the lower tip of the aerator the simulations are stopped when the droplet diameter reaches a value of 1 μ m where it is assumed to become airborne if the droplet reaches the height of the sink countertop before becoming airborne it either deposits on the counter outside the sink or is contained within the sink basin hence knowing the particle deposition radius at the sink countertop level is needed to determine the droplets that are contained within the sink and the droplets that deposit outside the sink and their deposition location fig 10 a c shows that droplets with a diameter smaller than 55 μ m become airborne before reaching the level of the counter within 25 mm of the jet at a relative humidity of 30 while particles smaller than 50 μ m become airborne at 50 rh thus a lower relative humidity slightly increases the droplet diameter threshold at emission below which particles become airborne larger droplets deposit on the sink counter or are contained in the sink basin within 70 mm of the water jet in general in both cases the larger the droplet the larger the deposition radius fig 10 b d the latter observation means that if the water is contaminated the largest pathogenic load is the farthest from the faucet assuming a uniform distribution in the different droplets the effect of relative humidity on the deposition site of the larger particles is minimal finally since the larger particles deposit within 7 cm from the faucet the sink basin should be placed such as the distance between all of its edges and the faucet outlet perimeter is larger than 7 cm the effect of the faucet height on the fate of the droplets can be seen in fig 11 the black lines represent sink counters located 10 20 30 and 40 cm below the aerator it can be seen that for lower sink counters larger droplets have time to evaporate before impact and can therefore become airborne the upper threshold diameter varies between 45 μ m at r h 30 40 μ m at r h 50 for a faucet height of 10 cm from the sink counter and 60 μ m for a faucet height of 40 cm hence as expected reducing the faucet heights decreases the number of airborne particles but also their size which reduces the pathogen load that remains in the suspended droplets decreasing airborne transmission the ultimate risk of infection depends not only on the aerosol characteristics reported here but also on the inhalation of sufficient numbers of viable pathogens the survival of pathogens in aerosol depends on ambient temperature relative humidity the content of the droplets exposure to atmospheric pollutants and ultraviolet light tang 2009 hence the latter effects should be included in estimating infection risks for different settings in practice the dependence of a specific pathogen on the described factors may not be fully known and certain assumptions are used in qmra models hamilton et al 2018 3 3 longitudinal profile along the jet interface a high resolution scan along the z axis was done 1 75 mm from the interface corresponding to the distance between the jet interface and the edge of the aerator and to y 0 with a spatial step of 2 mm ranging from z 0 to z 80 mm and resulting in 21 measurement points thus this scan was done closer to the interface with a higher resolution and a larger z bound compared to the data shown previously to estimate the number and the generation location of the droplets produced by bursting bubbles 3 3 1 droplet size distribution the size distribution at the different z positions is shown in fig 12 and the layout is identical to that in fig 6 similar to what was described earlier in the planar scan the size distribution is initially unimodal however it shifts to a bimodal one at approximately z 36 mm not shown in fig 12 and reaches asymptotically a monotonically decreasing distribution indicating a higher percentage of the smallest particles at lower positions which can be explained by a similar change in the size distribution of the bubbles at the interface of the jet the particle concentration varied from 5 6 1 0 6 particles m 3 at z 0 to 3 6 1 0 9 particles m 3 at z 20 mm the maximum value is 2 orders lower than that in the planar scan due to the higher induced air flow rates closer to the jet even though the number of particles detected was higher reaching values up to 42 particles s 3 3 2 droplet trajectories the velocity vector modulus and orientation in the y z plane are shown in fig 13 at y 1 75 mm the same particle clusters as in fig 8 are observed although still low in number more droplets moving upwards and away from the jet are detected category 5 down to z 40 mm particles with a velocity higher than 0 5 m s a value typical of droplets entrained by the induced airflows and moving upward and away from the jet are scarce this observation can be explained by the fact that droplets initially ejected upwards are quickly decelerated by both gravity and the aerator induced airflow and then mostly sucked into the aerator hence these droplets were not observed in the planar scan in which sampled points were located further from the interface these droplets are neglected due to their low number and limited detection region droplets larger than a threshold value ranging from 42 μ m at z 12 to 83 μ m at z 60 mm are almost exclusively moving downwards and away from the jet on the other hand only droplets with a diameter smaller than a value starting at 33 μ m at z 2 increasing up to 40 μ m at z 14 and then decreasing to 36 μ m at z 36 mm are drawn towards the aerator the same tendencies are observed for the velocity angle with the increase of z with a more pronounced agglomeration of the angles around θ 90 this behavior seems to be reached asymptotically as it does not vary considerably starting from z 48 mm and up to z 80 mm as for the velocity modulus while it decreased when z increased in the y z scan for smaller particles emitted downwards and away from the jet this is not seen in the current z scan indeed the modulus attained values near 3 m s at z 80 mm the difference between the two scans is the distance to the jet s interface closer to the emission point of the droplets therefore the trajectory of the droplets is closer to that at emission and the deceleration effect is less pronounced 3 3 3 droplets produced from bursting bubbles all particles with a slope angle 180 θ 100 are traced back to their origin in the water jet as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the counts cumulative mass and diameters of particles that originated at z 70 mm are shown in fig 14 overall the number of droplets produced per unit length of the jet decreases downstream from the aerator after passing through a local maximum the increase in the droplet generation rate can result from the fact that the longer a bubble resides at the interface the more probable its bursting is for droplets to be generated further downstream in the jet bubbles situated away from the free surface must first move towards it this displacement happens due to small velocity gradients within the jet or bubble bubble interactions this leads with the decrease of the number of remaining bubbles to a slower particle generation frequency the calculations reveal that 3517 05 μ g s of droplets are emitted overall in addition 50 of the total mass of the droplets is emitted at z 26 mm and 75 before z 39 mm thus a high fraction of the particles produced is emitted close to the aerator and the use of a 50 mm long cylindrical shield would mitigate a significant fraction of the droplets the mean diameter of the droplets produced at z 1 5 mm has a value of 20 3 μ m increases to a maximum of 35 4 μ m at z 27 5 mm and decreases back to 18 5 μ m at z 69 5 mm this trend can be explained by first recalling that bubbles of a higher diameter produce bigger droplets deike et al 2018 additionally bubbles are displaced either by velocity gradients present in the jet or by bubble bubble interactions while smaller bubbles are more easily moved towards the interface by the velocity gradients than large bubbles the latter can meet the interface due to a smaller displacement and are more susceptible to bubble bubble interactions these competing tendencies lead to the observed increase in the diameter of droplets ejected when for z 10 since the number of bubbles is still relatively high and bubble bubble interactions are dominant however when the number of bubbles decreases further downstream in the jet velocity gradients become the dominant bubble displacement mechanism leading to smaller ejected droplets 3 4 limitations this study elucidates how complementary experimental and numerical methods can be used to provide a complete description of the aerosol produced in a given setting however several limitations persist the first limitation ensues from the fundamental droplet production itself the size and velocity of film and jet droplets ejected from bursting bubbles depend on the water properties on the one hand such as density viscosity and surface tension which are affected by the water content and on the bubble size on the other hand blanco rodriguez and gordillo 2020 deike et al 2018 poulain et al 2018 poulain and bourouiba 2018 first the dependence of the aerosol size distribution and dispersal pattern on water properties was not studied and the water content was unknown in addition the dependence of the size distribution and velocity of the droplets on the size distribution of the bubbles in the aerated jet remains unexplored the latter dependencies cannot be determined through the current study since the airflow aspirated by the aerator and the resulting bubble size distribution as well as the water microbial content were unknown thus experiments in a more controlled environment where the bubble size and water content can be varied are needed and are the subject of the authors future works the findings can guide the design of aerators that maintain the feel of aerated jets while minimizing droplet production and reducing the number of the largest droplets that are more susceptible to carrying a higher pathogenic load and the number of the smallest ones that may become airborne the second limitation stems from the fact that only one aerator model is used and the end fate of the droplets is derived in still air hence more studies should highlight the end fate of the droplets for different aerator models resulting in an aerated jet for different ventilation settings water contents temperatures and ambient conditions consequently adequate guidelines concerning ventilation and disinfection can be devised particularly in critical areas such as hospital rooms with patients whose immunity is compromised 4 conclusion the size distribution trajectories and dispersal pattern of the droplets generated from an aerated water jet is examined revealing four main particle groups can be identified depending on their trajectories from the jet interface moving into the aerator 9 at y 2 5 mm decelerated by the airflow towards the water the jet 45 at y 2 5 mm decelerated by drag and reaching a near vertical free fall motion 10 at y 2 5 mm and finally particles with sufficient inertia to maintain a ballistic trajectory 36 at y 2 5 mm droplets with diameters reaching 150 μ m are detected particles with a diameter smaller than 55 μ m become airborne while larger droplets deposit within 7 cm from the jet a lower faucet outlet decreases the number and pathogen load of airborne droplets the largest droplets are ejected on average at z 27 5 mm below the aerator with the generation rate decreasing downstream of the jet 75 of the total mass of the ejected droplets are emitted within 39 mm of the aerator hence adding a cylindrical shield near the aerator could prevent the dissemination of a large mass of droplets

15233,faucet aerators that form aerated water jets generate aerosols which can constitute a risk of infection if the water is contaminated particularly for vulnerable individuals near the sink in this study we characterize the size and trajectory of water droplets produced from an aerated jet the detected particle diameter ranged from 3 to 150 μ m the concentration of droplets in the air varied from near zero to a maximum of 2 1 0 11 particles m 3 depending on the location relative to the jet we found four relevant categories of droplets based on their trajectories following their emission at the jet s free surface particles with inertia high enough to escape the immediate vicinity of the jet category 1 particles moving towards the jet category 2 particles drawn into the aerator which only included particles with a diameter smaller than 50 μ m category 3 and particles with a near vertical trajectory category 4 tracing category 1 particles to their generation location on the water interface shows a higher emission rate near the aerator finally we employ a numerical model to compute the subsequent trajectories of droplets detected at the limits of the sampled domain we find that particles whose diameter is smaller than 55 μ m completely dry and become airborne larger droplets deposit within a radius of 7 cm around the jet assuming a surface is located 20 cm below the aerator

o emission location at the jet interface 1 introduction aerosolization of water is inherent to the normal operation of several water using systems such as cooling towers sanchez et al 2015 showers estrada perez et al 2018 toilets schreck et al 2021 and as recently studied in faucet aerators benoit et al 2021 consequently microorganisms present in the source water can spread through the droplets formed the focus of the present work is on aerosols emitted by faucet aerators as a route for pathogen transmission the size of the emitted droplets strongly influences their behavior larger droplets tend to settle before they completely dry out and within a small distance from their source thus contaminating the surrounding surfaces or equipment and infecting individuals near the particle source conversely evaporation occurs more rapidly for smaller water particles which may dry out completely resulting in dried droplet nuclei the latter remain longer in the air and are transported by air currents thus reaching further these particles can be inhaled by individuals far from the aerosol source and the viability of pathogens in such particles depends on environmental factors such as temperature relative humidity ultraviolet light exposure and atmospheric pollutants tang 2009 the idea of one cut off particle diameter classifying droplets within the droplet airborne dichotomy is convenient for devising safety guidelines w h o 2020 however after emission the droplet trajectory and size evolution are coupled and depend on its initial content temperature size ejection velocity ambient temperature and relative humidity de oliveira et al 2021 bourouiba 2021 therefore the idea of a general cut off diameter and the corresponding dichotomy is insufficient and the dispersion of the droplets needs to be quantified and characterized for each aerosolization configuration to have accurate predictions additionally the size of a droplet determines among other factors its likelihood to deposit at infection sites in the respiratory tract darquenne 2012 which is of concern for respiratory pathogens such as legionella hence the characterization of the size distribution when coupled with the study of the dispersal pattern of aerosols generated from a water using device is essential to estimate the risk associated with exposure to these droplets and quantify it for instance through quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies hamilton et al 2018 faucet aerators the subject of the present study are devices that can be mounted at the tip of a faucet and serve several purposes flow restriction and water conservation improved pressure feeling and reduced splashing different types of aerators result in various water flow rates and water streams the latter include aerated streams non aerated streams and shower spray it has been shown in a previous work that the very common aerated jet configurations produced the highest particle counts and mass benoit et al 2021 in such jets air drawn into the jet from the surroundings mixes with water and results in a large number of air bubbles when these bubbles reach the free surface of the jet they burst and produce droplets of different sizes although other droplet production mechanisms can intervene such as splashing from the bottom of the sink bubble bursting remains the primary inhalable aerosol production mechanism even though drinking water is treated to minimize the level of pathogens within it biofilms still develop in water distribution systems embedding microbial cells and providing them with nutrients and protection from external stressors simoes and simões 2013 hence faucet aerators can become contaminated from infected individuals using the faucet reuter et al 2002 splashing from contaminated drains kotay et al 2017 or contaminated water ahead of the faucet outlet in the latter case aerators were shown to amplify the initial concentration of contaminants present in the water weber et al 1999 kappstein et al 2000 bédard et al 2015 consequently faucet aerators have been associated with outbreaks of several opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa in the hospital environment where most patients are vulnerable walker et al 2014 lv et al 2019 knoester et al 2014 yet rarely has the aerosol production been studied quantitatively bollin et al 1985 and never has the link with bursting bubbles been pointed out to until recently benoit et al 2021 bursting bubbles have been widely studied due to their prevalence in a wide range of contexts such as champagne tasting ghabache et al 2016 sea spray aerosol blanco rodriguez and gordillo 2020 viability of cells in bioreactors walls et al 2017 and pathogen spread blanchard and syzdek 1970 poulain and bourouiba 2018 an air bubble in a fluid at rest rises due to buoyancy forces until it reaches the free surface and remains at equilibrium the liquid cap entrapped between the bubble and the interface then drains and ultimately punctures as the thin film retracts it disintegrates into film droplets poulain et al 2018 the remaining cavity collapses due to capillary effects giving rise to a jet that can later decompose into jet droplets which are generally bigger than film droplets moreover several works derived relations between the bubble size and fluid properties on the one hand and the size of jet drops and their ejection velocities on the other hand the previous studies on bubble bursting involve a horizontal free surface at rest an axisymmetric configuration on the other hand when a bubble bursts at the free surface of a cylindrical water jet this is no longer the case several studies showed that the bursting dynamics occurring in configurations that did not present cylindrical symmetry were different from those observed in the axisymmetric case for instance the bursting dynamics for cavitation bubbles in a jet were found to be different from those in the case of a planar free surface see robert et al 2007 for a bubble in a jet and li et al 2019 for a bubble at a planar free surface and the bursting dynamics of an air bubble in the asymmetric case and the symmetric one were found to differ liger belair 2012 singh and das 2019 therefore the extent to which one can apply the findings from previous studies to predict the size distribution of droplets generated from an aerated jet is unknown in addition the bubble size distribution of the bubbles in the jet that result from the mixing of air with the water in a faucet aerator is unknown several studies characterized the aeration in free falling jets downstream of dams carrillo et al 2021 2020 castillo et al 2015 however the main aeration mechanism is air entrainment along the water jet interface resulting from turbulence shear stress overcoming the stabilizing capillary effects ervine and falvey 1987 the latter mechanism does not occur in faucet aerators where the air is entrained into the aerator due to the venturi effect moreover some results such as bubble sizes cannot be extrapolated if the scale difference is large and scaling effects are known to appear when a froude similarity is applied the problem depends on a large number of dimensionless numbers including the reynolds number which makes achieving a complete dynamic similarity extremely challenging chanson 2009 the main objective of this paper is to characterize experimentally the size and dispersal pattern of droplets generated from an aerated water jet we present detailed quantitative measurements of the size distribution and velocities of the particles at different locations relative to the jet and discuss them supported by high speed video imaging of the particle trajectories and a prediction of their ultimate fate finally we assess the droplet emission conditions as a function of their emission location within the jet 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of an aerator master plumber model uln 400 mounted at the extremity of a hose connected to a faucet the hose was used to increase the range of positions from the water jet radially and vertically accessible during the experiments accounting for geometrical constraints in the sink and measurement equipment the presence of the hose in the flow path therefore does not affect the relevance of the results to characterize faucet aerators as they are implemented in practice municipal tap water originating from surface water in montreal the quality of which was extensively characterized in doré et al 2019 was supplied at an average flow rate of 10 3 lpm with minor fluctuations less than 6 typical of those occurring within the supply line when the valve opening is maintained constant two techniques were used to characterize the droplets in the surroundings of the aerated water jet a phase doppler anemometer pda and particle tracking using high speed imaging 2 1 1 pda measurements the pda consisted of a laser transmitter dantec dynamics flowexplorer model number 9066x0701 receiver probes dantec dynamics fiberpda model number 9060x0421 a processor dantec dynamics burst spectrum analyser bsa s n 9063n0532 267 with the bsa flow software dantec dynamics v7 11 0 0 for equipment control and data analysis the pda was mounted on a traverse dantec dynamics iselgermany model number 9041t0332 allowing it to move in three directions phase doppler anemometry is a mature non intrusive method using fundamental theories of light propagation and scattering to measure the size and velocity of particles suspended in transparent media albrecht et al 2013 dantec 2011 four laser beams are emitted along the x z and y z planes fig 1 two in each plane all four beams intersect forming the illuminated volume comprising interference fringes when a particle passes through this volume the scattered light is captured by three detectors and results in a doppler burst the scattered light corresponding to each pair of intersecting laser beams is used to determine one of the two velocity components measured v y and v z the measurement principle exploits the doppler effect the frequency of the light scattered off a moving particle and detected by the receiver is different from that of the light originally emitted from the transmitter the frequency shift resulting from the superposition of both scattered laser beams is measured through the modulated amplitude of the light detected by the receiver its dependence on the velocity is expressed as follows 1 f d 2 s i n θ l 2 λ u i where f d is the doppler frequency θ l is the angle between the pair of laser beams incident on the particle λ is the laser wavelength and u i is the i th component of the velocity where i y z finally the size of the particle is calculated by considering the phase shift between the doppler burst signals from the different detectors the measurable size range of the pda depends on several factors including the focal length of the transmitter s lens the focal length of the receiver s lens the mask used in front of the detectors and the scattering angle of the detected light it was also shown that the sensitivity of the photomultipliers the signal gain and the laser power affect the measured size distribution kapulla and najera 2006 thus preliminary tests were made to ensure that this was not the case with the values chosen in the experiments the parameters used in the current study are shown in table 1 and allow the detection of particles with diameters situated in the range 0 5 150 μ m at the beginning of each experiment the illuminated volume was placed at the lower extremity of the aerator which was taken as a reference point two spatial scans were thus made one in the y z plane and another along the vertical near the interface at y 1 75 mm leading to spatial mappings of the size and velocity distributions at each location the sampling time was chosen such that the obtained size distribution reached a steady state i e until the overall distribution did not change significantly with time and was thus representative of the particles passing through the measurement location this constraint represented a limitation for the number of positions that could be mapped within a reasonable time frame thus limiting the spatial resolution and boundaries of the spatial domain where measurements were taken the maximum acquisition time for a complete scan was chosen here as ten continuous hours of measurements the domain boundaries were y 2 5 10 5 mm z 0 60 mm with a resolution of δ y 2 mm and δ z 10 mm for the planar scan and y 1 75 mm z 0 80 mm with δ z 2 mm for the longitudinal scan for sampling locations where the number of particles was excessively low the size distribution was shown in the results to illustrate the scarcity of droplets and is not statistically meaningful 2 1 2 high speed imaging the water jet was illuminated with a nila varsa light source a high speed camera photron fastcam mini ax200 was placed on the opposite side of the water jet as shown in fig 2 the frame rate used was 4000 fps and the shutter speed was 1 10000 s the image resolution was 1024 1024 and the spatial resolution was approximately 30 μ m pixel with the lens used 105 mm f2 8 macro ex dg hsm sigma these parameters are appropriate for the tracking of the particles observed which were expected to have a velocity on the order of 1 m s deike et al 2018 particles appeared as illuminated pixels in the acquired images the latter were processed for particle detection and tracking using an in house code the tracking code employed the hungarian algorithm buehren 2008 particles in two successive frames are matched together such that the sum of the distances between the centroids of all the resulting pairs of particles is minimal thus particle positions are stored across consecutive frames allowing the determination of their trajectories it should be noted that the image plane is the y z plane meaning that the trajectories observed are the projection on this plane of the three dimensional particle trajectory however if we assume that the aerosol production is axisymmetric the dispersal pattern is maintained furthermore the number of particles observed in the images was highly affected by the position of the light source also the size of the smallest detectable particle is limited by the image s spatial resolution consequently the high speed imaging experiments do not provide quantitative particle size and velocity distributions nonetheless they are used for illustrative purposes and offer complementary information to interpret pda results 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 pda data analysis as previously mentioned two spatial mappings of the aerosol sizes and velocities in the aerated jet surroundings are presented in this article the first is a coarse scan performed in the y z plane to identify patterns in the size distribution of particles and their trajectories as a function of spatial location the second is limited to the region near the jet s interface along the z axis to provide a higher spatial resolution allowing the prediction of the droplet emission points the size distribution and the mean particle diameter at each position were extracted with the bsa software a probe volume correction was applied to the size distribution to account for the actual measurement volume dependence on the size of the particles dantec 2011 when the number of sampled particles was too small to apply this correction the size distribution is presented without any statistical correction the raw data including the size and velocity of each particle passing through the measurement volume without any statistical correction were also used to represent the particle trajectories it should be noted that particles with a diameter smaller than 3 μ m were excluded from the analysis due to low pda accuracy in this size range when calculating the location of droplet production in the jet we consider particles detected in the scan along the z axis and moving away from the water jet with a downward trajectory 180 θ 100 see fig 3 for orientation convention indeed as observed in the high speed imaging recordings see supplemental material particles are initially mostly emitted from the jet with a downward trajectory before being affected by the surrounding airflow since the radial distance from the jet free surface was approximately 1 75 mm for these measurements and assuming linear trajectories the origin on the jet of each particle s trajectory z o was computed as follows 2 z o z 1 75 tan θ z being the sampling location where the particle was detected and θ the angle computed with the convention shown in fig 3 since the maximum z value sampled was 80 mm the lowest origin of particles highest z o value that can be retraced reliably for all trajectory directions is at z o 70 mm limit case for θ 100 droplets produced at z o between 70 and 80 mm with trajectories close to the vertical limit depending on the z o value would be found at positions lower than the measurement domain boundary 1 75 mm away from the interface fig 3a thus droplets from our data traced back to z o 70 80 mm would represent only part of the particles emitted at that interface position and the study is limited to z o 0 70 mm even though the measurements along the z axis have a high resolution taken every 2 mm they are still taken at discrete locations a simplified approach is implemented to fill the missing data between the sampling points the acquired data is taken over the z dimension of the illuminated volume d z measurement distance shown in red in 3b the unsampled distance between the sampling points distance in black in 3b δ z d z is divided by d z to get n v the number of measurement volumes needed to fill the gap fig 3 3 n v δ z d z d z the data taken at each sampling point is therefore counted n v more times except at the last sampling point to provide an estimate of the true number of droplets that would be detected if the spatial locations were spanned continuously instead of measuring at discrete locations once the droplet generation rate is obtained it is multiplied by the ratio of the jet perimeter to that of the pda measurement volume thickness d x to account for the droplet production at the jet periphery rotational symmetry 2 2 2 end fate of the droplets as previously mentioned the bounds of the sampled domain are limited by measurement time constraints to better assess the transmission risk linked to the dispersion pattern of the droplets beyond the spatial boundaries considered in the pda measurements we implement an in house code based on the physical model presented in xie et al 2007 the equations employed model the evaporation and movement of the emitted droplets and incorporate relative humidity air temperature and water temperature the mass balance heat balance and momentum

trajectories of the droplets are computed in still air v g 0 for further details refer to xie et al 2007 eqs 4 6 are discretized with the forward euler method with a timestep of 1 0 4 s the conditions of the simulation were chosen to mimic the standard indoor environment health canada recommends maintaining a relative humidity in the buildings of approximately 30 in the winter and 50 during the summer healthcanada 2016 and a drinking water temperature less than 20 c healthcanada 2021 while the world health organization suggests an indoor temperature between 18 and 24 c although the higher limit is not resolved precisely w h o 2018 consequently the simulations were run at a droplet temperature of 15 c an air temperature of 20 c and two values of relative humidity 30 and 50 the in house code was validated by comparing results from the free falling droplets test case to corresponding results in xie et al 2007 the test case consists of pure water droplets at a temperature of 33 c falling from a position at rest in dry air r h 0 at a temperature of 18 c simulations were stopped when the droplets reach a diameter of 1 μ m the evolution of the diameter of the droplets modeled with time and the variation of the falling velocity with the droplet diameters are in good agreement with the results presented in xie et al 2007 as shown in fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 high speed imaging high speed imaging was used to understand the spatial trajectory tendencies observed with the pda measurements shown in the following section the jet and its surroundings were filmed at 4 locations covering z 0 25 mm z 25 55 mm z 55 85 mm and z 85 105 mm the particle tracking algorithm is used to extract trajectories from the acquired images the results are shown in fig 5 yellow markers represent points of the particles trajectories where they are moving downward and away from the jet 180 θ 90 red markers correspond to particles moving downstream toward the interface 90 θ 0 and green markers correspond to particles moving upstream towards the aerator 0 θ 90 it can be observed in fig 5a that droplets emitted early from the jet yellow markers near the aerator are decelerated and then aspirated towards the aerator green markers indeed the aerator pulls air to mix it with water thus entraining these particles upwards this behavior is observed in the region corresponding to 0 z 18 mm for higher z values the airflow is no longer strong enough to carry the particles to the aerator yet still influences the particles trajectories by decelerating them and changing the track characteristic of droplets emitted from bubbles bursting as can be seen in the high speed videos shown in the supplemental material the latter particles mostly move with a slope angle 180 θ 90 once decelerated the particles are drawn towards the jet reversing the sign of the y component of their velocities red markers the decelerating effect of the airflow near the aerator can still be seen on the trajectories of particles at z 55 85 mm in fig 5b trajectories with yellow and red markers when the decelerated particles are far from the jet they move in a near vertical gravity dominated trajectory on the other hand when the particles are close enough to the jet and far enough from the aerator z 40 mm they appear to be caught in a boundary layer accelerated by the water stream the thickness of the boundary layer is approximately 2 5 mm derived from the videos the presence of the boundary layer is more visible in fig 5 c d where the two groups of particles described are identified in addition the videos show qualitatively that the emission of droplets from the jet decreases when moving downwards the latter observation along with the fact that the particles gradually reach a near vertical motion starting from z 40 mm suggests a size distribution that varies minimally with further movement downstream therefore explaining the asymptotic size distribution and θ scatter plots reached in the scan along the z axis figs 12 13 presented subsequently it should be noted that several particles are seen in the videos to have high inertia they maintain their trajectory from emission and escape the camera frame as discussed in the introduction pathogens can spread within droplets when the water is contaminated and the resulting particles can either deposit on surfaces and equipment near the sink or evaporate and remain suspended in the air long enough to be inhaled the droplets end fate depends on their emission size and velocity among other factors the trajectories observed in the high speed images taken near the faucet exhibit several distinct patterns suggesting different potential contamination routes while particles that are aspirated by the aerator or drawn by the boundary layer of the jet are not likely to be dispersed far away from the vicinity of the sink this is not the case for particles moving in a decelerated near vertical motion 100 θ 80 nor those with inertia high enough to preserve an inclined trajectory with 180 θ 100 in the former case the particles can deposit at the bottom of the sink or get dispersed by ambient currents if they dry to droplet nuclei similarly particles of high inertia either dry depending on the ambient conditions and become airborne or deposit on surfaces within or around the sink however they may deposit further from the sink basin than particles with a near vertical trajectory due to the inclined path they follow thus creating a risk of pathogen transmission through indirect contact fomites as explained earlier not all particles can be visualized with the settings used in high speed imaging experiments consequently to further quantify the data observed in the high speed camera videos and gain insight into the process of droplet emission from the jet a thorough mapping of the particles size and velocity was conducted with the pda and is presented in the following sections 3 2 spatial mapping in the longitudinal plane a coarse scan in the y z plane is performed to obtain information on the global number and sizes of particles emitted by the jet the sampled positions were in the range y 2 5 10 5 mm and z 0 60 mm in this section the particle size distribution the variation of particle counts and the mean particle diameter at the different spatial positions will be presented as a broad view of the particles spread in space 3 2 1 particle size distribution the size distributions of the particles as a function of position relative to the aerated jet are shown in fig 6 the ordinate of the histograms represents the fraction of particles that fall within each size range the color represents the number of particles detected per cubic meter of air at each position particles up to a diameter of 150 μ m are detected generally with a bell shaped size distribution which becomes broader when moving downstream at each radial position also the mode of the size distribution increases when z increases at a fixed radial distance from the jet 32 μ m at y 2 5 mm and 73 μ m at z 10 mm and y 2 5 mm z 60 mm this can have two potential explanations the first one consists of a broader distribution of bursting bubbles at the interface when moving downstream from the jet with a higher fraction of bubbles with a larger diameter the second explanation is that smaller particles are detected as a larger fraction of the total population near the aerator lower z values where they are aspirated naturally this fraction decreases when moving downstream finally the total number of particles varied from 0 0411 particles m 3 at y 8 5 mm z 0 to 2 0129 1 0 11 particles m 3 at y 6 5 mm z 10 mm the lowest concentration of particles is found at z 0 highlighting the low background concentration in the laboratory air and the scarcity of particles reaching a height higher than the aerator s tip the number of particles per second detected in the measurement volume 0 0742 μ m 3 at each position and the corresponding mean diameter and mass are shown in fig 7 while the concentration of particles is relevant when assessing the number of particles that may enter the airways when inhaling the number of particles detected at a position per second mirrors the hydrodynamic aspect of the problem the particle count is the highest in the lower vicinity of the aerator 10 765 particles s at y 2 5 mm z 20 mm it reaches a minimum of 0 022 particles s at y 8 5 mm at the same level as the aerator the highest number of particles is detected within the region y 8 5 mm 10 z 40 mm as for the mean diameter it increases with both radial and longitudinal distance from the aerator and reaches a maximum of 72 6 μ m at the lower left extremity of the domain measured y 10 5 mm z 60 mm indeed the largest droplets are less prone to entrainment by the airflow near the aerator or within the boundary layer near the water stream and can maintain their original downwards trajectory departing from the jet over a longer distance finally the mass of the particles detected per second is the highest within the triangular region near the jet delimited by the extremities y 8 5 mm z 60 mm and y 0 z 20 mm its maximum value is 0 9377 μ g s corresponding to the mass flux passing through the measurement volume at y 0 z 40 mm it is worth noting that at the domain boundary the largest aerosol mass is within the lower region z 20 mm thus unless adverse upwards air currents exist the highest potential pathogen load is associated with particles deposited on the sink basin or surrounding surfaces and particles that remain suspended beneath the aerator 3 2 2 droplet trajectories the modulus and orientation of the velocity vector of the particles are shown as a function of the different droplets diameters in fig 8 these parameters describe the trajectories of particles at several locations from the jet the slope angles of the particles trajectories are computed relative to the y axis and follow the convention shown in fig 3 in each plot 90 0 and 90 slope angles are marked by black horizontal lines while 180 and 180 angles are at the bounds of the y axis at points located at the same height of the aerator tip z 0 very few particles are found highlighting again that particles reaching the region above the aerator are scarce at y 2 5 mm z 10 mm two main particle clusters can be distinguished particles moving upwards toward the water jet and particles moving downward away from it a third cluster corresponding to particles moving downwards and toward the stream appears further downstream at a constant radial location the number of particles heading toward the aerator decreases at lower positions this is also true for particles heading downwards and away from the jet with a steep slope the two groups gradually merge into one group of particles with slope angles ranging from 180 to 90 starting from z 20 mm the more z increases the more the particles are found with a trajectory slope of approximately 90 referring to a vertical downward trajectory this tendency holds at different radial locations no clear correlation can be seen between the slope of the particle s path and its size however it can be seen qualitatively that particles with a diameter larger than a threshold value almost only move downwards and away from the jet at each sampling location this threshold value varies between approximately 60 and 110 μ m and increases with increasing z at a constant y furthermore when moving downwards and away from the jet smaller particles move closer to a near vertical path in contrast only particles of a diameter smaller than a threshold value are drawn towards the aerator the latter threshold varies between 45 and 50 μ m since particles emitted from the jet move downwards and away from it as previously seen in the high speed videos the previous observations can be explained by the following particles of different sizes are emitted by the bubbles bursting at the interface of the jet the smallest particles can be drawn to the aerator diameter smaller than 45 μ m when moving further downstream or in other terms moving further away from the point of emission of droplets produced near the aerator the trajectory of larger droplets is affected to a different extent depending on their size by the airflow near the aerator and in the boundary layer near the water jet this results in the merging of the different clusters observed only the largest particles diameter bigger than 110 μ m preserve their trajectory for most sampled positions additionally the velocity modulus of the droplets was computed from the two components v y and v z and is represented by the color scale in fig 8 thus it represents the velocity in the y z plane although it does not provide the precise three dimensional velocity modulus value it preserves the overall velocity tendencies since the velocity component in the direction perpendicular to the y z plane is assumed to be negligible for particles detected in the y z plane again no clear trend can be seen between the particles diameters and their velocities exclusively however it can be seen that particles moving downwards and away from the jet and consequently particles that are emitted from the jet and not yet affected by the airflow have the highest velocity that can reach values up to 3 8 m s another observation is that for constant y when z increases the smallest particles of the previously described group are gradually decelerated for instance smaller than 25 μ m at y 0 z 30 mm or 50 μ m at y 0 z 50 mm and their number decreases this means that some of the droplets described are hindered by the airflow and change trajectories this behavior confirms the observations of the near vertical trajectories of the smaller particles appearing with higher z values detailed in the previous paragraph and seen in the high speed videos based on the different types of trajectories droplets may have five categories of particles can be defined the first category consists of droplets moving downwards and away from the jet 180 θ 100 the second class englobes particles moving downwards toward the water jet 80 θ 0 the third one includes particles moving upwards toward the aerator 0 θ 90 the fourth category comprises particles with a near vertical trajectory 100 θ 80 and the fifth moves upwards and away from the jet 90 θ 180 according to fig 9a particles moving downwards and toward the jet have the highest count fraction between 45 to 50 for particles moving downwards and away from the jet the count fraction varied between 34 to 36 particles moving in a near vertical trajectory have a count fraction of 9 and 10 at y 2 5 and 4 5 mm respectively the latter fraction increases with a further increase of radial distance from the jet reaching 18 at y 10 5 mm this variation reflects the decreasing influence the airflow in the boundary layer near the jet or near the aerator has on the particles motion with increasing radial distance as expected figs 5 and 8 the fraction of particles aspirated by the aerator induced airflow is highest at the nearest radial position from the jet and is almost null at y 10 5 mm finally particles moving upwards and away from the jet are practically nonexistent category 1 downward and away from the jet has the highest mass fraction which varied between 46 and 51 at y 10 5 mm 34 58 μ g s of particles of category 1 are detected and thus escape the immediate vicinity of the jet the mass fraction of category 2 downward and toward the jet fluctuated between 32 and 35 this permutation of fraction order is due to particles affected by the aerator induced airflow being smaller than particles retaining their original motion deviating from the stream leading to a lower mass fraction despite the higher count category 4 near vertical trajectory has a mass fraction between 15 and 20 finally the mass fraction of category 3 upward toward the aerator is 1 6 at y 2 5 mm and reaches 0 at y 6 5 mm and is considerably smaller than its count fraction since only the smallest particles are aspirated toward the aerator thus the highest mass of the droplets may surpass the sink boundaries and either deposit on the surrounding surfaces or become airborne 3 2 3 end fate of the droplets to better assess the risk associated with the aerosol studied the model presented in section 2 2 2 is employed to simulate the end fate of the droplets detected at y 10 5 mm at two relative humidity values 30 and 50 the results are shown in fig 10 we simulate the trajectory and diameter variation of 6 particle sizes 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 μ m we subsample among category 1 droplets since they are the most likely to escape the vicinity of the jet and reach the furthest distances we assume that the sink counter is at 20 cm from the lower tip of the aerator the simulations are stopped when the droplet diameter reaches a value of 1 μ m where it is assumed to become airborne if the droplet reaches the height of the sink countertop before becoming airborne it either deposits on the counter outside the sink or is contained within the sink basin hence knowing the particle deposition radius at the sink countertop level is needed to determine the droplets that are contained within the sink and the droplets that deposit outside the sink and their deposition location fig 10 a c shows that droplets with a diameter smaller than 55 μ m become airborne before reaching the level of the counter within 25 mm of the jet at a relative humidity of 30 while particles smaller than 50 μ m become airborne at 50 rh thus a lower relative humidity slightly increases the droplet diameter threshold at emission below which particles become airborne larger droplets deposit on the sink counter or are contained in the sink basin within 70 mm of the water jet in general in both cases the larger the droplet the larger the deposition radius fig 10 b d the latter observation means that if the water is contaminated the largest pathogenic load is the farthest from the faucet assuming a uniform distribution in the different droplets the effect of relative humidity on the deposition site of the larger particles is minimal finally since the larger particles deposit within 7 cm from the faucet the sink basin should be placed such as the distance between all of its edges and the faucet outlet perimeter is larger than 7 cm the effect of the faucet height on the fate of the droplets can be seen in fig 11 the black lines represent sink counters located 10 20 30 and 40 cm below the aerator it can be seen that for lower sink counters larger droplets have time to evaporate before impact and can therefore become airborne the upper threshold diameter varies between 45 μ m at r h 30 40 μ m at r h 50 for a faucet height of 10 cm from the sink counter and 60 μ m for a faucet height of 40 cm hence as expected reducing the faucet heights decreases the number of airborne particles but also their size which reduces the pathogen load that remains in the suspended droplets decreasing airborne transmission the ultimate risk of infection depends not only on the aerosol characteristics reported here but also on the inhalation of sufficient numbers of viable pathogens the survival of pathogens in aerosol depends on ambient temperature relative humidity the content of the droplets exposure to atmospheric pollutants and ultraviolet light tang 2009 hence the latter effects should be included in estimating infection risks for different settings in practice the dependence of a specific pathogen on the described factors may not be fully known and certain assumptions are used in qmra models hamilton et al 2018 3 3 longitudinal profile along the jet interface a high resolution scan along the z axis was done 1 75 mm from the interface corresponding to the distance between the jet interface and the edge of the aerator and to y 0 with a spatial step of 2 mm ranging from z 0 to z 80 mm and resulting in 21 measurement points thus this scan was done closer to the interface with a higher resolution and a larger z bound compared to the data shown previously to estimate the number and the generation location of the droplets produced by bursting bubbles 3 3 1 droplet size distribution the size distribution at the different z positions is shown in fig 12 and the layout is identical to that in fig 6 similar to what was described earlier in the planar scan the size distribution is initially unimodal however it shifts to a bimodal one at approximately z 36 mm not shown in fig 12 and reaches asymptotically a monotonically decreasing distribution indicating a higher percentage of the smallest particles at lower positions which can be explained by a similar change in the size distribution of the bubbles at the interface of the jet the particle concentration varied from 5 6 1 0 6 particles m 3 at z 0 to 3 6 1 0 9 particles m 3 at z 20 mm the maximum value is 2 orders lower than that in the planar scan due to the higher induced air flow rates closer to the jet even though the number of particles detected was higher reaching values up to 42 particles s 3 3 2 droplet trajectories the velocity vector modulus and orientation in the y z plane are shown in fig 13 at y 1 75 mm the same particle clusters as in fig 8 are observed although still low in number more droplets moving upwards and away from the jet are detected category 5 down to z 40 mm particles with a velocity higher than 0 5 m s a value typical of droplets entrained by the induced airflows and moving upward and away from the jet are scarce this observation can be explained by the fact that droplets initially ejected upwards are quickly decelerated by both gravity and the aerator induced airflow and then mostly sucked into the aerator hence these droplets were not observed in the planar scan in which sampled points were located further from the interface these droplets are neglected due to their low number and limited detection region droplets larger than a threshold value ranging from 42 μ m at z 12 to 83 μ m at z 60 mm are almost exclusively moving downwards and away from the jet on the other hand only droplets with a diameter smaller than a value starting at 33 μ m at z 2 increasing up to 40 μ m at z 14 and then decreasing to 36 μ m at z 36 mm are drawn towards the aerator the same tendencies are observed for the velocity angle with the increase of z with a more pronounced agglomeration of the angles around θ 90 this behavior seems to be reached asymptotically as it does not vary considerably starting from z 48 mm and up to z 80 mm as for the velocity modulus while it decreased when z increased in the y z scan for smaller particles emitted downwards and away from the jet this is not seen in the current z scan indeed the modulus attained values near 3 m s at z 80 mm the difference between the two scans is the distance to the jet s interface closer to the emission point of the droplets therefore the trajectory of the droplets is closer to that at emission and the deceleration effect is less pronounced 3 3 3 droplets produced from bursting bubbles all particles with a slope angle 180 θ 100 are traced back to their origin in the water jet as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the counts cumulative mass and diameters of particles that originated at z 70 mm are shown in fig 14 overall the number of droplets produced per unit length of the jet decreases downstream from the aerator after passing through a local maximum the increase in the droplet generation rate can result from the fact that the longer a bubble resides at the interface the more probable its bursting is for droplets to be generated further downstream in the jet bubbles situated away from the free surface must first move towards it this displacement happens due to small velocity gradients within the jet or bubble bubble interactions this leads with the decrease of the number of remaining bubbles to a slower particle generation frequency the calculations reveal that 3517 05 μ g s of droplets are emitted overall in addition 50 of the total mass of the droplets is emitted at z 26 mm and 75 before z 39 mm thus a high fraction of the particles produced is emitted close to the aerator and the use of a 50 mm long cylindrical shield would mitigate a significant fraction of the droplets the mean diameter of the droplets produced at z 1 5 mm has a value of 20 3 μ m increases to a maximum of 35 4 μ m at z 27 5 mm and decreases back to 18 5 μ m at z 69 5 mm this trend can be explained by first recalling that bubbles of a higher diameter produce bigger droplets deike et al 2018 additionally bubbles are displaced either by velocity gradients present in the jet or by bubble bubble interactions while smaller bubbles are more easily moved towards the interface by the velocity gradients than large bubbles the latter can meet the interface due to a smaller displacement and are more susceptible to bubble bubble interactions these competing tendencies lead to the observed increase in the diameter of droplets ejected when for z 10 since the number of bubbles is still relatively high and bubble bubble interactions are dominant however when the number of bubbles decreases further downstream in the jet velocity gradients become the dominant bubble displacement mechanism leading to smaller ejected droplets 3 4 limitations this study elucidates how complementary experimental and numerical methods can be used to provide a complete description of the aerosol produced in a given setting however several limitations persist the first limitation ensues from the fundamental droplet production itself the size and velocity of film and jet droplets ejected from bursting bubbles depend on the water properties on the one hand such as density viscosity and surface tension which are affected by the water content and on the bubble size on the other hand blanco rodriguez and gordillo 2020 deike et al 2018 poulain et al 2018 poulain and bourouiba 2018 first the dependence of the aerosol size distribution and dispersal pattern on water properties was not studied and the water content was unknown in addition the dependence of the size distribution and velocity of the droplets on the size distribution of the bubbles in the aerated jet remains unexplored the latter dependencies cannot be determined through the current study since the airflow aspirated by the aerator and the resulting bubble size distribution as well as the water microbial content were unknown thus experiments in a more controlled environment where the bubble size and water content can be varied are needed and are the subject of the authors future works the findings can guide the design of aerators that maintain the feel of aerated jets while minimizing droplet production and reducing the number of the largest droplets that are more susceptible to carrying a higher pathogenic load and the number of the smallest ones that may become airborne the second limitation stems from the fact that only one aerator model is used and the end fate of the droplets is derived in still air hence more studies should highlight the end fate of the droplets for different aerator models resulting in an aerated jet for different ventilation settings water contents temperatures and ambient conditions consequently adequate guidelines concerning ventilation and disinfection can be devised particularly in critical areas such as hospital rooms with patients whose immunity is compromised 4 conclusion the size distribution trajectories and dispersal pattern of the droplets generated from an aerated water jet is examined revealing four main particle groups can be identified depending on their trajectories from the jet interface moving into the aerator 9 at y 2 5 mm decelerated by the airflow towards the water the jet 45 at y 2 5 mm decelerated by drag and reaching a near vertical free fall motion 10 at y 2 5 mm and finally particles with sufficient inertia to maintain a ballistic trajectory 36 at y 2 5 mm droplets with diameters reaching 150 μ m are detected particles with a diameter smaller than 55 μ m become airborne while larger droplets deposit within 7 cm from the jet a lower faucet outlet decreases the number and pathogen load of airborne droplets the largest droplets are ejected on average at z 27 5 mm below the aerator with the generation rate decreasing downstream of the jet 75 of the total mass of the ejected droplets are emitted within 39 mm of the aerator hence adding a cylindrical shield near the aerator could prevent the dissemination of a large mass of droplets these findings form the first pillar in the assessment of the pathogen transmission risk associated with faucet aerator aerosol declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the authors would like to thank yves fontaine julie

15234,papermaking industry discharges large quantities of wastewater and waste gas whose treatment is limited by extra chemicals requirements insufficient resource recovery and high energy consumption herein a chemical self sufficiency zero liquid discharge zld system which integrates nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis and membrane contactor nf bmed mc is designed for the resource recovery from wastewater and waste gas the key features of this system include 1 recovery of nacl from pretreated papermaking wastewater by nf 2 hcl naoh generation and fresh water recovery by bmed and 3 co2 capture and naoh na2co3 generation by mc this integrated system shows great synergy by precipitating hardness ions in papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate with naoh na2co3 the inorganic scaling on nf membrane is mitigated moreover the nf bmed mc system with high stability can simultaneously achieve efficient co2 removal and sustainable recovery of fresh water and high purity resources nacl na2so4 naoh and hcl from wastewater and waste gas without introducing any extra chemicals the environmental evaluation indicates the carbon neutral papermaking wastewater reclamation can be achieved through the application of nf bmed mc system this study establishes the promising of nf bmed mc as a sustainable alternative to current membrane methods for zld of papermaking industry discharges treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords papermaking wastewater nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis co2 capture zero liquid discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades it has become increasingly clear that water security is one of the main challenges of our time boo et al 2020 the water shortage will be increasingly problematic in the future when having to deal with prolonged periods of drought meanwhile large amounts of wastewaters are produced by industries it has been gradually realized that industrial wastewaters should be regarded as an emerging untraditional water resource for generating high standard product water instead of a simple waste traditional zero liquid discharge zld has been applied to the complete abatement of liquid discharges tong and elimelech 2016 however the previous zld approaches rarely focus on the recovery of valuable ionic resources from wastewater and waste gas in a sustainable treatment system shin et al 2022 moreover the extra chemical requirement is the critical challenge for traditional zld approaches zhao et al 2020 the papermaking wastewater consisting of about 13 0 of total industrial wastewater discharge in china causes a serious threat to the environment qiu et al 2021 yao et al 2019 generally every one ton of paper production 50 100 tons of fresh water are consumed and the produced wastewater can contain more than 200 different types of chemicals niu et al 2020a conventional biochemical treatment and reverse osmosis ro are commonly applied to treat papermaking wastewater however there are still high concentrated salts e g nacl and na2so4 and hard biodegraded organics e g lignin and its derivatives served as secondary pollutants traditional physical and chemical methods e g coagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation are often applied to treat papermaking wastewater but limited by the extra chemicals addition feng et al 2020 moreover large amount of greenhouse gases such as co2 is released during paper manufacturing process which does not comply with the carbon neutral strategies huovila et al 2022 man et al 2000 consequently innovative technologies need to be put forward for achieving synergistic resource recovery water reclamation and carbon neutrality from papermaking wastewater recently membrane technologies show potential in wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency in separation and resource recovery long et al 2022 werber et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 among various membrane technologies nanofiltration nf emerges as a promising technology because of its high permeate flux low energy consumption and excellent salts separation performances lin et al 2021 xu et al 2022 the nf membrane achieves a high rejection rate for multivalent ions and large molecules via synergistic electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion lu and elimelech 2021 thus nf can be used to recover monovalent salt e g nacl while rejecting multivalent salt e g na2so4 and organics in the saline papermaking wastewater however severe membrane fouling caused by inorganic scaling e g ca2 and mg2 results in the reduction of permeate flux to avoid it the acid and base are added externally for nf feed pretreatment such as naoh na2co3 addition is reported to be an effective method to prevent the membrane scaling caused by hardness ions luo et al 2022 bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed system may be a good alternative to provide the acid and base this system allows to generate acid and base from salts such as naoh and hcl generated from nacl ferrari et al 2022 li et al 2021 moreover the released co2 can be thermodynamically absorbed by the naoh solution to generate naoh na2co3 by the membrane contactor mc in the mc system the naoh solution and co2 can be applied as liquid phase and gas phases flow on different sides of the hydrophobic porous membrane respectively this way decreases the carbon emission and is beneficial for nf fouling mitigation chemicals generation for the first time a nf bmed mc integrated system is designed for papermaking wastewater treatment to realize ionic resource recovery fresh water production and carbon emission reduction three key parts are essential for this process 1 the nf membrane can recover nacl and reject other ions and organics in pretreated papermaking wastewater 2 the bmed generates acid base used for the nf process and produces fresh water 3 the mc captures co2 and generates naoh na2co3 to examine the feasibility of the nf bmed mc system membrane type and water recovery rate are assessed in nf experiments two stages of bmed with high volume ratio are used to achieve acid base conversion with high concentration the acid is used as cleaning agent to recover nf membrane fouling and the base is used to absorb co2 by mc system to gain a comprehensive understanding of co2 absorption by naoh from bmed the parameters such as gas flow rate liquid flow rate and naoh concentration are optimized the generated naoh and na2co3 from co2 dissolution and reaction are applied to precipitate ca2 and mg2 during the pretreatment of papermaking wastewater in addition an economic analysis and waste discharge analysis of the proposed nf bmed mc system are made to further evaluate its sustainability this research will provide guidance for the ionic resource recovery from papermaking industry in the triangle industry resource environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the papermaking wastewater of industrial ro brine was collected from papermaking industry in nan tong china the water compositions are shown in table s1 all reagents are of analytical grade and deionized water is used in all experiments co2 gas with 99 9 was purchased from the vista technology co ltd tianjin china two commercial mixed aromatic trimesoyl chloride piperazine nf membranes nf270 and fortilife xcn dow filmtec usa were used in this study the membranes used in bmed experiments were cation exchange membrane cmx astom co japan anion exchange membrane amx astom co japan and bipolar membrane bp 1e astom co japan the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hollow fiber membrane xinhui membrane co china was used for co2 absorption the main properties of the mentioned membranes are listed in tables s2 4 2 2 nf bmed mc system 2 2 1 pretreatment process for softening papermaking wastewater scaling will occur on the bmed membrane surface if the hardness and the ph of raw wastewater are not properly controlled hence pretreatment of the papermaking wastewater is needed to reduce the divalent cations i e mg2 and ca2 prior to the bmed process commonly oh and co3 2 are used to precipitate mg2 and ca2 respectively due to the low solubilities of mg oh 2 and caco3 as formed through reactions m g 2 2 o h mg oh 2 and c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 chen et al 2021 therefore the naoh and na2co3 generated from mc were used to lower the hardness of the papermaking wastewater the chemical precipitation denoted as cp fig 1 to achieve the higher acid base concentration during the subsequent bmed process the ph of the softened wastewater was adjusted to 7 8 by adding hcl solution 2 2 2 nf for salt fractionation the pretreated papermaking wastewater was fed into nf for monovalent salts recovery two types of nf membranes xcn and nf270 were used to separate the ions the effective membrane area of the two membranes was 2 6 m2 the experiments were carried out in batch mode at 25 c with feed flow rate of 0 9 m3 h 1 the feed wastewater was circulated in the feed tank with operating pressure of 1 0 mpa while the permeate was collected in the permeate tank the experiments were stopped when the water recovery rate reached 80 after the experiments a 0 3 wt hcl solution from bmed was used to clean the nf membrane the nf permeate was further fed into bmed module for the acid base conversion the details of nf related calculations are shown in text s1 duong et al 2016 gnder et al 2020 oddo and tomson 1994 2 2 3 acid and base generation and fresh water recovery the nf permeate was fed into bmed feed tank the bmed stack with five repeating units consisted of feed base acid and electrolyte 3 wt na2so4 compartments the effective size of each membrane was 9 cm 21 cm the voltage drop used was 10 v the two stage bmed was operated to promote the h oh concentration in the first stage bmed the uf permeate deionized water and deionized water were fed to the feed compartment acid compartment and base compartment respectively before the experiment in the second stage bmed the solution in feed compartment was replaced by the uf permeate while the acid and base solutions remained from the first stage bmed in each stage the volume ratio between feed acid and base compartment in first stage was identical to second stage two kinds of volume ratio vf va vb 10 1 1 and 15 1 1 were investigated the bmed experiments were stopped when the feed solution conductivity decreased to 1 ms cm 1 the details of bmed related calculations are shown in text s1 2 2 4 mc for co2 capture the mc system was applied to capture co2 for the generation of naoh and na2co3 to simulate the gas in papermaking industry the gaseous mixture containing 20 vol co2 and 80 vol n2 was used as feed gas flowing through the hollow fiber membrane contactor shell side using a mass flow controller the naoh solution from bmed stack was flowed through the membrane lumen using a peristaltic pump response surface method rsm was applied to design the experiments and box behnken design bbd was used to determine the optimal parameters i e gas flow rate l min 1 liquid flow rate l min 1 and naoh concentration mol l 1 to perform

nf 3 1 1 effect of chemical pretreatment two kinds of nf membranes were selected to assess the separation performance after the pretreatment of cp chemicals naoh and na2co3 from mc system in general the xcn membrane showed lower normalized flux than the nf270 membrane regardless of chemical pretreatment fig 2 a without chemical pretreatment the fluxes for xcn and nf270 membrane were lower and the flux for xcn membrane presented lower values compared to that for nf270 membrane mickols et al 2021 after pretreatment the permeate fluxes were significantly increased for both membranes the improved fluxes of the nf membrane indicated that pretreatment by introducing naoh and na2co3 can effectively precipitate hardness ions in the uf feed thereby alleviating membrane scaling fig 2b c showed the xcn membrane with higher rejections to divalent ions 97 6 ca2 98 4 mg2 and 95 2 so4 2 compared with that for nf270 96 7 ca2 97 8 mg2 and 91 9 so4 2 the higher rejection for xcn membrane to bivalent anion so4 2 was related to the higher electrostatic repulsion while the higher rejection to bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 may be related to the size exclusion zhang et al 2017 the xrd analysis showed that the obtained salt from nf permeate was nacl fig s1 the selectivity of the nf membranes showed that the xcn had a lower value of sanion than that of nf270 it can be inferred that divalent so4 2 can be highly concentrated in the concentrate stream by xcn membrane due to the high rejection of ca2 the caso4 scaling easily formed under the condition of super saturation fortunately in comparison with chemical precipitation in pretreatment the feed stream of cp xcn had lower concentrations of ca2 3 9 mg l 1 and mg2 1 7 mg l 1 which could avoid the caso4 scaling formation on the membrane surface different types of organics in nf feed concentrate and permeate were further studied by using the 3d eem fig 2d f according to the division of eem fluorescence regions the representative substances in regions i and ii were aromatic proteins the substances in in regions iii iv and v were related to fulvic acids microbial metabolites and humic acids respectively wen et al 2003 in original papermaking wastewater the fluorescence peak was observed due to humic acid like substances fig 2d wen et al 2003 for nf concentrate two fluorescence peaks roughly at emission wavelength excitation wavelength ex em 330 nm 435 nm peak a was humic acid like substances and ex em 240 nm 410 nm peak b was fulvic acid like substances were found some recalcitrant organic compounds existed in papermaking wastewater such as degradation products of lignin derivatives carbohydrates and proteins shared similar spectroscopic characteristics with humic substances feng et al 2020 yao et al 2019 peak b was not obvious which may be due to the pollutant concentration being too low to reach the detection limit guo et al 2021 after filtration most types of organics were effectively removed as absence of fluorescence response this indicated that the nf can effectively reject organic matters which was further confirmed by the low cod concentrations in cp nf270 11 2 mg l 1 and cp xcn effluent 8 1 mg l 1 fig 2g meanwhile the emergence of organics in the permeate stream could be ascribed to the concentration polarization occurred at high recovery rate which resulted in the transport of organics through the membrane the membrane resistance was analyzed between nf with and without pretreatment fig 2h the contribution to the reversible resistance rr was determined as 38 6 and 40 1 for xcn and nf270 membranes respectively in single nf process the irreversible resistance rir had the lowest contribution 17 20 for both membranes the rr originated from the loosely attached organic adsorption and inorganic crystal deposition on the membrane surface which could be cleaned by hydraulic or shear forces on the other hand the rir derived from the strongly attached pollutants on membrane surface by gel and biofilm formation as well as in the membrane pore by pore blocking after cp pretreatment the contribution to the rr significantly reduced for both membranes due to the alleviation of inorganic scaling occurred on the membrane surface although cp pretreatment mitigated the reversible membrane fouling successfully the contribution of rir was in the range of 15 21 which indicated the irreversible accumulation of organics in the membrane surface pore cannot be avoided due to the higher rejection of xcn for organics and so4 2 the cp xcn was selected as the optimal operation mode in the following experiments 3 1 2 effect of recovery rate increase of recovery rate had marginal impact on the membrane separation capability observed in this study in general nf exhibited high rejection performance for both organics and inorganics as shown in fig 3 a the rejection efficiencies of multivalent ions were maintained at high level throughout the experiment ca2 99 7 97 2 mg2 99 4 98 6 and so4 2 97 1 96 3 as recovery rate gradually increased from 50 to 80 the increasing recovery rate indicated that the feed water became more concentrated which led to more ions being transported from the bulk solution to the membrane surface in fig 3b a slight increase of the ph in the concentrate stream 7 9 8 1 was observed as the recovery rate increased whereas a decrease of the ph in the permeate stream 7 6 7 3 was also observed which might be explained by the co ions competition due to the isoelectric point of nf membrane was lower than 7 the membrane was negatively charged in the wastewater compared with other cations h ions were much easier to pass through the membrane leading to a higher h concentration and a lower ph in permeate than in feed luo and wan 2013 lower solution ph would decrease the crystallization of inorganic salts this together with the enhanced effect of concentration polarization would escalate scaling on the membrane surface similar to the inorganic salt removal process the removal of organic matters was mainly achieved by nf in fig 3c the cod rejection decreased from 96 0 to 88 1 as the recovery rate increased from 50 to 80 as the feed stream concentrated with increasing recovery rate the higher concentration difference between permeate stream and concentrate stream would lead to the increasing cod in the permeate stream in fig 3d the purity of nacl showed a downward trend with increasing recovery rate on the contrary the purity of na2so4 showed an upward trend with increasing recovery rate which was due to the transport of cl to the permeate stream the na2so4 yield was in the range of 93 5 99 3 while the nacl yield was in the range of 44 3 74 3 with increasing recovery rate moreover the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the nf permeate were lower than 0 1 mg l 1 the total hardness of the softened nf concentrate was lower than 10 mg l 1 which was low enough to meet the operating requirements of bmed du et al 2021 overall to achieve a higher water recovery rate and nacl yield the optimal nf recovery rate was selected at 80 3 1 3 nf membrane fouling analysis the resistance distributions of xcn and cp xcn process were analyzed to determine the membrane fouling behavior with increasing recovery rate in fig 4 a the contribution to the reversible resistance of rr increased from 20 1 to as 38 6 for xcn simultaneously the ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in nf retenate stream increased with increasing recovery rate the growth efficiency and nucleation rate of caso4 crystallization would be enhanced with increasing recovery rate moreover the continuous increasing of organics in the retenate stream also caused serious resistance to the nf membrane after cp pretreatment the rr decreased from 38 6 xcn to 17 46 cp xcn fig 4b the rir increased from 8 9 to 15 5 for cp xcn membranes which was due to the accumulation of organics on the membrane surface sem images enabled a visualized observation on the morphology of membrane fouling layers 80 recovery rate pristine thin film composite polyamide xcn membrane showed a typical surface morphology with a smooth structure fig 4c however noticeable fouling was observed on fouled xcn membranes fig 4d while little crystal was observed after the cp xcn treatment fig 4e for virgin xcn membrane eds analysis observed carbon oxygen and nitrogen peaks for pristine membrane which were the main components of mixed aromatic trimesoyl chloride piperazine membrane active layer for xcn membrane eds analysis showed increased intensity of calcium oxygen and sulfur peaks the emerged calcium peak characterized the scaling of caso4 crystals the emergence of caso4 crystals could be explained by surface heterogeneous crystallization crystals grew on the membrane surface and crystals deposition crystals formed in the concentrate stream and then deposited on the membrane surface song et al 2020 in the present study the breakstone like crystals observed on the membrane surface were due to the deposition of bulk formed crystals rather than heterogeneous crystallization since no well ordered crystal clusters were observed for cp xcn membrane it should be noticed that no obvious calcium peak was observed at recovery rate of 80 fig 4e indicating there was no caso4 crystals on the membrane surface due to the organics in papermaking wastewater contained lignin derivatives and fulvic acid the sulfur peak could still be observed on the cp xcn membrane the is of caso4 is shown in fig s2 it can be seen that if high total recovery rate occurred with high flux the is still lower than 0 for cp xcn treatment this suggested that the cp pretreatment was feasible for decreasing the risk of inorganic scaling while increasing water recovery rates the surface morphology of different membranes was characterized by atomic force microscopy the virgin xcn membrane has a low roughness value 2 38 nm compared with the fouled membranes 30 90 nm fig 4f g this was due to the adhesion of inorganic salts and organics on the xcn membrane surface after cp pretreatment the membrane surface became smooth and the roughness value was reduced to 22 42 nm fig 4h this was because cp pretreatment avoided the formation of caso4 on the membrane surface and the main change of roughness was due to the adsorption of organics atr ftir spectra were analyzed for virgin and fouled membranes to better understand the fouling characteristics fig 4i the virgin membrane showed a broad peak at 3353 cm 1 that was n h and o h stretching vibration in the polyamide layer geluwe et al 2011 the small peaks at 2967 cm 1 and 2933 cm 1 were caused by stretching vibrations of aliphatic c h bonds in ch3 and ch2 although the band at 1630 cm 1 resulted from piperazine peaks there was no peak at 1630 cm 1 for xcn membrane possible reason for this situation might be that infrared beam was not able to penetrate the thin active skin layer with a thickness of 15 40 nm simon et al 2013 the bands at 1503 cm 1 1487 cm 1 and 1409 cm 1 were assigned to the benzene c c deformation in the aromatic ring efligenir et al 2015 the peak at 1241 cm 1 was attributed to asymmetric stretching vibration of the aryl o aryl group for polysulfone layer the peak at 1013 cm 1 was caused by aliphatic c c and aromatic hydrogen bending gnder et al 2020 the peak at 692 cm 1 was associated with aromatic c c bonds by comparing ftir spectra of virgin and fouled membranes the peak intensity of fouled membrane at 3353 cm 1 decreased which was due to the attenuation of hydrogen bonds in the polyamide layer caused by the foulants efligenir et al 2015 3 2 acid and base generation and fresh water recovery by bmed bmed was applied to further convert acid base from nf permeate the current in bmed showed an initial increase followed by a decrease fig 5 a initially the acid and base compartments were filled with deionized water and the conductivity was low hence the relatively high solution resistance was the most important factor in the resistance of the membrane stack subsequently the current of the membrane stack presented an increasing trend after the continuous dissociation of water the continuous migration of na and cl caused its concentration to decrease in feed compartment therefore the conductivity of the solution in the feed compartment gradually decreased fig 5b finally the solution resistance was the main influence again with lower current at the latter stage of the experiment for the wastewater with higher volume ratio the current increased with the increasing volume ratio this was due to the higher amount of salts in the feed solution resulting in a lower stack resistance in fig 5c the generated h oh concentration was proportional to the volume ratio a higher feed solution volume led to a higher amount of salt ions migrating through feed compartment thereby higher h oh concentration in acid base compartment for the second stage bmed the h oh concentration approached 1 5 mol l 1 however there was a limit to the h oh concentration with different volume ratio treatment which was due to the confine of back diffusion and solution volume variation due to the high concentration of acid base in acid base compartment at the end of experiment the increasing concentration gradient between acid base compartment and feed compartment will cause back diffusion of h oh from acid base solution to feed solution song et al 2021 in fig 5d the solution volume variation of acid base compartment increased from 170 187 to 230 240 as volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the first stage bmed the water migration from feed compartment to acid base compartment could be explained by electro osmosis and osmosis phenomenon galama et al 2014 porada et al 2018 on the one hand the electrochemical potential difference promoted electro osmotic water migration due to hydrated ions migration during the bmed operation thus the water migration for the second stage bmed was higher than that for the first stage bmed on the other hand the water osmotically migrated from feed compartment to acid base compartment due to concentration osmotic pressure gradients in the latter stage of experiment in fig 5e when the volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the energy consumption slightly increased from 3 2 kw h m 3 to 6 3 kw h m 3 for the first stage bmed the increase in energy consumption was associated with the higher amount of ions migration in the feed compartment the current efficiency decreased from 57 2 to 55 3 when volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the diminishing current efficiency at the higher volume ratio was attributed to co ions transport and back diffusion of ions for the second stage bmed the current efficiency also presented a slight decrease compared to the first stage bmed overall the naoh concentration for volume ratio of 15 1 1 with two stages bemd approached 1 5 mol l 1 which could be used to absorb co2 in the mc system 3 3 co2 capture and cp chemicals generation by mc in mc system results showed that the highest co2 removal rate of 89 6 was achieved at gas flow rate of 0 2 l min 1 liquid flow rate of 100 ml min 1 and naoh concentration of 1 5 mol l 1 the multiple regression models were used to link the co2 removal rate to parameters in fig s3a the analysis of variance anova for the co2 removal is given in table s6 cojocaru and clima 2020 niu et al 2020b the multiple regression models were used to link the co2 removal rate to parameters eq s11 from rsm analysis the increasing gas flow rate reduced the contact time between gas and the absorbent in the membrane contactor which led to a lower co2 removal rate fig s3b the increasing liquid velocity positively affected the performance of the membrane system and simultaneously enhanced the co2 removal rate jalil et al 2018 from figs s3c d the co2 removal rate of the mc system increased with increasing naoh concentration more details see text s2 cojocaru and clima 2020 jalil et al 2018 niu et al 2020b the solution after co2 absorption can be directly used in the pretreatment process for softening papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate in which co2 transformed to be na2co3 through the reaction with naoh the solution contained naoh and na2co3 and their mass ratio can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time according to the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in feed wastewater and nf concentrate the theoretical mass ratio of naoh and na2co3 m naoh na2co3 was 0 093 1 and 0 069 1 in mc system the mass ratio of naoh na2co3 in naoh solution can be regulated to be lower than 1 after 70 min fig s3e hence the generated naoh and na2co3 mixtures with controllable amount can be applied to precipitate ca2 and mg2 in feed wastewater and nf concentrate 3 4 zld performance is maintained in repeated cycles the overall performance of the membrane system nf bmed mc for produced water treatment is displayed in fig 6 in view of the excessive ca2 and mg2 in the nf influent that may form scaling on the selective layer a cp pretreatment step was added at the nf feed to remove ca2 and mg2 the residual ca2 and mg2 in the influent of nf was kept constantly below 4 mg l 1 which can protect the nf from the attack of scaling the rejection rate was stabilized 96 so4 2 and 7 cl in the testing period indicating that the nf can successfully separate nacl from mixed salts wastewater the purity of the final nacl and na2so4 was characterized by a third party with the purity of 98 5 and 91 2 respectively the bmed stability experiments with three cycles indicated the base and acid concentration were both higher than 1 5 mol l 1 fig s4a the salt removal rate maintained higher than 96 with the effluent conductivity lower than 1 ms cm 1 which showed great potential in fresh water reuse fig s4b moreover the energy consumption was in the range of 10 4 10 6 kwh m 3 for three cycles fig s4c after the experiments sem images indicated no visible scaling deposits were observed on the surfaces of both the cem and bipolar membrane figs s4d g this demonstrated that the bmed process for acid base production was suitable for long term application for mc system the membrane performance degradation caused by fouling and pore swelling may occur during long term experiments xu et al 2019 hence the long term experiment for 30 days was conducted to investigate the membrane stability results indicated the naoh from bmed can be fed as absorbent for continuously capturing co2 with removal rate higher than 85 while the residual naoh na2co3 solution can be used as cp chemicals the long term experiment showed no liquid droplets were detected in the outlet of the gas phase indicating that no liquid molecules were penetrated through the membrane pores and no membrane wetting was observed figs s5a b the water contact angle slightly decreased from 126 9 to 118 8 after the long term experiment which showed strong hydrophobic property of the ptfe membrane fig s5c 3 5 economic and environmental evaluation of nf bmed mc system economic analysis for nf bmed mc system was important for practical application thus the overall recovery cost for nf bmed mc system was calculated using calculating model liang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the specific energy requirements in nf bmed and mc were 2 6 10 9 and 2 5 kw h m 3 respectively fig s6a the water recovery was 80 0 for nf 81 1 for bmed and the total water recovery was approximately 64 9 fig s6b the specific energy cost of the whole system would be 1 68 m 3 considering the investment cost the cost incurred for treating 1 m3 papermaking wastewater by nf bmed mc process was calculated to be approximately 5 18 table s7 in industrial application the total cost will be significantly reduced as energy cost and investment cost decreases with increasing processing capacity if considering the benefits of avoiding softening agent e g na2co3 addition the recovered water and salts as well as the minimization of solid waste disposal the treatment cost can be further reduced in comparison with conventional membrane processes table s8 compared the separation performance of different membrane based technologies for various wastewater treatments chu et al 2022 nghiema et al 2015 loganathan et al 2015 lv et al 2022 ma et al 2022 mcginnis et al 2013 qiu et al 2022 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 these technologies were mainly combined or multi stages systems for the treatment of industrial wastewater the integrated systems were highly efficient in the removal of inorganic salts and organic foulants while achieving fresh water recovery from the wastewater however extra chemicals e g coagulants flocculants precipitants and anti scalants were required which introduced extra costs and caused damage to the system in addition to economic evaluation the environmental evaluation is also indispensable to assess the feasibility of the whole process in terms of co2 emission and capture in order to evaluate the co2 capture co2 emissions and the total co2 avoided excluding the associated emissions from the energy consumption for producing 1 kg of naoh by nf bmed mc were calculated ye et al 2015 according to the co2 emissions from different sources of electricity table s9 the co2 emissions produced via different electricity generators were calculated in fig 7 a pereira and posen 2020 among all the alternative energy resources the renewable energy resources including wind hydroelectric biomass and solar produce the lowest co2 emissions fig 7b shows the total co2 avoided by nf bmed mc system by using wind hydroelectric and nuclear resources the amount of co2 avoided was positive which meant the amount of co2 captured was more than co2 emission in our system proving that the system was environmentally friendly however the amount of co2 avoided was in big negative value by using other non renewable resources such as natural gas for 6145 5 g co2 per kg naoh in order to facilitate the production of naoh from wastewater for co2 capture the use of electricity generated from renewable or clean energies was strongly recommended more renewable resources like wind and hydroelectric should be encouraged to avoid excess generation of co2 4 conclusions resource recovery from industrial waste in a zero liquid discharge zld system is crucial for the sustainable development of society in this study we designed a self sufficiency and closed loop nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis and membrane contactor nf bmed mc system for the sustainable recovery of ionic resource from papermaking wastewater and waste gas recovery of nacl and na2so4 from pretreated papermaking wastewater hcl naoh generation and fresh water recovery co2 capture and naoh na2co3 generation were successfully accomplished by the nf bmed mc system the nf bmed mc system achieved self sufficiency of chemicals e g naoh and na2co3 to remove hardness ions from papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate thus avoiding the nf membrane fouling more importantly the valuable ionic resources such as nacl na2so4 naoh and hcl could be effectively recovered from wastewater economic analysis showed the overall recovery cost for the nf bmed mc system was approximately 5 18 m 3 which showed great potential to be cost competitive for papermaking wastewater and waste gas recovery environmental assessment indicated that the zero carbon emission aim of nf bmed mc system could be considered by employing renewable energy resources such as wind hydroelectric biomass and solar in the future in this way a green and low carbon zld system may bring a revolution in wastewater and waste gas

15234,papermaking industry discharges large quantities of wastewater and waste gas whose treatment is limited by extra chemicals requirements insufficient resource recovery and high energy consumption herein a chemical self sufficiency zero liquid discharge zld system which integrates nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis and membrane contactor nf bmed mc is designed for the resource recovery from wastewater and waste gas the key features of this system include 1 recovery of nacl from pretreated papermaking wastewater by nf 2 hcl naoh generation and fresh water recovery by bmed and 3 co2 capture and naoh na2co3 generation by mc this integrated system shows great synergy by precipitating hardness ions in papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate with naoh na2co3 the inorganic scaling on nf membrane is mitigated moreover the nf bmed mc system with high stability can simultaneously achieve efficient co2 removal and sustainable recovery of fresh water and high purity resources nacl na2so4 naoh and hcl from wastewater and waste gas without introducing any extra chemicals the environmental evaluation indicates the carbon neutral papermaking wastewater reclamation can be achieved through the application of nf bmed mc system this study establishes the promising of nf bmed mc as a sustainable alternative to current membrane methods for zld of papermaking industry discharges treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords papermaking wastewater nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis co2 capture zero liquid discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades it has become increasingly clear that water security is one of the main challenges of our time boo et al 2020 the water shortage will be increasingly problematic in the future when having to deal with prolonged periods of drought meanwhile large amounts of wastewaters are produced by industries it has been gradually realized that industrial wastewaters should be regarded as an emerging untraditional water resource for generating high standard product water instead of a simple waste traditional zero liquid discharge zld has been applied to the complete abatement of liquid discharges tong and elimelech 2016 however the previous zld approaches rarely focus on the recovery of valuable ionic resources from wastewater and waste gas in a sustainable treatment system shin et al 2022 moreover the extra chemical requirement is the critical challenge for traditional zld approaches zhao et al 2020 the papermaking wastewater consisting of about 13 0 of total industrial wastewater discharge in china causes a serious threat to the environment qiu et al 2021 yao et al 2019 generally every one ton of paper production 50 100 tons of fresh water are consumed and the produced wastewater can contain more than 200 different types of chemicals niu et al 2020a conventional biochemical treatment and reverse osmosis ro are commonly applied to treat papermaking wastewater however there are still high concentrated salts e g nacl and na2so4 and hard biodegraded organics e g lignin and its derivatives served as secondary pollutants traditional physical and chemical methods e g coagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation are often applied to treat papermaking wastewater but limited by the extra chemicals addition feng et al 2020 moreover large amount of greenhouse gases such as co2 is released during paper manufacturing process which does not comply with the carbon neutral strategies huovila et al 2022 man et al 2000 consequently innovative technologies need to be put forward for achieving synergistic resource recovery water reclamation and carbon neutrality from papermaking wastewater recently membrane technologies show potential in wastewater treatment due to their high efficiency in separation and resource recovery long et al 2022 werber et al 2016 zhao et al 2022 among various membrane technologies nanofiltration nf emerges as a promising technology because of its high permeate flux low energy consumption and excellent salts separation performances lin et al 2021 xu et al 2022 the nf membrane achieves a high rejection rate for multivalent ions and large molecules via synergistic electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion lu and elimelech 2021 thus nf can be used to recover monovalent salt e g nacl while rejecting multivalent salt e g na2so4 and organics in the saline papermaking wastewater however severe membrane fouling caused by inorganic scaling e g ca2 and mg2 results in the reduction of permeate flux to avoid it the acid and base are added externally for nf feed pretreatment such as naoh na2co3 addition is reported to be an effective method to prevent the membrane scaling caused by hardness ions luo et al 2022 bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed system may be a good alternative to provide the acid and base this system allows to generate acid and base from salts such as naoh and hcl generated from nacl ferrari et al 2022 li et al 2021 moreover the released co2 can be thermodynamically absorbed by the naoh solution to generate naoh na2co3 by the membrane contactor mc in the mc system the naoh solution and co2 can be applied as liquid phase and gas phases flow on different sides of the hydrophobic porous membrane respectively this way decreases the carbon emission and is beneficial for nf fouling mitigation chemicals generation for the first time a nf bmed mc integrated system is designed for papermaking wastewater treatment to realize ionic resource recovery fresh water production and carbon emission reduction three key parts are essential for this process 1 the nf membrane can recover nacl and reject other ions and organics in pretreated papermaking wastewater 2 the bmed generates acid base used for the nf process and produces fresh water 3 the mc captures co2 and generates naoh na2co3 to examine the feasibility of the nf bmed mc system membrane type and water recovery rate are assessed in nf experiments two stages of bmed with high volume ratio are used to achieve acid base conversion with high concentration the acid is used as cleaning agent to recover nf membrane fouling and the base is used to absorb co2 by mc system to gain a comprehensive understanding of co2 absorption by naoh from bmed the parameters such as gas flow rate liquid flow rate and naoh concentration are optimized the generated naoh and na2co3 from co2 dissolution and reaction are applied to precipitate ca2 and mg2 during the pretreatment of papermaking wastewater in addition an economic analysis and waste discharge analysis of the proposed nf bmed mc system are made to further evaluate its sustainability this research will provide guidance for the ionic resource recovery from papermaking industry in the triangle industry resource environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the papermaking wastewater of industrial ro brine was collected from papermaking industry in nan tong china the water compositions are shown in table s1 all reagents are of analytical grade and deionized water is used in all experiments co2 gas with 99 9 was purchased from the vista technology co ltd tianjin china two commercial mixed aromatic trimesoyl chloride piperazine nf membranes nf270 and fortilife xcn dow filmtec usa were used in this study the membranes used in bmed experiments were cation exchange membrane cmx astom co japan anion exchange membrane amx astom co japan and bipolar membrane bp 1e astom co japan the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hollow fiber membrane xinhui membrane co china was used for co2 absorption the main properties of the mentioned membranes are listed in tables s2 4 2 2 nf bmed mc system 2 2 1 pretreatment process for softening papermaking wastewater scaling will occur on the bmed membrane surface if the hardness and the ph of raw wastewater are not properly controlled hence pretreatment of the papermaking wastewater is needed to reduce the divalent cations i e mg2 and ca2 prior to the bmed process commonly oh and co3 2 are used to precipitate mg2 and ca2 respectively due to the low solubilities of mg oh 2 and caco3 as formed through reactions m g 2 2 o h mg oh 2 and c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 chen et al 2021 therefore the naoh and na2co3 generated from mc were used to lower the hardness of the papermaking wastewater the chemical precipitation denoted as cp fig 1 to achieve the higher acid base concentration during the subsequent bmed process the ph of the softened wastewater was adjusted to 7 8 by adding hcl solution 2 2 2 nf for salt fractionation the pretreated papermaking wastewater was fed into nf for monovalent salts recovery two types of nf membranes xcn and nf270 were used to separate the ions the effective membrane area of the two membranes was 2 6 m2 the experiments were carried out in batch mode at 25 c with feed flow rate of 0 9 m3 h 1 the feed wastewater was circulated in the feed tank with operating pressure of 1 0 mpa while the permeate was collected in the permeate tank the experiments were stopped when the water recovery rate reached 80

nf 3 1 1 effect of chemical pretreatment two kinds of nf membranes were selected to assess the separation performance after the pretreatment of cp chemicals naoh and na2co3 from mc system in general the xcn membrane showed lower normalized flux than the nf270 membrane regardless of chemical pretreatment fig 2 a without chemical pretreatment the fluxes for xcn and nf270 membrane were lower and the flux for xcn membrane presented lower values compared to that for nf270 membrane mickols et al 2021 after pretreatment the permeate fluxes were significantly increased for both membranes the improved fluxes of the nf membrane indicated that pretreatment by introducing naoh and na2co3 can effectively precipitate hardness ions in the uf feed thereby alleviating membrane scaling fig 2b c showed the xcn membrane with higher rejections to divalent ions 97 6 ca2 98 4 mg2 and 95 2 so4 2 compared with that for nf270 96 7 ca2 97 8 mg2 and 91 9 so4 2 the higher rejection for xcn membrane to bivalent anion so4 2 was related to the higher electrostatic repulsion while the higher rejection to bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 may be related to the size exclusion zhang et al 2017 the xrd analysis showed that the obtained salt from nf permeate was nacl fig s1 the selectivity of the nf membranes showed that the xcn had a lower value of sanion than that of nf270 it can be inferred that divalent so4 2 can be highly concentrated in the concentrate stream by xcn membrane due to the high rejection of ca2 the caso4 scaling easily formed under the condition of super saturation fortunately in comparison with chemical precipitation in pretreatment the feed stream of cp xcn had lower concentrations of ca2 3 9 mg l 1 and mg2 1 7 mg l 1 which could avoid the caso4 scaling formation on the membrane surface different types of organics in nf feed concentrate and permeate were further studied by using the 3d eem fig 2d f according to the division of eem fluorescence regions the representative substances in regions i and ii were aromatic proteins the substances in in regions iii iv and v were related to fulvic acids microbial metabolites and humic acids respectively wen et al 2003 in original papermaking wastewater the fluorescence peak was observed due to humic acid like substances fig 2d wen et al 2003 for nf concentrate two fluorescence peaks roughly at emission wavelength excitation wavelength ex em 330 nm 435 nm peak a was humic acid like substances and ex em 240 nm 410 nm peak b was fulvic acid like substances were found some recalcitrant organic compounds existed in papermaking wastewater such as degradation products of lignin derivatives carbohydrates and proteins shared similar spectroscopic characteristics with humic substances feng et al 2020 yao et al 2019 peak b was not obvious which may be due to the pollutant concentration being too low to reach the detection limit guo et al 2021 after filtration most types of organics were effectively removed as absence of fluorescence response this indicated that the nf can effectively reject organic matters which was further confirmed by the low cod concentrations in cp nf270 11 2 mg l 1 and cp xcn effluent 8 1 mg l 1 fig 2g meanwhile the emergence of organics in the permeate stream could be ascribed to the concentration polarization occurred at high recovery rate which resulted in the transport of organics through the membrane the membrane resistance was analyzed between nf with and without pretreatment fig 2h the contribution to the reversible resistance rr was determined as 38 6 and 40 1 for xcn and nf270 membranes respectively in single nf process the irreversible resistance rir had the lowest contribution 17 20 for both membranes the rr originated from the loosely attached organic adsorption and inorganic crystal deposition on the membrane surface which could be cleaned by hydraulic or shear forces on the other hand the rir derived from the strongly attached pollutants on membrane surface by gel and biofilm formation as well as in the membrane pore by pore blocking after cp pretreatment the contribution to the rr significantly reduced for both membranes due to the alleviation of inorganic scaling occurred on the membrane surface although cp pretreatment mitigated the reversible membrane fouling successfully the contribution of rir was in the range of 15 21 which indicated the irreversible accumulation of organics in the membrane surface pore cannot be avoided due to the higher rejection of xcn for organics and so4 2 the cp xcn was selected as the optimal operation mode in the following experiments 3 1 2 effect of recovery rate increase of recovery rate had marginal impact on the membrane separation capability observed in this study in general nf exhibited high rejection performance for both organics and inorganics as shown in fig 3 a the rejection efficiencies of multivalent ions were maintained at high level throughout the experiment ca2 99 7 97 2 mg2 99 4 98 6 and so4 2 97 1 96 3 as recovery rate gradually increased from 50 to 80 the increasing recovery rate indicated that the feed water became more concentrated which led to more ions being transported from the bulk solution to the membrane surface in fig 3b a slight increase of the ph in the concentrate stream 7 9 8 1 was observed as the recovery rate increased whereas a decrease of the ph in the permeate stream 7 6 7 3 was also observed which might be explained by the co ions competition due to the isoelectric point of nf membrane was lower than 7 the membrane was negatively charged in the wastewater compared with other cations h ions were much easier to pass through the membrane leading to a higher h concentration and a lower ph in permeate than in feed luo and wan 2013 lower solution ph would decrease the crystallization of inorganic salts this together with the enhanced effect of concentration polarization would escalate scaling on the membrane surface similar to the inorganic salt removal process the removal of organic matters was mainly achieved by nf in fig 3c the cod rejection decreased from 96 0 to 88 1 as the recovery rate increased from 50 to 80 as the feed stream concentrated with increasing recovery rate the higher concentration difference between permeate stream and concentrate stream would lead to the increasing cod in the permeate stream in fig 3d the purity of nacl showed a downward trend with increasing recovery rate on the contrary the purity of na2so4 showed an upward trend with increasing recovery rate which was due to the transport of cl to the permeate stream the na2so4 yield was in the range of 93 5 99 3 while the nacl yield was in the range of 44 3 74 3 with increasing recovery rate moreover the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the nf permeate were lower than 0 1 mg l 1 the total hardness of the softened nf concentrate was lower than 10 mg l 1 which was low enough to meet the operating requirements of bmed du et al 2021 overall to achieve a higher water recovery rate and nacl yield the optimal nf recovery rate was selected at 80 3 1 3 nf membrane fouling analysis the resistance distributions of xcn and cp xcn process were analyzed to determine the membrane fouling behavior with increasing recovery rate in fig 4 a the contribution to the reversible resistance of rr increased from 20 1 to as 38 6 for xcn simultaneously the ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in nf retenate stream increased with increasing recovery rate the growth efficiency and nucleation rate of caso4 crystallization would be enhanced with increasing recovery rate moreover the continuous increasing of organics in the retenate stream also caused serious resistance to the nf membrane after cp pretreatment the rr decreased from 38 6 xcn to 17 46 cp xcn fig 4b the rir increased from 8 9 to 15 5 for cp xcn membranes which was due to the accumulation of organics on the membrane surface sem images enabled a visualized observation on the morphology of membrane fouling layers 80 recovery rate pristine thin film composite polyamide xcn membrane showed a typical surface morphology with a smooth structure fig 4c however noticeable fouling was observed on fouled xcn membranes fig 4d while little crystal was observed after the cp xcn treatment fig 4e for virgin xcn membrane eds analysis observed carbon oxygen and nitrogen peaks for pristine membrane which were the main components of mixed aromatic trimesoyl chloride piperazine membrane active layer for xcn membrane eds analysis showed increased intensity of calcium oxygen and sulfur peaks the emerged calcium peak characterized the scaling of caso4 crystals the emergence of caso4 crystals could be explained by surface heterogeneous crystallization crystals grew on the membrane surface and crystals deposition crystals formed in the concentrate stream and then deposited on the membrane surface song et al 2020 in the present study the breakstone like crystals observed on the membrane surface were due to the deposition of bulk formed crystals rather than heterogeneous crystallization since no well ordered crystal clusters were observed for cp xcn membrane it should be noticed that no obvious calcium peak was observed at recovery rate of 80 fig 4e indicating there was no caso4 crystals on the membrane surface due to the organics in papermaking wastewater contained lignin derivatives and fulvic acid the sulfur peak could still be observed on the cp xcn membrane the is of caso4 is shown in fig s2 it can be seen that if high total recovery rate occurred with high flux the is still lower than 0 for cp xcn treatment this suggested that the cp pretreatment was feasible for decreasing the risk of inorganic scaling while increasing water recovery rates the surface morphology of different membranes was characterized by atomic force microscopy the virgin xcn membrane has a low roughness value 2 38 nm compared with the fouled membranes 30 90 nm fig 4f g this was due to the adhesion of inorganic salts and organics on the xcn membrane surface after cp pretreatment the membrane surface became smooth and the roughness value was reduced to 22 42 nm fig 4h this was because cp pretreatment avoided the formation of caso4 on the membrane surface and the main change of roughness was due to the adsorption of organics atr ftir spectra were analyzed for virgin and fouled membranes to better understand the fouling characteristics fig 4i the virgin membrane showed a broad peak at 3353 cm 1 that was n h and o h stretching vibration in the polyamide layer geluwe et al 2011 the small peaks at 2967 cm 1 and 2933 cm 1 were caused by stretching vibrations of aliphatic c h bonds in ch3 and ch2 although the band at 1630 cm 1 resulted from piperazine peaks there was no peak at 1630 cm 1 for xcn membrane possible reason for this situation might be that infrared beam was not able to penetrate the thin active skin layer with a thickness of 15 40 nm simon et al 2013 the bands at 1503 cm 1 1487 cm 1 and 1409 cm 1 were assigned to the benzene c c deformation in the aromatic ring efligenir et al 2015 the peak at 1241 cm 1 was attributed to asymmetric stretching vibration of the aryl o aryl group for polysulfone layer the peak at 1013 cm 1 was caused by aliphatic c c and aromatic hydrogen bending gnder et al 2020 the peak at 692 cm 1 was associated with aromatic c c bonds by comparing ftir spectra of virgin and fouled membranes the peak intensity of fouled membrane at 3353 cm 1 decreased which was due to the attenuation of hydrogen bonds in the polyamide layer caused by the foulants efligenir et al 2015 3 2 acid and base generation and fresh water recovery by bmed bmed was applied to further convert acid base from nf permeate the current in bmed showed an initial increase followed by a decrease fig 5 a initially the acid and base compartments were filled with deionized water and the conductivity was low hence the relatively high solution resistance was the most important factor in the resistance of the membrane stack subsequently the current of the membrane stack presented an increasing trend after the continuous dissociation of water the continuous migration of na and cl caused its concentration to decrease in feed compartment therefore the conductivity of the solution in the feed compartment gradually decreased fig 5b finally the solution resistance was the main influence again with lower current at the latter stage of the experiment for the wastewater with higher volume ratio the current increased with the increasing volume ratio this was due to the higher amount of salts in the feed solution resulting in a lower stack resistance in fig 5c the generated h oh concentration was proportional to the volume ratio a higher feed solution volume led to a higher amount of salt ions migrating through feed compartment thereby higher h oh concentration in acid base compartment for the second stage bmed the h oh concentration approached 1 5 mol l 1 however there was a limit to the h oh concentration with different volume ratio treatment which was due to the confine of back diffusion and solution volume variation due to the high concentration of acid base in acid base compartment at the end of experiment the increasing concentration gradient between acid base compartment and feed compartment will cause back diffusion of h oh from acid base solution to feed solution song et al 2021 in fig 5d the solution volume variation of acid base compartment increased from 170 187 to 230 240 as volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the first stage bmed the water migration from feed compartment to acid base compartment could be explained by electro osmosis and osmosis phenomenon galama et al 2014 porada et al 2018 on the one hand the electrochemical potential difference promoted electro osmotic water migration due to hydrated ions migration during the bmed operation thus the water migration for the second stage bmed was higher than that for the first stage bmed on the other hand the water osmotically migrated from feed compartment to acid base compartment due to concentration osmotic pressure gradients in the latter stage of experiment in fig 5e when the volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the energy consumption slightly increased from 3 2 kw h m 3 to 6 3 kw h m 3 for the first stage bmed the increase in energy consumption was associated with the higher amount of ions migration in the feed compartment the current efficiency decreased from 57 2 to 55 3 when volume ratio increased from 10 1 1 to 15 1 1 the diminishing current efficiency at the higher volume ratio was attributed to co ions transport and back diffusion of ions for the second stage bmed the current efficiency also presented a slight decrease compared to the first stage bmed overall the naoh concentration for volume ratio of 15 1 1 with two stages bemd approached 1 5 mol l 1 which could be used to absorb co2 in the mc system 3 3 co2 capture and cp chemicals generation by mc in mc system results showed that the highest co2 removal rate of 89 6 was achieved at gas flow rate of 0 2 l min 1 liquid flow rate of 100 ml min 1 and naoh concentration of 1 5 mol l 1 the multiple regression models were used to link the co2 removal rate to parameters in fig s3a the analysis of variance anova for the co2 removal is given in table s6 cojocaru and clima 2020 niu et al 2020b the multiple regression models were used to link the co2 removal rate to parameters eq s11 from rsm analysis the increasing gas flow rate reduced the contact time between gas and the absorbent in the membrane contactor which led to a lower co2 removal rate fig s3b the increasing liquid velocity positively affected the performance of the membrane system and simultaneously enhanced the co2 removal rate jalil et al 2018 from figs s3c d the co2 removal rate of the mc system increased with increasing naoh concentration more details see text s2 cojocaru and clima 2020 jalil et al 2018 niu et al 2020b the solution after co2 absorption can be directly used in the pretreatment process for softening papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate in which co2 transformed to be na2co3 through the reaction with naoh the solution contained naoh and na2co3 and their mass ratio can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time according to the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in feed wastewater and nf concentrate the theoretical mass ratio of naoh and na2co3 m naoh na2co3 was 0 093 1 and 0 069 1 in mc system the mass ratio of naoh na2co3 in naoh solution can be regulated to be lower than 1 after 70 min fig s3e hence the generated naoh and na2co3 mixtures with controllable amount can be applied to precipitate ca2 and mg2 in feed wastewater and nf concentrate 3 4 zld performance is maintained in repeated cycles the overall performance of the membrane system nf bmed mc for produced water treatment is displayed in fig 6 in view of the excessive ca2 and mg2 in the nf influent that may form scaling on the selective layer a cp pretreatment step was added at the nf feed to remove ca2 and mg2 the residual ca2 and mg2 in the influent of nf was kept constantly below 4 mg l 1 which can protect the nf from the attack of scaling the rejection rate was stabilized 96 so4 2 and 7 cl in the testing period indicating that the nf can successfully separate nacl from mixed salts wastewater the purity of the final nacl and na2so4 was characterized by a third party with the purity of 98 5 and 91 2 respectively the bmed stability experiments with three cycles indicated the base and acid concentration were both higher than 1 5 mol l 1 fig s4a the salt removal rate maintained higher than 96 with the effluent conductivity lower than 1 ms cm 1 which showed great potential in fresh water reuse fig s4b moreover the energy consumption was in the range of 10 4 10 6 kwh m 3 for three cycles fig s4c after the experiments sem images indicated no visible scaling deposits were observed on the surfaces of both the cem and bipolar membrane figs s4d g this demonstrated that the bmed process for acid base production was suitable for long term application for mc system the membrane performance degradation caused by fouling and pore swelling may occur during long term experiments xu et al 2019 hence the long term experiment for 30 days was conducted to investigate the membrane stability results indicated the naoh from bmed can be fed as absorbent for continuously capturing co2 with removal rate higher than 85 while the residual naoh na2co3 solution can be used as cp chemicals the long term experiment showed no liquid droplets were detected in the outlet of the gas phase indicating that no liquid molecules were penetrated through the membrane pores and no membrane wetting was observed figs s5a b the water contact angle slightly decreased from 126 9 to 118 8 after the long term experiment which showed strong hydrophobic property of the ptfe membrane fig s5c 3 5 economic and environmental evaluation of nf bmed mc system economic analysis for nf bmed mc system was important for practical application thus the overall recovery cost for nf bmed mc system was calculated using calculating model liang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the specific energy requirements in nf bmed and mc were 2 6 10 9 and 2 5 kw h m 3 respectively fig s6a the water recovery was 80 0 for nf 81 1 for bmed and the total water recovery was approximately 64 9 fig s6b the specific energy cost of the whole system would be 1 68 m 3 considering the investment cost the cost incurred for treating 1 m3 papermaking wastewater by nf bmed mc process was calculated to be approximately 5 18 table s7 in industrial application the total cost will be significantly reduced as energy cost and investment cost decreases with increasing processing capacity if considering the benefits of avoiding softening agent e g na2co3 addition the recovered water and salts as well as the minimization of solid waste disposal the treatment cost can be further reduced in comparison with conventional membrane processes table s8 compared the separation performance of different membrane based technologies for various wastewater treatments chu et al 2022 nghiema et al 2015 loganathan et al 2015 lv et al 2022 ma et al 2022 mcginnis et al 2013 qiu et al 2022 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 these technologies were mainly combined or multi stages systems for the treatment of industrial wastewater the integrated systems were highly efficient in the removal of inorganic salts and organic foulants while achieving fresh water recovery from the wastewater however extra chemicals e g coagulants flocculants precipitants and anti scalants were required which introduced extra costs and caused damage to the system in addition to economic evaluation the environmental evaluation is also indispensable to assess the feasibility of the whole process in terms of co2 emission and capture in order to evaluate the co2 capture co2 emissions and the total co2 avoided excluding the associated emissions from the energy consumption for producing 1 kg of naoh by nf bmed mc were calculated ye et al 2015 according to the co2 emissions from different sources of electricity table s9 the co2 emissions produced via different electricity generators were calculated in fig 7 a pereira and posen 2020 among all the alternative energy resources the renewable energy resources including wind hydroelectric biomass and solar produce the lowest co2 emissions fig 7b shows the total co2 avoided by nf bmed mc system by using wind hydroelectric and nuclear resources the amount of co2 avoided was positive which meant the amount of co2 captured was more than co2 emission in our system proving that the system was environmentally friendly however the amount of co2 avoided was in big negative value by using other non renewable resources such as natural gas for 6145 5 g co2 per kg naoh in order to facilitate the production of naoh from wastewater for co2 capture the use of electricity generated from renewable or clean energies was strongly recommended more renewable resources like wind and hydroelectric should be encouraged to avoid excess generation of co2 4 conclusions resource recovery from industrial waste in a zero liquid discharge zld system is crucial for the sustainable development of society in this study we designed a self sufficiency and closed loop nanofiltration bipolar membrane electrodialysis and membrane contactor nf bmed mc system for the sustainable recovery of ionic resource from papermaking wastewater and waste gas recovery of nacl and na2so4 from pretreated papermaking wastewater hcl naoh generation and fresh water recovery co2 capture and naoh na2co3 generation were successfully accomplished by the nf bmed mc system the nf bmed mc system achieved self sufficiency of chemicals e g naoh and na2co3 to remove hardness ions from papermaking wastewater and nf concentrate thus avoiding the nf membrane fouling more importantly the valuable ionic resources such as nacl na2so4 naoh and hcl could be effectively recovered from wastewater economic analysis showed the overall recovery cost for the nf bmed mc system was approximately 5 18 m 3 which showed great potential to be cost competitive for papermaking wastewater and waste gas recovery environmental assessment indicated that the zero carbon emission aim of nf bmed mc system could be considered by employing renewable energy resources such as wind hydroelectric biomass and solar in the future in this way a green and low carbon zld system may bring a revolution in wastewater and waste gas
