16530,this article considers current trends in antimicrobial resistance amr research and knowledge gaps relevant to policymaking in the water sector specifically biological indicators of amr antibiotic resistant bacteria and their resistance genes and detection methods that have been used so far are identified and discussed as well as the problems with and solutions to the collection of amr data sewage surveillance lessons from the covid 19 pandemic and the financial burden caused by amr which could be synergically used to improve advocacy on amr issues in the water sector finally this article proposes solutions to overcoming existing hurdles and shortening the time it will take to have an impact on policymaking and regulation in the sector graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords amr surveillance microbial indicators precautionary approach regulation water sector 1 introduction antimicrobials and specifically antibiotics have become one of the main pillars of modern medicine saving millions of lives since they were first introduced in the 1940s antibiotics are essential in treating bacterial infections in both humans and animals but the emergence of antimicrobial resistance amr has limited their effectiveness nathan 2020 as a result governments industry and scientists are adamant the amr crisis is one of the most pressing global threats several initiatives are in place to deal with this mainly in clinical and environmental settings in clinical settings the focus has been on surveillance reducing the use of existing drugs establishing incentives for the discovery and production of new antibiotics implementing global guidelines and when possible local regulations in environmental settings the focus has predominantly been on research initiatives to monitor the presence and impact of antibiotics decreasing antimicrobial therapy in agriculture and livestock determining minimal acceptable thresholds for antibiotics in treated effluents and exploring the potential role of wastewater treatment to reduce antibiotics and amr determinants in treated water hong et al 2018 stanton et al 2020 murray et al 2021 however the ability to monitor how amr spreads from the environment to clinical settings is limited hofer 2019 due to the lack of a single or set of universal biological indicators that can establish the rate of amr spread in environmental settings and their potential risk to human health the only short term solution repeatedly recommended is the precautionary approach manaia 2017 in this article the precautionary principle has been expanded with the following objectives i exploring how amr surveillance has been implemented and data has been generated in both clinical and water environmental settings ii discussing how biological indicators related to amr have been used in pilot surveillance efforts and how data has been generated and shared iii reflecting on sewage surveillance lessons from the covid 19 pandemic and how this could help better manage amr in water and iv commenting on the financial burden of amr and how this could be used to drive change in policymaking the aim of this article is therefore to highlight current knowledge gaps anticipate future trends and suggest actionable insights to advance amr regulation in the water sector 2 amr in the water sector antimicrobial resistance is complex to define and quantify broadly speaking amr is an intrinsic or acquired ability of microorganisms to resist an antimicrobial in the latter case they can acquire resistance to antimicrobials by either genetic mutation or by accepting amr genes from other bacteria in fact amr genes are considered as environmental pollutants if anthropogenic disturbances increase their prevalence above the usually occurring background levels martinez 2009 moreover bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections and their ability to resist antibiotic treatment are under the spotlight in the amr crisis chandler 2019 amr extends not only to antibiotics but to a number of chemical classes including heavy metals and disinfectants biocides singer et al 2016 the accepted framework for dealing with amr is the one health approach fundamental to this is interdisciplinary collaboration and communication on health in the human animal and environmental sectors areas of action include monitoring targets known to decrease infectious risk such as improving sanitation providing access to clean water improving medical care tackling environmental pollution and managing the overuse of antimicrobials in both human healthcare and animal husbandry essack 2018 jovanovic et al 2021 as water bodies frequently receive treated and untreated wastewater effluents and anthropogenic pollution water is an ideal environment for the acquisition and spread of amr in fact this impact can be exacerbated in developing countries where the presence of wastewater treatment is limited or even absent pandit and kumar 2015 pandey et al 2021 consequently the one water approach has been suggested to complement the one health framework in order to monitor and manage amr in the water sector the one water approach proposes that drinking and wastewater are interconnected and need to be managed holistically both the one health and the one water frameworks guide us to holistically manage wicked problems such as global water supply climate change and the amr crisis while considering the environment and human and animal health shafer and fox 2016 hong et al 2018 moreover considering that the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs will be the point of reference for any strategy or policy towards a more sustainable future those goals relating to water and sanitation should be taken into account in formulating effective policies the sdgs include eight targets that address drinking water sanitation and hygiene services wastewater treatment water quality water use water management transboundary cooperation water related ecosystems official development assistance and participation of local communities who unicef 2021 3 surveillance as a tool for amr containment amr cannot be eradicated either in clinical or environmental settings the containment of amr however is possible jovanovic et al 2021 and to achieve this the world health organization who has highlighted that surveillance of amr is essential data acquired through surveillance can be used to monitor the development and spread of amr and also to measure the impact of strategies and interventions to mitigate it smith and coast 2002 although the consensus that resistance development rather than just transmission exists in environmental settings and is vital to amr containment this precautionary topic has been extremely difficult to advocate and gain the attention of policymakers wellcome trust 2020 in order to address this several amr databases and data collection initiatives have been revisited to better connect the resulting data thereby generating new insights and influencing policymaking 4 databases generated on amr surveillance the major surveillance programs targeting amr at global scale have placed emphasis on monitoring of clinically relevant pathogens such initiatives are listed below surveillance of amr emergence and spread in water environmental settings has been more consistently done in research at local level rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 majeed et al 2021 regional continental monitoring campaigns cacace et al 2019 pärnänen et al 2019 or selected countries at global scale hendriksen et al 2019a targeting particular antimicrobial resistance hotspots such as wastewater treatment plants lekunberri et al 2017 contaminated watersheds koczura et al 2016 soil agricultural land singer et al 2016 and seawater ecosystems blanco picazo et al 2020 moreover there is insufficient or no information from other countries or regions especially from low income and middle income countries where the amr surveillance in water is limited the global open access triple antimicrobial resistance database led by the who the food and agriculture administration fao and the world organisation for animal health oie provides access to information on the status of countries implementation of the global action plan and actions to address antimicrobial resistance across all sectors data collection here is based on a country self assessment questionnaire the global database for the tripartite antimicrobial resistance

reports for the continent the sweden based joint programming initiative on antimicrobial resistance jpiamr an international collaborative platform engaging 28 nations and the european commission to curb antimicrobial resistance amr has various funding and project consortium initiatives to fund amr research globally and has gathered a collection of multipurpose databases https www jpiamr eu the

prevent antibiotic resistance https parfoundation org the industry consultancy led amr insights https www amr insights eu and the star idaz international consortium on animal health https www star idaz net these various initiatives are encouraging however in order to fully extract and utilize the value and meaning of their data these databases need to be harmonized so that trends can be truly observed actions be taken and overarching environmental amr regulations implemented aarestrup and koopmans 2016 who 2015 recently it has been suggested that data technologies such as blockchain iot internet of things and others may help to achieve better management and use of amr data globally https www amr insights eu for that to occur however legal barriers impeding data sharing between countries and organizations will need to be tackled at governmental levels 5 how far advanced are biological indicators for amr in water for implementing impactful surveillance of amr in environmental settings a standard methodology should be selected as well as a set of relevant biological indicators to be able to establish an economically feasible and long term sustainable monitoring regime although standard culture based methods used to evaluate microbial safety of drinking water and wastewater have provided valuable information marano et al 2020 these methods have limited applicability in amr surveillance and are biased towards cultivable organisms amr is mostly related to microorganisms harbouring antibiotic resistance genes args for which the detection depends almost exclusively on molecular methods gao and sui 2020 cutting edge genomics e g microarray technology and metagenomics have been proposed as a possible next step to achieve global monitoring of amr in water environmental settings duarte et al 2020 hendriksen et al 2019b hong et al 2018 they have been successfully used in sewage surveillance and have proven to be flexible scalable relatively easy to implement and standardize features that could potentially benefit also their application in low and medium income countries maclean and san millan 2019 however these methods are not exempt from disadvantages and limitations such as how the complexity in sequence assembly and or functional genes of one microorganism cannot be fully linked to its phylogeny forbes et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 the joint use of standard culture based methods and cutting edge genomics can therefore overcome these limitations trends observed using these methods need to be correlated with observations in clinical settings so that insightful correlations can be established between the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens and args encountered in the environment such evidence is essential to persuade both the public and policymakers of the urgent need to act on amr jovanovic et al 2021 specific examples that establish how the spread of args occurred from water environmental sources to impact on clinical settings are starting to emerge these include the mobility of bla ctx m gene encoding resistance for β lactamases responsible for inactivating third generation cephalosporins cantón 2009 jovanovic et al 2021 mcr 1 resistance to colistin or polymyxins bla ndm 1 resistance to a large range of β lactamases including carbapenems jovanovic et al 2021 the risk of the spread of args from antibiotic resistant bacteria to final consumers has recently been established in animal farming settings van gompel et al 2020 recommended approaches to determine biological indicators for amr surveillance in water include monitoring resistance in i microorganisms watched by official lists who unesp uscdc ecdc etc jovanovic et al 2021 ii faecal and other benchmark microbial indicators such as bacteriophages routinely monitored in drinking and wastewater facilities larsson et al 2018 iii clinical relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria and iv the general presence of args in the target water setting also known as evaluation of the environmental resistome while the correlations between the presence of these amr precautionary microbial indicators and the risk they may pose of migrating from water to a clinical setting are established the precautionary approach can further inform improving water safety in established high risk environments for amr spread such as effluents of hospital and antibiotic production facilities wastewater treatment facilities need to be upgraded to reduce pollution and to more effectively remove not only antibiotics and antimicrobials but also amr indicators such as resistant bacteria and args hong et al 2018 these changes however are only likely to occur with enforcement of stronger water regulations compliance here will depend upon the development and availability of fit for purpose and economically viable water treatment technologies de almeida kumlien et al 2021 an important case study to help advance amr regulations in water can be drawn from the latest pandemic our views on which are discussed below 6 lessons from the covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 pandemic has quickly advanced our knowledge and practice of sewage surveillance and epidemiology of sars cov 2 studies in water which has extensively benefited from wastewater based epidemiology this latter is a relatively new approach that has the potential to provide comprehensive health information using community derived wastewater sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in fact the european commission has recently proposed recommendations for a common approach to establish a systematic surveillance of sars cov 2 and its variants in wastewaters in the eu european commission 2021 which would undoubtedly help to identify health related relevant parameters to be regularly monitored in wastewaters these initiatives represent an opportunity to implement their recommendations and advance amr surveillance wilson et al 2020 even though a conclusive quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to influence policymaking on amr in water is needed given the threat amr poses to public health the case for using the precautionary approach should be considered particularly when data is still not conclusive risks that cannot be calculated can be predicted or at least estimated by deploying data analytics scientific leadership and knowledge and within local financial and technical limits be corroborated on a pilot scale through multinational projects this however needs to happen through parallel taskforces that also focus on driving changes in current water legislation established networks and projects rapidly pivoted during the years 2020 and 2021 such as the dutch led sewers for covid https devpost com software sewers4covid and the spanish sarsaigua https sarsaigua icra cat and can be aligned with existing amr surveillance initiatives to speed up amr surveillance and containment in the environment singer et al 2016 using the precautionary approach existing strategies to determine amr precautionary indicators even though not definitive could be used to pilot more significant amr surveillance schemes in water one concrete way to drive that change is to add such indicators to watchlists and with more aggressive advocacy by the right actors to water regulations here the ideal target monitoring sites would be hospital and antibiotic facilities wastewaters potentially regulated through changes in overarching and enforcing law such as the water framework directive in europe the question that should be asked at this point is how can actionable insights be created to influence policymaking with the data available now for a vital issue such as amr advocacy on the theme is both relevant and recommended the important action is to determine who are the actors at community research policymaking and water utility levels that need to be involved both in arguing for the amr cause and in driving change a way to bring these actor together is through smart specialization clusters a collaboration strategy mediated by governmental funding schemes well known to speed up innovation in the water sector de almeida kumlien et al 2019 2018 fig 1 illustrates a systematic process to develop policies that can address public health problems such as amr 7 driving change in policymaking of amr in water similarly to the dispersion of data collected in various amr surveillance efforts the current and future costs of the amr crisis to countries are still only estimates apart from realizing robust qmra data a fundamental factor to drive change in amr policymaking in water is by clearly demonstrating the financial losses caused by this crisis roope et al 2019 although data here is still approximate estimates show a difficult scenario on the horizon for global economies recent estimates put the amr cost globally at us 100 trillion through loss of productivity in the usa data from 2019 more than 2 8 million multidrug resistant bacterial infections occur annually with an estimated 35 000 deaths and a us 20 billion health care burden strathdee et al 2020 in europe the annual economic cost associated with the treatment of antibiotic resistant infections has been estimated to be around 1500 million this figure includes the economic impact associated with the number of days of lost productivity estimated to be approximately 450 million each year roca et al 2015 amr affects national budgets mortality and related disability adjusted life years dalys in the eu and european economic area eea its impact has been comparable to the combined effects of tuberculosis influenza and hiv cassini et al 2019 progress has been made in establishing methodologies to determine amr costs a comprehensive framework for categorization of amr costs which evaluates human animal and environmental factors and its effects up through societal levels is the global antimicrobial resistance platform for one burden estimates gap on this initiative funded under the jpiamr considers local direct and indirect epidemiological costs and data and is adaptable for a broad range of aetiological pathogens and geographic locations morel et al 2020 recommendations by the who or in the absence of a central government that regulates amr stewardship by other organizations which act locally have shown slow progress currently only 5 of countries have a multisectoral amr action plan that has been implemented with identified funding sources and monitoring processes in place o neill 2016 compliance even when it is attained in some countries might not be possible to achieve due to lack of financial and human resources chandler 2019 roope et al 2019 the cost of implementing amr governance is considerable and most likely unaffordable for developing nations the cost of remediating the amr crisis however will be much higher the who has recently highlighted the need to develop new amr regulations with global reach hoffman et al 2015 this could be achieved by revising the international health regulations ihr developing a new treaty on pandemics or a separate agreement on amr regardless of the path of action chosen we need to seize chances to achieve new regulations for amr now given this scientific leadership is essential to advise policymakers on which are the best control points and methodologies for implementing regulation of amr in the water sector amongst them the following should be taken into consideration i precautionary indicators to achieve more effective surveillance of amr in water environmental settings ii harmonization and better accessibility of methodologies to detect amr and data generated iii reflecting on lessons learnt from the pandemics especially regarding sewage surveillance schemes and iv making the case on the financial impact of the amr crisis these points need to be advocated aligned and incorporated in a centralized enforcing amr regulation pivoted by the right leadership being at who or un level and only achievable with stronger collaboration between amr stakeholders at community country research industry water utility and policymaking levels 8 conclusions polluted aquatic environments e g wastewaters present a potentially high risk of the spread of amr affecting public health and thus should be carefully monitored scientific leadership needs to work with policymakers to advocate for immediate water regulation based on precautionary microbial indicators and methodologies to detect and evaluate the potential impact of amr on human health harmonization of detection methodologies and indicators through the combined participation of research institutions worldwide is crucial to reach these goals the generation of new data improvements in existing data communication accessibility and harmonization between global amr databases will help generate insights into the impact of amr from the water environment on human health lessons on sewage surveillance learnt from the covid 19 pandemic and the estimated financial impact of the amr crisis can help drive better advocacy for new regulations in

dispersion of data collected in various amr surveillance efforts the current and future costs of the amr crisis to countries are still only estimates apart from realizing robust qmra data a fundamental factor to drive change in amr policymaking in water is by clearly demonstrating the financial losses caused by this crisis roope et al 2019 although data here is still approximate estimates show a difficult scenario on the horizon for global economies recent estimates put the amr cost globally at us 100 trillion through loss of productivity in the usa data from 2019 more than 2 8 million multidrug resistant bacterial infections occur annually with an estimated 35 000 deaths and a us 20 billion health care burden strathdee et al 2020 in europe the annual economic cost associated with the treatment of antibiotic resistant infections has been estimated to be around 1500 million this figure includes the economic impact associated with the number of days of lost productivity estimated to be approximately 450 million each year roca et al 2015 amr affects national budgets mortality and related disability adjusted life years dalys in the eu and european economic area eea its impact has been comparable to the combined effects of tuberculosis influenza and hiv cassini et al 2019 progress has been made in establishing methodologies to determine amr costs a comprehensive framework for categorization of amr costs which evaluates human animal and environmental factors and its effects up through societal levels is the global antimicrobial resistance

pathogens and geographic locations morel et al 2020 recommendations by the who or in the absence of a central government that regulates amr stewardship by other organizations which act locally have shown slow progress currently only 5 of countries have a multisectoral amr action plan that has been implemented with identified funding sources and monitoring processes in place o neill 2016 compliance even when it is attained in some countries might not be possible to achieve due to lack of financial and human resources chandler 2019 roope et al 2019 the cost of implementing amr governance is considerable and most likely unaffordable for developing nations the cost of remediating the amr crisis however will be much higher the who has recently highlighted the need to develop new amr regulations with global reach hoffman et al 2015 this could be achieved by revising the international health regulations ihr developing a new treaty on pandemics or a separate agreement on amr regardless of the path of action chosen we need to seize chances to achieve new regulations for amr now given this scientific leadership is essential to advise policymakers on which are the best control points and methodologies for implementing regulation of amr in the water sector amongst them the following should be taken into consideration i precautionary indicators to achieve more effective surveillance of amr in water environmental settings ii harmonization and better accessibility of methodologies to detect amr and data generated iii reflecting on lessons learnt from the pandemics especially regarding sewage surveillance schemes and iv making the case on the financial impact of the amr crisis these points need to be advocated aligned and incorporated in a centralized enforcing amr regulation pivoted by the right leadership being at who or un level and only achievable with stronger collaboration between amr stakeholders at community country research industry water utility and policymaking levels 8 conclusions polluted aquatic environments e g wastewaters present a potentially high risk of the spread of amr affecting public health and thus should be carefully monitored scientific leadership needs to work with policymakers to advocate for immediate water regulation based on precautionary microbial indicators and methodologies to detect and evaluate the potential impact of amr on human health harmonization of detection methodologies and indicators through the combined participation of research institutions worldwide is crucial to reach these goals the generation of new data improvements in existing data communication accessibility and harmonization between global amr databases will help generate insights into the impact of amr from the water environment on human health lessons on sewage surveillance learnt from the covid 19 pandemic and the estimated financial impact of the amr crisis can help drive better advocacy for new regulations in

16531,iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps formed in water treatment are of emerging concern due to their high toxicity and the tase and odor problems associated with iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodoacetic acid and dichloroiodomethane are currently regulated in shenzhen china and the ministry of health of the people s republic of china has also been considering regulating i dbps iodide i organoiodine compounds e g iodinated x ray contrast media icm and iodate io3 are the three common iodine sources in aquatic environment that lead to i dbp formation while uv irradiation effectively inactivate a wide range of microorganisms in water it induces the transformation of these iodine sources enabling the formation of i dbps this review focuses on the fate and transformation of these iodine sources in uv based water treatment i e uv irradiation and uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops and the formation of i dbps in post disinfection i released in uv based treatments of icm and can be oxidized in subsequent disinfection to hypoiodous acid hoi which reacts with natural organic matter nom to produce i dbps both uv and uv aops are not able to fully mineralize icm and completely oxidize the released i to except uv o3 results reveal that uv and uv aops are adequate for i dbp degradation but require high uv doses while the ideal i dbp mitigation strategy awaits to be developed understanding their sources and formation pathways aids in informed selections of water treatment processes empowers water suppliers to meet drinking water standards and minimizes consumers exposure to i dbps graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv irradiation uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps iodide iodinated x ray contrast media icm iodate 1 introduction chlorine disinfection is currently the most common disinfection method in drinking water treatment it is a cost effective and efficient approach for inactivating pathogens in water treatment and providing necessary residuals in the distribution system however chlorine can react with the natural and anthropogenic constituents e g natural organic matter nom bromide and iodide in water and inevitably results in the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps with health concerns this chlorine dilemma between inactivation of waterborne pathogens and dbp formation presents an intractable but important challenge for drinking water treatment since the first discovery of trihalomethanes thms in 1974 700 dbps have been identified in literature dong et al 2019 currently only 11 of them are regulated by the u s epa i e 4 thms 5 haloacetic acids haas bromate chlorite in response to the potential health effects of regulated dbps many utilities have opted for alternative disinfection methods such as chloramines chlorine dioxide ozone and ultraviolet uv irradiation however each of these disinfection methods produces its own suite of dbps and sometimes offers more problems than solutions tibbets 1995 sedlak and von gunten 2011 for example though chloramination significantly reduces the formation of regulated dbps it notably enhances the formation of emerging dbps such as iodinated dbps i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 richardson 2003 krasner et al 2006 i dbps are constantly being detected in drinking water with iodo trihalomethanes i thms and iodo haloacetic acids i haas being the most detected chcl2i 0 05 µg l 1 was first detected in chlorinated finished water as early as in 1975 bunn et al 1975 other groups of i dbps i e iodo haloacetamides iodo haloacetonitriles iodo haloaldehydes iodo phenols have also been identified in drinking water dong et al 2019 i dbps have been reported to be more toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 with more chemical standards of i dbps becoming available research on i dbps is accelerated to emerge i thms are known to cause unpleasant taste and odor issues in drinking water hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 cancho et al 2001 odor and taste in drinking water are also of great concern for water suppliers due to the resulting complaints from consumers who often perceive unpleasant odor and taste as potential health risk hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2001 the odor threshold concentration otc values of i thms are significantly lower than those of regulated thms table s1 among i thms an increase in iodine atoms dramatically decreased their otc values with the otc value of chi3 being as low as 0 03 µg l 1 it is highly possible that our drinking water would exceed such threshold since chi3 is often detected in the range of 0 02 8 3 µg l 1 wei et al 2013a 2013b tugulea et al 2018 not to mention that the co existence of the six i thms is more likely to be detected by consumers than the presence of an individual i thm mcdonald et al 2009 in fact up to 25 of bad taste and odor in french drinking waters were estimated to be partly caused by i thms eaux 1993 bichsel and von gunten 1999b such low otc levels of i thms necessitate the optimization of disinfection methods to strategically mitigate their formation and control taste and odor in drinking water treatment i dbps have been detected worldwide at considerable concentrations in drinking water leading to growing concerns in scientific community and the drinking water industry brass et al 1977 hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 plewa et al 2004 krasner et al 2006 plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2013 wei et al 2013a 2013b yang and zhang 2013 luo et al 2014 jeong et al 2015 pan et al 2016 allen et al 2017 tugulea et al 2018 in view of their critical importance several comprehensive reviews have been presented to summarize their occurrence toxicity and formation mechanism in drinking water treatment dong et al 2019 postigo and zonja 2019 li et al 2020a 2020b sengar and vijayanandan 2021 these reviews recapped i dbp formation in oxidative treatments using agents including chlorine chloramines iodine ozone chlorine dioxide potassium permanganate peracetic acid ferrate manganese dioxide lead oxide zero valent iron and peroxides or uv based oxidation processes however the fate of iodine species e g iodide i iondinated x ray contrast media icm and iodate io3 in uv based technologies is largely overlooked and has rarely been reviewed uv irradiation can effectively inactivate a wide range of microorganisms in water without any addition of chemicals and the formation of dbps song et al 2016 the major obstacle associated with uv disinfection is that it cannot maintain a disinfectant residual in the effluents being treated hassen et al 2000 making it necessary to resupply residual disinfectants e g cl2 and nh2cl after uv disinfection in water treatment tian et al 2014 therefore drinking water treatment plants using uv to achieve primary disinfection require a secondary chemical disinfection our recent findings and others have demonstrated that sequential application of uv or uv aops and chemical disinfection could result in the formation of an appreciable amount of i dbps during the treatment of water containing iodine sources raising an increasing issue for uv implemented water treatment facilities in this review we discuss the fate and transformation of iodine species in uv based water treatment we review the interconversion of these iodine species including organoiodine compounds i e icm and i dbps and with a focus on uv induced transformation of iodine sources to i dbps we outline recent progress and suggest fruitful avenues for future research in particularly the control strategies for i dbp formation 2 iodine species in uv based water treatment there are 4 iodine species encountered in water treatment including i organoiodine compounds elementary iodine i2 and io3 during oxidation and disinfection e g cl2 nh2cl clo2 and o3 can be oxidized to reactive hypoiodous acid hoi which then reacts with nom to form i dbps in competing with its further oxidation to io3 during uv and uv aops organoiodine compounds such as icm undergo deiodination and the release of i tian et al 2017b wang et al 2017 hu et al 2019b which acts as the iodine source for i dbp formation in post disinfection iodine based disinfectants i e i2 could also act as an iodine source during iodination of raw source waters smith et al 2010 however it has rarely been applied in full scale water treatment facilities ellis 1991 and thus will not be further discussed transforms to in uv and uv aops through photochemical reduction resulting in the formation of i dbps in subsequent disinfection zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a 2019 overall the fate and transformation of iodine species in uv based water treatment appear to form a cycle and are summarized in fig 1 details will be discussed in the following sections 3 iodide the culprit for i dbp formation 3 1 iodide concentration in water sources i has been notoriously blamed for its potential risk in i dbp formation during disinfection it is the most typical iodine source and naturally presents in source water i concentration in source drinking water in north america was found in the range of 0 4 104 2 µg l 1 median of 10 3 µg l 1 richardson et al 2008 groundwater normally contains 0 01 20 µg l 1 of i ali mohamed and jamali 1989 in a survey across canada highest i level was detected in a groundwater source at 131 36 µg l 1 tugulea et al 2018 a high i level of 200 µg l 1 was measured in mineral water in central europe bichsel and von gunten 1999a i concentration ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 µg l 1 was detected in tap water samples collected from four cities in china gong and zhang 2013 i can be introduced in drinking water by seawater intrusion in coastal regions e g shanghai and shenzhen wei et al 2013a elevated levels of i are expected due to the increasing use of alternative source water including recycled wastewater dong et al 2017 desalinated seawater agus et al 2009 and impaired source water e g shale gas wastewater impacted drinking water supplies parker et al 2014 high i concentration in surface water e g 50 µg l 1 may also occur in arid regions 3 2 transformation of iodide in uv irradiation and uv aops 3 2 1 uv irradiation the presence of i in source drinking water is troublesome due to its high potential in i dbp formation during oxidation uv irradiation at 254 nm can photochemically activate i and transform i to iodine radicals e g i and i2 and eqs 1 8 in supplementary materials rahn 1993 rahn 1997 yeo and choi 2009 exposure of i to uv eq 1 produces a caged complex containing an iodine atom and an electron through a charge transfer eq 2 after that reactions 3 and 4 can occur a back reaction to reform i eq 3 and the breakdown of the caged complex eqs 4a and b in the absence of an electron scavenger the back reaction dominates leading to the recombination of the bulk electrons with iodine atoms to form i therefore uv irradiation of i in pure water and water containing humic acid did not result in any change in i concentration xia et al 2018 in fact the primary challenge associated with uv irradiation of iodide containing drinking water lies in the uv induced alteration of dissolved organic matter which renders it more reactive towards disinfectants leading to enhanced formation of i dbps in post disinfection xia et al 2018 in the presence of an electron scavenger e g o2 n2o and io3 the caged complex breaks down and releases the iodine atom and an hydrated electron eaq eq 4a reactions 5 8 of iodine species will occur and result in the formation of i2 present mainly as hoi in water treatment an iodine anion radical i2 and i3 absorption spectra of i aqueous solutions in uv region show broad electronic bands and are assigned to charge transfer to solvent state during which eaq is rapidly produced eq 4a lehr et al 1999 with a standard reduction potential of 2 9 v eaq is a powerful reductant that reacts with electron scavengers e g o2 eq 4b schwarz 1981 instead of using impractical electron scavengers e g o2 and n2o in water treatment several studies have managed to make use of this eaq for the degradation of various reducible contaminants such as perfluorinated chemicals park et al 2009 hexavalent chromium yeo et al 2012 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma sun et al 2017 and haas bu et al 2018b by treating them as electron scavengers however due to the low i concentration this uv iodide process requires adding i in water and is thus not advisable since i is of significant high risk for i dbp formation during final disinfection another scenario that is worthy of serious consideration is the coexistence of i and io3 in uv irradiation of drinking water i and io3 both have been found in source drinking water see 3 1 and 5 1 with the coexistence of i and io3 io3 acts as an electron scavenger and facilitates the formation of reactive iodine species ris e g hoi i2 i2 and i3 eqs 5 8 rahn 1997 xia et al 2018 though i dbp formation resulted directly from the reaction of these uv induced ris and dissolved organic matter dom is unconfirmed xia et al observed a noticeable improvement in i thm formation in subsequent chloramination xia et al 2018 which might be partly attributable to this unconfirmed reaction fig 1 3 2 2 uv aops uv aops which combines uv irradiation with oxidants e g uv o3 uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv nh2cl produces reactive radicals e g oh cl clo and cl2 these radicals may oxidize i and generate iodine radicals i e i i2 and possibly cli and bri and hoi which can incorporate into dom to form i dbp gao et al 2020 uv o3 and uv cl2 may fully oxidize i to io3 especially uv o3 therefore uv aops oxidation can alter i dbp formation while the oxidation of i has been predominantly studied with common oxidants e g o3 h2o2 cl2 and nh2cl very few investigate uv aops oxidation of iodide containing water uv h2o2 oxidation and subsequent chlorination of iodide containing water did not produce any iodinated haloacetamides hacams chu et al 2014 uv h2o2 might oxidize i to iodine species that did not react with dom to form iodinated hacams other explanations are also possible such as the destruction of hacam precursors in uv h2o2 uv cl2 appears to be improper for treating iodide containing water compared with chlorination alone uc cl2 oxidation produced more i thms gao et al 2020 presumably due to alteration of dom by uv photolysis xia et al 2018 overall uv irradiation and uv aops tend to amend dom significantly and enhance i dbp formation in post disinfection limited data are available and future experiments should address the transformation of i in uv and uv aops and provide a better understanding of their roles in i dbp formation 4 organoiodine compounds icm and i dbps 4 1 occurrence of icm the emerging iodine source icm are another emerging iodine source it was not until 2011 when icm were found to lead to i dbp formation did the scientific community start to pay close attention to these frequently applied compounds for medical imaging in hospitals duirk et al 2011 due to their high hydrophilicity and biochemical stability they are inefficiently removed during wastewater treatment consequently they were ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater wastewater receiving waters e g surface water groundwater and drinking water with the highest concentration of 100 µg l 1 being reported hirsch et al 2000 ternes and hirsch 2000 drewes et al 2001 sacher et al 2001 duirk et al 2011 hence icm are of special concern where wastewater reclamation for potable reuse is implemented drewes et al 2001 schittko et al 2004 tiehm et al 2011 another organoiodine compound that warrants attention is thyroid hormones e g thyroxine and liothyronine they are also iodinated pharmaceuticals that have been detected in wastewater svanfelt et al 2010 but less studied occurrence of icm in different water sources is summarized in table s2 icm such as iopromide iopamidol iomeprol and diatrizoate have been identified in literature it appears that iopromide is the icm being most frequently detected which is inconsistent with an earlier finding that iopamidol was the most frequently detected in source drinking waters duirk et al 2011 the different result is probably because we include a wider range of water sources such as wastewater effluents and surface water e g lake river and creek among the water sources that we collected table s2 highest icm concentrations are mostly found in sewage treatment plant stp influents removal of icm by conventional treatment in stps is limited thus icm concentrations in stp effluents are also high drinking water and its sources also contain icm though at trace levels typically in ng l 1 it should also be noted that all the icm occurrence studies are overwhelmingly conducted in developed countries or in developed area of developing country i e shanghai china the occurrence of icm in other developing areas around the world are widely unknown probably due to the lack of access to advanced analytic instruments similarly the occurrence of i dbps is also rarely documented in developing areas where people may suffer from worse source drinking water and less advanced water treatment technologies therefore international collaborations are urgently needed to deal with this uneven distribution of data and resource 4 2 uv irradiation of icm the employment of advanced treatment processes is often required to remove icm in water and wastewater treatment uv irradiation is an established method for water disinfection hijnen et al 2006 a typical disinfection dose fluence of 40 mj cm 2 is sufficient to eliminate various pathogens and photochemically degrade organic compounds hijnen et al 2006 canonica et al 2008 thus it has been applied for the degradation of icm the direct uv photolysis of a compound in pure water depends mainly on two parameters the decadic molar absorption coefficient ε λ and the quantum yield φ pereira et al 2007 a compound needs the capacity to absorb photons of the incident light to be photolabile the probability that a compound absorbs light at a certain wavelength λ can be measured by ε λ pereira et al 2007 higher ε λ 254 indicates better uv254 irradiation absorption the quantum yield values for icm degradation can be defined by the ratio between the total number of molecules of the icm degraded to the total number of photons absorbed by the solution in the presence of icm pereira et al 2007 they need to be determined experimentally and the φ values measured under medium pressure hg lamp mp uv should be equal to those using low pressure hg lamp lp uv 254 nm canonica et al 2008 the ε λ 254 and φ 254 of icm have been determined and are listed in table s3 allard et al 2016 degradation of icm by direct lp uv photolysis lp uv 254 nm monochromatic follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics i e ln c c0 kt fig 2 a b allard et al 2016 factors including uv fluence initial icm concentration uv light wavelength water matrix and solution ph have been shown to influence their degradation 4 2 1 uv fluence the degradation rates of icm e g iohexol and iopamidol have been shown to increase with uv fluence at lp uv254 fluence of 40 mj cm 2 only 15 removal of iopromide was observed in pure water ph 7 canonica et al 2008 similarly the removal of iohexol was only around 20 at lp uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 while it substantially increased to nearly 100 at an extremely high fluence of 1700 mj cm 2 pereira et al 2007 tian et al and duan et al observed a linear decrease in the concentrations of iopamidol and diatrizoate with the increase of lp uv fluence and intensity respectively fig 2a b tian et al 2014 duan et al 2017 4 2 2 initial concentration the degradation rate constants were reported to be higher at low initial icm concentrations than at high initial icm concentrations including iopamidol and iomeprol doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 this can be ascribed to the greater absorption of the incident photo flux by icm at high initial concentrations thus the absorbed photon flux by the icm under low and high concentration conditions was disproportionate to their initial concentration doll and frimmel 2003 with low initial icm concentration the photon flux can be in excess in equation 9 e is photon energy h is the planck s constant v is the photon s frequency c is the speed of light and λ is the photon s wavelength 4 2 3 wavelength in photolysis a compound first absorbs photons to reach an initial excited state velo gala et al 2014 gao et al 2019 the rate to attain this excited state depends on the photon energy which is inversely proportional to the photon s wavelength eq 9 it is thus rational to consider the impact of wavelength for the optimization of icm degradation in uv photolysis canonica et al found that mp uv 238 334 nm polychromatic was less effective than lp uv 254 nm for iopromide degradation canonica et al 2008 in a recent study conducted by our group using uv leds we found that 265 nm uv leds were more effective than 280 nm uv leds in the direct photolysis of iopamidol gao et al 2019 which should be ascribed to the larger molar absorption coefficient or quantum yield of the iopamidol under 265 nm uv leds intriguingly the combination of 265 nm and 280 nm in a hybrid uv led configuration enhanced iopamidol degradation compared to using 265 nm uv leds or 280 nm uv leds individually this was attributed to the enhancement in the number of photons provided between 265 and 280 nm in the hybrid system fig 2c 4 2 4 nom the presence of nom in water has two contrary effects on photodegradation of contaminants it could either reduce the effective fluence rate and thus photochemical degradation of icm due to inner filtering of uv light by colored nom or increase icm degradation due to an indirect generation of reactive species e g oh from nom photoexcitation pereira et al 2007 canonica et al 2008 borowska et al reported a 12 reduction in iohexol removal in tap water compared to in pure water by mp uv borowska et al 2015 contrarily pereira et al observed that lp uv photolysis rate constant of iohexol was 0 26 min 1 in pure water and increased to 0 35 min 1 in surface water 4 2 mgc l dissolved organic carbon doc pereira et al 2007 uv photolysis of icm with the presence of nom can involve indirect phototransformation producing secondary photo oxidants the enhancement obtained by pereira et al pereira et al 2007 in lp uv photolysis of iohexol was probably because of reactive species e g singlet oxygen superoxide anion h2o2 oh and e αq formed in nom photoexcitation via indirect photolysis which accelerated its removal doll and frimmel 2003 canonica et al 2008 therefore a nom content suitable enough to scavenge those reactive species is required to negatively impact icm degradation by uv photolysis doll and frimmel 2003 interestingly a negligible impact of water samples on lp uv photolysis of iopromide doc 1 7 2 1 mgc l and mp uv photolysis of diatrizoate and iodipamide in tap water was measured by canonica et al 2008 and borowska et al 2015 respectively the insignificant influence of water matrix on uv photolysis of icm might be explained by the fact that their water samples had low doc contents and showed low decrease in effective fluence rate 7 canonica et al 2008 borowska et al 2015 in general the results of the impacts of water matrix on uv photolysis of icm degradation depends on the characteristics of the water matrix and hence further research is warranted 4 2 5 ph ph of water can greatly impact direct photolysis of contaminants because many of their pka values are within or near the ph range of source water pka values influence the distribution of the protonated deprotonated species which may have different absorption properties and quantum yields however ph values of 4 7 and 10 was shown not to affect the absorption properties of 5 icm including iopromide iopamidol iohexol diatrizoic acid and iotalamic acid the pka values of icm are listed in table s3 all these values are not in the ph range typically encountered in water treatment e g 6 9 and thus ph would not impact icm protonation in practical water treatment for example iopamidol did not dissociate in water and remained predominantly nonionized in the ph range of 5 9 tian et al 2014 therefore solution ph has been demonstrated to not impact the degradation rates of iopamidol iohexol and iopromide by uv photolysis and other icm are expected to behave similarly canonica et al 2008 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 4 2 6 deiodination and i dbp formation uv irradiation of icm involves stepwise deiodination of the aromatic ring leading to the generation of deiodinated products and most importantly the release of i which is notorious for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection during photolysis of iopamidol iopromide and iomeprol gradual increase in i concentration and decrease in absorbable organic iodine aoi concentration was observed with increasing uv fluence fig 2d doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 aoi include the remaining icm and partly deiodinated intermediates that contain iodine other iodine species including hoi and i2 were not identified affirming that i is the only inorganic product allard et al 2016 not only the sum of aoi and i but also the total organic carbon toc concentration in the solution remained almost constant throughout the reaction indicating that uv cannot mineralize icm to co2 but transforms them to smaller molecular weight organic products which could be a potential threat for subsequent water treatment processes doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 for instance acting as precursors for dbp formation in the ensuing disinfection tian et al was the first to study i dbp formation in sequential treatment of icm with uv and chemical disinfection i e cl2 nh2cl and clo2 increasing uv fluence enhanced i dbp formation e g chcl2i chcli2 chi3 and ci3cooh in post disinfection tian et al 2014 this confirms our speculation that the released i in uv photolysis of icm e g iopamidol and iopromide can be oxidized in post disinfection to hoi which reacts with the organic products produced during uv degradation of icm to form i dbps fig 1 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 the concentration of i dbps represented merely a small fraction of the aoi measured allard et al 2016 signifying that other emerging iodinated byproducts were present at appreciable levels and warrant our attention tian et al conducted the experiments in the absence of nom to demonstrate that the intermediates formed in uv degradation of iopamidol can serve as dbp precursors in post disinfection tian et al 2014 allard et al conducted similar experiments with the presence of nom allard et al 2016 and found slightly decrease in uv degradation of iopromide due to uv light absorption by nom however i thm formation i e chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 was enhanced in subsequent disinfection i e hocl and nh2cl owing to more dbp precursors provided by nom although icm themselves are nontoxic their uv photo degradation intermediates were demonstrated to be of significant toxicity not to mention the i dbps formed in post disinfection allard et al 2016 therefore special attention needs to be paid to the sequential application of uv and post disinfection when icm are present in water source 4 2 7 outlook uv photolysis at the typical fluence levels near that used for disinfection 40 140 mj cm 2 alone is ineffective for the removal of icm present in drinking water to achieve significant icm destruction higher fluence levels or a combination of uv with other advanced oxidation processes is hence required it should also be noted that most studies in literature investigated one icm at a time making the comparation among different icm difficult however source water generally contains more than one icm table s2 as an emerging research area a systematic investigation of uv photolysis comparing various icm and influencing factors would provide more accurate information and practical guidelines for water treatment facilities 4 3 degradation of icm by uv aops uv aops combining uv irradiation with various oxidants e g uv o3 uv h2o2 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv persulfate uv s2o8 2 are attractive and emerging approaches for the removal of various organic contaminants the active radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh standard redox potential of 2 4 2 7 v at acidic ph and 1 9 2 0 at alkaline ph chlorine radical cl 2 4 v amino radical nh2 and sulfate radical so4 2 5 3 1 v produced in these uv aops are found to be of high standard redox potentials and promising for the destruction of icm fang and shang 2012 zhao et al 2019 4 3 1 uv o3 and uv h2o2 during uv irradiation o3 and h2o2 are commonly added to enhance contaminant elimination efficiency due to their absorption of uv light and the formation of table s4 uv photolysis of o3 in water produces h2o2 which subsequently reacts with uv irradiation or o3 to form oh eqs 10 11 gong et al 2008 uv o3 oxidation of contaminants is hence a synergistic effect of several individual reactions including direct ozonation direct photolysis and oh oxidation while the dominant mechanism of contaminant destruction in uv h2o2 is oh mediated advanced oxidation ionic icm i e diatrizoate was found to be highly recalcitrant to o3 uv photolysis and uv o3 though its removal slowly increased with the increase of o3 and uv fluence table s5 and fig 2b ternes et al 2003 duan et al 2017 uv photolysis alone at a high uv fluence of 160 mj cm 2 removed only 38 of diatrizoate while o3 dose of 15 mg l 1 removed merely 14 the combination uv o3 with uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 slightly improved its degradation compared with o3 on the contrary o3 seems to be efficacious for the degradation of all non ionic icms i e iopamidol iopromide and iomeprol so that uv o3 does not improve their removal table s5 uv o3 is the less studied uv aops for icm degradation more research is hence needed to investigate its icm removal since the results in literature cannot provide a clear answer for its effectiveness it has to be noted that the high o3 doses of 5 15 mg l 1 was applied to the wastewater effluent with a high doc content of 23 0 mgc l in the study by ternes et al ternes et al 2003 the reaction of o3 with iopromide was reported huber et al 2003 to be very slow in pure water and the degradation of iopromide in ozonation of drinking water seems not as effective as in ternes et al table s5 ternes et al 2003 this may be explained by the fact that high iopromide concentration iopromide 0 395 5 µg l 1 was spiked huber et al 2003 which is about 2 magnitude higher than icm levels typically detected in water sources table s2 in a drinking water treatment plant with o3 dose of 1 mg l 1 and 4 6 min contact time ozonation removed averagely only 30 of the non ionic icm i e iomeprol iopromide iohexol and iopamidol whereas it cannot eliminate ionic diatrizoic acid seitz et al 2006 therefore we conclude that o3 is unable to degrade icms to a large extent in drinking water treatment during uv o3 degradation of iopromide i and io3 were identified as the main degradation products fig 3 a with concentration of io3 being substantially higher than that of io3 sona et al 2006 implying that the released i from deiodination was immediately oxidized to io3 other iodine containing metabolites were detected as well therefore uv o3 is promising for non ionic icm removal in especial the oxidation of i to io3 which reduces the potential risk of i dbp formation in post disinfection degradation of icm e g diatrizoate and iohexol by h2o2 was found to be negligible duan et al 2017 hu et al 2019a thus uv h2o2 has been applied for icm oxidation using tert butanol ethanol or methanol as oh scavengers it was confirmed that oh was the major contributor for icm i e iohexol and diatrizoate oxidation and direct uv photolysis was negligible in uv h2o2 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a compared to uv alone uv h2o2 slightly improved the degradation of iopromide chu et al 2011 iopamidol fig 3c and diatrizoate figs 2b and 3d duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 kong et al 2018 while retarded the degradation of iohexol fig 3e f pereira et al 2007 hu et al 2019a gradual increase in h2o2 concentration in uv h2o2 increased iopamidol degradation tian et al 2020 while decreased iohexol degradation fig 3f signifying that different icm may react differently toward oxidation although more h2o2 produces more oh excess h2o2 can scavenge oh to form less reactive species eqs 12 and 13 hu et al 2019a besides excess h2o2 competes with icm for light flux in uv h2o2 oxidation screening effect also worth mentioning is the consumption of oh by a catalytic cycle of oxidation of the released i to iodine hoi hoi being the dominant species in water treatment and the fast reduction of hoi by h2o2 back to i jeong et al 2010 shin et al 2020 this also explains why uv h2o2 oxidation of icm does not induce io3 formation fig 3b uv h2o2 is also unlikely to oxidize i to io3 in terms of production uv intensity seems to play a more important role than h2o2 concentration with the increase of uv intensity the degradation rate of iopamidol showed a linear increase resulting from more oh generated tian et al 2020 nevertheless the use of h2o2 decreased the uv fluence needed to remove icm for example with the addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 uv fluence was reduced from 120 to 108 mj cm 2 from 397 to 360 mj cm 2 from 794 to 720 mj cm 2 for 50 90 and 99 removal of iohexol respectively pereira et al 2007 the change of ph insignificantly influences uv h2o2 degradation of icm including iopamidol kong et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 diatrizoate kong et al 2018 and iohexol hu et al 2019a which is probably because the generation of oh in uv h2o2 is independent of solution ph eq 10 and icm dissociation is not impacted by solution ph typically encountered in water treatment pka table s3 zhao et al 2019 it should also be mentioned that only 10 iohexol was degraded at uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 and 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 pereira et al 2007 affirming that uv h2o2 with typical doses applied in drinking water treatment is incompetent to tackle icm another downside of uv h2o2 is that it cannot further oxidize the released i in deiodination to io3 and this i is the culprit for i dbp formation in post disinfection fig 3b kong et al 2018 shin et al 2020 significant enhancement in chi3 formation has been observed in post chlorination of iopamidol pre treated with uv h2o2 zhao et al 2019 which was ascribed to the oxidation of i to hoi in post disinfection 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 another oxidant that is receiving increasing attention in uv aops is persulfate anion s2o8 2 uv activation of can generate sulfate radical so4 eq 14 which has been proven effective in oxidative destruction of various emerging contaminants including endocrine disruption compounds drugs perfluorinated compounds and algal toxins fang and shang 2012 oh can also be produced when so4 reacts with water or with oh under alkaline conditions eqs 15 and 16 xie et al 2015 sulfate anion is generated as the end product which is not considered to be a pollutant being a powerful oxidant so4 has been identified as a promising method for icm destruction chan et al 2010 duan et al 2017 similar to h2o2 degradation of icm e g diatrizoate iopamidol and iohexol by s2o8 2 oxidation alone is negligible fig 3e zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a uv activation of s2o8 2 strikingly accelerates the degradation of icm including iopromide chan et al 2010 diatrizoate duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 iopamidol zhao et al 2019 and iohexol hu et al 2019a dong et al 2021 uv photolysis oh and so4 were confirmed by radical scavenging tests to contribute to icm degradation in uv s2o8 2 hu et al 2019a with so4 being the dominant reactive species zhou et al 2017 so4 reacts with organic contaminants mainly via electron transfer which makes it more selective than oh most studies investigated uv s2o8 2 using uv h2o2 as a reference and found that uv s2o8 2 was significantly more effective in icm destruction than uv h2o2 under neutral conditions figs 2b and 3e table s6 this can be attributed to two factors one is the higher light absorption by s2o8 2 than h2o2 table s4 resulting in higher production rate of reactive radicals in uv s2o8 2 than in uv h2o2 another reason is that the self scavenging of so4 by s2o8 2 in uv s2o8 2 is much lower than that of oh by h2o2 in uv h2o2 xiao et al 2016 iopromide was the first icm that was subjected to uv s2o8 2 oxidation chan et al 2010 its degradation was enhanced with increasing uv intensity and persulfate concentration similar results were also observed in the degradation of diatrizoate and iohexol fig 4 a b duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a with the increase of s2o8 2 from 100 to 500 µm a linear increase in the degradation rate constant of iohexol in uv s2o8 2 oxidation was observed fig 4b insert this indicates that increase in s2o8 2 can lead to a proportional increase in the generation of so4 and oh of note is that the diatrizoate degradation rate was notably rapid in the first 10 20 min afterwards it was retarded figs 2b and 3a this deceleration in diatrizoate oxidation is ascribable to the formation of degradation products which may compete with s2o8 2 for light flux and with diatrizoate for further reaction with so4 zhou et al 2017 icm degradation by uv s2o8 2 slightly decreased with increasing ph chan et al 2010 however ph in the circumneutral range e g 6 9 merely influenced icm degradation further increase in ph 9 can lead to decline in icm degradation this can partly be explained by the formation of oh eqs 15 and 16 which is less reactive than so4 toward icm table s6 it is also likely that alkaline ph activates s2o8 2 decomposition eq 17 which yields only one so4 per 2 persulfate molecules at much lower rate than that of uv activated s2o8 2 eq 14 in addition it is worth noting that solution ph decreases concomitantly as uv s2o8 2 degrades icm probably due to the h being generated as a consequence of so4 scavenging eq 15 and the formation of acidic species chan et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 other influencing factors such as temperature common ions and nom in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm have also been investigated uv s2o8 2 degradation of iohexol increased with increasing temperature from 20 to 35 c because higher temperatures tend to produce more so4 zhou et al 2017 the presence of common ions e g k ca mg2 nh4 and so4 2 in water did not affect uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iohexol while some cations including cl and hco3 were found to negatively impact icm degradation in uv s2o8 2 especially when they are present at high concentrations in several mm range zhou et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 this inhibitory effect caused by cl and hco3 can mostly be attributable to their reactions with so4 and oh generating secondary radicals e g cl cloh and co3 that are less reactive with organic compounds than so4 and oh interestingly both cl and hco3 merely retarded uv h2o2 degradation of iopamidol zhao et al 2019 probably because they have no uv 254 absorption at low concentrations 100 mg l 1 xiao et al 2014 also cl does not scavenge oh zhang et al 2018 in general nom shows adverse impacts on the degradation of icm zhao et al 2019 nom can absorb uv light and thus act as inner filter to reduce degradation rate of icm it can also rapidly react with so4 and oh leading to the consumption of these reactive radicals degradation rates of iopamidol by uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 were both reduced with the presence of nom zhao et al 2019 compared with uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 degradation rate of iopadmiol showed much more significant reduction implying that uv s2o8 2 is more sensitive to nom likely resulting from the higher reactivity of so4 with some organic compounds than that of oh unfortunately in uv s2o8 2 degradation of icm the liberated i is transformed to hoi but not to io3 zhao et al 2019 measured considerable amounts of i and hoi in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iopamidol while was negligible i was confirmed to be oxidized to hoi without further transformation to io3 in a carbon nanotube activated s2o8 2 system guan et al 2017 io3 is often the desired sink of iodine while hoi is infamous for its reaction with nom to form i dbps the application of uv s2o8 2 in icm oxidation is thus of serious concern as it turns out chi3 was detected in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iohexol and its concentration increased with increasing initial s2o8 2 concentration hu et al 2019a which should be ascribed to the reaction of hoi and degradation intermediates wang et al 2019 it should also be noted that i dbps e g chcli2 chcl2i chi3 and ich2cooh have been detected in subsequent chlorination followed by pre oxidation with uv s2o8 2 of icm i dbps are formed through the reaction of hoi and intermediates produced by uv s2o8 2 degradation of icm this hoi is produced through three pathways one is produced in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm second one is the oxidation of the released i by subsequent chlorination the third one is chlorination of the partly deiodinated intermediates fig 1 the last one is highly likely because the majority of the iodine atoms in icm were found to remain as organic iodine after oxidation wang et al 2019 this is particularly worrisome since these organic iodine containing intermediates are as problematic as i in post disinfection not to mention that they are more reactive than their parent icm with oxidants also noteworthy most studied were conducted with extremely high concentrations of icm several µm that were intentionally spiked into water matrix and substantially higher than those in raw water table s2 hence further research is needed to address uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm at environmental relevant concentrations however since uv s2o8 2 is not able to oxidize the released i to io3 it is thus not recommended for icm degradation in combination with subsequent disinfection 4 3 3 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv clo2 both uv and chlorine are widely used for disinfection the use of chlorine in conjunction with uv light i e uv cl2 has been developed to overcome the disadvantage of each process uv produces no disinfectant residual while chlorination forms dbps exposure of cl2 to uv irradiation produces oh and reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl clo and cl2 eqs 18 23 and 27 feng et al 2007 kong et al 2018 which enables uv cl2 to be an alternative uv aop to degrade contaminants in water similar to uv cl2 uv nh2cl receives increasing attention recently and has emerged as a new aop owing to its generation of reactive radicals including cl nh2 and oh eqs 24 27 bu et al 2018a uv nh2cl is more complex than uv cl2 because various radicals potentially exist and may play unneglectable roles in its degradation of organic contaminants compared to the commonly used uv h2o2 process uv cl2 and uv nh2cl are advantageous because they have a higher radical production due to their comparable or higher quantum yields and higher molar absorption coefficients table s4 uv clo2 has also been explored lately though its mechanism seems unclear it is suggested that radicals such as oh o cl and clo may be involved tian et al 2020 direct oxidation of icm by conventional oxidants e g cl2 nh2cl clo2 and h2o2 is negligible sichel et al 2011 wang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 tian et al 2020 tian et al tian et al 2020 thus combined uv with these oxidants and conducted an extensive study on their degradation of iopamidol the degradation rate was found to follow the order of uv cl2 uv h2o2 uv nh2cl uv clo2 uv fig 4c similar trend was observed sichel et al 2011 in uv aops both reactive radicals e g oh and rcs and direct uv photolysis can contribute to icm degradation rcs i e cl cl2 and clo rather than oh were demonstrated to be primarily responsible for the enhanced removal of iopamidol and diatrizoate in uv cl2 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 though rcs and contribute approximately equally in uv nh2cl their contribution to icm degradation is substantially less than that of direct uv photolysis wu et al 2019 suggesting that icm oxidation by reactive radicals in uv nh2cl is minor generally increasing the concentration of these oxidants in uv aops increases icm degradation rates due to enhanced formation of reactive radicals tian et al 2020 interestingly reduction in iohexol oxidation by uv h2o2 see discussion on uv h2o2 and ref hu et al 2019a and diatrizoate oxidation by uv nh2cl was observed with increasing oxidant concentrations this is probably because excessive nh2cl scavenges oh eq 28 producing radicals e g nhcl of low oxidation ability ph affects icm degradation in uv aops mainly through speciation and formation of reactive radicals neutral ph tends to favor iopamidol and diatrizoate degradation in uv cl2 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 which conflicts with earlier finding that uv cl2 showed higher reactivity towards contaminant degradation at low phs where oh dominates the reactive radicals for degradation wang et al 2016 the reason for this disparity is uncertain but might be the carbonate radical co3 formed through the reaction of dissolved co2 i e hco3 and at neutral ph kong et al 2018 also rcs contribute significantly to icm degradation in uv cl2 and they are the dominant reactive species at neutral ph kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 although oh and rcs are accountable for contaminant degradation in both uv nh2cl and uv cl2 uv nh2cl is less influenced by ph wu et al 2019 because photolysis of chloramines has little or no ph dependence and thus the concentrations of radicals produced by uv nh2cl are relatively ph independent li and blatchley iii 2009 tian et al 2020 found that slightly alkaline ph was conductive to uv clo2 oxidation of iopamidol and ascribed it to the integrated effects of reactive radicals such as oh o cl and clo degradation of icm by uv aops mainly include deiodination hydroxylation chlorination and h abstraction deiodination of icm leads to the release of i however the following reactions between i and various reactive species can introduce different iodine species in different uv aops and hence affect i dbp formation in subsequent oxidation while uv h2o2 cannot oxidize i to io3 oh might oxidize i to inorganic iodine species other than hoi zhao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 uv cl2 can oxidize i to hoi and further to io3 as substantial amounts of hoi and io3 were observed in uv cl2 oxidation of iopamidol fig 4d the oxidation of i by uv cl2 was probably rapid since the i concentration measured was negligible though a large amount of i was oxidized to io3 this is not without its costs because a high chlorine dose was needed i e 14 2 mg l 1 fig 4d uv nh2cl can oxidize the released i to hoi but not further to io3 making it the worse pre oxidation method tian et al 2020 thus i dbp formation was substantially enhanced after pre oxidation with uv nh2cl wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 only a trace amount of i thms was formed in post disinfection after uv clo2 oxidation of iopamidol which could be ascribed to the low degradation efficiency of icm and the oxidation of i to io3 tian et al 2020 future research needs to confirm this speculation since tian et al did not analyze i and io3 in uv clo2 overall the conversion of iodine in iopamidol to i thms in sequential uv aops and chlorination or chloramination decreased in the order of uv nh2cl uv uv cl2 uv h2o2 uv clo2 suggesting that uv clo2 are better options for controlling i dbps when icm are present in drinking water 4 3 4 outlook although the degradation kinetics of icm in different uv aops and i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection have been exhaustively examined less attention has been paid to the transformation of inorganic iodine i e i hoi and io3 most studies did not manage to analyze them and assumed that the released i from deiodination of icm was the iodine source for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection even though this assumption is generally correct the role of partially deiodinated products generated as intermediates in the degradation of icm is less clear in i dbp formation see 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 section both uv photolysis and uv aops cannot fully mineralize icm and produce a significant amount of lower molecular weight transformation products these intermediates should be more reactive with oxidants than their parent icm not to mention their higher toxicity allard et al 2016 most iodine remains in the partly deiodinated intermediates even when the parent icm are completely transformed thus the fate of organic and inorganic iodine species demands attention also an oxidation strategy that offers complete transformation of iodine in icm to io3 and mineralization of icm is of significant interest since it will eliminate the potential risk of i dbp formation it is also noteworthy that most studies overlooked the structural difference of different icm and the effectiveness of an uv aop process on the oxidation of various icm ionic icm i e diatrizoate and iothalamic acid include a benzene ring with three iodine atoms and a side chain containing a carboxylic acid group while nonionic icm are composed of tri iodinated benzene rings with various side chains that contain polar alcohol groups caschera et al 2016 though they are structurally similar they may behavior differently in the same uv aop process for example diatrizoate tends to be degraded slower than other icm in oh oxidation table s6 therefore future research needs to consider the performance of an uv aop process on the degradation of different icm 4 4 removal of i dbp by uv and uv aops i dbps have been widely detected in drinking water recycled water and wastewater effluents krasner et al 2009 farré et al 2012 dong et al 2019 i dbp formation presents a serious challenge for water engineers due to their high toxicity and regulation the removal of i dbp precursors and the use of advisable disinfection oxidation methods are important strategies to reduce their formation however how to remove them once they are formed is also of great significance especially before distributing the finished water or at the point of entry and point of use brominated thms and haas were shown to be largely degraded by uv irradiation and uv h2o2 nicole et al 1991 jo et al 2011 i thms generally have higher molar absorption coefficients than brominated thms table s1 highlighting the viability of photodegradation of i thm therefore uv photolysis and uv aops have been explored for i dbp degradation 4 4 1 uv irradiation direct uv photolysis can mineralize i dbps and liberate halides i e cl br and i during uv irradiation i thms go through a rapid photodegradation through the cleavage of c i bonds resulting in stepwise deiodination and gradual release of i chlorate bromate and iodate are not formed take chi3 as an example its degradation can be divided into the following reactions eqs 29 35 other i dbps are expected to share similar degradation pathways iodide and formic acid hcooh were confirmed as end products hcooh was a minor product while the reactions to form co eqs 31 33 and 35 were the main photodegradation pathways for chi3 hu et al 2019b uv irradiation was also demonstrated to rapidly degrade diiodoacetamide diacam and iodo haloacetic acids i haas but at high uv fluence xiao et al 2016 hu et al 2019b the removal percentage of 6 i thms at typical uv fluence of 40 and 140 mj cm 2 were mostly less than 10 and 26 respectively xiao et al 2014 the comparatively photo recalcitrant chcl2i and iodoacetic acid ich2cooh which have the lowest molar absorption coefficients among i thms table s1 and i haas were removed less than 5 and 3 35 at 140 mj cm 2 respectively xiao et al 2016 though i dbp concentrations a few hundred µg l 1 higher than those of encountered in water treatment plants a few µg l 1 were spiked in those studies initial i thm concentration showed no noticeable effect on their photodegradation kinetics xiao et al 2014 therefore similar to icm degradation uv irradiation alone is not an advisable method for i dbp removal 4 4 2 uv aops photodegradation of micropollutants by uv aops involves both direct photolysis and indirect photolysis by reactive radicals e g oh cl and so4 uv aops including uv h2o2 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2015 uv cl2 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b and uv s2o8 2 xiao et al 2016 have been explored for i dbp degradation direct oxidation of i dbps e g i thms diacam and i haas by h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 was negligible compared to uv alone uv aops were shown to enhance i dbp photodegradation rates substantially indicating that indirect photolysis played an important role in i dbp photodegradation oh was confirmed by radical scavenging tests to dominate the reactive species for i dbp degradation in both uv h2o2 and uv cl2 while so4 was the dominant reactive species in uv s2o8 2 uv h2o2 produces oh but uv cl2 produces both oh and rcs in order to achieve significant i dbp removal high cl2 dose is thus required in uv cl2 since rcs are not responsible for i dbp oxidation for example 2 6 mg l 1 of h2o2 is often enough in uv h2o2 xiao et al 2015 while uv cl2 requires 10 mg l 1 of cl2 wang et al 2017 this is one important issue associated with uv cl2 that it normally requires a relatively high chlorine dose of 5 10 mg l 1 compared to the 0 2 2 mg l 1 typically used for chlorine disinfection wang et al 2015 uv aops are also able to mineralize i dbps and liberate halides i e cl br and i during uv h2o2 oxidation of chcli2 a good mass balance 95 recovery between the produced halides and the introduced halogens in chcl2i was observed which means that no other organic halogenated end products and inorganic halogen species e g clo3 bro3 and io3 were produced xiao et al 2015 oh may be able to oxidize the liberated i to io3 but probably to a very low extent see section uv o3 and uv h2o2 hu et al 2019b oh oxidation of chi3 is expected to go through deiodination accompanied by the addition of oh at the iodo site eqs 36 and 37 uv s2o8 2 was found to be more efficient than uv h2o2 in ich2cooh degradation because so4 is more reactive than oh with ich2cooh xiao et al 2016 uv s2o8 2 can completely mineralize ich2cooh while uv h2o2 removed 50 of the initial toc there was a good mass balance between the produced i or io3 and the total i in ich2cooh during its degradation by uv s2o8 2 and uv h2o2 suggesting no other iodine species e g hoi and organic iodine were formed uv s2o8 2 oxidized all the liberated i to io3 which seems to be contradictory to the results observed in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm that no io3 was formed see section 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 further efforts are thus needed to improve our understanding of the fate of iodine species in these different reaction systems trace level of io3 0 02 of liberated was produced in uv h2o2 oxidation of ich2cooh confirming the inability of uv h2o2 in transforming i to io3 during uv cl2 oxidation of i dbps i e chi3 and diacam iodine species including i hoi and io3 were all formed wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b the formation of io3 is probably due to the oxidation of i by cl2 5 iodate the fourth iodine source 5 1 iodate in water sources among the dominant iodine species in aquatic environment i e i icm and io3 io3 is nontoxic and stable and has been considered as a desired sink of iodine in drinking water bürgi et al 2001 gong and zhang 2013 io3 concentrations in the range of 0 8 4 2 µg l 1 2 8 6 2 µg l 1 and 6 5 14 6 µg l 1 have been detected in surface ground waters finished drinking water and tap water respectively schwehr and santschi 2003 snyder et al 2005 gong and zhang 2013 io3 has also been detected in estuarine surface waters with concentrations ranging from 4 1 to 23 9 µg l 1 indicating that seawater intrusion in coastal areas is likely to introduce io3 to local water treatment plants schwehr and santschi 2003 i icm and i2 are well documented iodine sources for i dbp formation unexpectedly io3 was recently identified as an alternative iodine source in i thm formation zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a xia et al 2017 this is because of the reductive transformation e g uv irradiation and zero valent iron of io3 to i tian et al 2017a xia et al 2017 tang et al 2021 io3 is thus recognized as the fourth iodine source responsible for i dbp formation therefore special care should also be taken in drinking water treatment when io3 is present 5 2 phototransformation of iodate io3 can easily react with oxidizable substances during which it may undergo the following redox reaction eq 38 the standard reduction potential of io3 i is 1 085 v but decreases to 0 672 v at ph 7 this redox potential makes io3 susceptible to reductive treatment such as zero valent iron e0 0 447 xia et al 2017 and hydrated electron e aq e0 2 9 v produced by uv irradiation of humic acids saunders et al 2012 uv irradiation can also induce the transformation of io3 to i by direct photolysis light absorption transfers an electron from io3 to water molecules in the hydration layer forming a complex eq 39 farkas and klein 1948 this complex can decompose to form io eq 40 which is unstable and would further decompose to i eq 41 farkas and klein 1948 in uv irradiation of io3 i and hoi concentrations were found to increase progressively while io3 concentration deceased partly affirming the above hypothesis zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a xia et al 2018 compared to uv irradiation alone uv h2o2 appears to enhance the transformation of io3 to i presumably due to the reactions between io3 and reactive radicals e g oh o and e aq that may present in uv h2o2 tian et al 2019 the results were quite surprising and counterintuitive because of the presence of strong oxidation radical oh in uv h2o2 this is because oh played a minor part in the uv h2o2 decomposition of io3 which differed greatly from aop degradation mechanisms of most organic pollutants the major contributors for this enhancement were o and e aq both of which have significantly greater reaction rates than oh with io3 tian et al 2019 the release of i in uv pre treatment of io3 creates an intractable issue for subsequent disinfection as we have discussed in section 4 3 subsequent disinfection e g cl2 and nh2cl can oxidize this i to hoi which is notorious for its reaction with nom to form i dbps when 5 100 µm of io3 was spiked in uv pre treatment of nom containing water considerable amounts of i thms were detected in subsequent chlorination and chloramination zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a tian et al 2019 under a practical condition i e uv fluence 50 mg cm 2 nh2cl 5 mgcl2 l doc 5 mgc l and io3 concentration of 17 5 µg l 1 0 17 µg l 1 of chcl2i was formed pointing to the possibility of i dbp formation when applying sequential uv and disinfection treatment of iodate containing water zhang et al 2016 io3 and i naturally coexist in water source schwehr and santschi 2003 gong and zhang 2013 the presence of i was found to enhance the conversion of io3 to ris e g hoi i2 and i3 under uv irradiation and increase i thm formation in subsequent chloramination tang et al 2021 in this mixed io3 i system io3 undergoes both direct photolysis eqs 39 41 and photoreduction by e aq generated by uv irradiation of i eqs 1 4a leading to the formation of more ris than in single io3 or i system therefore when io3 and i coexist in water source uv irradiation should be applied carefully to control i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection 6 conclusions and future perspectives there has been an increasing focus on i dbps in the scientific community and water regulators on account of their high toxicity dong et al 2019 in may 2020 shenzhen china started to regulate i dbps and their essential source iodide and became the first to set definite regulations on i dbps the regulatory limits in drinking water have been set by the regulation bureau of shenzhen at 0 1 mg l 1 for iodide 0 02 mg l 1 for iodoacetic acid and 0 01 mg l 1 for dichloroiodomethane shenzhen 2020 although iodide concentration encountered in drinking water sources is often lower than 0 1 mg l 1 richardson et al 2008 this regulation takes seawater intrusion into serious consideration because shenzhen is a coastal city where seawater intrusion is highly likely this regulation is of exemplary significance since approximately 60 of the world s population lives within 60 km of the coast richardson and kimura 2017 the implementation of these stringent regulations requires advisable trade offs between disinfection and i dbp formation and helps to curb the highest i dbp exposures research and regulations are the drivers of each other hence future studies on in depth elucidation of i dbp precursors formation pathways and effective i dbp abatement in water treatment are urgently needed 6 1 i dbp precursors dissolved organic matter dom is the principal dbp precursors water with different dom characteristics e g humic acid fulvic acid raw water and filtered water differs in dbp formation potentials xia et al 2018 fulvic acid appears to have the highest potential in i thm formation selective removal of dom contents with high i dbp formation potential may be effective and ideal in i dbp control one of the biggest challenges for uv irradiation and uv aops is their alteration of dom producing small molecules that tend to form more dbps in subsequent disinfection therefore more i dbps have been observed in post chloramination after uv irradiation the removal of organic precursors only serves to mitigate i dbp formation but not to eliminate their formation because of the difficulty to completely remove these precursors not to mention its high cost strategic transformation of iodine sources to io3 is thus the ultimate method to surmount the challenge associated with i dbps oxidation of i to io3 by pre oxidation with cl2 and o3 is a feasible strategy to control i dbp formation in subsequent chemical disinfection another challenge of uv irradiation and uv aops is their transformation of io3 to i which acts as the iodine source for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection the presence of io3 does not cause any trouble as long as uv irradiation is avoided the key challenge that lies ahead is the conundrum of iodinated x ray contrast media icm treatment their inherent chemical stability renders them recalcitrant to almost all chemical oxidants disinfectants used in water treatment uv and uv aops are capable of degrading and mineralizing icm to some extent which are characterized by the release of i through deiodination uv o3 and uv cl2 are the only aops that have been shown to oxidize the released i to io3 in a large amount and are thus promising for icm treatment 6 2 formation pathways the reaction of hoi with dom is primarily responsible for i dbp formation the oxidation of i to io3 often produces hoi as a critical intermediate in water treatment the fate transformation and reaction kinetics of these three important iodine species i e i io3 and hoi have been less investigated in uv aops data are primarily available for reactions of these iodine species with common oxidants used in water treatment shin et al 2018 the role of iodine radicals e g i and i2 produced in uv aops treatment of water containing iodine sources is also largely unknown these radicals are highly likely to alter dom transformation and even drive dom halogenation potentially contributing to i dbp formation fig 1 zhang and parker 2018 with the increasing use of uv aops in water reuse desalination and water wastewater treatment more experimental data on transformation of iodine species radicals by uv aops under environmentally relevant conditions are needed to address these significant gaps uv based treatment of icm is also worthy of further research during oxidation of icm by uv aops the majority of the iodine remains as organic iodine in the degradation intermediates and thus only part of the iodine in icm is transformed to io3 because uv aops are often unable to mineralize icm this partial deiodination poses a difficult challenge for post disinfection while attention has seldom been paid to these partly deiodinated intermediates they are essentially important they are not only more toxic but also more reactive towards disinfectants than their parent icm and hence have a better chance to form i dbps in post disinfection therefore uv aops that can completely deiodinate mineralize icm and further oxidize the released i to io3 are urgently needed 6 4 i dbp abatement while removing precursors and mitigating formation pathways can control i dbp formation at the sources i dbps may inevitably form in drinking water treatment and in the distribution systems which necessitates localized i dbp reduction after their formation there are several methods available for localized control of dbps including air stripping boiling uv photodegradation and adsorption air stripping is effective for chloroform due to its high volatility table s1 henry s law constant brominated thms and i thms are less volatile and thus difficult to remove via air stripping tap water is frequently heated or boiled before use e g cooking showering and hot beverages boiling of tap water reduces halogenated dbps due to the combined effects of thermal hydrolysis degradation and volatilization of dbps liu et al 2020a however considering the high boiling points of i dbps and their low volatility table s1 boiling might have limited effects on their abatement particularly iodinated haloacetic acids uv aops degradation and adsorption by activated carbon have been proven to be effective for i dbp removal wang et al 2017 qian et al 2018 however the high installation and operation costs of uv systems at the point of use and point of entry in a single household introduce a high economic barrier to entry since i dbps may form during disinfection uv treatment can be adopted after final disinfection in centralized water treatment facilities i thms are of high hydrophobicity as demonstrated by their high n octanol to water partition coefficients i e log kow table s1 rendering them affinitive towards hydrophobic activated carbon household carbon filters should remove i thms effectively however the removal of iodinated haloacetic acids and other i dbps by adsorption is in question current research predominantly focuses on i thms membrane filtration may be a viable alternative in a household future studies on other emerging i dbps are eagerly

16531,iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps formed in water treatment are of emerging concern due to their high toxicity and the tase and odor problems associated with iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodoacetic acid and dichloroiodomethane are currently regulated in shenzhen china and the ministry of health of the people s republic of china has also been considering regulating i dbps iodide i organoiodine compounds e g iodinated x ray contrast media icm and iodate io3 are the three common iodine sources in aquatic environment that lead to i dbp formation while uv irradiation effectively inactivate a wide range of microorganisms in water it induces the transformation of these iodine sources enabling the formation of i dbps this review focuses on the fate and transformation of these iodine sources in uv based water treatment i e uv irradiation and uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops and the formation of i dbps in post disinfection i released in uv based treatments of icm and can be oxidized in subsequent disinfection to hypoiodous acid hoi which reacts with natural organic matter nom to produce i dbps both uv and uv aops are not able to fully mineralize icm and completely oxidize the released i to except uv o3 results reveal that uv and uv aops are adequate for i dbp degradation but require high uv doses while the ideal i dbp mitigation strategy awaits to be developed understanding their sources and formation pathways aids in informed selections of water treatment processes empowers water suppliers to meet drinking water standards and minimizes consumers exposure to i dbps graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv irradiation uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps iodide iodinated x ray contrast media icm iodate 1 introduction chlorine disinfection is currently the most common disinfection method in drinking water treatment it is a cost effective and efficient approach for inactivating pathogens in water treatment and providing necessary residuals in the distribution system however chlorine can react with the natural and anthropogenic constituents e g natural organic matter nom bromide and iodide in water and inevitably results in the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps with health concerns this chlorine dilemma between inactivation of waterborne pathogens and dbp formation presents an intractable but important challenge for drinking water treatment since the first discovery of trihalomethanes thms in 1974 700 dbps have been identified in literature dong et al 2019 currently only 11 of them are regulated by the u s epa i e 4 thms 5 haloacetic acids haas bromate chlorite in response to the potential health effects of regulated dbps many utilities have opted for alternative disinfection methods such as chloramines chlorine dioxide ozone and ultraviolet uv irradiation however each of these disinfection methods produces its own suite of dbps and sometimes offers more problems than solutions tibbets 1995 sedlak and von gunten 2011 for example though chloramination significantly reduces the formation of regulated dbps it notably enhances the formation of emerging dbps such as iodinated dbps i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 richardson 2003 krasner et al 2006 i dbps are constantly being detected in drinking water with iodo trihalomethanes i thms and iodo haloacetic acids i haas being the most detected chcl2i 0 05 µg l 1 was first detected in chlorinated finished water as early as in 1975 bunn et al 1975 other groups of i dbps i e iodo haloacetamides iodo haloacetonitriles iodo haloaldehydes iodo phenols have also been identified in drinking water dong et al 2019 i dbps have been reported to be more toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 with more chemical standards of i dbps becoming available research on i dbps is accelerated to emerge i thms are known to cause unpleasant taste and odor issues in drinking water hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 cancho et al 2001 odor and taste in drinking water are also of great concern for water suppliers due to the resulting complaints from consumers who often perceive unpleasant odor and taste as potential health risk hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2001 the odor threshold concentration otc values of i thms are significantly lower than those of regulated thms table s1 among i thms an increase in iodine atoms dramatically decreased their otc values with the otc value of chi3 being as low as 0 03 µg l 1 it is highly possible that our drinking water would exceed such threshold since chi3 is often detected in the range of 0 02 8 3 µg l 1 wei et al 2013a 2013b tugulea et al 2018 not to mention that the co existence of the six i thms is more likely to be detected by consumers than the presence of an individual i thm mcdonald et al 2009 in fact up to 25 of bad taste and odor in french drinking waters were estimated to be partly caused by i thms eaux 1993 bichsel and von gunten 1999b such low otc levels of i thms necessitate the optimization of disinfection methods to strategically mitigate their formation and control taste and odor in drinking water treatment i dbps have been detected worldwide at considerable concentrations in drinking water leading to growing concerns in scientific community and the drinking water industry brass et al 1977 hansson et al 1987 cancho et al 2000 plewa et al 2004 krasner et al 2006 plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2013 wei et al 2013a 2013b yang and zhang 2013 luo et al 2014 jeong et al 2015 pan et al 2016 allen et al 2017 tugulea et al 2018 in view of their critical importance several comprehensive reviews have been presented to summarize their occurrence toxicity and formation mechanism in drinking water treatment dong et al 2019 postigo and zonja 2019 li et al 2020a 2020b sengar and vijayanandan 2021 these reviews recapped i dbp formation in oxidative treatments using agents including chlorine chloramines iodine ozone chlorine dioxide potassium permanganate peracetic acid ferrate manganese dioxide lead oxide zero valent iron and peroxides or uv based oxidation processes however the fate of iodine species e g iodide i iondinated x ray contrast media icm and iodate io3 in uv based technologies is largely overlooked and has rarely been reviewed uv irradiation can effectively inactivate a wide range of microorganisms in water without any addition of chemicals and the formation of dbps song et al 2016 the major obstacle associated with uv disinfection is that it cannot maintain a disinfectant residual in the effluents being treated hassen et al 2000 making it necessary to resupply residual disinfectants e g cl2 and nh2cl after uv disinfection in water treatment tian et al 2014 therefore drinking water treatment plants using uv to achieve primary disinfection require a secondary chemical disinfection our recent findings and others have demonstrated that sequential application of uv or uv aops and chemical disinfection could result in the formation of an appreciable amount of i dbps during the treatment of water containing iodine sources raising an increasing issue for uv implemented water treatment facilities in this review we discuss the fate and transformation of iodine species in uv based water treatment we review the interconversion of these iodine species including organoiodine compounds i e icm and i dbps and with a focus on uv induced transformation of iodine sources to i dbps we outline recent progress and suggest fruitful avenues for future research in particularly the control strategies for i dbp formation 2 iodine species in uv based water treatment there are 4 iodine species encountered in water treatment including i organoiodine compounds elementary iodine i2 and io3 during oxidation and disinfection e g cl2 nh2cl clo2 and o3 can be oxidized to reactive hypoiodous acid hoi which then reacts with nom to form i dbps in competing with its further oxidation to io3 during uv and uv aops organoiodine compounds such as icm undergo deiodination and the release of i tian et al 2017b wang et al 2017 hu et al 2019b which acts as the iodine source for i dbp formation in post disinfection iodine based disinfectants i e i2 could also act as an iodine source during iodination of raw source waters smith et al 2010 however it has rarely been applied in full scale water treatment facilities ellis 1991 and thus will not be further discussed transforms to in uv and uv aops through photochemical reduction resulting in the formation of i dbps in subsequent disinfection zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a 2019 overall the fate and transformation of iodine species in uv based water treatment appear to form a cycle and are summarized in fig 1 details will be discussed in the following sections 3 iodide the culprit for i dbp formation 3 1 iodide concentration in water sources i has been notoriously blamed for its potential risk in i dbp formation during disinfection it is the most typical iodine source and naturally presents in source water i concentration in source drinking water in north america was found in the range of 0 4 104 2 µg l 1 median of 10 3 µg l 1 richardson et al 2008 groundwater normally contains 0 01 20 µg l 1 of i ali mohamed and jamali 1989 in a survey across canada highest i level was detected in a groundwater source at 131 36 µg l 1 tugulea et al 2018 a high i level of 200 µg l 1 was measured in mineral water in central europe bichsel and von gunten 1999a i concentration ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 µg l 1 was detected in tap water samples collected from four cities in china gong and zhang 2013 i can be introduced in drinking water by seawater intrusion in coastal regions e g shanghai and shenzhen wei et al 2013a elevated levels of i are expected due to the increasing use of alternative source water including recycled wastewater dong et al 2017 desalinated seawater agus et al 2009 and impaired source water e g shale gas wastewater impacted drinking water supplies parker et al 2014 high i concentration in surface water e g 50 µg l 1 may also occur in arid regions 3 2 transformation of iodide in uv irradiation and uv aops 3 2 1 uv irradiation the presence of i in source drinking water is troublesome due to its high potential in i dbp formation during oxidation uv irradiation at 254 nm can photochemically activate i and transform i to iodine radicals e g i and i2 and eqs 1 8 in supplementary materials rahn 1993 rahn 1997 yeo and choi 2009 exposure of i to uv eq 1 produces a caged complex containing an iodine atom and an electron through a charge transfer eq 2 after that reactions 3 and 4 can occur a back reaction to reform i eq 3 and the breakdown of the caged complex eqs 4a and b in the absence of an electron scavenger the back reaction dominates leading to the recombination of the bulk electrons with iodine atoms to form i therefore uv irradiation of i in pure water and water containing humic acid did not result in any change in i concentration xia et al 2018 in fact the primary challenge associated with uv irradiation of iodide containing drinking water lies in the uv induced alteration of dissolved organic matter which renders it more reactive towards disinfectants leading to enhanced formation of i dbps in post disinfection xia et al 2018 in the presence of an electron scavenger e g o2 n2o and io3 the caged complex breaks down and releases the iodine atom and an hydrated electron eaq eq 4a reactions 5 8 of iodine species will occur and result in the formation of i2 present mainly as hoi in water treatment an iodine anion radical i2 and i3 absorption spectra of i aqueous solutions in uv region show broad electronic bands and are assigned to charge transfer to solvent state during which eaq is rapidly produced eq 4a lehr et al 1999 with a standard reduction potential of 2 9 v eaq is a powerful reductant that reacts with electron scavengers e g o2 eq 4b schwarz 1981 instead of using impractical electron scavengers e g o2 and n2o in water treatment several studies have managed to make use of this eaq for the degradation of various reducible contaminants such as perfluorinated chemicals park et al 2009 hexavalent chromium yeo et al 2012 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma sun et al 2017 and haas bu et al 2018b by treating them as electron scavengers however due to the low i concentration this uv iodide process requires adding i in water and is thus not advisable since i is of significant high risk for i dbp formation during final disinfection another scenario that is worthy of serious consideration is the coexistence of i and io3 in uv irradiation of drinking water i and io3 both have been found in source drinking water see 3 1 and 5 1 with the coexistence of i and io3 io3 acts as an electron scavenger and facilitates the formation of reactive iodine species ris e g hoi i2 i2 and i3 eqs 5 8 rahn 1997 xia et al 2018 though i dbp formation resulted directly from the reaction of these uv induced ris and dissolved organic matter dom is unconfirmed xia et al observed a noticeable improvement in i thm formation in subsequent chloramination xia et al 2018 which might be partly attributable to this unconfirmed reaction fig 1 3 2 2 uv aops uv aops which combines uv irradiation with oxidants e g uv o3 uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv nh2cl produces reactive radicals e g oh cl clo and cl2 these radicals may oxidize i and generate iodine radicals i e i i2 and possibly cli and bri and hoi which can incorporate into dom to form i dbp gao et al 2020 uv o3 and uv cl2 may fully oxidize i to io3 especially uv o3 therefore uv aops oxidation can alter i dbp formation while the oxidation of i has been predominantly studied with common oxidants e g o3 h2o2 cl2 and nh2cl very few investigate uv aops oxidation of iodide containing water uv h2o2 oxidation and subsequent chlorination of iodide containing water did not produce any iodinated haloacetamides hacams chu et al 2014 uv h2o2 might oxidize i to iodine species that did not react with dom to form iodinated hacams other explanations are also possible such as the destruction of hacam precursors in uv h2o2 uv cl2 appears to be improper for treating iodide containing water compared with chlorination alone uc cl2 oxidation produced more i thms gao et al 2020 presumably due to alteration of dom by uv photolysis xia et al 2018 overall uv irradiation and uv aops tend to amend dom significantly and enhance i dbp formation in post disinfection limited data are available and future experiments should address the transformation of i in uv and uv aops and provide a better understanding of their roles in i dbp formation 4 organoiodine compounds icm and i dbps 4 1 occurrence of icm the emerging iodine source icm are another emerging iodine source it was not until 2011 when icm were found to lead to i dbp formation did the scientific community start to pay close attention to these frequently applied compounds for medical imaging in hospitals duirk et al 2011 due to their high hydrophilicity and biochemical stability they are inefficiently removed during wastewater treatment consequently they were ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater wastewater receiving waters e g surface water groundwater and drinking water with the highest concentration of 100 µg l 1 being reported hirsch et al 2000 ternes and hirsch 2000 drewes et al 2001 sacher et al 2001 duirk et al 2011 hence icm are of special concern where wastewater reclamation for potable reuse is implemented drewes et al 2001 schittko et al 2004 tiehm et al 2011 another organoiodine compound that warrants attention is thyroid hormones e g thyroxine and liothyronine they are also iodinated pharmaceuticals that have been detected in wastewater svanfelt et al 2010 but less studied occurrence of icm in different water sources is summarized in table s2 icm such as iopromide iopamidol iomeprol and diatrizoate have been identified in literature it appears that iopromide is the icm being most frequently detected which is inconsistent with an earlier finding that iopamidol was the most frequently detected in source drinking waters duirk et al 2011 the different result is probably because we include a wider range of water sources such as wastewater effluents and surface water e g lake river and creek among the water sources that we collected table s2 highest icm concentrations are mostly found in sewage treatment plant stp influents removal of icm by conventional treatment in stps is limited thus icm concentrations in stp effluents are also high drinking water and its sources also contain icm though at trace levels typically in ng l 1 it should also be noted that all the icm occurrence studies are overwhelmingly conducted in developed countries or in developed area of developing country i e shanghai china the occurrence of icm in other developing areas around the world are widely unknown probably due to the lack of access to advanced analytic instruments similarly the occurrence of i dbps is also rarely documented in developing areas where people may suffer from worse source drinking water and less advanced water treatment technologies therefore international collaborations are urgently needed to deal with this uneven distribution of data and resource 4 2 uv irradiation of icm the employment of advanced treatment processes is often required to remove icm in water and wastewater treatment uv irradiation is an established method for water disinfection hijnen et al 2006 a typical disinfection dose fluence of 40 mj cm 2 is sufficient to eliminate various pathogens and photochemically degrade organic compounds hijnen et al 2006 canonica et al 2008 thus it has been applied for the degradation of icm the direct uv photolysis of a compound in pure water depends mainly on two parameters the decadic molar absorption coefficient ε λ and the quantum yield φ pereira et al 2007 a compound needs the capacity to absorb photons of the incident light to be photolabile the probability that a compound absorbs light at a certain wavelength λ can be measured by ε λ pereira et al 2007 higher ε λ 254 indicates better uv254 irradiation absorption the quantum yield values for icm degradation can be defined by the ratio between the total number of molecules of the icm degraded to the total number of photons absorbed by the solution in the presence of icm pereira et al 2007 they need to be determined experimentally and the φ values measured under medium pressure hg lamp mp uv should be equal to those using low pressure hg lamp lp uv 254 nm canonica et al 2008 the ε λ 254 and φ 254 of icm have been determined and are listed in table s3 allard et al 2016 degradation of icm by direct lp uv photolysis lp uv 254 nm monochromatic follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics i e ln c c0 kt fig 2 a b allard et al 2016 factors including uv fluence initial icm concentration uv light wavelength water matrix and solution ph have been shown to influence their degradation 4 2 1 uv fluence the degradation rates of icm e g iohexol and iopamidol have been shown to increase with uv fluence at lp uv254 fluence of 40 mj cm 2 only 15 removal of iopromide was observed in pure water ph 7 canonica et al 2008 similarly the removal of iohexol was only around 20 at lp uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 while it substantially increased to nearly 100 at an extremely high fluence of 1700 mj cm 2 pereira et al 2007 tian et al and duan et al observed a linear decrease in the concentrations of iopamidol and diatrizoate with the increase of lp uv fluence and intensity respectively fig 2a b tian et al 2014 duan et al 2017 4 2 2 initial concentration the degradation rate constants were reported to be higher at low initial icm concentrations than at high initial icm concentrations including iopamidol and iomeprol doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 this can be ascribed to the greater absorption of the incident photo flux by icm at high initial concentrations thus the absorbed photon flux by the icm under low and high concentration conditions was disproportionate to their initial concentration doll and frimmel 2003 with low initial icm concentration the photon flux can be in excess in equation 9 e is photon energy h is the planck s constant v is the photon s frequency c is the speed of light and λ is the photon s wavelength 4 2 3 wavelength in photolysis a compound first absorbs photons to reach an initial excited state velo gala et al 2014 gao et al 2019 the rate to attain this excited state depends on the photon energy which is inversely proportional to the photon s wavelength eq 9 it is thus rational to consider the impact of wavelength for the optimization of icm degradation in uv photolysis canonica et al found that mp uv 238 334 nm polychromatic was less effective than lp uv 254 nm for iopromide degradation canonica et al 2008 in a recent study conducted by our group using uv leds we found that 265 nm uv leds were more effective than 280 nm uv leds in the direct photolysis of iopamidol gao et al 2019 which should be ascribed to the larger molar absorption coefficient or quantum yield of the iopamidol under 265 nm uv leds intriguingly the combination of 265 nm and 280 nm in a hybrid uv led configuration enhanced iopamidol degradation compared to using 265 nm uv leds or 280 nm uv leds individually this was attributed to the enhancement in the number of photons provided between 265 and 280 nm in the hybrid system fig 2c 4 2 4 nom the presence of nom in water has two contrary effects on photodegradation of contaminants it could either reduce the effective fluence rate and thus photochemical degradation of icm due to inner filtering of uv light by colored nom or increase icm degradation due to an indirect generation of reactive species e g oh from nom photoexcitation pereira et al 2007 canonica et al 2008 borowska et al reported a 12 reduction in iohexol removal in tap water compared to in pure water by mp uv borowska et al 2015 contrarily pereira et al observed that lp uv photolysis rate constant of iohexol was 0 26 min 1 in pure water and increased to 0 35 min 1 in surface water 4 2 mgc l dissolved organic carbon doc pereira et al 2007 uv photolysis of icm with the presence of nom can involve indirect phototransformation producing secondary photo oxidants the enhancement obtained by pereira et al pereira et al 2007 in lp uv photolysis of iohexol was probably because of reactive species e g singlet oxygen superoxide anion h2o2 oh and e αq formed in nom photoexcitation via indirect photolysis which accelerated its removal doll and frimmel 2003 canonica et al 2008 therefore a nom content suitable enough to scavenge those reactive species is required to negatively impact icm degradation by uv photolysis doll and frimmel 2003 interestingly a negligible impact of water samples on lp uv photolysis of iopromide doc 1 7 2 1 mgc l and mp uv photolysis of diatrizoate and iodipamide in tap water was measured by canonica et al 2008 and borowska et al 2015 respectively the insignificant influence of water matrix on uv photolysis of icm might be explained by the fact that their water samples had low doc contents and showed low decrease in effective fluence rate 7 canonica et al 2008 borowska et al 2015 in general the results of the impacts of water matrix on uv photolysis of icm degradation depends on the characteristics of the water matrix and hence further research is warranted 4 2 5 ph ph of water can greatly impact direct photolysis of contaminants because many of their pka values are within or near the ph range of source water pka values influence the distribution of the protonated deprotonated species which may have different absorption properties and quantum yields however ph values of 4 7 and 10 was shown not to affect the absorption properties of 5 icm including iopromide iopamidol iohexol diatrizoic acid and iotalamic acid the pka values of icm are listed in table s3 all these values are not in the ph range typically encountered in water treatment e g 6 9 and thus ph would not impact icm protonation in practical water treatment for example iopamidol did not dissociate in water and remained predominantly nonionized in the ph range of 5 9 tian et al 2014 therefore solution ph has been demonstrated to not impact the degradation rates of iopamidol iohexol and iopromide by uv photolysis and other icm are expected to behave similarly canonica et al 2008 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 4 2 6 deiodination and i dbp formation uv irradiation of icm involves stepwise deiodination of the aromatic ring leading to the generation of deiodinated products and most importantly the release of i which is notorious for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection during photolysis of iopamidol iopromide and iomeprol gradual increase in i concentration and decrease in absorbable organic iodine aoi concentration was observed with increasing uv fluence fig 2d doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 aoi include the remaining icm and partly deiodinated intermediates that contain iodine other iodine species including hoi and i2 were not identified affirming that i is the only inorganic product allard et al 2016 not only the sum of aoi and i but also the total organic carbon toc concentration in the solution remained almost constant throughout the reaction indicating that uv cannot mineralize icm to co2 but transforms them to smaller molecular weight organic products which could be a potential threat for subsequent water treatment processes doll and frimmel 2003 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 for instance acting as precursors for dbp formation in the ensuing disinfection tian et al was the first to study i dbp formation in sequential treatment of icm with uv and chemical disinfection i e cl2 nh2cl and clo2 increasing uv fluence enhanced i dbp formation e g chcl2i chcli2 chi3 and ci3cooh in post disinfection tian et al 2014 this confirms our speculation that the released i in uv photolysis of icm e g iopamidol and iopromide can be oxidized in post disinfection to hoi which reacts with the organic products produced during uv degradation of icm to form i dbps fig 1 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 the concentration of i dbps represented merely a small fraction of the aoi measured allard et al 2016 signifying that other emerging iodinated byproducts were present at appreciable levels and warrant our attention tian et al conducted the experiments in the absence of nom to demonstrate that the intermediates formed in uv degradation of iopamidol can serve as dbp precursors in post disinfection tian et al 2014 allard et al conducted similar experiments with the presence of nom allard et al 2016 and found slightly decrease in uv degradation of iopromide due to uv light absorption by nom however i thm formation i e chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 was enhanced in subsequent disinfection i e hocl and nh2cl owing to more dbp precursors provided by nom although icm themselves are nontoxic their uv photo degradation intermediates were demonstrated to be of significant toxicity not to mention the i dbps formed in post disinfection allard et al 2016 therefore special attention needs to be paid to the sequential application of uv and post disinfection when icm are present in water source 4 2 7 outlook uv photolysis at the typical fluence levels near that used for disinfection 40 140 mj cm 2 alone is ineffective for the removal of icm present in drinking water to achieve significant icm destruction higher fluence levels or a combination of uv with other advanced oxidation processes is hence required it should also be noted that most studies in literature investigated one icm at a time making the comparation among different icm difficult however source water generally contains more than one icm table s2 as an emerging research area a systematic investigation of uv photolysis comparing various icm and influencing factors would provide more accurate information and practical guidelines for water treatment facilities 4 3 degradation of icm by uv aops uv aops combining uv irradiation with various oxidants e g uv o3 uv h2o2 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv persulfate uv s2o8 2 are attractive and emerging approaches for the removal of various organic contaminants the active radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh standard redox potential of 2 4 2 7 v at acidic ph and 1 9 2 0 at alkaline ph chlorine radical cl 2 4 v amino radical nh2 and sulfate radical so4 2 5 3 1 v produced in these uv aops are found to be of high standard redox potentials and promising for the destruction of icm fang and shang 2012 zhao et al 2019 4 3 1 uv o3 and uv h2o2 during uv irradiation o3 and h2o2 are commonly added to enhance contaminant elimination efficiency due to their absorption of uv light and the formation of table s4 uv photolysis of o3 in water produces h2o2 which subsequently reacts with uv irradiation or o3 to form oh eqs 10 11 gong et al 2008 uv o3 oxidation of contaminants is hence a synergistic effect of several individual reactions including direct ozonation direct photolysis and oh oxidation while the dominant mechanism of contaminant destruction in uv h2o2 is oh mediated advanced oxidation ionic icm i e diatrizoate was found to be highly recalcitrant to o3 uv photolysis and uv o3 though its removal slowly increased with the increase of o3 and uv fluence table s5 and fig 2b ternes et al 2003 duan et al 2017 uv photolysis alone at a high uv fluence of 160 mj cm 2 removed only 38 of diatrizoate while o3 dose of 15 mg l 1 removed merely 14 the combination uv o3 with uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 slightly improved its degradation compared with o3 on the contrary o3 seems to be efficacious for the degradation of all non ionic icms i e iopamidol iopromide and iomeprol so that uv o3 does not improve their removal table s5 uv o3 is the less studied uv aops for icm degradation more research is hence needed to investigate its icm removal since the results in literature cannot provide a clear answer for its effectiveness it has to be noted that the high o3 doses of 5 15 mg l 1 was applied to the wastewater effluent with a high doc content of 23 0 mgc l in the study by ternes et al ternes et al 2003 the reaction of o3 with iopromide was reported huber et al 2003 to be very slow in pure water and the degradation of iopromide in ozonation of drinking water seems not as effective as in ternes et al table s5 ternes et al 2003 this may be explained by the fact that high iopromide concentration iopromide 0 395 5 µg l 1 was spiked huber et al 2003 which is about 2 magnitude higher than icm levels typically detected in water sources table s2 in a drinking water treatment plant with o3 dose of 1 mg l 1 and 4 6 min contact time ozonation removed averagely only 30 of the non ionic icm i e iomeprol iopromide iohexol and iopamidol whereas it cannot eliminate ionic diatrizoic acid seitz et al 2006 therefore we conclude that o3 is unable to degrade icms to a large extent in drinking water treatment during uv o3 degradation of iopromide i and io3 were identified as the main degradation products fig 3 a with concentration of io3 being substantially higher than that of io3 sona et al 2006 implying that the released i from deiodination was immediately oxidized to io3 other iodine containing metabolites were detected as well therefore uv o3 is promising for non ionic icm removal in especial the oxidation of i to io3 which reduces the potential risk of i dbp formation in post disinfection degradation of icm e g diatrizoate and iohexol by h2o2 was found to be negligible duan et al 2017 hu et al 2019a thus uv h2o2 has been applied for icm oxidation using tert butanol ethanol or methanol as oh scavengers it was confirmed that oh was the major contributor for icm i e iohexol and diatrizoate oxidation and direct uv photolysis was negligible in uv h2o2 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a compared to uv alone uv h2o2 slightly improved the degradation of iopromide chu et al 2011 iopamidol fig 3c and diatrizoate figs 2b and 3d duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 kong et al 2018 while retarded the degradation of iohexol fig 3e f pereira et al 2007 hu et al 2019a gradual increase in h2o2 concentration in uv h2o2 increased iopamidol degradation tian et al 2020 while decreased iohexol degradation fig 3f signifying that different icm may react differently toward oxidation although more h2o2 produces more oh excess h2o2 can scavenge oh to form less reactive species eqs 12 and 13 hu et al 2019a besides excess h2o2 competes with icm for light flux in uv h2o2 oxidation screening effect also worth mentioning is the consumption of oh by a catalytic cycle of oxidation of the released i to iodine hoi hoi being the dominant species in water treatment and the fast reduction of hoi by h2o2 back to i jeong et al 2010 shin et al 2020 this also explains why uv h2o2 oxidation of icm does not induce io3 formation fig 3b uv h2o2 is also unlikely to oxidize i to io3 in terms of production uv intensity seems to play a more important role than h2o2 concentration with the increase of uv intensity the degradation rate of iopamidol showed a linear increase resulting from more oh generated tian et al 2020 nevertheless the use of h2o2 decreased the uv fluence needed to remove icm for example with the addition of 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 uv fluence was reduced from 120 to 108 mj cm 2 from 397 to 360 mj cm 2 from 794 to 720 mj cm 2 for 50 90 and 99 removal of iohexol respectively pereira et al 2007 the change of ph insignificantly influences uv h2o2 degradation of icm including iopamidol kong et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 diatrizoate kong et al 2018 and iohexol hu et al 2019a which is probably because the generation of oh in uv h2o2 is independent of solution ph eq 10 and icm dissociation is not impacted by solution ph typically encountered in water treatment pka table s3 zhao et al 2019 it should also be mentioned that only 10 iohexol was degraded at uv fluence of 40 mj cm 2 and 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 pereira et al 2007 affirming that uv h2o2 with typical doses applied in drinking water treatment is incompetent to tackle icm another downside of uv h2o2 is that it cannot further oxidize the released i in deiodination to io3 and this i is the culprit for i dbp formation in post disinfection fig 3b kong et al 2018 shin et al 2020 significant enhancement in chi3 formation has been observed in post chlorination of iopamidol pre treated with uv h2o2 zhao et al 2019 which was ascribed to the oxidation of i to hoi in post disinfection 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 another oxidant that is receiving increasing attention in uv aops is persulfate anion s2o8 2 uv activation of can generate sulfate radical so4 eq 14 which has been proven effective in oxidative destruction of various emerging contaminants including endocrine disruption compounds drugs perfluorinated compounds and algal toxins fang and shang 2012 oh can also be produced when so4 reacts with water or with oh under alkaline conditions eqs 15 and 16 xie et al 2015 sulfate anion is generated as the end product which is not considered to be a pollutant being a powerful oxidant so4 has been identified as a promising method for icm destruction chan et al 2010 duan et al 2017 similar to h2o2 degradation of icm e g diatrizoate iopamidol and iohexol by s2o8 2 oxidation alone is negligible fig 3e zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a uv activation of s2o8 2 strikingly accelerates the degradation of icm including iopromide chan et al 2010 diatrizoate duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 iopamidol zhao et al 2019 and iohexol hu et al 2019a dong et al 2021 uv photolysis oh and so4 were confirmed by radical scavenging tests to contribute to icm degradation in uv s2o8 2 hu et al 2019a with so4 being the dominant reactive species zhou et al 2017 so4 reacts with organic contaminants mainly via electron transfer which makes it more selective than oh most studies investigated uv s2o8 2 using uv h2o2 as a reference and found that uv s2o8 2 was significantly more effective in icm destruction than uv h2o2 under neutral conditions figs 2b and 3e table s6 this can be attributed to two factors one is the higher light absorption by s2o8 2 than h2o2 table s4 resulting in higher production rate of reactive radicals in uv s2o8 2 than in uv h2o2 another reason is that the self scavenging of so4 by s2o8 2 in uv s2o8 2 is much lower than that of oh by h2o2 in uv h2o2 xiao et al 2016 iopromide was the first icm that was subjected to uv s2o8 2 oxidation chan et al 2010 its degradation was enhanced with increasing uv intensity and persulfate concentration similar results were also observed in the degradation of diatrizoate and iohexol fig 4 a b duan et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a with the increase of s2o8 2 from 100 to 500 µm a linear increase in the degradation rate constant of iohexol in uv s2o8 2 oxidation was observed fig 4b insert this indicates that increase in s2o8 2 can lead to a proportional increase in the generation of so4 and oh of note is that the diatrizoate degradation rate was notably rapid in the first 10 20 min afterwards it was retarded figs 2b and 3a this deceleration in diatrizoate oxidation is ascribable to the formation of degradation products which may compete with s2o8 2 for light flux and with diatrizoate for further reaction with so4 zhou et al 2017 icm degradation by uv s2o8 2 slightly decreased with increasing ph chan et al 2010 however ph in the circumneutral range e g 6 9 merely influenced icm degradation further increase in ph 9 can lead to decline in icm degradation this can partly be explained by the formation of oh eqs 15 and 16 which is less reactive than so4 toward icm table s6 it is also likely that alkaline ph activates s2o8 2 decomposition eq 17 which yields only one so4 per 2 persulfate molecules at much lower rate than that of uv activated s2o8 2 eq 14 in addition it is worth noting that solution ph decreases concomitantly as uv s2o8 2 degrades icm probably due to the h being generated as a consequence of so4 scavenging eq 15 and the formation of acidic species chan et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 other influencing factors such as temperature common ions and nom in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm have also been investigated uv s2o8 2 degradation of iohexol increased with increasing temperature from 20 to 35 c because higher temperatures tend to produce more so4 zhou et al 2017 the presence of common ions e g k ca mg2 nh4 and so4 2 in water did not affect uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iohexol while some cations including cl and hco3 were found to negatively impact icm degradation in uv s2o8 2 especially when they are present at high concentrations in several mm range zhou et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 this inhibitory effect caused by cl and hco3 can mostly be attributable to their reactions with so4 and oh generating secondary radicals e g cl cloh and co3 that are less reactive with organic compounds than so4 and oh interestingly both cl and hco3 merely retarded uv h2o2 degradation of iopamidol zhao et al 2019 probably because they have no uv 254 absorption at low concentrations 100 mg l 1 xiao et al 2014 also cl does not scavenge oh zhang et al 2018 in general nom shows adverse impacts on the degradation of icm zhao et al 2019 nom can absorb uv light and thus act as inner filter to reduce degradation rate of icm it can also rapidly react with so4 and oh leading to the consumption of these reactive radicals degradation rates of iopamidol by uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 were both reduced with the presence of nom zhao et al 2019 compared with uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 degradation rate of iopadmiol showed much more significant reduction implying that uv s2o8 2 is more sensitive to nom likely resulting from the higher reactivity of so4 with some organic compounds than that of oh unfortunately in uv s2o8 2 degradation of icm the liberated i is transformed to hoi but not to io3 zhao et al 2019 measured considerable amounts of i and hoi in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iopamidol while was negligible i was confirmed to be oxidized to hoi without further transformation to io3 in a carbon nanotube activated s2o8 2 system guan et al 2017 io3 is often the desired sink of iodine while hoi is infamous for its reaction with nom to form i dbps the application of uv s2o8 2 in icm oxidation is thus of serious concern as it turns out chi3 was detected in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of iohexol and its concentration increased with increasing initial s2o8 2 concentration hu et al 2019a which should be ascribed to the reaction of hoi and degradation intermediates wang et al 2019 it should also be noted that i dbps e g chcli2 chcl2i chi3 and ich2cooh have been detected in subsequent chlorination followed by pre oxidation with uv s2o8 2 of icm i dbps are formed through the reaction of hoi and intermediates produced by uv s2o8 2 degradation of icm this hoi is produced through three pathways one is produced in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm second one is the oxidation of the released i by subsequent chlorination the third one is chlorination of the partly deiodinated intermediates fig 1 the last one is highly likely because the majority of the iodine atoms in icm were found to remain as organic iodine after oxidation wang et al 2019 this is particularly worrisome since these organic iodine containing intermediates are as problematic as i in post disinfection not to mention that they are more reactive than their parent icm with oxidants also noteworthy most studied were conducted with extremely high concentrations of icm several µm that were intentionally spiked into water matrix and substantially higher than those in raw water table s2 hence further research is needed to address uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm at environmental relevant concentrations however since uv s2o8 2 is not able to oxidize the released i to io3 it is thus not recommended for icm degradation in combination with subsequent disinfection 4 3 3 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv clo2 both uv and chlorine are widely used for disinfection the use of chlorine in conjunction with uv light i e uv cl2 has been developed to overcome the disadvantage of each process uv produces no disinfectant residual while chlorination forms dbps exposure of cl2 to uv irradiation produces oh and reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl clo and cl2 eqs 18 23 and 27 feng et al 2007 kong et al 2018 which enables uv cl2 to be an alternative uv aop to degrade contaminants in water similar to uv cl2 uv nh2cl receives increasing attention recently and has emerged as a new aop owing to its generation of reactive radicals including cl nh2 and oh eqs 24 27 bu et al 2018a uv nh2cl is more complex than uv cl2 because various radicals potentially exist and may play unneglectable roles in its degradation of organic contaminants compared to the commonly used uv h2o2 process uv cl2 and uv nh2cl are advantageous because they have a higher radical production due to their comparable or higher quantum yields and higher molar absorption coefficients table s4 uv clo2 has also been explored lately though its mechanism seems unclear it is suggested that radicals such as oh o cl and clo may be involved tian et al 2020 direct oxidation of icm by conventional oxidants e g cl2 nh2cl clo2 and h2o2 is negligible sichel et al 2011 wang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 tian et al 2020 tian et al tian et al 2020 thus combined uv with these oxidants and conducted an extensive study on their degradation of iopamidol the degradation rate was found to follow the order of uv cl2 uv h2o2 uv nh2cl uv clo2 uv fig 4c similar trend was observed sichel et al 2011 in uv aops both reactive radicals e g oh and rcs and direct uv photolysis can contribute to icm degradation rcs i e cl cl2 and clo rather than oh were demonstrated to be primarily responsible for the enhanced removal of iopamidol and diatrizoate in uv cl2 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 though rcs and contribute approximately equally in uv nh2cl their contribution to icm degradation is substantially less than that of direct uv photolysis wu et al 2019 suggesting that icm oxidation by reactive radicals in uv nh2cl is minor generally increasing the concentration of these oxidants in uv aops increases icm degradation rates due to enhanced formation of reactive radicals tian et al 2020 interestingly reduction in iohexol oxidation by uv h2o2 see discussion on uv h2o2 and ref hu et al 2019a and diatrizoate oxidation by uv nh2cl was observed with increasing oxidant concentrations this is probably because excessive nh2cl scavenges oh eq 28 producing radicals e g nhcl of low oxidation ability ph affects icm degradation in uv aops mainly through speciation and formation of reactive radicals neutral ph tends to favor iopamidol and diatrizoate degradation in uv cl2 kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 which conflicts with earlier finding that uv cl2 showed higher reactivity towards contaminant degradation at low phs where oh dominates the reactive radicals for degradation wang et al 2016 the reason for this disparity is uncertain but might be the carbonate radical co3 formed through the reaction of dissolved co2 i e hco3 and at neutral ph kong et al 2018 also rcs contribute significantly to icm degradation in uv cl2 and they are the dominant reactive species at neutral ph kong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 although oh and rcs are accountable for contaminant degradation in both uv nh2cl and uv cl2 uv nh2cl is less influenced by ph wu et al 2019 because photolysis of chloramines has little or no ph dependence and thus the concentrations of radicals produced by uv nh2cl are relatively ph independent li and blatchley iii 2009 tian et al 2020 found that slightly alkaline ph was conductive to uv clo2 oxidation of iopamidol and ascribed it to the integrated effects of reactive radicals such as oh o cl and clo degradation of icm by uv aops mainly include deiodination hydroxylation chlorination and h abstraction deiodination of icm leads to the release of i however the following reactions between i and various reactive species can introduce different iodine species in different uv aops and hence affect i dbp formation in subsequent oxidation while uv h2o2 cannot oxidize i to io3 oh might oxidize i to inorganic iodine species other than hoi zhao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 uv cl2 can oxidize i to hoi and further to io3 as substantial amounts of hoi and io3 were observed in uv cl2 oxidation of iopamidol fig 4d the oxidation of i by uv cl2 was probably rapid since the i concentration measured was negligible though a large amount of i was oxidized to io3 this is not without its costs because a high chlorine dose was needed i e 14 2 mg l 1 fig 4d uv nh2cl can oxidize the released i to hoi but not further to io3 making it the worse pre oxidation method tian et al 2020 thus i dbp formation was substantially enhanced after pre oxidation with uv nh2cl wu et al 2019 tian et al 2020 only a trace amount of i thms was formed in post disinfection after uv clo2 oxidation of iopamidol which could be ascribed to the low degradation efficiency of icm and the oxidation of i to io3 tian et al 2020 future research needs to confirm this speculation since tian et al did not analyze i and io3 in uv clo2 overall the conversion of iodine in iopamidol to i thms in sequential uv aops and chlorination or chloramination decreased in the order of uv nh2cl uv uv cl2 uv h2o2 uv clo2 suggesting that uv clo2 are better options for controlling i dbps when icm are present in drinking water 4 3 4 outlook although the degradation kinetics of icm in different uv aops and i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection have been exhaustively examined less attention has been paid to the transformation of inorganic iodine i e i hoi and io3 most studies did not manage to analyze them and assumed that the released i from deiodination of icm was the iodine source for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection even though this assumption is generally correct the role of partially deiodinated products generated as intermediates in the degradation of icm is less clear in i dbp formation see 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 section both uv photolysis and uv aops cannot fully mineralize icm and produce a significant amount of lower molecular weight transformation products these intermediates should be more reactive with oxidants than their parent icm not to mention their higher toxicity allard et al 2016 most iodine remains in the partly deiodinated intermediates even when the parent icm are completely transformed thus the fate of organic and inorganic iodine species demands attention also an oxidation strategy that offers complete transformation of iodine in icm to io3 and mineralization of icm is of significant interest since it will eliminate the potential risk of i dbp formation it is also noteworthy that most studies overlooked the structural difference of different icm and the effectiveness of an uv aop process on the oxidation of various icm ionic icm i e diatrizoate and iothalamic acid include a benzene ring with three iodine atoms and a side chain containing a carboxylic acid group while nonionic icm are composed of tri iodinated benzene rings with various side chains that contain polar alcohol groups caschera et al 2016 though they are structurally similar they may behavior differently in the same uv aop process for example diatrizoate tends to be degraded slower than other icm in oh oxidation table s6 therefore future research needs to consider the performance of an uv aop process on the degradation of different icm 4 4 removal of i dbp by uv and uv aops i dbps have been widely detected in drinking water recycled water and wastewater effluents krasner et al 2009 farré et al 2012 dong et al 2019 i dbp formation presents a serious challenge for water engineers due to their high toxicity and regulation the removal of i dbp precursors and the use of advisable disinfection oxidation methods are important strategies to reduce their formation however how to remove them once they are formed is also of great significance especially before distributing the finished water or at the point of entry and point of use brominated thms and haas were shown to be largely degraded by uv irradiation and uv h2o2 nicole et al 1991 jo et al 2011 i thms generally have higher molar absorption coefficients than brominated thms table s1 highlighting the viability of photodegradation of i thm therefore uv photolysis and uv aops have been explored for i dbp degradation 4 4 1 uv irradiation direct uv photolysis can mineralize i dbps and liberate halides i e cl br and i during uv irradiation i thms go through a rapid photodegradation through the cleavage of c i bonds resulting in stepwise deiodination and gradual release of i chlorate bromate and iodate are not formed take chi3 as an example its degradation can be divided into the following reactions eqs 29 35 other i dbps are expected to share similar degradation pathways iodide and formic acid hcooh were confirmed as end products hcooh was a minor product while the reactions to form co eqs 31 33 and 35 were the main photodegradation pathways for chi3 hu et al 2019b uv irradiation was also demonstrated to rapidly degrade diiodoacetamide diacam and iodo haloacetic acids i haas but at high uv fluence xiao et al 2016 hu et al 2019b the removal percentage of 6 i thms at typical uv fluence of 40 and 140 mj cm 2 were mostly less than 10 and 26 respectively xiao et al 2014 the comparatively photo recalcitrant chcl2i and iodoacetic acid ich2cooh which have the lowest molar absorption coefficients among i thms table s1 and i haas were removed less than 5 and 3 35 at 140 mj cm 2 respectively xiao et al 2016 though i dbp concentrations a few hundred µg l 1 higher than those of encountered in water treatment plants a few µg l 1 were spiked in those studies initial i thm concentration showed no noticeable effect on their photodegradation kinetics xiao et al 2014 therefore similar to icm degradation uv irradiation alone is not an advisable method for i dbp removal 4 4 2 uv aops photodegradation of micropollutants by uv aops involves both direct photolysis and indirect photolysis by reactive radicals e g oh cl and so4 uv aops including uv h2o2 xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2015 uv cl2 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b and uv s2o8 2 xiao et al 2016 have been explored for i dbp degradation direct oxidation of i dbps e g i thms diacam and i haas by h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 was negligible compared to uv alone uv aops were shown to enhance i dbp photodegradation rates substantially indicating that indirect photolysis played an important role in i dbp photodegradation oh was confirmed by radical scavenging tests to dominate the reactive species for i dbp degradation in both uv h2o2 and uv cl2 while so4 was the dominant reactive species in uv s2o8 2 uv h2o2 produces oh but uv cl2 produces both oh and rcs in order to achieve significant i dbp removal high cl2 dose is thus required in uv cl2 since rcs are not responsible for i dbp oxidation for example 2 6 mg l 1 of h2o2 is often enough in uv h2o2 xiao et al 2015 while uv cl2 requires 10 mg l 1 of cl2 wang et al 2017 this is one important issue associated with uv cl2 that it normally requires a relatively high chlorine dose of 5 10 mg l 1 compared to the 0 2 2 mg l 1 typically used for chlorine disinfection wang et al 2015 uv aops are also able to mineralize i dbps and liberate halides i e cl br and i during uv h2o2 oxidation of chcli2 a good mass balance 95 recovery between the produced halides and the introduced halogens in chcl2i was observed which means that no other organic halogenated end products and inorganic halogen species e g clo3 bro3 and io3 were produced xiao et al 2015 oh may be able to oxidize the liberated i to io3 but probably to a very low extent see section uv o3 and uv h2o2 hu et al 2019b oh oxidation of chi3 is expected to go through deiodination accompanied by the addition of oh at the iodo site eqs 36 and 37 uv s2o8 2 was found to be more efficient than uv h2o2 in ich2cooh degradation because so4 is more reactive than oh with ich2cooh xiao et al 2016 uv s2o8 2 can completely mineralize ich2cooh while uv h2o2 removed 50 of the initial toc there was a good mass balance between the produced i or io3 and the total i in ich2cooh during its degradation by uv s2o8 2 and uv h2o2 suggesting no other iodine species e g hoi and organic iodine were formed uv s2o8 2 oxidized all the liberated i to io3 which seems to be contradictory to the results observed in uv s2o8 2 oxidation of icm that no io3 was formed see section 4 3 2 uv s2o8 2 further efforts are thus needed to improve our understanding of the fate of iodine species in these different reaction systems trace level of io3 0 02 of liberated was produced in uv h2o2 oxidation of ich2cooh confirming the inability of uv h2o2 in transforming i to io3 during uv cl2 oxidation of i dbps i e chi3 and diacam iodine species including i hoi and io3 were all formed wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b the formation of io3 is probably due to the oxidation of i by cl2 5 iodate the fourth iodine source 5 1 iodate in water sources among the dominant iodine species in aquatic environment i e i icm and io3 io3 is nontoxic and stable and has been considered as a desired sink of iodine in drinking water bürgi et al 2001 gong and zhang 2013 io3 concentrations in the range of 0 8 4 2 µg l 1 2 8 6 2 µg l 1 and 6 5 14 6 µg l 1 have been detected in surface ground waters finished drinking water and tap water respectively schwehr and santschi 2003 snyder et al 2005 gong and zhang 2013 io3 has also been detected in estuarine surface waters with concentrations ranging from 4 1 to 23 9 µg l 1 indicating that seawater intrusion in coastal areas is likely to introduce io3 to local water treatment plants schwehr and santschi 2003 i icm and i2 are well documented iodine sources for i dbp formation unexpectedly io3 was recently identified as an alternative iodine source in i thm formation zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a xia et al 2017 this is because of the reductive transformation e g uv irradiation and zero valent iron of io3 to i tian et al 2017a xia et al 2017 tang et al 2021 io3 is thus recognized as the fourth iodine source responsible for i dbp formation therefore special care should also be taken in drinking water treatment when io3 is present 5 2 phototransformation of iodate io3 can easily react with oxidizable substances during which it may undergo the following redox reaction eq 38 the standard reduction potential of io3 i is 1 085 v but decreases to 0 672 v at ph 7 this redox potential makes io3 susceptible to reductive treatment such as zero valent iron e0 0 447 xia et al 2017 and hydrated electron e aq e0 2 9 v produced by uv irradiation of humic acids saunders et al 2012 uv irradiation can also induce the transformation of io3 to i by direct photolysis light absorption transfers an electron from io3 to water molecules in the hydration layer forming a complex eq 39 farkas and klein 1948 this complex can decompose to form io eq 40 which is unstable and would further decompose to i eq 41 farkas and klein 1948 in uv irradiation of io3 i and hoi concentrations were found to increase progressively while io3 concentration deceased partly affirming the above hypothesis zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a xia et al 2018 compared to uv irradiation alone uv h2o2 appears to enhance the transformation of io3 to i presumably due to the reactions between io3 and reactive radicals e g oh o and e aq that may present in uv h2o2 tian et al 2019 the results were quite surprising and counterintuitive because of the presence of strong oxidation radical oh in uv h2o2 this is because oh played a minor part in the uv h2o2 decomposition of io3 which differed greatly from aop degradation mechanisms of most organic pollutants the major contributors for this enhancement were o and e aq both of which have significantly greater reaction rates than oh with io3 tian et al 2019 the release of i in uv pre treatment of io3 creates an intractable issue for subsequent disinfection as we have discussed in section 4 3 subsequent disinfection e g cl2 and nh2cl can oxidize this i to hoi which is notorious for its reaction with nom to form i dbps when 5 100 µm of io3 was spiked in uv pre treatment of nom containing water considerable amounts of i thms were detected in subsequent chlorination and chloramination zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a tian et al 2019 under a practical condition i e uv fluence 50 mg cm 2 nh2cl 5 mgcl2 l doc 5 mgc l and io3 concentration of 17 5 µg l 1 0 17 µg l 1 of chcl2i was formed pointing to the possibility of i dbp formation when applying sequential uv and disinfection treatment of iodate containing water zhang et al 2016 io3 and i naturally coexist in water source schwehr and santschi 2003 gong and zhang 2013 the presence of i was found to enhance the conversion of io3 to ris e g hoi i2 and i3 under uv irradiation and increase i thm formation in subsequent chloramination tang et al 2021 in this mixed io3 i system io3 undergoes both direct photolysis eqs 39 41 and photoreduction by e aq generated by uv irradiation of i eqs 1 4a leading to the formation of more ris than in single io3 or i system therefore when io3 and i coexist in water source uv irradiation should be applied carefully to control i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection 6 conclusions and future perspectives there has been an increasing focus on i dbps in the scientific community and water regulators on account of their high toxicity dong et al 2019 in may 2020 shenzhen china started to regulate i dbps and their essential source iodide and became the first to set definite regulations on i dbps the regulatory limits in drinking water have been set by the regulation bureau of shenzhen at 0 1 mg l 1 for iodide 0 02 mg l 1 for iodoacetic acid and 0 01 mg l 1 for dichloroiodomethane shenzhen 2020 although iodide concentration encountered in drinking water sources is often lower than 0 1 mg l 1 richardson et al 2008 this regulation takes seawater intrusion into serious consideration because shenzhen is a coastal city where seawater intrusion is highly likely this regulation is of exemplary significance since approximately 60 of the world s population lives within 60 km of the coast richardson and kimura 2017 the implementation of these stringent regulations requires advisable trade offs between disinfection and i dbp formation and helps to curb the highest i dbp exposures research and regulations are the drivers of each other hence future studies on in depth elucidation of i dbp precursors formation pathways and effective i dbp abatement in water treatment are urgently needed 6 1 i dbp precursors dissolved organic matter dom is the principal dbp precursors water with different dom characteristics e g humic acid fulvic acid raw water and filtered water differs in dbp formation potentials xia et al 2018 fulvic acid appears to have the highest potential in i thm formation selective removal of dom contents with high i dbp formation potential may be effective and ideal in i dbp control one of the biggest challenges for uv irradiation and uv aops is their alteration of dom producing small molecules that tend to form more dbps in subsequent disinfection therefore more i dbps have been observed in post chloramination after uv irradiation the removal of organic precursors only serves to mitigate i dbp formation but not to eliminate their formation because of the difficulty to completely remove these precursors not to mention its high cost strategic transformation of iodine sources to io3 is thus the ultimate method to surmount the challenge associated with i dbps oxidation of i to io3 by pre oxidation with cl2 and o3 is a feasible strategy to control i dbp formation in subsequent chemical disinfection another challenge of uv irradiation and uv aops is their transformation of io3 to i which acts as the iodine source for i dbp formation in subsequent disinfection the presence of io3 does not cause any trouble as long as uv irradiation is avoided the key challenge that lies ahead is the conundrum of iodinated x ray contrast media icm treatment their inherent chemical stability renders them recalcitrant to almost all chemical oxidants disinfectants used in water treatment uv and uv aops are capable of degrading and mineralizing icm to some extent which are characterized by the release of i through deiodination uv o3 and uv cl2 are the only aops that have been shown to oxidize the released i to io3 in a large amount and are thus promising for icm treatment 6 2 formation pathways the reaction of hoi with dom is primarily responsible for i dbp formation the oxidation of i to io3 often produces hoi as a critical intermediate in water treatment the fate transformation and reaction kinetics of these three important iodine species i e i io3 and hoi have been less investigated in uv aops data are primarily available for reactions of these iodine species with common oxidants used in water treatment shin et al 2018 the role of iodine radicals e g i and i2 produced in uv aops treatment of water containing iodine sources is also largely unknown these radicals are highly likely to alter dom transformation and even drive dom halogenation potentially contributing to i dbp formation fig 1 zhang and parker 2018 with the increasing use of uv aops in water reuse desalination and water wastewater treatment more experimental data on transformation of iodine species radicals by uv aops under environmentally relevant conditions are needed to address these significant gaps uv based treatment of icm is also worthy of further research during oxidation of icm by uv aops the majority of the iodine remains as organic iodine in the degradation intermediates and thus only part of the iodine in icm is transformed to io3 because uv aops are often unable to mineralize icm this partial deiodination poses a difficult challenge for post disinfection while attention has seldom been paid to these partly deiodinated intermediates they are essentially important they are not only more toxic but also more reactive towards disinfectants than their parent icm and hence have a better chance to form i dbps in post disinfection therefore uv aops that can completely deiodinate mineralize icm and further oxidize the released i to io3 are urgently needed 6 4 i dbp abatement while removing precursors and mitigating formation pathways can control i dbp formation at the sources i dbps may inevitably form in drinking water treatment and in the distribution systems which necessitates localized i dbp reduction after their formation there are several methods available for localized control of dbps including air stripping boiling uv photodegradation and adsorption air stripping is effective for chloroform due to its high volatility table s1 henry s law constant brominated thms and i thms are less volatile and thus difficult to remove via air stripping tap water is frequently heated or boiled before use e g cooking showering and hot beverages boiling of tap water reduces halogenated dbps due to the combined effects of thermal hydrolysis degradation and volatilization of dbps liu et al 2020a however considering the high boiling points of i dbps and their low volatility table s1 boiling might have limited effects on their abatement particularly iodinated haloacetic acids uv aops degradation and adsorption by activated carbon have been proven to be effective for i dbp removal wang et al 2017 qian et al 2018 however the high installation and operation costs of uv systems at the point of use and point of entry in a single household introduce a high economic barrier to entry since i dbps may form during disinfection uv treatment can be adopted after final disinfection in centralized water treatment facilities i thms are of high hydrophobicity as demonstrated by their high n octanol to water partition coefficients i e log kow table s1 rendering them affinitive towards hydrophobic activated carbon household carbon filters should remove i thms effectively however the removal of iodinated haloacetic acids and other i dbps by adsorption is in question current research predominantly focuses on i thms membrane filtration may be a viable alternative in a household future studies on other emerging i dbps are eagerly

16532,globally water based bathing pastimes are important for both mental and physical health however exposure to waterborne organisms could present a substantial public health issue bathing waters are shown to contribute to the transmission of illness and disease and represent a reservoir and pathway for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant amr organisms current bathing water quality regulations focus on enumeration of faecal indicator organisms and are not designed for detection of specific waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc such as antimicrobial resistant amr pathogenic bacteria or viruses this investigation presents the first scoping review of the occurrence of waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc in identified natural bathing waters across the european union eu which aimed to critically evaluate the potential risk of human exposure and to assess the appropriateness of the current eu bathing water regulations for the protection of public health accordingly this review sought to identify and synthesise all literature pertaining to a selection of bacterial campylobacter spp escherichia coli salmonella spp shigella spp vibrio spp pseudomonas spp amr bacteria viral hepatitis spp enteroviruses rotavirus adenovirus norovirus and protozoan giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp contaminants in eu bathing waters sixty investigations were identified as eligible for inclusion and data was extracted peer reviewed investigations included were from 18 countries across the eu totalling 87 investigations across a period of 35 years with 30 published between 2011 and 2015 a variety of water bodies were identified with 27 investigations exclusively assessing coastal waters waterborne organisms were classified into three categories bacteria viruses and protozoa amounting to 58 36 and 17 of the total investigations respectively the total number of samples across all investigations was 8 118 with detection of one or more organisms in 2 449 30 of these viruses were detected in 1281 52 of all samples where wophc were found followed by bacteria 865 35 and protozoa 303 12 where assessed 442 samples amr bacteria had a 47 detection rate emphasising their widespread occurrence in bathing waters results of this scoping review highlight the potential public health risk of exposure to wophc in bathing waters that normally remain undetected within the current monitoring parameters grphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bathing water waterborne organisms antimicrobial resistance public health concern 1 background water based bathing activities are popular pastimes in both freshwater and seawaters but little is known about the potential microbiological health risks of partaking in these activities collier et al 2015 epidemiological investigations have reported an association between bathing water quality and possible negative health outcomes since the 1950 s pruss 1998 whilst bathing water users can be exposed to a variety of wophc world health organisation 2003 the health promoting benefits arising from bathing water use should be noted volker kistemann 2011 britton et al 2018 fewtrell and kay 2015 kistemann et al 2016 these benefits are well documented and include health and wellbeing social and cultural advantages and economic value papadopoulou et al 2018 within the eu bathing water quality is regulated under the bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 7 ec the european water framework directive wfd further governs water quality focusing on the good ecological and chemical status of freshwater bodies ec 2000 bathing waters are assessed by compliance with predefined standards table 1 the current bwd 2006 7 ec monitors water quality at designated bathing waters and focuses on the enumeration of faecal indicator organisms fio escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci wade et al 2006 whilst the previous directive 76 160 eec utilised coliforms streptococci and salmonella alongside enterovirus it requires countries to minimise risk to public health from faecal pollution in bathing waters through monitoring and management approaches bedri et al 2016 sampling is conducted during the bathing season which runs from may to september in most european countries with the bathing season defined as a period in which large numbers of bathers are expected 2006 07 ec at least four samples are collected per location during each bathing season which allows for its classification based on a minimum of 16 samples over a four year monitoring period water quality is classified by four distinct categories poor sufficient good and excellent for both excellent and good classifications the fios must meet the predefined standards in 95 of samples whereas for sufficient classification they must only meet these standards in 90 of samples in line with current regulations bathing water samples are collected a minimum of once per month where a single grab sample 100 ml is collected in one 24 hour period and tested for relevant faecal indicator bacteria in literature examining the bwd the importance of human health protection has been a subject of discussion this issue has grown in recent years considering increased use of bathing waters outdoor swimmer 2021 one criticism refers to the sampling method for microbiological analysis which has several limitations including low sampling frequency low volume and small number of samples collected a study by wyer et al 2018 demonstrated same day variability in microbial concentrations within uk bathing waters over a 60 day period suggesting that a single small volume sample for microbiological analysis 100 ml is not sufficient to assess bathing water quality the researchers proposed that an alternate sampling method be utilised whereby sampling is conducted in the early morning and when most bathers are due to be present randomised sampling be conducted wyer concluded that a single compliance sample should not be used to classify bathing water quality on a given day and instead compliance data should be used to develop prediction models to allow for a forecast of bathing water quality similar investigations of within day variability conducted in california boehm et al 2002 and canada wymer et al 2007 concur with these findings both detailing variability between samples taken at various time intervals wymer et al 2007 recorded that freshwater and marine samples taken at hourly intervals had a coefficient variation of 1 7 whilst samples taken daily had a result of 2 2 showing considerable temporal variability between the time frames both investigations recognise weather changes as influencing variability in estimates of fio present results presented in these investigations supports the recommendation that a single sample should not be considered a robust representative of water quality on the given day these variability investigations emphasise that more regular sampling is required to decrease inconsistency in results in addition recommendations from the world health organisation 2018 for the revised bathing water directive herein referred to as rbwd included amendments such as the necessity to increase the minimum number for overall classification from sixteen to twenty samples during a 4 year period sample size has a considerable impact on findings and subsequent classifications with a lesser number of samples possibly leading to misclassifications of bathing waters world health organisation 2018 public health may be broadly defined as the science of preventing disease and promoting the health of people and communities this is achieved though organised efforts of health promotion research and disease detection and prevention cdc 2021 monitoring investigations reveal that bathing waters can be a vehicle for numerous organisms including viruses pathogenic bacteria amr bacteria and protozoa federigi et al 2020 o connor et al 2021 hooban et al 2021 for the purposes of this review we are defining waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc as microorganisms that have the potential to cause illness or harm to humans many waterborne organisms such as cryptosporidium and e coli originate from the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals coffey et al 2007 lightfoot 2003 the risk of illness from exposure to waters contaminated with faecal material has been the subject of many investigations pruss 1998 wade et al 2003 leonard et al 2018 whilst the registered infection rate of viral agents is lower than that of faecal bacteria the exclusion of viral parameters from monitoring regulations proves worrisome because of their ability to cause infection world health organisation 2018 following revision of the bwd 1976 76 160 eec enteroviruses pfu l were excluded alongside total and faecal coliforms in the rbwd the rbwd which replaced the 1976 directive assesses bathing water quality management utilising two faecal parameters e coli and intestinal enterococci in particular enteroviruses were removed in the rbwd as they were not considered appropriate indicators eea 2021 however no suitable indicator was recommended as replacement many authors have challenged this exclusion as e coli and intestinal enterococci occurrence does not correlate with enteroviruses rodrigues cunha 2017 lee et al 2014 henry et al 2016 jiang chu 2004 fios as indicators therefore cannot provide a complete representation of bathing water quality regardless of registered infection rates as mentioned previously the european commission ec aimed to evaluate the rbwd by 2020 with consideration to parameters included within the directive and potential amendment of classification standards world health organisation 2018 this plan is highlighted also in the rbwd itself stating the commission shall no later than 2020 review this directive with particular regard to the parameters for bathing water quality considering this the european union 2021 released an evaluation roadmap on bathing water quality within this they detail plans to evaluate the recommended parameters review current laboratory methods and sampling processes alongside assessing the need for prolonging the sampling periods to include year round bathers and have included public consultation europa 2021 at the time of publication of the world health organisation 2018 recommendations on developments relevant to the parameters for bathing water quality bathing waters were not believed to be a key factor in the dissemination of amr organisms however recent research on bathing waters highlights the presence of amr organisms in bathing waters including new delhi metallo beta lactamase ndm producing enterobacteriaceae and cephalosporin resistant e coli leonard et al 2015 world health organisation 2018 blaak 2014 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 these investigations highlight the need for further examination of the role of bathing waters in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance exposure to amr bacteria in bathing waters could represent a substantial public health risk through gut colonization and subsequent dissemination of amr bacteria to vulnerable individuals over the past few years the presence of amr organisms and amr genes in the environment has been identified as a public health risk in a multitude of settings riedel et al 2019 antimicrobial resistance genes args have been identified in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent with some investigations suggesting that these facilities are hotspots for the dissemination of amr genes and organisms to the environment riedel et al 2019 antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted to the bathing water environment through release of sewage agricultural runoff and healthcare effluent mahon et al 2017 parris 2011 cahill et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 at the time of writing the present review incorporated countries within the european union to whom the current bwd applies this review intends to address the knowledge gaps relating to potential negative impacts for the individual that could arise from exposure to contaminated bathing waters alongside analysis of the effectiveness of the bwd in public health protection this arises from the increased use of these waters in the past decade with demands on recreational waters having increased greatly especially during the coronavirus 19 pandemic outdoor swimmer 2021 this review will incorporate the integrated systems of human animal and environmental health promoting the importance of a one health approach in understanding the role of bathing waters in the transmission of organisms of public health importance white hughes 2019 whilst it is well known that bathing water quality has improved vastly in recent decades eea 2021 the relative prevalence of organisms of public health concern in bathing waters gyraite et al 2019 döhla et al 2019 efstratiou et al 2009 young 2016 remains cause for debate in some instances therefore the objectives of this study were to i assess and summarise the scientific evidence associated with wophc in eu bathing waters ii assess the prevalence of wophc and identify the detection rates and iii evaluate the methodology utilised in comparison to those currently employed by the rbwd the prevalence of wophc in bathing waters remains largely understudied indicating a significant knowledge gap a comprehensive understanding of the occurrences of wophc is essential to influence not only research but policy and regulations with regards to safe bathing waters 2 methods 2 1 defining scope research question and development of search strategy the protocol for this review was defined according to pre established guidelines pullin and stewart 2006 and the reporting standards for systematic evidence syntheses roses with adaptions from previously published papers andrade et al 2018 hooban et al 2020 goulas et al 2020 a review panel was created to define relevant search terms literature and eligibility criteria the formulation of the research question was undertaken through discussion amongst members of the review panel the central research question of this scoping review is what is the prevalence of wophc in eu bathing waters and is there a risk to human health beyond what is detected under the current bwd this review is restricted to a selected number of wophc as chosen both through review of literature and consultation with experts in the area lightfoot 2003 recognised waterborne organisms to include campylobacter spp e coli salmonella spp shigella spp vibrio spp pseudomonas spp hepatitis a b and c virus enteroviruses norovirus adenovirus rotavirus giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in addition to this resource discussion with the review panel compiled a complete list which was employed and tested to ensure inclusion of all organisms of relevance as seen in table 2 due to their increasing relevance and their occurrence in aquatic environments amr bacteria are also included in the category of wophc in the present review these selected organisms were chosen due to their pathogenic capabilities alongside their commonality to seek data which will aid in addressing the potential health risks of utilising natural bathing waters the present review defines natural bathing waters as water bodies that have not been man made or treated artificially pathogenic organisms as those that have the capability of causing disease in humans and faecal indicator bacteria as those used to indicate the presence of faecal contamination in a bathing water initial searches were executed in scopus to define search keywords and protocol the initial volume of literature captured during this phase was employed to estimate the efficacy of each combined search term and to finalise search terms selected key papers were applied as a measure of efficiency of various search terms boolean operators and strategies search strings were then developed in the scopus database and altered for use in databases embase biosis web of science and greenfile ebscohost a range of search terms and indexed terms related to waterborne organisms recreational water and water quality monitoring were applied to the databases table 2 four databases were searched for articles most recently december 2020 with alerts created within the relevant databases for any new investigations published in relation to the search terms investigations of interest were those relating to the occurrence of wophc in naturally occurring bathing waters the reference management software endnote x9 was used to collate references from online databases and for the removal of duplicates 2 2 identifying and collating literature search terms were organised in relation to population exposure and outcome which were combined with the boolean operator and truncation and wildcards were used and adapted to each database to take variants into consideration title abs keywords was applied in each database except for biosis where topic ts was applied limitations to the search were applied in the form of i availability in the english language ii investigations must have been conducted between 1975 and 2020 and iii geographical limitations to eu this year range and geographical limitation was chosen in accordance with the introduction of the bwd 1976 and the corresponding eu countries the rbwd applied to at the time of writing respectively due to resource and time limitations a language threshold was applied supplementary table s3 study authors were contacted where possible to obtain relevant missing or further support data if necessary authors of articles published in journals that could not be accessed were contacted twice over a month long period in cases where full text was not obtained they were excluded following full text screening grey literature was searched by employing the phrase waterborne organisms in bathing waters to the environment and health websites supplementary table s2 the first 50 results of each were screened for eligibility those that were eligible were progressed to data extraction appropriate topic areas source types publication type and taxas were employed in each search field to reduce the retrieval of unrelated articles 2 3 screening and limitations study selection was separated into two phases title and abstract screen 1 main reviewer followed by full text screen 2 reviewers the bibliographies of investigations meeting the relevant criteria were examined to identify additional relevant investigations i e citation chasing once each phase was completed a randomised subset of the investigations 10 was selected for quality control and assigned to another reviewer results were compared to the original screening and any disagreements resolved by discussion between reviewers inclusion criteria for full text screening included i sample size greater than or equal to 10 ii sample volume is greater than or equal to 100 ml and iii waters identified as naturally occurring bathing waters by the author exclusion criteria at full text review stage included articles that investigated waters not used for bathing purposes data presented unformatted and or integrated event data which could not be extracted and discretised or reviewed results of previously published investigations 2 4 analysis and synthesis of data the relevant literature was organised as an evidence map according to the objectives key information about the identified literature was extracted into excel microsoft 365 by one reviewer and the data collected was compared to the inclusion thresholds supplementary table s4 initial data regarding primary author year of publication and country were extracted as a means of identification and to allow for evidence mapping by year and country following this the organism of interest as identified by the author was extracted and categorised into i bacteria ii viruses or iii protozoa bathing water was divided into relevant groups i inland ii coastal iii transitional or iv a combination of two or more water bodies to assess the water quality in each study quantitative measures and narrative descriptions were utilised this was conducted according to similar methods employed by russo et al 2020 where if quantitative measures were lacking e g microbial analysis water quality was designated based on narrative synthesis if water was designated as heavily polluted the consequent water quality was considered poor where an author refers to the bathing season for time of sampling it was presumed that this implied may to september sample volume and sample size were extracted and grouped into appropriate categories to allow for in depth analysis extracted data fields were further organised by i influence by pollution and ii whether the sampling took place during after or incorporated the bathing season as an example data regarding pollution was extracted as per the authors description whether that be a potential pollutant sewage or agriculture discharge or no mention of pollution additionally in some incidences data was recorded as pollution not specified whereby the author mentions pollution but fails to identify the potential source data analysis omits investigations solely detecting organisms within the current bathing water directive standards i e intestinal enterococci and e coli fio and instead focuses on organisms beyond the scope of the current bwd for example if an article detailed both faecal coliforms and enterovirus detection the faecal coliform result was essentially ignored to allow for an in depth analysis of microorganisms of importance for this review a copy of the data analysis fields extracted can be seen in supplementary table s4 3 results 3 1 summary of review protocol results a total of 4548 articles were identified by the review protocol fig 1 initial screening resulted in high exclusion levels due to broad search terms leading to retrieval of investigations irrelevant to the aim of this review following de duplication 2130 articles were moved forward for title and abstract screening of these 132 were deemed relevant and progressed to full text screening a further 66 of the 132 were excluded based on pre established criteria with an additional 6 papers excluded due to no access to full text of the excluded articles the majority were excluded due to low sample size or volume n 13 investigations or water body not clearly identifiable as bathing n 14 for investigations listed as lacking two or more criteria n 9 the majority lacked both sample size and volume whilst five of the excluded investigations examined waters not designated as suitable for bathing seventeen investigations listed in the category of other were considered beyond the scope of the present review these included investigations that focused on bovine farms sewage outflows sand and microplastics biofilms a further 8 were excluded due to being short communication style reports in total 60 investigations were included for the final review with 72 total articles excluded after full text screening a reference record of included articles is presented in supplementary material table s5 3 2 included study

detected ndm producing e coli and ndm producing k pneumoniae similarly vignaroli et al 2013 employed pcr detection of virulence and antibiotic resistant genes two studies focused solely on molecular based methodologies di cesare et al 2015 herrig et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 synopsis of relevant literature identified this scoping review presents an insight into the occurrence of waterborne organisms of public health concern in european bathing waters the substantial quantity of investigations that met the inclusion criteria is indicative of the upsurge of research relating to contaminated bathing waters in recent years a limitation was placed on searches in accordance with the rbwd to include sample size and volume whereby sample size could not be less than 10 samples and sample volume must be greater than or equal to 100 ml reflective of the bathing water quality monitoring guidelines protocols a significant finding of this review is the regular occurrence in bathing waters of waterborne organisms that are beyond the scope of those currently monitored for under the rbwd overall the included investigations in this present review have demonstrated the great potential for bathing waters to be reservoirs of a wide array of potentially harmful organisms publication dates of included investigations ranged from 1985 to 2020 with the majority published following the 2006 bwd revision no investigations were identified prior to 1985 a range of water bodies were identified as vulnerable to contamination with the majority coastal 44 followed by freshwater 27 and two or more water categories 30 as seen in supplementary table s8 4 2 organisms of public health concern in bathing waters as previously outlined vibrio spp was the most detected organism persistent aquatic environmental reservoirs of vibrio spp could pose a health risk to humans vibrio cholera is the causative agent of cholera an acute diarrhoeal infection it should be noted that this disease is not endemic in europe and outbreaks are associated with poor hygiene and sanitation the results of the present review not only highlight their presence in bathing waters but also worrisome pathogenic factors of the vibrio strains such as haemolysin vibrio with haemolysin activity against erythrocytes can manifest as gastrointestinal infections or intestinal infections depending on their causative species mizuno et al 2020 in the present review an included study by boer et al 2013 reported testing for haemolytic capabilities in v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae strains with two v parahaemolyticus carrying the trh gene but not the tdh thermostable direct haemolysin tdh vibrio are commonly associated with gastroenteritis septicaemia and wound infection mizuno et al 2020 interestingly boer also performed the kanagawa haemolytic test which showed that two additional isolates neither having the trh or tdh genes had haemolytic abilities which suggests the presence of further haemolysis genes moreover boer tested 22 detected strains of v cholerae for the presence of ctxa and serotypes o1 and o139 with the latter being responsible for the diarrhoeal disease cholera however none of these strains were pathogenic boer also highlights the detection of v vulnificus bringing attention to the potential health risk caused by this organism due to its toxicity particularly with respect to wound infections boer clearly states the risk associated with this organism highlighting that this species does not correlate with current faecal indicators utilised in bathing water quality assessments in comparison another included study gyraite et al 2019 describes detection of v vulnificus using real time pcr methods that target the vvha haemolysin gene gyraite describes detectable levels of v vulnificus carrying this gene during the bathing seasons and in some cases the abundances of this organism were higher in bathing areas than other parts of the waters tested similar to methods utilised by boer masini et al 2007 utilised pcr methods of detection for the tdh and trh haemolysin genes with results showing that both v alginolyticus and v harveyi isolates harbouring trh genes lepuschitz et al 2019 detailed the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in 81 of 82 environmental vibrio spp isolates studied eighty of these displayed resistance to sulphonamides 25 were resistant to both sulphonamides and streptomycin 12 to sulphonamides and ampicillin 1 to ampicillin alone and 7 isolates were multidrug resistant sulphonamides ampicillin and streptomycin methods employed by the 8 studies detailing vibrio spp analysis largely employed cultivation on selective agars with the exception of panaiotov et al 2015 who employed microscopic and pcr analyses additionally lepuschitz et al 2019 did not use detection methods in their study rather the isolates were selected from an existing strain collection from a previous study pretzer et al 2017 the result from these included articles allows for the presumption that bathing waters contaminated with vibrio spp could contribute to the potential for illness following exposure to these waters similarly the occurrence of additional pathogenic bacteria associated with human illness were detected in bathing waters efstratiou et al 2009 and aulicino et al 2001 describe the detection of salmonella spp in waters classified as both good and sufficient respectively salmonella spp is a causative agent in a large percentage of gastrointestinal illnesses with some serotypes leading to typhoid and paratyphoid illness efstratiou et al 2009 mansilha et al 2010 although none were detected in the included studies aulicino et al 2001 identified salmonella derby which is the most identified cause of salmonellosis in europe sévellec et al 2020 another included study mansilha et al 2010 highlights the occurrence of salmonella spp in bathing waters classified as both good and excellent including non typhoidal serotypes of clinical importance such as s enteritidis and s typhimurium additionally arvanitidou et al 1995 detailed the occurrence of 4 2 campylobacter jejuni strains in 200 seawater samples that complied with the standards set furthermore the author also reported the occurrence of 7 17 campylobacter jejuni isolates in 41 river samples that did not meet the bwd standards arvanitidou furthermore details the occurrence of 7 4 yersinia intermedia in seawaters and 5 12 of the same organism in the river waters campylobacter enteritis is a major cause of acute enteritis globally with some cases linked to polluted waters arvanitidou et al 1995 hokajärvi et al 2013 describes the occurrence of campylobacter spp in 29 58 of 50 finnish bathing waters samples sewage effluents were simultaneously sampled and it was suggested that the observed presence of campylobacter spp in bathing waters could present a public health risk it could be speculated that the bathing waters in this study were contaminated by the sewage effluent due to the common occurrence of this bacteria with campylobacter coli strains detected in both sampling areas having indistinguishable smai and kpni profiles this highlighted the need for reinforcement measures and a higher sampling frequency to ensure bathing waters are free of sewage contaminants occurrences of pathogenic bacteria such as these in bathing waters having met or surpasses the standards set by the bwd is of significant concern campylobacter spp and salmonella spp are causative organisms of human gastrointestinal illnesses and therefore are a public health risk ecdc 2017 ecdc 2020 this highlights that whilst the current parameters are a useful detection method for similar organisms a more comprehensive panel of parameters should be established to effectively assess the risk of exposure to wophc in bathing waters whilst amr bacteria had one of the lesser sample sizes n 442 it had a 47 detection rate this highlighted amr as a substantial issue within bathing waters alongside viruses and other organisms amr is a globally recognised public health risk with increasing evidence highlighting its dissemination into the aquatic environment sanderson et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 the present review highlights bathing waters as a potential reservoir for amr bacteria and multi drug resistant bacteria thus identifying a potential risk to bathing water users whilst there are currently insufficient investigations to quantify the public health risk associated with exposure to amr in bathing waters numerous authors have suggested the potential for colonisation with amr bacteria during use of contaminated waters leonard et al 2015 leonard et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 for example schijven et al 2015 described most sampling locations as having a good classification yet detected extended spectrum β lactamase producing esbl e coli at concentrations ranging up to 1 5 102 cfu l this research highlights that exposure to esbl e coli is possible in waters that have met or exceeded the standards set by the rbwd tejedor et al 2001 describes the identification of antibiotic resistant faecal enterococci in waters described as having met the mandatory bacteriological standards two strains of enterococci displayed high level aminoglycoside resistance leading to the suggestion that waterways could contribute to their spread and dissemination furthermore di cesare et al 2015 described pristine oligotrophic waters yet highlighted their study area as a reservoir for antibiotic resistant genes consideration could be given to examining characteristics of the current monitoring parameters for other organisms such as viral parameters or amr bacteria until recently bathing waters were not thought to be a key pathway in the dissemination of amr organisms according to the world health organisation 2018 however results from the present review and other recent advancements in this area of research suggest otherwise leonard et al 2015 world health organisation 2014 blaak 2014 mahon et al 2017 recreational exposure to bathing waters has the potential to present a pathway for transmission for antimicrobial resistance to the public hooban et al 2020 leonard et al 2018 vignaroli et al 2013 detected gentamycin and tetracycline resistant genes alongside enterococcus associated virulence determinants cylb esp and gele di cesare et al 2015 reported detection of tet a bla ctx m str b and sulii genes in their research herrig et al 2020 employed solely molecular techniques in the form of dna extraction and qpcr to detect bla ctx m genes with genes detected in all water samples throughout the sampling period furthermore lepuschitz et al 2019 utilised whole genome sequencing wgs to confirm 3 enterobacter mori with st1009 plasmids 1 e coli incl1 plasmid and virulencefinder to detect the presence of one e coli isolate with the virulence gene iss bacteria utilise a variety of mechanisms to become resistant to antibiotics but whilst all are worrisome acquired resistances from the bacteria s surroundings such as the antibiotic inactivating enzymes or acquired mechanisms such as modification enzymes that specifically target or modify the antibiotic are of grave concern peterson and kaur 2018 the presence of amr genes in bathing waters is of significant concern and there is a need for evaluation of bathing waters globally for amr there is potential for bacteria to acquire resistance mechanisms through the aquatic environment which could lead to their spread and subsequent further transmission hooban et al 2020 nappier et al 2020 the low percentage of investigations that sought to identify amr bacteria in bathing waters 10 highlights a key research gap whilst the role of the aquatic environment in the dissemination of amr bacteria is increasingly being recognised further research is required to satisfy research gaps before the environment and public health impact of amr in bathing waters can be fully understood six different viruses were identified in this study supplementary table s7 the high volume of research examining the prevalence of adenovirus adv is likely due to the hypothesis that this virus is most favourable to use as a virologic marker for water quality silva et al 2010 numerous additional investigations to the present review have identified this virus as an indicator of faecal contamination carducci et al 2008 silva et al 2011 hewitt et al 2013 supporting its use as an indicator hewitt et al 2013 compares the occurrence of adv in the environment to norovirus which is considered a significant human virus that is not as universally present the 2019 pandemic of the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 has caused high levels of morbidity and mortality globally this rapidly spreading virus has been detected in wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020 lodder et al 2020 and faecal specimens pan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 globally despite this recent reviews have outlined that the risk of sars cov 2 exposure in bathing waters is thought to be low cahill et al 2020 carducci et al 2020 however further research is required protozoan contaminants were broken down into cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp accumulating to 4 of the total sample number of included investigations overall a greater number of samples were examined for cryptosporidium n 894 however only 17 of these resulted in detection similarly giardia had a sample number of 854 with 17 detected many articles excluded in the title and abstract screening for this organism category were due to sampling from treated waters e g swimming pools plutzer et al 2019 detailed one such study where an outbreak of cryptosporidium occurred on a residential rehabilitation holiday for paediatric organ transplant patients in hungary this study found that cases were 7 times more likely than controls to have swum in the children s pool and 5 times more likely to have used the whirlpool cryptosporidium occurrence in treated pools is likely due to infection control difficulties where resistance occurs at certain chlorine levels plutzer et al 2019 e coli and intestinal enterococci are not well correlated with the pathogenic cryptosporidium and giardia further enhancing the argument that additional parameters should be included in current regulations one such additional parameter clostridium perfringens is mentioned in rodrigues et al 2017 critical review of current microbiological assessments in bathing waters c perfringens can be a useful indicator for pathogenic organisms such as cryptosporidium giardia salmonella adenoviruses and enteroviruses due to good correlations wu et al 2011 furthermore c perfringens spores have been proposed as secondary indicators of faecal pollution due to resulting from faecal origins themselves stelma 2018 4 3 detection and sampling methods employed large variations in methods employed were observed amongst the included investigations which meant that it was not possible to directly compare results of selected investigations small volumes of 100 ml were collected for analysis in some situations whilst larger volumes of 100 l were collected in others however variances in methods amongst the investigations selected per organism group resulted in difficulties for comparison with some investigations utilising genotypic methods such as pcr whilst others utilised culture based methods methodological approach is especially relevant when evaluating difficult to culture organisms such as protozoans in bathing waters the process of detection generally includes filtration and immunomagnetic separation as concentration methods followed by contrast staining fluorescent antibodies and microscopic detection herein known as the usepa method however these fail to identify the organisms species bringing into question whether the human health risk can be appropriately assessed whilst widely utilised the usepa method does not differentiate between pathogenic and non pathogenic cryptosporidium or giardia as outlined by adamska et al 2015 this raises questions about whether an adequate risk assessment can be made using these methods and highlights the need for more sensitive methods such as pcr these specific methodologies could allow for a more appropriate risk assessment molecular methods such as these were utilised by adamska et al 2015 allowing for the conclusion that whilst low confirmed rates of c parvum and g intestinalis were noted in the sampled waters the identification of these specific pathogens indicates that the microbial quality of the examined waters has been impacted additionally attention should be given to the issue that whilst an organism may be detected this does not give information regarding its infectivity leaving the risk essentially unknown molecular methods such as pcr have been described as not only a more rapid method but also more specific when compared with culture based methods morris et al 2016 similar pcr methods were employed by many authors coupe et al 2006 ehsan et al 2012 galvan et al 2014 sales ortellis et al 2015 however three studies failed to employ specific identification methods castro hermida et al 2010 julio et al 2012 schets et al 2008 whilst the findings from these studies identify organisms of concern in bathing waters they fail to identify whether the organisms detected have the potential to be pathogenic and in the case of pcr whether they are viable this limits the conclusions that can be established highlighting more so a general overview of the presence of organisms rather than a true evaluation of the potential public health risk moreover difficulties can arise with detection especially in the case of viruses identification of contaminated waters requires sensitive assays to detect even low viral numbers julian and schwab 2011 conventional methods of detection and quantification of viruses are generally culture and or molecular based such as pcr and involve two important steps concentration and target detection symonds and breitbart 2014 challenges occur relating to these methods due to differences and limitations in viral collection viability assessment and concentration methods when sampling waters however improved detection methods are becoming increasingly available regardless it is clear viruses are of increasing concern in bathing waters yet reliance still lies with bacterial indicators for contamination alerts gibson et al 2014 whilst fio s are still favourable due to the readily available low cost methods of culture it should be noted that as overall parameters they do not always warn of the presence of viral contamination therefore re introduction of a viral indicator should be considered as with the 1976 bwd unfortunately previous reviews have indicated that due to the high variability of environmental persistence and epidemiology of viruses in particular enteric viruses it is unlikely that a single viral indicator will suffice to adequate assess the potential contamination symonds and breitbart 2014 this highlights that whilst it is evident that no single indicator can predict illness wade et al 2003 there is a need for a greater spectrum of testing for each category analysed in the present review alongside a standardised method of testing bathing waters the large variance in sampling design i e sample size and volume employed demonstrates a lack of standardisation amongst environmental sampling and laboratory processing which prevents robust comparison amongst reported results this created a challenge to interpreting data and to overcome this results were interpreted as positives per sample rather than concentration detected a common sampling approach amongst coastal based investigation stipulated collection of water samples at an approximate depth of 30 cm below surface n 14 which is in accordance with rbwd criteria whilst the rbwd suggests a total sample volume of 750 ml to include physicochemical testing 22 investigations collected samples less than this volume this is a significant research gap with respect to a homogeneous approach to sampling bathing waters but also created a challenge for interpreting data 4 4 water quality and public health water quality in the eu has improved following the introduction of the revised bwd 2006 therefore the risk of illness has reduced over this time leonard et al 2018 however several articles have shown the presence of organisms with the potential to cause illness or harm in bathing waters identified as meeting the standards of either bwd for its time mahon et al 2017 o flaherty et al schets et al 2008 schvoerer et al 2000 schijven et al 2015 pianetti et al 2000 kokkinos et al 2018 in the study of kokkinos et al 2018 out of 72 samples analysed 23 33 were positive for one or more viruses with human adenovirus detected in 29 of samples kokkinos et al 2018 reported that based on bacterial parameters sea and freshwater samples met the standard limits set according to the rbwd however human adenoviruses were detected in samples at all sites with hepatitis a also discovered on one occasion human adenoviruses have been noted as reliable indicators of faecal contamination of human origins and their detection could imply presence of other pathogenic viruses such as norovirus detected in 3 out of 72 samples in kokkinos et al 2018 as previously outlined bathing water quality is monitored by estimating the number of fios present however these standardised methods typically take over 24 h to be reported wade et al 2010 consequently it is not feasible to assess bathing water quality without this 24 hour delay wade et al 2006 which could subject the public to unknown risks hampers the provision of real time results and deprives the public of possible warnings colford et al 2012 this study raises the concern regarding whether at sites where water quality is variable the sampling results inform the public in a timely manner about the water quality on any given day this emphasises a need for increased frequency in sampling furthermore additional studies not included in the present review colford et al 2007 arnold et al 2013 have highlighted that the incidence of illness such as diarrhoea in some cases is not associated with the current indicators used to monitor bathing water quality these studies were not included in the present review as they did not directly sample bathing waters instead surveying water users both studies suggest a requirement for alternative methods for analysing water quality with a broader spectrum of parameters needed overall it is clear that an increased frequency of sampling is required with stricter management procedures during times of risk such as heavy rainfall to avoid potential public health hazards this is addressed in a recent report by the eea 2021 whereby it was noted that extreme weather events need to be addressed through an integrated urban management approach this includes forecasting potential pollution in lieu of extreme events such as excessive rainfall or storm water outflow and introducing further management procedures when pollution is detected such as pre closure of bathing areas ahead of forecasted storms for example currently warning systems are in place to warn bathers of the risk after pollution events however these management strategies should be updated to incorporate early warning systems with the introduction of the rbwd the aim of enhancing public health protection alongside environmental protection from faecal pollution through an improved monitoring and management strategy of bathing sites was established this directive specifies more stringent microbiological standards using faecal indicator bacteria intestinal enterococci and e coli for health risk predications from bathing stidson et al 2012 this excludes previous parameters such as total coliforms faecal coliforms faecal streptococci salmonella and enteroviruses however the rbwd allows for temporary moderation of these standards during short term pollution events where 15 of the total samples over a 4 year monitoring period can be effectively discounted nevertheless this can only be implemented where the occurrence of such events can be predicted and public advisory notices issued whilst the bwd aims to enhance public health protection it could be argued that including only two parameters as a means of classifying water quality is not sufficient to detect risks to public health from bathing water use whilst the introduction of the rbwd brought great improvements such as the classification system of poor to excellent recommendations to improve upon the rbwd have been published globally world health organisation 2018 exclusion of some parameters such as viral parameters is likely due to feasibility issues exclusion of other parameters such as amr require review particularly in relation to organisms resulting from contaminant sources surveillance of amr and organisms of concern in bathing waters will aid in protection of human health whilst also enhancing ecosystem health and preventing dissemination of these organisms of health concern there is a need to develop a harmonised approach to environmental surveillance for amr one potential approach could be to adopt the approach taken by the esbl tricycle amr surveillance project matheu et al 2017 as highlighted by this project there is a need for an integrated approach to surveillance of amr across the human health animal health and environmental sectors as systems have been developed for the surveillance of esbl producing e coli in the human and animal sectors this could prove a useful target for environmental surveillance surveillance of prevalence and concentrations of these wophc are fundamental to developing risk assessments for bathing waters and prioritizing development of policy and management strategies to reduce this when the rbwd is reviewed the potential issues for inclusion of other parameters such as elevated cost and time should be addressed 4 5 recommendations for research policy and practice a recommendation arising from this review is that consistent reporting of sample size and volumes collected should be applied to limit insufficient detail in investigations and strengthen evidence synthesis in this area therefore it is recommended that authors state initial sample volumes taken overall sample size and if the water is designated for bathing the classification status at the time of sampling should also be reported future research should also consider the public health risks arising from contaminated bathing water concerning the interpretation of results extracting data from investigations was not always feasible e g graphs displaying concentrations with no corresponding table or supplementary material in this review a range of sources have been linked as potential contaminants in the aquatic environment such as wwtp effluent agricultural pollution and urban outflows over half of the included investigations referred to a type of pollution representing a potential source of contamination into the aquatic environment and subsequent bathing exposure as such research into the public health risk arising from use of bathing waters is urgently needed with regards to current methodology for monitoring bathing water quality consideration should be given to updating recommended methods to allow for detection of wophc additionally classification systems should rest solely on a 95 confidence interval as opposed to both a 90 and 95 confidence interval to further increase water quality standards across europe as advised by the who in accordance with the who recommendations the present review supports the suggestion that the total number of samples during a four year bathing period be increased to 20 from 16 the present review also provides evidence for the need for larger sample volumes to obtain a greater representation of the bathing area as previously outlined the bwd 2006 states that samples taken during transient pollution events may be disregarded during annual compliance assessments the interference of this with accurate annual classifications cannot be ruled out in summary the following courses of action are recommended to aid in current understandings of the risk factors associated with wophc in bathing waters an increased temporal sampling regime rather than once off sampling methodology a universal homogeneous methodology allowing for comparisons amongst study outcomes it is recommended that there is a harmonisation of sample volume collected and methodologies used for analysis increased research into amr in bathing waters regulated and unregulated and its potential inclusion as a parameter in the bwd standardised methodologies such as those developed by the esbl tricycle amr surveillance protocol should be established to provide a cohesive multidisciplinary surveillance of amr in bathing waters further research to define suitable indicators that represent each of the three categories alongside risk based identification of locally important wophc for monitoring detailed reporting of methods in articles particularly in terms of study sample sizes and volumes these arising recommendations rely on enhanced methodologies and surveillance therefore efforts must be implemented to establish an efficient universal affordable standard for the detection of wophc to enhance public health protection 4 6 study limitations providing an accurate representation of the european prevalence of wophc in bathing waters is a difficult task this is due to an inconsistency of uniform sampling designs methodology and reporting of results this research was guided by european policy and resources there is potential to expand this review beyond europe to compare results study designs and procedures although articles were gathered from a variety of databases the search was performed in english excluding those not in the english language due to limited time and resources additionally six texts were not available for full text screening despite best efforts several gaps in the information provided by investigations led to a high exclusion rate of potentially significant investigations for this reason the most important of these was sample volume where many investigations mentioned the amount of water filtered during the testing procedure but not the initial volume collected nonetheless this study allowed for a comprehensive review of wophc amongst bathing waters in europe and highlighted important improvements that should be considered for implementation in the next european bwd revision 5 conclusion this review demonstrates the importance of bathing waters as significant reservoirs of waterborne organisms with the potential to impact upon public health and could be used to inform bathing water management and policy however there is a need for further research in this area alongside standardised robust methodologies to allow for better inter study comparison nonetheless the findings of this review highlight the extent and significance of contamination of european bathing waters by a variety of potentially harmful organisms that are currently beyond the scope of the rbwd and support the

16532,globally water based bathing pastimes are important for both mental and physical health however exposure to waterborne organisms could present a substantial public health issue bathing waters are shown to contribute to the transmission of illness and disease and represent a reservoir and pathway for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant amr organisms current bathing water quality regulations focus on enumeration of faecal indicator organisms and are not designed for detection of specific waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc such as antimicrobial resistant amr pathogenic bacteria or viruses this investigation presents the first scoping review of the occurrence of waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc in identified natural bathing waters across the european union eu which aimed to critically evaluate the potential risk of human exposure and to assess the appropriateness of the current eu bathing water regulations for the protection of public health accordingly this review sought to identify and synthesise all literature pertaining to a selection of bacterial campylobacter spp escherichia coli salmonella spp shigella spp vibrio spp pseudomonas spp amr bacteria viral hepatitis spp enteroviruses rotavirus adenovirus norovirus and protozoan giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp contaminants in eu bathing waters sixty investigations were identified as eligible for inclusion and data was extracted peer reviewed investigations included were from 18 countries across the eu totalling 87 investigations across a period of 35 years with 30 published between 2011 and 2015 a variety of water bodies were identified with 27 investigations exclusively assessing coastal waters waterborne organisms were classified into three categories bacteria viruses and protozoa amounting to 58 36 and 17 of the total investigations respectively the total number of samples across all investigations was 8 118 with detection of one or more organisms in 2 449 30 of these viruses were detected in 1281 52 of all samples where wophc were found followed by bacteria 865 35 and protozoa 303 12 where assessed 442 samples amr bacteria had a 47 detection rate emphasising their widespread occurrence in bathing waters results of this scoping review highlight the potential public health risk of exposure to wophc in bathing waters that normally remain undetected within the current monitoring parameters grphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bathing water waterborne organisms antimicrobial resistance public health concern 1 background water based bathing activities are popular pastimes in both freshwater and seawaters but little is known about the potential microbiological health risks of partaking in these activities collier et al 2015 epidemiological investigations have reported an association between bathing water quality and possible negative health outcomes since the 1950 s pruss 1998 whilst bathing water users can be exposed to a variety of wophc world health organisation 2003 the health promoting benefits arising from bathing water use should be noted volker kistemann 2011 britton et al 2018 fewtrell and kay 2015 kistemann et al 2016 these benefits are well documented and include health and wellbeing social and cultural advantages and economic value papadopoulou et al 2018 within the eu bathing water quality is regulated under the bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 7 ec the european water framework directive wfd further governs water quality focusing on the good ecological and chemical status of freshwater bodies ec 2000 bathing waters are assessed by compliance with predefined standards table 1 the current bwd 2006 7 ec monitors water quality at designated bathing waters and focuses on the enumeration of faecal indicator organisms fio escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci wade et al 2006 whilst the previous directive 76 160 eec utilised coliforms streptococci and salmonella alongside enterovirus it requires countries to minimise risk to public health from faecal pollution in bathing waters through monitoring and management approaches bedri et al 2016 sampling is conducted during the bathing season which runs from may to september in most european countries with the bathing season defined as a period in which large numbers of bathers are expected 2006 07 ec at least four samples are collected per location during each bathing season which allows for its classification based on a minimum of 16 samples over a four year monitoring period water quality is classified by four distinct categories poor sufficient good and excellent for both excellent and good classifications the fios must meet the predefined standards in 95 of samples whereas for sufficient classification they must only meet these standards in 90 of samples in line with current regulations bathing water samples are collected a minimum of once per month where a single grab sample 100 ml is collected in one 24 hour period and tested for relevant faecal indicator bacteria in literature examining the bwd the importance of human health protection has been a subject of discussion this issue has grown in recent years considering increased use of bathing waters outdoor swimmer 2021 one criticism refers to the sampling method for microbiological analysis which has several limitations including low sampling frequency low volume and small number of samples collected a study by wyer et al 2018 demonstrated same day variability in microbial concentrations within uk bathing waters over a 60 day period suggesting that a single small volume sample for microbiological analysis 100 ml is not sufficient to assess bathing water quality the researchers proposed that an alternate sampling method be utilised whereby sampling is conducted in the early morning and when most bathers are due to be present randomised sampling be conducted wyer concluded that a single compliance sample should not be used to classify bathing water quality on a given day and instead compliance data should be used to develop prediction models to allow for a forecast of bathing water quality similar investigations of within day variability conducted in california boehm et al 2002 and canada wymer et al 2007 concur with these findings both detailing variability between samples taken at various time intervals wymer et al 2007 recorded that freshwater and marine samples taken at hourly intervals had a coefficient variation of 1 7 whilst samples taken daily had a result of 2 2 showing considerable temporal variability between the time frames both investigations recognise weather changes as influencing variability in estimates of fio present results presented in these investigations supports the recommendation that a single sample should not be considered a robust representative of water quality on the given day these variability investigations emphasise that more regular sampling is required to decrease inconsistency in results in addition recommendations from the world health organisation 2018 for the revised bathing water directive herein referred to as rbwd included amendments such as the necessity to increase the minimum number for overall classification from sixteen to twenty samples during a 4 year period sample size has a considerable impact on findings and subsequent classifications with a lesser number of samples possibly leading to misclassifications of bathing waters world health organisation 2018 public health may be broadly defined as

2021 monitoring investigations reveal that bathing waters can be a vehicle for numerous organisms including viruses pathogenic bacteria amr bacteria and protozoa federigi et al 2020 o connor et al 2021 hooban et al 2021 for the purposes of this review we are defining waterborne organisms of public health concern wophc as microorganisms that have the potential to cause illness or harm to humans many waterborne organisms such as cryptosporidium and e coli originate from the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals coffey et al 2007 lightfoot 2003 the risk of illness from exposure to waters contaminated with faecal material has been the subject of many investigations pruss 1998 wade et al 2003 leonard et al 2018 whilst the registered infection rate of viral agents is lower than that of faecal bacteria the exclusion of viral parameters from monitoring regulations proves worrisome because of their ability to cause infection world health organisation 2018 following revision of the bwd 1976 76 160 eec enteroviruses pfu l were excluded alongside total and faecal coliforms in the rbwd the rbwd which replaced the 1976 directive assesses bathing water quality management utilising two faecal parameters e coli and intestinal enterococci in particular enteroviruses were removed in the rbwd as they were not considered appropriate indicators eea 2021 however no suitable indicator was recommended as replacement many authors have challenged this exclusion as e coli and intestinal enterococci occurrence does not correlate with enteroviruses rodrigues cunha 2017 lee et al 2014 henry et al 2016 jiang chu 2004 fios as indicators therefore cannot provide a complete representation of bathing water quality regardless of registered infection rates as mentioned previously the european commission ec aimed to evaluate the rbwd by 2020 with consideration to parameters included within the directive and potential amendment of classification standards world health organisation 2018 this plan is highlighted also in the rbwd itself stating the commission shall no later than 2020 review this directive with particular regard to the parameters for bathing water quality considering this the european union 2021 released an evaluation roadmap on bathing water quality within this they detail plans to evaluate the recommended parameters review current laboratory methods and sampling processes alongside assessing the need for prolonging the sampling periods to include year round bathers and have included public consultation europa 2021 at the time of publication of the world health organisation 2018 recommendations on developments relevant to the parameters for bathing water quality bathing waters were not believed to be a key factor in the dissemination of amr organisms however recent research on bathing waters highlights the presence of amr organisms in bathing waters including new delhi metallo beta lactamase ndm producing enterobacteriaceae and cephalosporin resistant e coli leonard et al 2015 world health organisation 2018 blaak 2014 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 these investigations highlight the need for further examination of the role of bathing waters in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance exposure to amr bacteria in bathing waters could represent a substantial public health risk through gut colonization and subsequent dissemination of amr bacteria to vulnerable individuals over the past few years the presence of amr organisms and amr genes in the environment has been identified as a public health risk in a multitude of settings riedel et al 2019 antimicrobial resistance genes args have been identified in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent with some investigations suggesting that these facilities are hotspots for the dissemination of amr genes and organisms to the environment riedel et al 2019 antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted to the bathing water environment through release of sewage agricultural runoff and healthcare effluent mahon et al 2017 parris 2011 cahill et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 at the time of writing the present review incorporated countries within the european union to whom the current bwd applies this review intends to address the knowledge gaps relating to potential negative impacts for the individual that could arise from exposure to contaminated bathing waters alongside analysis of the effectiveness of the bwd in public health protection this arises from the increased use of these waters in the past decade with demands on recreational waters having increased greatly especially during the coronavirus 19 pandemic outdoor swimmer 2021 this review will incorporate the integrated systems of human animal and environmental health promoting the importance of a one health approach in understanding the role of bathing waters in the transmission of organisms of public health importance white hughes 2019 whilst it is well known that bathing water quality has improved vastly in recent decades eea 2021 the relative prevalence of organisms of public health concern in bathing waters gyraite et al 2019 döhla et al 2019 efstratiou et al 2009 young 2016 remains cause for debate in some instances therefore the objectives of this study were to i assess and summarise the scientific evidence associated with wophc in eu bathing waters ii assess the prevalence of wophc and identify the detection rates and iii evaluate the methodology utilised in comparison to those currently employed by the rbwd the prevalence of wophc in bathing waters remains largely understudied indicating a significant knowledge gap a comprehensive understanding of the occurrences of wophc is essential to influence not only research but policy and regulations with regards to safe bathing waters 2 methods 2 1 defining scope research question and development of search strategy the protocol for this review was defined according to pre established guidelines pullin and stewart 2006 and the reporting standards for systematic evidence syntheses roses with adaptions from previously published papers andrade et al 2018 hooban et al 2020 goulas et al 2020 a review panel was created to define relevant search terms literature and eligibility criteria the formulation of the research question was undertaken through discussion amongst members of the review panel the central research question of this scoping review is what is the prevalence of wophc in eu bathing waters and is there a risk to human health beyond what is detected under the current bwd this review is restricted to a selected number of wophc as chosen both through review of literature and consultation with experts in the area lightfoot 2003 recognised waterborne organisms to include campylobacter spp e coli salmonella spp shigella spp vibrio spp pseudomonas spp hepatitis a b and c virus enteroviruses norovirus adenovirus rotavirus giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp in addition to this resource discussion with the review panel compiled a complete list which was employed and tested to ensure inclusion of all organisms of relevance as seen in table 2 due to their increasing relevance and their occurrence in aquatic environments amr bacteria are also included in the category of wophc in the present review these selected organisms were chosen due to their pathogenic capabilities alongside their commonality to seek data which will aid in addressing the potential health risks of utilising natural bathing waters the present review defines natural bathing waters as water bodies that have not been man made or treated artificially pathogenic organisms as those that have the capability of causing disease in humans and faecal indicator bacteria as those used to indicate the presence of faecal contamination in a bathing water initial searches were executed in scopus to define search keywords and protocol the initial volume of literature captured during this phase was employed to estimate the efficacy of each combined search term and to finalise search terms selected key papers were applied as a measure of efficiency of various search terms boolean operators and strategies search strings were then developed in the scopus database and altered for use in databases embase biosis web of science and greenfile ebscohost a range of search terms and indexed terms related to waterborne organisms recreational water and water quality monitoring were applied to the databases table 2 four databases were searched for articles most recently december 2020 with alerts created within the relevant databases for any new investigations published in relation to the search terms investigations of interest were those relating to the occurrence of wophc in naturally occurring bathing waters the reference management software endnote x9 was used to collate references from online databases and for the removal of duplicates 2 2 identifying and collating literature search terms were organised in relation to population exposure and outcome which were combined with the boolean operator and truncation and wildcards were used and adapted to each database to take variants into consideration title abs keywords was applied in each database except for biosis where topic ts was applied limitations to the search were applied in the form of i availability in the english language ii investigations must have been conducted between 1975 and 2020 and iii geographical limitations to eu this year range and geographical limitation was chosen in accordance with the introduction of the bwd 1976 and the corresponding eu countries the rbwd applied to at the time of writing respectively due to resource and time limitations a language threshold was applied supplementary table s3 study authors were contacted where possible to obtain relevant missing or further support data if necessary authors of articles published in journals that could not be accessed were contacted twice over a month long period in cases where full text was not obtained they were excluded following full text screening grey literature was searched by employing the phrase waterborne organisms in bathing waters to the environment and health websites supplementary table s2 the first 50 results of each were screened for eligibility those that were eligible were progressed to data extraction appropriate topic areas source types publication type and taxas were employed in each search field to reduce the retrieval of unrelated articles 2 3 screening and limitations study selection was separated into two phases title and abstract screen 1 main reviewer followed by full text screen 2 reviewers the bibliographies of investigations meeting the relevant criteria were examined to identify additional relevant investigations i e citation chasing once each phase was completed a randomised subset of the investigations 10 was selected for quality control and assigned to another reviewer results were compared to the original screening and any disagreements resolved by discussion between reviewers inclusion criteria for full text screening included i sample size greater than or equal to 10 ii sample volume is greater than or equal to 100 ml and iii waters identified as naturally occurring bathing waters by the author exclusion criteria at full text review stage included articles that investigated waters not used for bathing purposes data presented unformatted and or integrated event data which could not be extracted and discretised or reviewed results of previously published investigations 2 4 analysis and synthesis of data the relevant literature was organised as an evidence map according to the objectives key information about the identified literature was extracted into excel microsoft 365 by one reviewer and the data collected was compared to the inclusion thresholds supplementary table s4 initial data regarding primary author year of publication and country were extracted as a means of identification and to allow for evidence mapping by year and country following this the organism of interest as identified by the author was extracted and categorised into i bacteria ii viruses or iii protozoa bathing water was divided into relevant groups i inland ii coastal iii transitional or iv a combination of two or more water bodies to assess the water quality in each study quantitative measures and narrative descriptions were utilised this was conducted according to similar methods employed by russo et al 2020 where if quantitative measures were lacking e g microbial analysis water quality was designated based on narrative synthesis if water was designated as heavily polluted the consequent water quality was considered poor where an author refers to the bathing season for time of sampling it was presumed that this implied may to september sample volume and sample size were extracted and grouped into appropriate categories to allow for in depth analysis extracted data fields were further organised by i influence by pollution and ii whether the sampling took place during after or incorporated the bathing season as an example data regarding pollution was extracted as per the authors description whether that be a potential pollutant sewage or agriculture discharge or no mention of pollution additionally in some incidences data was recorded as pollution not specified whereby the author mentions pollution but fails to identify the potential source data analysis omits investigations solely detecting organisms within the current bathing water directive standards i e intestinal enterococci and e coli fio and instead focuses on organisms beyond the scope of the current bwd for example if an article detailed both faecal coliforms and enterovirus detection the faecal coliform result was essentially ignored to allow for an in depth analysis of microorganisms of importance for this review a copy of the data analysis fields extracted can be seen in supplementary table s4 3 results 3 1 summary of review protocol results a total of 4548 articles were identified by the review protocol fig 1 initial screening resulted in high exclusion levels due to broad search terms leading to retrieval of investigations irrelevant to the aim of this review following de duplication 2130 articles were moved forward for title and abstract screening of these 132 were deemed relevant and progressed to full text screening a further 66 of the 132 were excluded based on pre established criteria with an additional 6 papers excluded due to no access to full text of the excluded articles the majority were excluded due to low sample size or volume n 13 investigations or water body not clearly identifiable as bathing n 14 for investigations listed as lacking two or more criteria n 9 the majority lacked both sample size and volume whilst five of the excluded investigations examined waters not designated as suitable for bathing seventeen investigations listed in the category of other were considered beyond the scope of the present review these included investigations that focused on bovine farms sewage outflows sand and microplastics biofilms a further 8 were excluded due to being short communication style reports in total 60 investigations were included for the final review with 72 total articles excluded after full text screening a reference record of included articles is presented in supplementary material table s5 3 2 included study characteristics included literature spanned a period of 35 years 1985 to 2020 as seen in fig 2 with most investigations performed between 2006 and 2020 n 41 of the 60 included investigations 19 were published prior to 2006 bwd 1975 and 41 post 2006 the distribution of included investigations spanned across eighteen european countries fig 3 overall most investigations were performed in italy n 15 followed by spain n 12 and the united kingdom n 10 a total of 27 investigations examined coastal water exclusively whilst 16 investigations were considered solely freshwater a total of 18 investigations analysed two or more water types 3 3 sampling design and detection methods the 53 included investigations examined between 14 and 1410 samples for wophc where sample sizes were determined as greater than or equal to 10 but the exact size could not be defined an approximation was made by the number of sample sites 1 site would be equal to 1 sample most investigations n 34 had a sample size less than 100 as outlined in table 3 fifteen investigations examined between 101 and 499 samples and 4 investigations had a sample size of greater than 500 there was considerable variation in sample volumes also ranging from 100 ml to 1000 l with most investigations falling within the 1 l 20 l category n 29 overall most investigations utilised genotypic molecular methods of detection including polymerase chain reaction pcr with culture based methods proving most common with respect to phenotypic methods however methodologies employed for sample collection and organism detection varied substantially amongst investigations table 4 of the 60 included investigations 53 88 took place either during the bathing season or incorporated it three investigations took place outside the bathing season whilst 4 failed to include time of sampling based on quantitative and narrative description 33 of the investigations involved bathing waters of sufficient classification or higher just over half of the total investigations 55 failed to clearly outline bathing water quality whilst 5 had a classification of poor and 7 had waters that were dispersed across a few classifications fig 4 a and table 5 bacteria viruses and protozoa were detected in excellent and sufficient waters whilst bacteria and viruses were detected in good and poor waters additionally hepatitis a virus adenovirus and bacteroides fragilis were tested for by kokkinos et al 2018 bonadonna et al 2019 and aulicino et al 2001 respectively however none were detected extracted data are based on a total of n 60 included studies n 2449 positive samples and n 8118 samples analysed samples analysed percentage pertains to the total samples analysed 8118 a studies whereby detections were not clearly outlined per sample were not included in the positive sample s calculation b positive sample calculations omit investigations solely detecting organisms within the rbwd standards most investigations 53 mentioned pollution of the sampling areas with wwtp effluent and urban pollution mentioned frequently altogether 47 of articles either did not mention pollution sources or had no known pollution at the sampling sites fig 4b and whilst listed as none mentioned or no known pollution it is not possible to establish if they are completely free from pollution all three categories of wophc were detected in areas where pollution was classified as wastewater or mixed categories only two categories bacteria and viruses were established in urban polluted areas while faecally polluted areas only had viral contaminants present table 6 fig 5 3 4 detection rate of waterborne organisms three different organism categories were investigated in the present review with most of the included investigations examining bacteria n 31 then viruses n 19 and finally protozoa n 9 eight investigations focused solely on standard organisms from the rbwd e coli enterococci coliforms etc to present an overall picture of organisms detected that are beyond the scope of the rbwd standard parameters these eight investigations were excluded from the following results the total number of samples included in the analysis across all investigations was 8118 wophc were identified in 2449 29 of these samples with viruses being the most common category followed by bacteria and protozoa n 1281 n 865 and n 303 respectively table 7 within the virus category adenovirus was the most detected in 761 68 of 1124 samples reovirus had the second highest number of detections at 42 n 253 whilst norovirus was only detected in 155 10 of the 155 samples investigated in the bacterial category salmonella spp had the highest number of investigations n 990 however vibrio spp had the highest detection rate at 392 84 of 466 samples of the 8 included studies examining vibrio spp one analysed amr vibrio spp lepuschitz et al 2019 6 analysed detection of pathogenic vibrio spp gyraite et al 2019 bonadonna et al 2019 kirschner et al 2018 boer et al 2013 masini et al 2007 aulicino et al 2001 and one study detected the presence of vibrio spp but failed to detail the exact species panaiotov et al 2015 amr bacteria had the third highest detection rate found in 208 47 of the 442 samples finally in the protozoa category cryptosporidium spp had the most investigations n 894 but giardia spp had the highest detection rate at 17 n 854 overall 2449 29 of the 8118 investigations resulted in a detection of one or more target organisms a total of 11 investigations into amr bacteria arose from 10 studies spanning across 10 countries one included study incorporated 2 separate countries di cesare et al 2015 italy had the highest number of investigations examining amr bacteria n 3 only one study took place prior to 2006 with the remaining eight occurring from 2013 to 2019 investigations took place in coastal n 3 freshwater n 4 or both n 3 categories there was considerable variation in the volumes of water sampled however the majority investigated volumes of less than 1 l supplementary table s6 a total of 442 samples were collected across the 11 investigations with sample numbers collected in each study ranging from 14 to 97 amr bacteria were detected in 208 of the 442 samples of the 10 articles included 4 focused on culture based methods of detection only tejedor et al 2001 leonard et al 2015 schijven et al 2015 döhla et al 2019 three studies utilised pcr techniques combined with culture methods mahon et al 2017 vignaroli et al 2013 o flaherty et al 2019 mahon et al 2017 detected ndm producing e coli and ndm producing k pneumoniae similarly vignaroli et al 2013 employed pcr detection of virulence and antibiotic resistant genes two studies focused solely on molecular based methodologies di cesare et al 2015 herrig et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 synopsis of relevant literature identified this scoping review presents an insight into the occurrence of waterborne organisms of public health concern in european bathing waters the substantial quantity of investigations that met the inclusion criteria is indicative of the upsurge of research relating to contaminated bathing waters in recent years a limitation was placed on searches in accordance with the rbwd to include sample size and volume whereby sample size could not be less than 10 samples and sample volume must be greater than or equal to 100 ml reflective of the bathing water quality monitoring guidelines protocols a significant finding of this review is the regular occurrence in bathing waters of waterborne organisms that are beyond the scope of those currently monitored for under the rbwd overall the included investigations in this present review have demonstrated the great potential for bathing waters to be reservoirs of a wide array of potentially harmful organisms publication dates of included investigations ranged from 1985 to 2020 with the majority published following the 2006 bwd revision no investigations were identified prior to 1985 a range of water bodies were identified as vulnerable to contamination with the majority coastal 44 followed by freshwater 27 and two or more water categories 30 as seen in supplementary table s8 4 2 organisms of public health concern in bathing waters as previously outlined vibrio spp was the most detected organism persistent aquatic environmental reservoirs of vibrio spp could pose a health risk to humans vibrio cholera is the causative agent of cholera an acute diarrhoeal infection it should be noted that this disease is not endemic in europe and outbreaks are associated with poor hygiene and sanitation the results of the present review not only highlight their presence in bathing waters but also worrisome pathogenic factors of the vibrio strains such as haemolysin vibrio with haemolysin activity against erythrocytes can manifest as gastrointestinal infections or intestinal infections depending on their causative species mizuno et al 2020 in the present review an included study by boer et al 2013 reported testing for haemolytic capabilities in v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae strains with two v parahaemolyticus carrying the trh gene but not the tdh thermostable direct haemolysin tdh vibrio are commonly associated with gastroenteritis septicaemia and wound infection mizuno et al 2020 interestingly boer also performed the kanagawa haemolytic test which showed that two additional isolates neither having the trh or tdh genes had haemolytic abilities which suggests the presence of further haemolysis genes moreover boer tested 22 detected strains of v cholerae for the presence of ctxa and serotypes o1 and o139 with the latter being responsible for the diarrhoeal disease cholera however none of these strains were pathogenic boer also highlights the detection of v vulnificus bringing attention to the potential health risk caused by this organism due to its toxicity particularly with respect to wound infections boer clearly states the risk associated with this organism highlighting that this species does not correlate with current faecal indicators utilised in bathing water quality assessments in comparison another included study gyraite et al 2019 describes detection of v vulnificus using real time pcr methods that target the vvha haemolysin gene gyraite describes detectable levels of v vulnificus carrying this gene during the bathing seasons and in some cases the abundances of this organism were higher in bathing areas than other parts of the waters tested similar to methods utilised by boer masini et al 2007 utilised pcr methods of detection for the tdh and trh haemolysin genes with results showing that both v alginolyticus and v harveyi isolates harbouring trh genes lepuschitz et al 2019 detailed the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in 81 of 82 environmental vibrio spp isolates studied eighty of these displayed resistance to sulphonamides 25 were resistant to both sulphonamides and streptomycin 12 to sulphonamides and ampicillin 1 to ampicillin alone and 7 isolates were multidrug resistant sulphonamides ampicillin and streptomycin methods employed by the 8 studies detailing vibrio spp analysis largely employed cultivation on selective agars with the exception of panaiotov et al 2015 who employed microscopic and pcr analyses additionally lepuschitz et al 2019 did not use detection methods in their study rather the isolates were selected from an existing strain collection from a previous study pretzer et al 2017 the result from these included articles allows for the presumption that bathing waters contaminated with vibrio spp could contribute to the potential for illness following exposure to these waters similarly the occurrence of additional pathogenic bacteria associated with human illness were detected in bathing waters efstratiou et al 2009 and aulicino et al 2001 describe the detection of salmonella spp in waters classified as both good and sufficient respectively salmonella spp is a causative agent in a large percentage of gastrointestinal illnesses with some serotypes leading to typhoid and paratyphoid illness efstratiou et al 2009 mansilha et al 2010 although none were detected in the included studies aulicino et al 2001 identified salmonella derby which is the most identified cause of salmonellosis in europe sévellec et al 2020 another included study mansilha et al 2010 highlights the occurrence of salmonella spp in bathing waters classified as both good and excellent including non typhoidal serotypes of clinical importance such as s enteritidis and s typhimurium additionally arvanitidou et al 1995 detailed the occurrence of 4 2 campylobacter jejuni strains in 200 seawater samples that complied with the standards set furthermore the author also reported the occurrence of 7 17 campylobacter jejuni isolates in 41 river samples that did not meet the bwd standards arvanitidou furthermore details the occurrence of 7 4 yersinia intermedia in seawaters and 5 12 of the same organism in the river waters campylobacter enteritis is a major cause of acute enteritis globally with some cases linked to polluted waters arvanitidou et al 1995 hokajärvi et al 2013 describes the occurrence of campylobacter spp in 29 58 of 50 finnish bathing waters samples sewage effluents were simultaneously sampled and it was suggested that the observed presence of campylobacter spp in bathing waters could present a public health risk it could be speculated that the bathing waters in this study were contaminated by the sewage effluent due to the common occurrence of this bacteria with campylobacter coli strains detected in both sampling areas having indistinguishable smai and kpni profiles this highlighted the need for reinforcement measures and a higher sampling frequency to ensure bathing waters are free of sewage contaminants occurrences of pathogenic bacteria such as these in bathing waters having met or surpasses the standards set by the bwd is of significant concern campylobacter spp and salmonella spp are causative organisms of human gastrointestinal illnesses and therefore are a public health risk ecdc 2017 ecdc 2020 this highlights that whilst the current parameters are a useful detection method for similar organisms a more comprehensive panel of parameters should be established to effectively assess the risk of exposure to wophc in bathing waters whilst amr bacteria had one of the lesser sample sizes n 442 it had a 47 detection rate this highlighted amr as a substantial issue within bathing waters alongside viruses and other organisms amr is a globally recognised public health risk with increasing evidence highlighting its dissemination into the aquatic environment sanderson et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2019 hooban et al 2021 the present review highlights bathing waters as a potential reservoir for amr bacteria and multi drug resistant bacteria thus identifying a potential risk to bathing water users whilst there are currently insufficient investigations to quantify the public health risk associated with exposure to amr in bathing waters numerous authors have suggested the potential for colonisation with amr bacteria during use of contaminated waters leonard et al 2015 leonard et al 2018 mahon et al 2017 for example schijven et al 2015 described most sampling locations as having a good classification yet detected extended spectrum β lactamase producing esbl e coli at concentrations ranging up to 1 5 102 cfu l this research highlights that exposure to esbl e coli is possible in waters that have met or exceeded the standards set by the rbwd tejedor et al 2001 describes the identification of antibiotic resistant faecal enterococci in waters described as having met the mandatory bacteriological standards two strains of enterococci displayed high level aminoglycoside resistance leading to the suggestion that waterways could contribute to their spread and dissemination furthermore di cesare et al 2015 described pristine oligotrophic waters yet highlighted their study area as a reservoir for antibiotic resistant genes consideration could be given to examining characteristics of the current monitoring parameters for other organisms such as viral parameters or amr bacteria until recently bathing waters were not thought to be a key pathway in the dissemination of amr organisms according to the world health organisation 2018 however results from the present review and other recent advancements in this area of research suggest otherwise leonard et al 2015 world health organisation 2014 blaak 2014 mahon et al 2017 recreational exposure to bathing waters has the potential to present a pathway for transmission for antimicrobial resistance to the public hooban et al 2020 leonard et al 2018 vignaroli et al 2013 detected gentamycin and tetracycline resistant genes alongside enterococcus associated virulence determinants cylb esp and gele di cesare et al 2015 reported detection of tet a bla ctx m str b and sulii genes in their research herrig et al 2020 employed solely molecular techniques in the form of dna extraction and qpcr to detect bla ctx m genes with genes detected in all water samples throughout the sampling period furthermore lepuschitz et al 2019 utilised whole genome sequencing wgs to confirm 3 enterobacter mori with st1009 plasmids 1 e coli incl1 plasmid and virulencefinder to detect the presence of one e coli isolate with the virulence gene iss bacteria utilise a variety of mechanisms to become resistant to antibiotics but whilst all are worrisome acquired resistances from the bacteria s surroundings such as the antibiotic inactivating enzymes or acquired mechanisms such as modification enzymes that specifically target or modify the antibiotic are of grave concern peterson and kaur 2018 the presence of amr genes in bathing waters is of significant concern and there is a need for evaluation of bathing waters globally for amr there is potential for bacteria to acquire resistance mechanisms through the aquatic environment which could lead to their spread and subsequent further transmission hooban et al 2020 nappier et al 2020 the low percentage of investigations that sought to identify amr bacteria in bathing waters 10 highlights a key research gap whilst the role of the aquatic environment in the dissemination of amr bacteria is increasingly being recognised further research is required to satisfy research gaps before the environment and public health impact of amr in bathing waters can be fully understood six different viruses were identified in this study supplementary table s7 the high volume of research examining the prevalence of adenovirus adv is likely due to the hypothesis that this virus is most favourable to use as a virologic marker for water quality silva et al 2010 numerous additional investigations to the present review have identified this virus as an indicator of faecal contamination carducci et al 2008 silva et al 2011 hewitt et al 2013 supporting its use as an indicator hewitt et al 2013 compares the occurrence of adv in the environment to norovirus which is considered a significant human virus that is not as universally present the 2019 pandemic of the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 has caused high levels of morbidity and mortality globally this rapidly spreading virus has been detected in wastewater samples ahmed et al 2020 lodder et al 2020 and faecal specimens pan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 globally despite this recent reviews have outlined that the risk of sars cov 2 exposure in bathing waters is thought to be low cahill et al 2020 carducci et al 2020 however further research is required protozoan contaminants were broken down into cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp accumulating to 4 of the total sample number of included investigations overall a greater number of samples were examined for cryptosporidium n 894 however only 17 of these resulted in detection similarly giardia had a sample number of 854 with 17 detected many articles excluded in the title and abstract screening for this organism category were due to sampling from treated waters e g swimming pools plutzer et al 2019 detailed one such study where an outbreak of cryptosporidium occurred on a residential rehabilitation holiday for paediatric organ transplant patients in hungary this study found that cases were 7 times more likely than controls to have swum in the children s pool and 5 times more likely to have used the whirlpool cryptosporidium occurrence in treated pools is likely due to infection control difficulties where resistance occurs at certain chlorine levels plutzer et al 2019 e coli and intestinal enterococci are not well correlated with the pathogenic cryptosporidium and giardia further enhancing the argument that additional parameters should be included in current regulations one such additional parameter clostridium perfringens is mentioned in rodrigues et al 2017 critical review of current microbiological assessments in bathing waters c perfringens can be a useful indicator for pathogenic organisms such as cryptosporidium giardia salmonella adenoviruses and enteroviruses due to good correlations wu et al 2011 furthermore c perfringens spores have been proposed as secondary indicators of faecal pollution due to resulting from faecal origins themselves stelma 2018 4 3 detection and sampling methods employed large variations in methods employed were observed amongst the included investigations which meant that it was not possible to directly compare results of selected investigations small volumes of 100 ml were collected for analysis in some situations whilst larger volumes of 100 l were collected in others however variances in methods amongst the investigations selected per organism group resulted in difficulties for comparison with some investigations utilising genotypic methods such as pcr whilst others utilised culture based methods methodological approach is especially relevant when evaluating difficult to culture organisms such as protozoans in bathing waters the process of detection generally includes filtration and immunomagnetic separation as concentration methods followed by contrast staining fluorescent antibodies and microscopic detection herein known as the usepa method however these fail to identify the organisms species bringing into question whether the human health risk can be appropriately assessed whilst widely utilised the usepa method does not differentiate between pathogenic and non pathogenic cryptosporidium or giardia as outlined by adamska et al 2015 this raises questions about whether an adequate risk assessment can be made using these methods and highlights the need for more sensitive methods such as pcr these specific methodologies could allow for a more appropriate risk assessment molecular methods such as these were utilised by adamska et al 2015 allowing for the conclusion that whilst low confirmed rates of c parvum and g intestinalis were noted in the sampled waters the identification of these specific pathogens indicates that the microbial quality of the examined waters has been impacted additionally attention should be given to the issue that whilst an organism may be detected this does not give information regarding its infectivity leaving the risk essentially unknown molecular methods such as pcr have been described as not only a more rapid method but also more specific when compared with culture based methods morris et al 2016 similar pcr methods were employed by many authors coupe et al 2006 ehsan et al 2012 galvan et al 2014 sales ortellis et al 2015 however three studies failed to employ specific identification methods castro hermida et al 2010 julio et al 2012 schets et al 2008 whilst the findings from these studies identify organisms of concern in bathing waters they fail to identify whether the organisms detected have the potential to be pathogenic and in the case of pcr whether they are viable this limits the conclusions that can be established highlighting more so a general overview of the presence of organisms rather than a true evaluation of the potential public health risk moreover difficulties can arise with detection especially in the case of viruses identification of contaminated waters requires sensitive assays to detect even low viral numbers julian and schwab 2011 conventional methods of detection and quantification of viruses are generally culture and or molecular based such as pcr and involve two important steps concentration and target detection symonds and breitbart 2014 challenges occur relating to these methods due to differences and limitations in viral collection viability assessment and concentration methods when sampling waters however improved detection methods are becoming increasingly available regardless it is clear viruses are of increasing concern in bathing waters yet reliance still lies with bacterial indicators for contamination alerts gibson et al 2014 whilst fio s are still favourable due to the readily available low cost methods of culture it should be noted that as overall parameters they do not always warn of the presence of viral contamination therefore re introduction of a viral indicator should be considered as with the 1976 bwd unfortunately previous reviews have indicated that due to the high variability of environmental persistence and epidemiology of viruses in particular enteric viruses it is unlikely that a single viral indicator will suffice to adequate assess the potential contamination symonds and breitbart 2014 this highlights that whilst it is evident that no single indicator can predict illness wade et al 2003 there is a need for a greater spectrum of testing for each category analysed in the present review alongside a standardised method of testing bathing waters the large variance in sampling design i e sample size and volume employed demonstrates a lack of standardisation amongst environmental sampling and laboratory processing which prevents robust comparison amongst reported results this created a challenge to interpreting data and to overcome this results were interpreted as positives per sample rather than concentration detected a common sampling approach amongst coastal based investigation stipulated collection of water samples at an approximate depth of 30 cm below surface n 14 which is in accordance with rbwd criteria whilst the rbwd suggests a total sample volume of 750 ml to include physicochemical testing 22 investigations collected samples less than this volume this is a significant research gap with respect to a homogeneous approach to sampling bathing waters but also created a challenge for interpreting data 4 4 water quality and public health water quality in the eu has improved following the introduction of the revised bwd 2006 therefore the risk of illness has reduced over this time leonard et al 2018 however several articles have shown the presence of organisms with the potential to cause illness or harm in bathing waters identified as meeting the standards of either bwd for its time mahon et al 2017 o flaherty et al schets et al 2008 schvoerer et al 2000 schijven et al 2015 pianetti et al 2000 kokkinos et al 2018 in the study of kokkinos et al 2018 out of 72 samples analysed 23 33 were positive for one or more viruses with human adenovirus detected in 29 of samples kokkinos et al 2018 reported that based on bacterial parameters sea and freshwater samples met the standard limits set according to the rbwd however human adenoviruses were detected in samples at all sites with hepatitis a also discovered on one occasion human adenoviruses have been noted as reliable indicators of faecal contamination of human origins and their detection could imply presence of other pathogenic viruses such as norovirus detected in 3 out of 72 samples in kokkinos et al 2018 as previously outlined bathing water quality is monitored by estimating the number of fios present however these standardised methods typically take over 24 h to be reported wade et al 2010 consequently it is not feasible to assess bathing water quality without this 24 hour delay wade et al 2006 which could subject the public to unknown risks hampers the provision of real time results and deprives the public of possible warnings colford et al 2012 this study raises the concern regarding whether at sites where water quality is variable the sampling results inform the public in a timely manner about the water quality on any given day this emphasises a need for increased frequency in sampling furthermore additional studies not included in the present review colford et al 2007 arnold et al 2013 have highlighted that the incidence of illness such as diarrhoea in some cases is not associated with the current indicators used to monitor bathing water quality these studies were not included in the present review as they did not directly sample bathing waters instead surveying water users both studies suggest a requirement for alternative methods for analysing water quality with a broader spectrum of parameters needed overall it is clear that an increased frequency of sampling is required with stricter management procedures during times of risk such as heavy rainfall to avoid potential public health hazards this is addressed in a recent report by the eea 2021 whereby it was noted that extreme weather events need to be addressed through an integrated urban management approach this includes forecasting potential pollution in lieu of extreme events such as excessive rainfall or storm water outflow and introducing further management procedures when pollution is detected such as pre closure of bathing areas ahead of forecasted storms for example currently warning systems are in place to warn bathers of the risk after pollution events however these management strategies should be updated to incorporate early warning systems with the introduction of the rbwd the aim of enhancing public health protection alongside environmental protection from faecal pollution through an improved monitoring and management strategy of bathing sites was established this directive specifies more stringent microbiological standards using faecal indicator bacteria intestinal enterococci and e coli for health risk predications from bathing stidson et al 2012 this excludes previous parameters such as total coliforms faecal coliforms faecal streptococci salmonella and enteroviruses however the rbwd allows for temporary moderation of these standards during short term pollution events where 15 of the total samples over a 4 year monitoring period can be effectively discounted nevertheless this can only be implemented where the occurrence of such events can be predicted and public advisory notices issued whilst the bwd aims to enhance public health protection it could be argued that including only two parameters as a means of classifying water quality is not sufficient to detect risks to public health from bathing water use whilst the introduction of the rbwd brought great improvements such as the classification system of poor to excellent recommendations to improve upon the rbwd have been published globally world health organisation 2018 exclusion of some parameters such as viral parameters is likely due to feasibility issues exclusion of other parameters such as amr require review particularly in relation to organisms resulting from contaminant sources surveillance of amr and organisms of concern in bathing waters will aid in protection of human health whilst also enhancing ecosystem health and preventing dissemination of these organisms of health concern there is a need to develop a harmonised approach to environmental surveillance for amr one potential approach could be to adopt the approach taken by the esbl tricycle amr surveillance project matheu et al 2017 as highlighted by this project there is a need for an integrated approach to surveillance of amr across the human health animal health and environmental sectors as systems have been developed for the surveillance of esbl producing e coli in the human and animal sectors this could prove a useful target for environmental surveillance surveillance of prevalence and concentrations of these wophc are fundamental to developing risk assessments for bathing waters and prioritizing development of policy and management strategies to reduce this when the rbwd is reviewed the potential issues for inclusion of other parameters such as elevated cost and time should be addressed 4 5 recommendations for research policy and practice a recommendation arising from this review is that consistent reporting of sample size and volumes collected should be applied to limit insufficient detail in investigations and strengthen evidence synthesis in this area therefore it is recommended that authors state initial sample volumes taken overall sample size and if the water is designated for bathing the classification status at the time of sampling should also be reported future research should also consider the public health risks arising from contaminated bathing water concerning the interpretation of results extracting data from investigations was not always feasible e g graphs displaying concentrations with no corresponding table or supplementary material in this review a range of sources have been linked as potential contaminants in the aquatic environment such as wwtp effluent agricultural pollution and urban outflows over half of the included investigations referred to a type of pollution representing a potential source of contamination into the aquatic environment and subsequent bathing exposure as such research into the public health risk arising from use of bathing waters is urgently needed with regards to current methodology for monitoring bathing water quality consideration should be given to updating recommended methods to allow for detection of wophc additionally classification systems should rest solely on a 95 confidence interval as opposed to both a 90 and 95 confidence interval to further increase water quality standards across europe as advised by the who in accordance with the who recommendations the present review supports the suggestion that the total number of samples during a four year bathing period be increased to 20 from 16 the present review also provides evidence for the need for larger sample volumes to obtain a greater representation of the bathing area as previously outlined the bwd 2006 states that samples taken during transient pollution events may be disregarded during annual compliance assessments the interference of this with accurate annual classifications cannot be ruled out in summary the following courses of action are recommended to aid in current understandings of the risk factors associated with wophc in bathing waters an increased temporal sampling regime rather than once off sampling methodology a universal homogeneous methodology allowing for comparisons amongst study outcomes it is recommended that there is a harmonisation of sample volume collected and methodologies used for analysis increased research into amr in bathing waters regulated and unregulated and its potential inclusion as a parameter in the bwd standardised methodologies such as those developed by the esbl tricycle amr surveillance protocol should be established to provide a cohesive multidisciplinary surveillance of amr in bathing waters further research to define suitable indicators that represent each of the three categories alongside risk based identification of locally important wophc for monitoring detailed reporting of methods in articles particularly in terms of study sample sizes and volumes these arising recommendations rely on enhanced methodologies and surveillance therefore efforts must be implemented to establish an efficient universal affordable standard for the detection of wophc to enhance public health protection 4 6 study limitations providing an accurate representation of the european prevalence of wophc in bathing waters is a difficult task this is due to an inconsistency of uniform sampling designs methodology and reporting of results this research was guided by european policy and resources there is potential to expand this review beyond europe to compare results study designs and procedures although articles were gathered from a variety of databases the search was performed in english excluding those not in the english language due to limited time and resources additionally six texts were not available for full text screening despite best efforts several gaps in the information provided by investigations led to a high exclusion rate of potentially significant investigations for this reason the most important of these was sample volume where many investigations mentioned the amount of water filtered during the testing procedure but not the initial volume collected nonetheless this study allowed for a comprehensive review of wophc amongst bathing waters in europe and highlighted important improvements that should be considered for implementation in the next european bwd revision 5 conclusion this review demonstrates the importance of bathing waters as significant reservoirs of waterborne organisms with the potential to impact upon public health and could be used to inform bathing water management and policy however there is a need for further research in this area alongside standardised robust methodologies to allow for better inter study comparison nonetheless the findings of this review highlight the extent and significance of contamination of european bathing waters by a variety of potentially harmful organisms that are currently beyond the scope of the rbwd and support the

16533,antineoplastic compounds designed for chemotherapeutic anticancer therapy have become emerging contaminants of global concern over the past decade due to their ubiquitous occurrence environmental persistence and multiple adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems increasing efforts have been devoted to developing efficient strategies for remediating water containing these micropollutants in this study the physicochemical properties natural attenuation and chemical reactivity with aqueous oxidizing species of five antineoplastic drugs with the highest environmental prevalence i e tamoxifen cyclophosphamide ifosfamide 5 fluorouracil and methotrexate were summarized the removal performance transformation products tps of varying structures overall reaction pathways and toxicity evolution during different treatments were evaluated and discussed additionally the biodegradability and multi endpoint toxicity of each tp were predicted using in silico qsar software depending on their distinct inherent structures the reactivity of the antineoplastics with oxidizing species varied with hydroxyl radicals exhibiting unparalleled merits in rapid oxidation complete elimination of these contaminants was observed during oxidative treatments but with inadequate mineralization notably the increase in toxicity within multiple processes was determined based on both experimental bioassays and theoretical predictions this may be attributed to the adverse effects induced by the large number of identified and unknown tps individually and in combination together with the environmental persistence and low biodegradability of most tps these results necessitate the application of efficient post treatments in conjunction with a more thorough water safety evaluation e g using high throughput screening of the mixtures of treated water and wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antineoplastic agents water environment transformation products reaction pathways toxicity evaluation 1 introduction according to the latest report from the international agency for research on cancer iarc of the world health organization who 19 29 million new cancer cases were recorded in 2020 with 9 96 million cancer related deaths therefore it is the second leading cause of death worldwide wild et al 2020 the remarkable increase in cancer incidence each year has led to enhanced prescription and use of antineoplastic compounds also named anticancer or cytostatic drugs during chemotherapeutic therapy grbovic huezo et al 2020 pisa and kapoor 2020 recent studies have demonstrated a growing interest in the development and application of these chemicals in medicine lee et al 2021 slade and eustermann 2020 van der velden et al 2019 notably publications on the occurrence toxicity and remediation strategies of antineoplastic compounds in the environment also considerably increased over the past decade fig 1 these chemicals can be incidentally released into natural waters in their unchanged forms through two main routes 1 human excretion due to their incomplete metabolism and 2 wastewater effluents as their elimination by wastewater treatment plants is limited ferrando climent et al 2014 yadav et al 2021 increasing evidence has emphasized their environmental prevalence in multiple water sources worldwide with detected concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l cristóvão et al 2020 li et al 2021a nassour et al 2020 queirós et al 2021 wormington et al 2020 antineoplastic compounds exert adverse biological effects by triggering cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic effects novak et al 2017 toolaram et al 2014 additionally at environmental relevant levels these chemicals can significantly affect the development and reproduction of different aquatic models at the molecular level such as daphnia magna d magna and zebrafish danio rerio fonseca et al 2018 hung et al 2021 jo et al 2018 russo et al 2018a wormington et al 2020 therefore antineoplastic chemicals have become emerging pollutants of global concern gouveia et al 2019 heath et al 2020 jureczko and kalka 2020 li et al 2021a mišík et al 2019 a considerable number of efforts have been chronicled and devoted to developing cost efficient treatment methods for removing antineoplastic chemicals from water mirsadeghi et al 2020 pieczyńska et al 2017 yadav et al 2021 recent review articles have reported that oxidative treatments particularly advanced oxidation processes aops play a critical role in eliminating these pollutants by producing highly reactive oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals ho with low regioselectivity garcia costa et al 2021 janssens et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2021 pieczyńska et al 2017 tripathi et al 2020 yadav et al 2021 however inadequate mineralization of antineoplastic agents has commonly been observed and reported during these treatments leading to the generation of recalcitrant transformation products tps with diverse structures garcia costa et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 yadav et al 2021 these identified tps could be persistent with long term stability in the aquatic cycle and exert more severe acute and chronic toxicity than their parent compounds based on experimental results or in silico toxicity predictions lai et al 2017b mukherjee et al 2021 toolaram et al 2014 similarly enhanced toxicity from environmentally produced tps of other organic pollutants e g antibiotics and carbon dots has also been reported jaén gil et al 2020 liu et al 2021 tian et al 2020 their ubiquitous co existence has been reported in different water bodies feng et al 2021 mestankova et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in previous review articles kümmerer and his colleagues predicted and emphasized the increasing challenges to water safety assessment owing to the presence of various tps of different pharmaceuticals poses including antineoplastic drugs haddad et al 2015 toolaram et al 2014 therefore the current status of the removal efficiency mineralization tp formation and toxicity evolution of these antineoplastic contaminants during water treatment processes must urgently been determined in particular treatment driven alterations in the toxicity of water have not yet been extensively reviewed which is of vital importance for evaluating the potential environmental risks introduced by the aqueous co existence of antineoplastic agents and their tps in addition to their acute and chronic ecotoxicological potency in non target organisms the resulting tps may also induce multi endpoint toxicity such as genotoxicity developmental toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects however such important toxicity data which are vital for pollution control and water safety evaluation remain limited these results can be largely supplemented and predicted using well established in silico prediction software such as epi suitetm comptox and qsar toolbox they have been widely used and recommended for predicting the toxicity of tps originating from the oxidative transformation of different antineoplastic chemicals della flora et al 2020 sanabria et al 2021 secrétan et al 2019 toolaram et al 2014 the objectives of this review are as follows 1 to summarize the reported physicochemical properties and natural attenuation performance of the five most widely used and environmentally prevalent antineoplastic compounds with the most adverse reported effects on aquatic ecosystems in three different mechanistic categories i e tamoxifen tam as the hormonal agent cyclophosphamide cp and ifosfamide ifo as the alkylating chemicals 5 fluorouracil 5 fu and methotrexate mtx as the antimetabolites see their structures in fig 1 in particular their reactivity with different reactive species e g ho ozone and chlorine in water was outlined and discussed 2 to understand and compare the overall removal efficiency mineralization rate degradation products and reaction pathways of these compounds induced by different water treatment reagents technologies which mainly included aops and disinfection processes i e uv ozone and chlorine and 3 more importantly to analyze the current state of knowledge regarding the treatment driven toxicity evolution of these emerging micropollutants along with their aqueous decomposition in addition to the measured toxicity changes of five antineoplastic compounds during water treatment processes multi endpoint toxicity prediction and biodegradation evaluation of all reported tps were conducted using different in silico approaches based on the state of the art review and systematic analysis research limitations and knowledge gaps for future safety assessment of antineoplastic contaminated water during conventional and emerging water and wastewater treatment were also suggested 2 physicochemical and environmentally relevant properties of typical antineoplastic compounds the main physicochemical properties e g water solubility pk a and logk ow natural attenuation i e photolysis hydrolysis and biodegradability aqueous reactivity with different oxidizing species and their maximum concentrations in natural waters of five typical antineoplastics i e tam cp ifo 5 fu and mtx were scrutinized and are listed in table 1 the available degradation rates percentages of cp ifo and 5 fu via three different natural attenuation mechanisms were relatively low franquet griell et al 2017b lin et al 2014 along with their reported environmental concentrations these data highlight the wide range in the degree of persistence and contamination of three different categories of antineoplastic agents in the aquatic environment regarding the oxidation kinetics garcia ac et al 2010 reported the second order rate constants k of cp with ozone and ho at ph 8 10 which were 3 3 0 2 m 1 s 1 and 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively table 1 blaney et al 2019 reported similar data obtaining the transformation kinetics of cp and ifo by ozone and ho using continuous oxidation addition reactors with the individual k values reporting as 2 58 3 30 m 1 s 1 cp and ozone 2 00 2 69 109 m 1 s 1 cp and ho 6 95 0 21 m 1 s 1 ifo and ozone and 2 73 0 16 109 m 1 s 1 ifo and ho table 1 the k values of mtx with ozone and ho were determined as 3 6 103 m 1 s 1 garcia ac et al 2010 and 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 lai et al 2017b respectively despite the lower k value i e 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 of mtx with carbonate radicals co3 than that with ho introducing hco3 into the uv tio2 system significantly shortened the reaction time for the complete elimination of mtx from 90 min no hco3 to 10 min with 400 mg l hco3 lai et al 2017b this was attributed to the higher abundance of co3 that preferentially attacked the 4 aminobenzamide 4 aba moiety of mtx and altered its decomposition pathways by uv tio2 treatment regarding 5 fu its k values with ozone ho chlorine and bromine at ph 7 were measured to be 7 07 0 11 104 m 1 s 1 1 52 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 14 8 m 1 s 1 and 1 9 103 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2019 ganzenko et al 2018 li et al 2015 table 1 among all five target antineoplastic compounds tam exhibited the highest reactivity with ozone at ph 7 reaching 0 383 1 04 106 m 1 s 1 knoop et al 2018a the combined data indicated their distinct reactivity with these oxidizing species suggesting their inherent structural stability in water treatment together with their continuous introduction into the aquatic cycle it can be inferred that they may exhibit degradation recalcitrance under conventional water treatment processes or even aops particularly in the presence of different water matrices acting as effective and competitive radical quenchers 3 transformation pathways and toxicity evaluation of antineoplastics in water table 2 presents detailed information regarding the removal efficiency mineralization rate tp formation and biodegradability toxicity evaluation of the five antineoplastic agents during different water treatment processes the remediation techniques particularly aops such as photocatalysis and fenton like oxidation were highly effective under the optimized experimental conditions mostly achieving 90 aqueous removal for all five antineoplastic drugs however even the complete elimination of the parent compounds e g 5 fu and cp did not represent their efficient mineralization which was recorded as 70 for most of the treatments table 2 the maximum mineralization rate was 89 6 for the photocatalytic oxidation of cp in an uv tio2 system after 256 min of reaction lutterbeck et al 2015b these phenomena demonstrated the generation of various tps with robust structural stability which could be more recalcitrant to be further oxidized by reactive species additionally the increased toxicity of antineoplastic compounds has been widely demonstrated based on toxicity bioassays of reaction solutions conducted before and after oxidative treatments table 2 however it should be mentioned that different types of experimental factors such as the type and concentration of the target micropollutant type of aop applied dosage of the associated agents exposure sensitivity of the test organisms background water chemistry and reaction time would affect the toxicity evolution of antineoplastic compounds when using aops for water treatment the observed toxicity change was caused by the combined and integrated effects of all these experimental conditions accurately distinguishing the individual influences and contributions of these factors on the observed toxic effects would be difficult and complicated generally increasing the dosages of the associated agents in aops and extending the reaction time would reduce the final toxicity due to the improved removal efficiency and mineralization of the treated water overall these findings emphasize the importance of conducting environmental risk assessments of the cocktail mixtures of treated water in which the individual tps or their combination may pose a comparative or even higher toxicity than the pollutant itself however limited knowledge is available to systematically evaluate the aquatic toxicity of individual tps as mentioned above in silico predictions have recently been recognized as useful tools for gathering the physicochemical properties e g biodegradability and biological effects e g multi endpoint toxicity of the tps of antineoplastic compounds della flora et al 2020 sanabria et al 2021 secrétan et al 2019 however the reliability of these predicted results depends on the correct establishment of their chemical structures concerning the tp identification recent degradation studies of this class of emerging contaminants have mostly used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms haddad et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2021 pieczyńska et al 2017 generally this analytical method could provide high resolution and relatively accurate information regarding the molecular composition via ms and structural fragments via ms ms of analytes these data facilitate a reasonable proposal of the structures of tps and their possible transformation pathways 3 1 tam tam is one of the most extensively used drugs for the prevention of the reoccurrence of hormone dependent breast cancer criscitiello et al 2011 owing to its low water solubility i e 300 μg l and limited analytical detection using high performance liquid chromatography hplc few studies have focused on its aqueous degradation which mainly involved the use of ozone and fenton like oxidation ferrando climent et al 2017 knoop et al 2018a it has recently been demonstrated that uv based photolysis and aops including o3 o3 uv o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 could completely remove tam initial concentration 100 μg l from water within 240 min ferrando climent et al 2017 nine tps were detected during these treatments and their degradation pathways were proposed fig 2 based on toxicity evaluation using microtox bioassays the significantly enhanced toxic potency was observed for tam during all aop based treatments table 2 these results highlight the importance of post aop treatments e g biological degradation in eliminating or minimizing the environmental risks induced by tam and or its tps in a recent study knoop et al 2018a evaluated the reaction kinetics and tp formation of tam by ozonation at different solution ph levels with five identified tps i e a primary tam n oxide and two secondary tps tp 286 and tp 404 at ph 5 two primary tps tp 270 and tp 388 at ph 5 as illustrated in fig 2 three main reaction mechanisms were elucidated including the criegee reaction hydroxylation and n oxide formation subsequent toxicity investigations at ph 3 and 7 suggested that the initial immobilization of d magna by tam was removed after exposure to an ozone treated tam solution for 48 h knoop et al 2018c however after treating tam with a molar ratio of o3 tam up to 4 growth inhibition of green algae was significantly increased over 60 h of exposure according to the correlation analysis between the peak area of tps and toxicity evolution tp 270 and tp 388 generated as the major tps at ph 5 were proposed as those responsible for the enhanced toxicity knoop et al 2018c additionally anti estrogenic activity evaluation indicated that tp 270 could induce an increase in endocrine effects knoop et al 2018b meanwhile tam n oxide the predominant tp formed under a neutral ph exhibited diminished anti estrogenic activity these findings suggested that ozonation could remove the acute toxicity and endocrine effects of tam in natural water bodies i e ph 5 it should be mentioned that toxicity evolutions varied among these studies which may be largely attributed to the distinct experimental conditions such as the initial concentrations of tam and ozone and the reaction ph and sensitivity of test organisms or toxicity endpoints in contrast to its high reactivity with ozone tam is fairly recalcitrant to chlorination i e no degradation within 24 h while its two major metabolites i e 4 hydroxy tam and 4 hydroxy n desmethyl tam can be quickly oxidized by free chlorine negreira et al 2015 3 2 cp and ifo cp and ifo are oxazaphosphorine alkylating agents used in chemotherapy cancer treatment worldwide owing to their structural similarity most degradation studies investigated these two compounds together and compared their reactivity removal efficiency product identification and toxicity evolution the abilities of different aop based treatment strategies to eliminate cp and ifo have been tested including photocatalysis ozonation electrochemical oxidation and uv h2o2 blaney et al 2019 česen et al 2016 fabiańska et al 2015 fiszka borzyszkowska et al 2016 graumans et al 2020 lai et al 2017a 2015 ofiarska et al 2016 russo et al 2018b siedlecka et al 2018 lin et al 2015 these oxidative systems have achieved excellent removal efficiencies i e 95 100 of cp and ifo suggesting their feasibility in water and wastewater decontamination table 2 however their recorded mineralization rates range from 15 to 89 6 suggesting the formation of tps with higher oxidative recalcitrance and structural stability as presented in figs s1 and s2 cp and ifo have a total of 25 and 35 identified tps respectively most of which were detected during photocatalytic and electrocatalytic oxidation however the lack of knowledge in the literature regarding the reaction mechanisms of cp and ifo during aops hinders clear and stepwise interpretations of their overall reaction pathways the existing information suggests that hydroxylation and cleavage of c n c cl and n p bonds are the dominant reaction patterns for these two oxazaphosphorines in oxidative systems regarding the environmental risks of the treated solutions lutterbeck et al 2015b reported no toxicity for the tps generated by uv h2o2 and uv tio2 treatments of cp which were based on acute and chronic toxicity bioassays using vibrio fischeri v fischeri however enhanced toxicity was observed for these two compounds when treated by uv irradiation russo et al 2018b ozonation lin et al 2015 uv tio2 based photocatalysis lai et al 2017a 2015 lin and lin 2014 and electrochemical oxidation siedlecka et al 2018 these distinct phenomena might be attributed to the combined effects of the different conditions used for pollutant degradation such as the dosage and type of oxidative treatments reaction ph and water chemistry and toxicity bioassays such as the exposure time and sensitivity of different test organisms and some operating details such as the dilution factors of test solutions and initial concentrations of v fischeri which were not mentioned in the articles for example photocatalytic treatments of cp and ifo resulted in an initial increase in acute toxicity to v fischeri reaching the maximum bioluminescence inhibition after 60 min and 120 min of irradiation respectively further oxidation led to decreased toxic potency with no bioluminescence inhibition observed after 360 min of the photocatalytic oxidation of these two compounds lai et al 2015 in their subsequent study on cp and ifo lai et al 2017a found that introducing 800 mg l of hco3 or cl into the photocatalytic system resulted in treated solutions with higher toxicity than those without these anions these phenomena may be attributed to the different oxidative mechanisms of selective co3 and cl from non selective ho which attacked cp or ifo to generate new byproducts with higher toxicity similarly siedlecka et al 2018 reported a significant increase in growth inhibition of lemna minor l minor after exposure to cp or ifo before and after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation specifically the parent compounds induced no growth inhibition while it gradually enhanced as the reaction continued eventually reaching 100 inhibition for l minor overall these increases in toxicity may have been due to the combined effects of tp mixtures particularly chlorinated byproducts lai et al 2015 3 3 5 fu since its introduction in cancer treatment in the late 1950s 5 fu has become the most extensively used antimetabolite to disrupt enzyme activity and interfere with dna synthesis li et al 2021a among the five antineoplastic compounds 5 fu has attracted the most attention for pollution remediation particularly using aops e g photocatalysis electrocatalysis ozonation and fenton like oxidations ganzenko et al 2018 governo et al 2017 koltsakidou et al 2017a b lin et al 2015 lin and lin 2014 lutterbeck et al 2015c siedlecka et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a hydroxylation defluorination and ring opening have been proposed as the dominant reaction patterns fig s3 complete removal of 5 fu with no or few toxic residues has been widely achieved by photocatalytic treatment lin and lin 2014 electrochemical oxidation siedlecka et al 2018 solar driven photoelectrocatalytic oxidation mazierski et al 2019 and photo assisted oxidation governo et al 2017 table 2 additionally lutterbeck et al 2015c reported complete elimination of 5 fu by three aops i e uv h2o2 uv fe2 h2o2 and uv tio2 within 30 min and found enhanced biodegradability and reduced toxicity of 5 fu treated by an uv h2o2 system additionally ozone could efficiently eliminate 5 fu and its toxicity by attacking the olefin moiety via the criegee mechanism thereby producing tp 196 and tp 160d fig s3 chen et al 2019 further transformation occurred to form carboxylic acids as the dominant components of the residual levels of total organic carbon toc regarding the chlorination process 5 fu presented a relatively low reactivity with free chlorine i e 14 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 which produced five tps of unknown toxicity fig s3 li et al 2015 uv irradiation another disinfection method can achieve complete removal of 5 fu within 32 min lutterbeck et al 2016 the formed tps have higher biodegradability and lower toxicity than the parent compound these findings indicate that uv irradiation can be used as an efficient pre treatment which can be combined with post biodegradation and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption for water purification in contrast zhang et al 2017b reported that the presence of humic acid ha and nitrate ions no3 could trigger indirect photodegradation under uv irradiation thereby changing the reaction pathways specifically bond cleavage of 5 fu occurred during direct photodegradation while the introduction of ha and no3 resulted in electron transfer and addition reactions respectively overall studies on the degradation of 5 fu suggested that it could be efficiently removed by aops and the resulting environmental risks could be reduced considering the complexity of natural water bodies the potential environmental risks of antineoplastic compounds during water treatment with co existing components require further investigation given the co occurrence of 5 fu with other pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments li et al 2021a wormington et al 2020 their toxicity evolution during water treatment should not be ignored lin et al 2015 reported the ozonation of mixtures of three antineoplastics i e 5 fu cp and ifo and a vasodilator pharmaceutical pentoxifylline in which the acute toxicity of microtox was enhanced more recently evgenidou et al 2020 investigated tp formation and toxicity changes during the photocatalytic degradation of four antineoplastic mixtures including tam cp 5 fu and cytarabine using polyester tio2 films in water these compounds could be effectively removed within 360 min and 70 tps were identified in total the evaluation of the mixture effects on d magna indicated that the toxicity initially decreased and then increased with the proceeding photocatalytic oxidation the relative toxic potency and contributions of each tp were determined using ecosar software and the enhanced toxicity may have been due to the effects of unidentified tps and or their synergistic interactions with the detected tps therefore the current strategies for product identification and toxicological analysis of the aqueous transformation of antineoplastic compounds should be improved to elucidate the factors causing these alarming environmental risks 3 4 mtx as a commonly consumed antimetabolite in anticancer treatment worldwide mtx was designed to disrupt folate metabolism and interfere with dna synthesis thereby rapidly killing the growing cells lai et al 2017b mtx is composed of three major chemical moieties i e glutamic acid 4 aba and a diamino pteridine ring recent investigations have mainly focused on the application of aops including photocatalysis electrocatalysis and fenton like oxidations for degrading mtx in water barışçı et al 2018 calza et al 2014 lai et al 2017b lutterbeck et al 2015a siedlecka et al 2018 aops have been demonstrated as highly effective remediation approaches for mtx decontamination which was attributed to the powerful oxidizing capability of ho k ho mtx 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 however it cannot be ignored that different tps with varying structures were generated by these oxidative systems leading to inadequate mineralization table 2 the reaction pathways of mtx under three above aops were scrutinized and are summarized in fig s4 as previous studies reported no detailed reaction steps and mechanisms only the proposed structures of tps were provided lutterbeck et al 2015a reported that the tps generated by the uv h2o2 oxidation of mtx were less biodegradable and less toxic to v fischeri similar reductions in toxicity were also observed for uv tio2 calza et al 2014 and boron doped diamond assisted electrochemical oxidation treatments siedlecka et al 2018 using v fischeri and l minor as the target species respectively however based on the acute toxicity tests conducted on v fischeri the toxicity of the treated mtx solutions was enhanced when using electrocatalytic oxidation with a ti iro2 ruo2 electrode barışçı et al 2018 and photocatalytic oxidation via uv tio2 hco3 lai et al 2017b the difference in toxicity evolution from that of another electrochemical oxidation system siedlecka et al 2018 could be attributed to the completely different experimental conditions particularly the sensitivity of v fischeri and l minor which exerted a combined effect on the final toxicity in the latter study multiple reaction mechanisms were proposed such as hydroxylation deamination and c n c c bond cleavage lai et al 2017b the produced co3 preferentially attacked the 4 aba moiety of the mtx molecule leading to the formation of different tps with higher toxicity additionally uv peroxymonosulfate pms technology was investigated for eliminating mtx by producing sulfate radicals so4 and ho in water kanjal et al 2020 this oxidative system rapidly decomposed and effectively mineralized mtx achieving 90 removal and 65 mineralization within 30 min table 2 four major tps of mtx were identified and degradation pathways were proposed accordingly the degradation mechanisms included the cleavage of the peptide bond of mtx to yield tp 325 c n bond cleavage to generate tp 190 and tp 151 and the oxidation of the aldehyde moiety of tp 190 to form tp 206 with the carboxylic acid group fig s4 regarding the aqueous transformation of mtx during conventional disinfection both roig et al 2014 and yin et al 2017 reported rapid mtx removal by chlorination at an initial concentration of 1 mg l table 2 the incomplete mineralization indicated the formation of different tps which were identified as four mono chlorinated products i e tp 488a tp 488b tp 488c and tp 488d and a di chlorinated product i e tp 522 of mtx using lc ms fig s4a the environmental occurrence of tp 488a and tp 522 was confirmed in real hospital wastewater samples yin et al 2017 a battery of qsar based prediction software was used to evaluate the genotoxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of these tps and no clear increase in the toxicity of mtx after chlorination was suggested roig et al 2014 subsequent in vitro bioassays suggested that tp 488a had an inhibitory potency on the proliferation of zebrafish liver cells similar to that of mtx as indicated by the s phase arrest yin et al 2017 uv irradiation can also remove mtx residues while forming two tps tp 382 and tp 324 fig s4a zhang et al 2017b the photolysis half life under the test conditions was 35 54 min which was affected by the co existing water components i e natural organic matters noms and inorganic anions and water types similar to the above studies the removal efficiency of mtx can be significantly improved by introducing h2o2 or persulfate ps to constitute the photo based aops zhang et al 2017b 3 5 in silico predictions in this study the multi endpoint toxicity and biodegradability of five antineoplastic compounds and their tps during different water treatment processes were evaluated theoretically the smiles codes for these chemicals were exported based on their mol files using chemdraw software the carcinogenicity genotoxicity and in vitro in vivo mutagenicity were predicted using the oecd qsar toolbox https www oecd org chemicalsafety risk assessment oecd qsar toolbox htm data regarding developmental toxicity ames mutagenicity and endocrine disrupting effects expressed as estrogen receptor binding were obtained using comptox https comptox epa gov dashboard predictions index and their biodegradability and acute and chronic toxicity to aquatic species were individually assessed using biowin5 and ecosar from epi suitetm https www epa gov tsca screening tools epi suitetm estimation program interface models all predicted data for these chemicals and the detailed meanings for the defined abbreviations are presented in table 3 fig 2b and c for tam and its tps table s1 fig s1b and s1c for cp and its tps table s2 fig s2b and s2c for ifo and its tps table s3 fig s3b and s3c for 5 fu and its tps and table s4 fig s4b and s4c for mtx and its tps the multi endpoint toxicity data indicate that all five antineoplastic drugs and their tps exhibited different degrees of toxicity suggesting their potential adverse effects on aquatic species and public health in particular the biodegradation recalcitrance of most tps figs 2b and s1b s4b suggested the likelihood of ineffectiveness of post biological technologies when treating this class of micropollutants with aops which have been recommended for the efficient remediation of polluted water and wastewater laera et al 2012 méndez arriaga et al 2010 mousset et al 2021 oller et al 2011 regarding the acute and chronic toxicity assessment species dependent sensitivity was observed for cp ifo 5 fu mtx and their identified tps figs s1c s4c for example cp and its tps exhibited high acute toxicity to daphnia and chronic toxicity to fish while no such effects were observed for other aquatic species and exposure modes fig s1c similar results were also observed for ifo and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to daphnia during acute exposure and fish during chronic exposure fig s2c 5 fu and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to green algae during both acute and chronic exposure fig s3c and mtx and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to daphnia during chronic exposure fig s4c these phenomena suggest the possible applications of specific test species as bioindicators for early warnings of water dominantly polluted by these four antineoplastic compounds it should be noted that tam and most of its tps e g tp 370 tp 386 tp 388a tp 388b and tp 402 are highly toxic to all three aquatic organisms during both short term and long term exposure fig 2b these predicted data indicate that these pollutants may generate various non biodegradable tps with multiple toxicity endpoints during oxidative treatments the environmental persistence and risks introduced by these tps cannot be overlooked in water safety assessments additionally it should be highlighted that co existing tps may exert more severe toxic effects by multiple mechanisms which may be indicated using integrative high throughput screening techniques e g multi omics analysis and in vitro assays fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 3 6 complexity in matrices affecting the reaction mechanisms and toxicity evolution the presence of different water components e g co3 2 hco3 noms halides no2 and no3 can trigger the generation of multiple reactive species such as co3 triplet excited state nom 3nom or singlet oxygen 1o2 halogen radicals and no2 no fig 3 guo et al 2020 lei et al 2021 von gunten 2018 zhou et al 2019 generally co3 can be produced by the reaction of co3 2 hco3 with ho 3nom so4 cl or cl2 wojnárovits et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in contrast to the oxidation mechanisms of ho e g oh addition and h abstraction co3 can preferentially and selectively attack organic compounds containing electron rich moieties such as n and s containing compounds and aromatic substrates via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction wojnárovits et al 2020 the distinct reaction mechanisms could result in the formation of tps with different structures and toxic potencies it has recently been demonstrated that co3 played a critical role in the efficient degradation of micropollutants by different uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv ps uv cl2 and uv nh2cl zhou et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 recently found that hco3 could also activate ps to form 1o2 which is responsible for the efficient decomposition of acetaminophen as a class of ubiquitous organics with high abundance noms can be excited by uv light irradiation to produce reactive 3nom and 1o2 vione and carena 2020 which may alter the photochemical transformation pathways of micropollutants and the resulting toxicity caused by uv light alone in particular as two typical halides br and i could significantly influence many oxidative processes such as so4 based oxidation uv based oxidation and disinfection using ozone and chlorine by generating various reactive bromine iodine species fig 3 these species could attack organic contaminants and form bromine iodine containing tps that pose severe environmental risks duirk et al 2011 liberatore et al 2017 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2014 furthermore recent studies have reported that the occurrence of no2 no3 within so4 based and uv based oxidative systems could lead to the production of no2 and no which could introduce no2 group into the parent compounds to yield different types of toxic nitrated byproducts ji et al 2017 li et al 2021b yang et al 2019 regarding aqueous cations such as fe ii cu ii and co ii increasing evidence has demonstrated the generation of different high valent metal intermediates such as fe iv cu iii and co iii co iv particularly under acidic conditions which make non overlooked contributions to organic degradation kim et al 2019 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zong et al 2020 these metal based oxidants may possess different reaction mechanisms in oxidizing organic pollutants as compared to the radical species this may result in the generation of new tps with unexpected toxicity most of the toxicity evolution of micropollutants induced by different reactive species remains unclear particularly for reaction systems containing transition metals e g fe ii cu ii and co ii and so4 based oxidation this may be partly attributed to the potential toxicity of the associated residual agents e g cu ii co ii and ps pms which may exert synergistic toxic effects on the test species as suggested by vione and carena 2020 and von gunten 2018 the possible formation of harmful intermediates as a function of water chemistry remains the dark side of micropollutants during their photochemical transformation and oxidative water treatments zhou et al 2020 recently investigated the individual changes in the genotoxicity of treated naproxen solutions by co3 ho and uv cl2 negligible mutagenic potency was observed for the first two systems which was attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the hydroxylated tps however significantly enhanced genotoxicity was observed for the uv cl2 system which produced different cl containing tps with high mutagenicity additionally the presence of br and i has been widely demonstrated to introduce the higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity during disinfection of drinking water and wastewater using chlorine and chloramine which requires special attention for water safety and public health yang et al 2014 dong et al 2017 overall these produced species could significantly affect the product formation and reaction pathways of a wide range of organic contaminants during water treatment e g mtx degradation by uv tio2 hco3 system lai et al 2017b therefore a more in depth mechanistic analysis should be conducted to evaluate the water matrix induced product formation and toxicity changes of organic micropollutants after chemical oxidation 4 conclusions and future perspectives this study provides a retrospective and systematic review of the current status of transformation derived removal efficiency mineralization tp formation and toxicity evolution of five typical antineoplastic compounds in water the widespread environmental persistence of these micropollutants is indicated by different natural attenuation mechanisms i e photolysis hydrolysis and biodegradation they exhibited different degrees of reactivity to aqueous oxidizing species such as ozone ho and co3 with ho exhibiting outstanding oxidative performance 109 m 1 s 1 for antineoplastics in contrast the reactivity of aqueous ozone with these compounds was much lower ranging from 10 m 1 s 1 cp and ifo to 0 383 1 04 106 m 1 s 1 tam it should be noted that different reactive species have distinct reaction mechanisms which may lead to more efficient elimination of pollutants by certain radicals even with a lower reactivity for instance co3 generated from a uv tio2 hco3 system with higher abundance and lower k value i e 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 achieved more significant removal of mtx than ho k 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 by preferentially attacking its 4 aba moiety the results recorded in the literature suggest that aops particularly photochemical and electrochemical processes could effectively eliminate these micropollutants i e almost complete removal after treatment for 30 min to 16 h however the mineralization rates for most treatments were relatively low 70 indicating the formation of more recalcitrant tps notably a total of 14 21 28 32 and 32 tps were identified for tam cp ifo 5 fu and mtx under different oxidative treatments respectively the overall transformation pathways of these antineoplastic agents were proposed with hydroxylation and bond cleavage or ring opening being the dominant reaction mechanisms an extensive increase in toxicity was observed during their aqueous transformation which was demonstrated based on experimental bioassays such as acute toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects and in silico toxicity predictions the poor biodegradability of most tps necessitates the use of appropriate post treatments for cost efficient mineralization additionally toxicological approaches for water safety assessment should be improved to acquire mechanistic insights into the overlooked combined effects of the treated water and wastewater on aquatic organisms at the molecular level based on the current state of knowledge some research gaps and future perspectives are recommended for safer water quality evaluation during the remediation of antineoplastic pollutants 1 analytical accuracy of product identification as mentioned above the lc ms technique has been commonly applied to identify the structures of tps despite its high resolution characteristics it has limited accuracy in proposing detailed structures which can also be greatly influenced by personal knowledge networks for example hydroxylation may occur within different chemical moieties of the compounds which cannot be properly characterized using lc ms analysis the inaccurate identification of tps can directly cause false interpretations of in silico qsar based evaluations of their biodegradability and multi endpoint toxicity additionally even with non targeted product analysis it is highly likely that some tps produced during oxidative treatments cannot be characterized using lc ms because of their inherent analytical limitations and possible omissions during product extraction e g solid phase extraction these undetected tps might largely cause the increased environmental risks therefore the combined use of other analytical technologies such as 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms is highly recommended to identify more tps and verify their proposed chemical structures 2 environmental relevance of toxicity bioassays of tps the current literature regarding the aqueous transformation of antineoplastics has widely used significantly higher concentrations e g mg l than their environmentally relevant levels i e ng l μg l the toxicity evolution of these pollutants should be investigated at the trace levels observed during water treatment processes this may provide more realistic insights into the environmental risks introduced by their chemical transformation 3 co existence of other micropollutants for combined toxicity it is well acknowledged that different classes of environmental contaminants e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and endocrine disrupting chemicals co exist in natural water bodies deeb et al 2017 feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the complexity of chemical mixtures of multiple micropollutants and their persistent tps may exert unexpected toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems and even public health therefore integrated high throughput screening techniques e g multi omics should be introduced for more comprehensive risk assessments of treated water and wastewater 4 efficiency for the detoxification of water polluted by antineoplastic compounds current literature has demonstrated that aops are the promising remediation technologies for the effective removal of these emerging pollutants considering the limited mineralization and increased toxicity by tps during these oxidative treatments more efficient purification strategies or their combinations are urgently required to achieve clean and complete detoxification of contaminated water kümmerer et al 2018 5 differences in the remediation technologies reported in literature and practical water treatment processes despite the excellent removal efficiency of aops for antineoplastic compounds uv based technologies and electrochemical treatments have rarely been applied in the practical elimination of these micropollutant residues as effective removal would require long reaction times i e 30 min to 16 h see table 2 additionally uv irradiation did not achieve significant removal when using the disinfection intensities or doses as commonly used physical treatments adsorption or other removal options such as membranes are generally preferred to oxidation to avoid the formation of harmful tps during the production of drinking water thus in some countries aops are not allowed for this application therefore only chlorine and ozone used as the disinfectants significantly contribute to the transformation of micropollutants in water which might exert secondary environmental risks derived from the co existence with their tps table 2 it should also be noted that the studied antineoplastic compounds excluding tam are structurally highly polar and therefore not easily retained by adsorbents such as activated carbons therefore adsorption might not be an appropriate alternative for the effective capture of these toxic micropollutants overall in full scale wastewater treatment plants oxidation treatments e g aops can be applied after biological treatments in some cases such as water reuse or to protect aquatic ecosystems while the implementation of these technologies for the practical remediation of antineoplastic compounds and other organic contaminants in water and wastewater remains rare appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online credit authorship

16533,antineoplastic compounds designed for chemotherapeutic anticancer therapy have become emerging contaminants of global concern over the past decade due to their ubiquitous occurrence environmental persistence and multiple adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems increasing efforts have been devoted to developing efficient strategies for remediating water containing these micropollutants in this study the physicochemical properties natural attenuation and chemical reactivity with aqueous oxidizing species of five antineoplastic drugs with the highest environmental prevalence i e tamoxifen cyclophosphamide ifosfamide 5 fluorouracil and methotrexate were summarized the removal performance transformation products tps of varying structures overall reaction pathways and toxicity evolution during different treatments were evaluated and discussed additionally the biodegradability and multi endpoint toxicity of each tp were predicted using in silico qsar software depending on their distinct inherent structures the reactivity of the antineoplastics with oxidizing species varied with hydroxyl radicals exhibiting unparalleled merits in rapid oxidation complete elimination of these contaminants was observed during oxidative treatments but with inadequate mineralization notably the increase in toxicity within multiple processes was determined based on both experimental bioassays and theoretical predictions this may be attributed to the adverse effects induced by the large number of identified and unknown tps individually and in combination together with the environmental persistence and low biodegradability of most tps these results necessitate the application of efficient post treatments in conjunction with a more thorough water safety evaluation e

reaction pathways toxicity evaluation 1 introduction according to the latest report from the international agency for research on cancer iarc of the world health organization who 19 29 million new cancer cases were recorded in 2020 with 9 96 million cancer related deaths therefore it is the second leading cause of death worldwide wild et al 2020 the remarkable increase in cancer incidence each year has led to enhanced prescription and use of antineoplastic compounds also named anticancer or cytostatic drugs during chemotherapeutic therapy grbovic huezo et al 2020 pisa and kapoor 2020 recent studies have demonstrated a growing interest in the development and application of these chemicals in medicine lee et al 2021 slade and eustermann 2020 van der velden et al 2019 notably publications on the occurrence toxicity and remediation strategies of antineoplastic compounds in the environment also considerably increased over the past decade fig 1 these chemicals can be incidentally released into natural waters in their unchanged forms through two main routes 1 human excretion due to their incomplete metabolism and 2 wastewater effluents as their elimination by wastewater treatment plants is limited ferrando climent et al 2014 yadav et al 2021 increasing evidence has emphasized their environmental prevalence in multiple water sources worldwide with detected concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l cristóvão et al 2020 li et al 2021a nassour et al 2020 queirós et al 2021 wormington et al 2020 antineoplastic compounds exert adverse biological effects by triggering cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic effects novak et al 2017 toolaram et al 2014 additionally at environmental relevant levels these chemicals can significantly affect the development and reproduction of different aquatic models at the molecular level such as daphnia magna d magna and zebrafish danio rerio fonseca et al 2018 hung et al 2021 jo et al 2018 russo et al 2018a wormington et al 2020 therefore antineoplastic chemicals have become emerging pollutants of global concern gouveia et al 2019 heath et al 2020 jureczko and kalka 2020 li et al 2021a mišík et al 2019 a considerable number of efforts have been chronicled and devoted to developing cost efficient treatment methods for removing antineoplastic chemicals from water mirsadeghi et al 2020 pieczyńska et al 2017 yadav et al 2021 recent review articles have reported that oxidative treatments particularly advanced oxidation processes aops play a critical role in eliminating these pollutants by producing highly reactive oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals ho with low regioselectivity garcia costa et al 2021 janssens et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2021 pieczyńska et al 2017 tripathi et al 2020 yadav et al 2021 however inadequate mineralization of antineoplastic agents has commonly been observed and reported during these treatments leading to the generation of recalcitrant transformation products tps with diverse structures garcia costa et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2021 yadav et al 2021 these identified tps could be persistent with long term stability in the aquatic cycle and exert more severe acute and chronic toxicity than their parent compounds based on experimental results or in silico toxicity predictions lai et al 2017b mukherjee et al 2021 toolaram et al 2014 similarly enhanced toxicity from environmentally produced tps of other organic pollutants e g antibiotics and carbon dots has also been reported jaén gil et al 2020 liu et al 2021 tian et al 2020 their ubiquitous co existence has been reported in different water bodies feng et al 2021 mestankova et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in previous review articles kümmerer and his colleagues predicted and emphasized the increasing challenges to water safety assessment owing to the presence of various tps of different pharmaceuticals poses including antineoplastic drugs haddad et al 2015 toolaram et al 2014 therefore the current status of the removal efficiency mineralization tp formation and toxicity evolution of these antineoplastic contaminants during water treatment processes must urgently been determined in particular treatment driven alterations in the toxicity of water have not yet been extensively reviewed which is of vital importance for evaluating the potential environmental risks introduced by the aqueous co existence of antineoplastic agents and their tps in addition to their acute and chronic ecotoxicological potency in non target organisms the resulting tps may also induce multi endpoint toxicity such as genotoxicity developmental toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects however such important toxicity data which are vital for pollution control and water safety evaluation remain limited these results can be largely supplemented and predicted using well established in silico prediction software such as epi suitetm comptox and qsar toolbox they have been widely used and recommended for predicting the toxicity of tps originating from the oxidative transformation of different antineoplastic chemicals della flora et al 2020 sanabria et al 2021 secrétan et al 2019 toolaram et al 2014 the objectives of this review are as follows 1 to summarize the reported physicochemical properties and natural attenuation performance of the five most widely used and environmentally prevalent antineoplastic compounds with the most adverse reported effects on aquatic ecosystems in three different mechanistic categories i e tamoxifen tam as the hormonal agent cyclophosphamide cp and ifosfamide ifo as the alkylating chemicals 5 fluorouracil 5 fu and methotrexate mtx as the antimetabolites see their structures in fig 1 in particular their reactivity with different reactive species e g ho ozone and chlorine in water was outlined and discussed 2 to understand and compare the overall removal efficiency mineralization rate degradation products and reaction pathways of these compounds induced by different water treatment reagents technologies which mainly included aops and disinfection processes i e uv ozone and chlorine and 3 more importantly to analyze the current state of knowledge regarding the treatment driven toxicity evolution of these emerging micropollutants along with their aqueous decomposition in addition to the measured toxicity changes of five antineoplastic compounds during water treatment processes multi endpoint toxicity prediction and biodegradation evaluation of all reported tps were conducted using different in silico approaches based on the state of the art review and systematic analysis research limitations and knowledge gaps for future safety assessment of antineoplastic contaminated water during conventional and emerging water and wastewater treatment were also suggested 2 physicochemical and environmentally relevant properties of typical antineoplastic compounds the main physicochemical properties e g water solubility pk a and logk ow natural attenuation i e photolysis hydrolysis and biodegradability aqueous reactivity with different oxidizing species and their maximum concentrations in natural waters of five typical antineoplastics i e tam cp ifo 5 fu and mtx were scrutinized and are listed in table 1 the available degradation rates percentages of cp ifo and 5 fu via three different natural attenuation mechanisms were relatively low franquet griell et al 2017b lin et al 2014 along with their reported environmental concentrations these data highlight the wide range in the degree of persistence and contamination of three different categories of antineoplastic agents in the aquatic environment regarding the oxidation kinetics garcia ac et al 2010 reported the second order rate constants k of cp with ozone and ho at ph 8 10 which were 3 3 0 2 m 1 s 1 and 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively table 1 blaney et al 2019 reported similar data obtaining the transformation kinetics of cp and ifo by ozone and ho using continuous oxidation addition reactors with the individual k values reporting as 2 58 3 30 m 1 s 1 cp and ozone 2 00 2 69 109 m 1 s 1 cp and ho 6 95 0 21 m 1 s 1 ifo and ozone and 2 73 0 16 109 m 1 s 1 ifo and ho table 1 the k values of mtx with ozone and ho were determined as 3 6 103 m 1 s 1 garcia ac et al 2010 and 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 lai et al 2017b respectively despite the lower k value i e 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 of mtx with carbonate radicals co3 than that with ho introducing hco3 into the uv tio2 system significantly shortened the reaction time for the complete elimination of mtx from 90 min no hco3 to 10 min with 400 mg l hco3 lai et al 2017b this was attributed to the higher abundance of co3 that preferentially attacked the 4 aminobenzamide 4 aba moiety of mtx and altered its decomposition pathways by uv tio2 treatment regarding 5 fu its k values with ozone ho chlorine and bromine at ph 7 were measured to be 7 07 0 11 104 m 1 s 1 1 52 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 14 8 m 1 s 1 and 1 9 103 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2019 ganzenko et al 2018 li et al 2015 table 1 among all five target antineoplastic compounds tam exhibited the highest reactivity with ozone at ph 7 reaching 0 383 1 04 106 m 1 s 1 knoop et al 2018a the combined data indicated their distinct reactivity with these oxidizing species suggesting their inherent structural stability in water treatment together with their continuous introduction into the aquatic cycle it can be inferred that they may exhibit degradation recalcitrance under conventional water treatment processes or even aops particularly in the presence of different water matrices acting as effective and competitive radical quenchers 3 transformation pathways and toxicity evaluation of antineoplastics in water table 2 presents detailed information regarding the removal efficiency mineralization rate tp formation and biodegradability toxicity evaluation of the five antineoplastic agents during different water treatment processes the remediation techniques particularly aops such as photocatalysis and fenton like oxidation were highly effective under the optimized experimental conditions mostly achieving 90 aqueous removal for all five antineoplastic drugs however even the complete elimination of the parent compounds e g 5 fu and cp did not represent their efficient mineralization which was recorded as 70 for most of the treatments table 2 the maximum mineralization rate was 89 6 for the photocatalytic oxidation of cp in an uv tio2 system after 256 min of reaction lutterbeck et al 2015b these phenomena demonstrated the generation of various tps with robust structural stability which could be more recalcitrant to be further oxidized by reactive species additionally the increased toxicity of antineoplastic compounds has been widely demonstrated based on toxicity bioassays of reaction solutions conducted before and after oxidative treatments table 2 however it should be mentioned that different types of experimental factors such as the type and concentration of the target micropollutant type of aop applied dosage of the associated agents exposure sensitivity of the test organisms background water chemistry and reaction time would affect the toxicity evolution of antineoplastic compounds when using aops for water treatment the observed toxicity change was caused by the combined and integrated effects of all these experimental conditions accurately distinguishing the individual influences and contributions of these factors on the observed toxic effects would be difficult and complicated generally increasing the dosages of the associated agents in aops and extending the reaction time would reduce the final toxicity due to the improved removal efficiency and mineralization of the treated water overall these findings emphasize the importance of conducting environmental risk assessments of the cocktail mixtures of treated water in which the individual tps or their combination may pose a comparative or even higher toxicity than the pollutant itself however limited knowledge is available to systematically evaluate the aquatic toxicity of individual tps as mentioned above in silico predictions have recently been recognized as useful tools for gathering the physicochemical properties e g biodegradability and biological effects e g multi endpoint toxicity of the tps of antineoplastic compounds della flora et al 2020 sanabria et al 2021 secrétan et al 2019 however the reliability of these predicted results depends on the correct establishment of their chemical structures concerning the tp identification recent degradation studies of this class of emerging contaminants have mostly used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms haddad et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2021 pieczyńska et al 2017 generally this analytical method could provide high resolution and relatively accurate information regarding the molecular composition via ms and structural fragments via ms ms of analytes these data facilitate a reasonable proposal of the structures of tps and their possible transformation pathways 3 1 tam tam is one of the most extensively used drugs for the prevention of the reoccurrence of hormone dependent breast cancer criscitiello et al 2011 owing to its low water solubility i e 300 μg l and limited analytical detection using high performance liquid chromatography hplc few studies have focused on its aqueous degradation which mainly involved the use of ozone and fenton like oxidation ferrando climent et al 2017 knoop et al 2018a it has recently been demonstrated that uv based photolysis and aops including o3 o3 uv o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 could completely remove tam initial concentration 100 μg l from water within 240 min ferrando climent et al 2017 nine tps were detected during these treatments and their degradation pathways were proposed fig 2 based on toxicity evaluation using microtox bioassays the significantly enhanced toxic potency was observed for tam during all aop based treatments table 2 these results highlight the importance of post aop treatments e g biological degradation in eliminating or minimizing the environmental risks induced by tam and or its tps in a recent study knoop et al 2018a evaluated the reaction kinetics and tp formation of tam by ozonation at different solution ph levels with five identified tps i e a primary tam n oxide and two secondary tps tp 286 and tp 404 at ph 5 two primary tps tp 270 and tp 388 at ph 5 as illustrated in fig 2 three main reaction mechanisms were elucidated including the criegee reaction hydroxylation and n oxide formation subsequent toxicity investigations at ph 3 and 7 suggested that the initial immobilization of d magna by tam was removed after exposure to an ozone treated tam solution for 48 h knoop et al 2018c however after treating tam with a molar ratio of o3 tam up to 4 growth inhibition of green algae was significantly increased over 60 h of exposure according to the correlation analysis between the peak area of tps and toxicity evolution tp 270 and tp 388 generated as the major tps at ph 5 were proposed as those responsible for the enhanced toxicity knoop et al 2018c additionally anti estrogenic activity evaluation indicated that tp 270 could induce an increase in endocrine effects knoop et al 2018b meanwhile tam n oxide the predominant tp formed under a neutral ph exhibited diminished anti estrogenic activity these findings suggested that ozonation could remove the acute toxicity and endocrine effects of tam in natural water bodies i e ph 5 it should be mentioned that toxicity evolutions varied among these studies which may be largely attributed to the distinct experimental conditions such as the initial concentrations of tam and ozone and the reaction ph and sensitivity of test organisms or toxicity endpoints in contrast to its high reactivity with ozone tam is fairly recalcitrant to chlorination i e no degradation within 24 h while its two major metabolites i e 4 hydroxy tam and 4 hydroxy n desmethyl tam can be quickly oxidized by free chlorine negreira et al 2015 3 2 cp and ifo cp and ifo are oxazaphosphorine alkylating agents used in chemotherapy cancer treatment worldwide owing to their structural similarity most degradation studies investigated these two compounds together and compared their reactivity removal efficiency product identification and toxicity evolution the abilities of different aop based treatment strategies to eliminate cp and ifo have been tested including photocatalysis ozonation electrochemical oxidation and uv h2o2 blaney et al 2019 česen et al 2016 fabiańska et al 2015 fiszka borzyszkowska et al 2016 graumans et al 2020 lai et al 2017a 2015 ofiarska et al 2016 russo et al 2018b siedlecka et al 2018 lin et al 2015 these oxidative systems have achieved excellent removal efficiencies i e 95 100 of cp and ifo suggesting their feasibility in water and wastewater decontamination table 2 however their recorded mineralization rates range from 15 to 89 6 suggesting the formation of tps with higher oxidative recalcitrance and structural stability as presented in figs s1 and s2 cp and ifo have a total of 25 and 35 identified tps respectively most of which were detected during photocatalytic and electrocatalytic oxidation however the lack of knowledge in the literature regarding the reaction mechanisms of cp and ifo during aops hinders clear and stepwise interpretations of their overall reaction pathways the existing information suggests that hydroxylation and cleavage of c n c cl and n p bonds are the dominant reaction patterns for these two oxazaphosphorines in oxidative systems regarding the environmental risks of the treated solutions lutterbeck et al 2015b reported no toxicity for the tps generated by uv h2o2 and uv tio2 treatments of cp which were based on acute and chronic toxicity bioassays using vibrio fischeri v fischeri however enhanced toxicity was observed for these two compounds when treated by uv irradiation russo et al 2018b ozonation lin et al 2015 uv tio2 based photocatalysis lai et al 2017a 2015 lin and lin 2014 and electrochemical oxidation siedlecka et al 2018 these distinct phenomena might be attributed to the combined effects of the different conditions used for pollutant degradation such as the dosage and type of oxidative treatments reaction ph and water chemistry and toxicity bioassays such as the exposure time and sensitivity of different test organisms and some operating details such as the dilution factors of test solutions and initial concentrations of v fischeri which were not mentioned in the articles for example photocatalytic treatments of cp and ifo resulted in an initial increase in acute toxicity to v fischeri reaching the maximum bioluminescence inhibition after 60 min and 120 min of irradiation respectively further oxidation led to decreased toxic potency with no bioluminescence inhibition observed after 360 min of the photocatalytic oxidation of these two compounds lai et al 2015 in their subsequent study on cp and ifo lai et al 2017a found that introducing 800 mg l of hco3 or cl into the photocatalytic system resulted in treated solutions with higher toxicity than those without these anions these phenomena may be attributed to the different oxidative mechanisms of selective co3 and cl from non selective ho which attacked cp or ifo to generate new byproducts with higher toxicity similarly siedlecka et al 2018 reported a significant increase in growth inhibition of lemna minor l minor after exposure to cp or ifo before and after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation specifically the parent compounds induced no growth inhibition while it gradually enhanced as the reaction continued eventually reaching 100 inhibition for l minor overall these increases in toxicity may have been due to the combined effects of tp mixtures particularly chlorinated byproducts lai et al 2015 3 3 5 fu since its introduction in cancer treatment in the late 1950s 5 fu has become the most extensively used antimetabolite to disrupt enzyme activity and interfere with dna synthesis li et al 2021a among the five antineoplastic compounds 5 fu has attracted the most attention for pollution remediation particularly using aops e g photocatalysis electrocatalysis ozonation and fenton like oxidations ganzenko et al 2018 governo et al 2017 koltsakidou et al 2017a b lin et al 2015 lin and lin 2014 lutterbeck et al 2015c siedlecka et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a hydroxylation defluorination and ring opening have been proposed as the dominant reaction patterns fig s3 complete removal of 5 fu with no or few toxic residues has been widely achieved by photocatalytic treatment lin and lin 2014 electrochemical oxidation siedlecka et al 2018 solar driven photoelectrocatalytic oxidation mazierski et al 2019 and photo assisted oxidation governo et al 2017 table 2 additionally lutterbeck et al 2015c reported complete elimination of 5 fu by three aops i e uv h2o2 uv fe2 h2o2 and uv tio2 within 30 min and found enhanced biodegradability and reduced toxicity of 5 fu treated by an uv h2o2 system additionally ozone could efficiently eliminate 5 fu and its toxicity by attacking the olefin moiety via the criegee mechanism thereby producing tp 196 and tp 160d fig s3 chen et al 2019 further transformation occurred to form carboxylic acids as the dominant components of the residual levels of total organic carbon toc regarding the chlorination process 5 fu presented a relatively low reactivity with free chlorine i e 14 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 which produced five tps of unknown toxicity fig s3 li et al 2015 uv irradiation another disinfection method can achieve complete removal of 5 fu within 32 min lutterbeck et al 2016 the formed tps have higher biodegradability and lower toxicity than the parent compound these findings indicate that uv irradiation can be used as an efficient pre treatment which can be combined with post biodegradation and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption for water purification in contrast zhang et al 2017b reported that the presence of humic acid ha and nitrate ions no3 could trigger indirect photodegradation under uv irradiation thereby changing the reaction pathways specifically bond cleavage of 5 fu occurred during direct photodegradation while the introduction of ha and no3 resulted in electron transfer and addition reactions respectively overall studies on the degradation of 5 fu suggested that it could be efficiently removed by aops and the resulting environmental risks could be reduced considering the complexity of natural water bodies the potential environmental risks of antineoplastic compounds during water treatment with co existing components require further investigation given the co occurrence of 5 fu with other pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments li et al 2021a wormington et al 2020 their toxicity evolution during water treatment should not be ignored lin et al 2015 reported the ozonation of mixtures of three antineoplastics i e 5 fu cp and ifo and a vasodilator pharmaceutical pentoxifylline in which the acute toxicity of microtox was enhanced more recently evgenidou et al 2020 investigated tp formation and toxicity changes during the photocatalytic degradation of four antineoplastic mixtures including tam cp 5 fu and cytarabine using polyester tio2 films in water these compounds could be effectively removed within 360 min and 70 tps were identified in total the evaluation of the mixture effects on d magna indicated that the toxicity initially decreased and then increased with the proceeding photocatalytic oxidation the relative toxic potency and contributions of each tp were determined using ecosar software and the enhanced toxicity may have been due to the effects of unidentified tps and or their synergistic interactions with the detected tps therefore the current strategies for product identification and toxicological analysis of the aqueous transformation of antineoplastic compounds should be improved to elucidate the factors causing these alarming environmental risks 3 4 mtx as a commonly consumed antimetabolite in anticancer treatment worldwide mtx was designed to disrupt folate metabolism and interfere with dna synthesis thereby rapidly killing the growing cells lai et al 2017b mtx is composed of three major chemical moieties i e glutamic acid 4 aba and a diamino pteridine ring recent investigations have mainly focused on the application of aops including photocatalysis electrocatalysis and fenton like oxidations for degrading mtx in water barışçı et al 2018 calza et al 2014 lai et al 2017b lutterbeck et al 2015a siedlecka et al 2018 aops have been demonstrated as highly effective remediation approaches for mtx decontamination which was attributed to the powerful oxidizing capability of ho k ho mtx 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 however it cannot be ignored that different tps with varying structures were generated by these oxidative systems leading to inadequate mineralization table 2 the reaction pathways of mtx under three above aops were scrutinized and are summarized in fig s4 as previous studies reported no detailed reaction steps and mechanisms only the proposed structures of tps were provided lutterbeck et al 2015a reported that the tps generated by the uv h2o2 oxidation of mtx were less biodegradable and less toxic to v fischeri similar reductions in toxicity were also observed for uv tio2 calza et al 2014 and boron doped diamond assisted electrochemical oxidation treatments siedlecka et al 2018 using v fischeri and l minor as the target species respectively however based on the acute toxicity tests conducted on v fischeri the toxicity of the treated mtx solutions was enhanced when using electrocatalytic oxidation with a ti iro2 ruo2 electrode barışçı et al 2018 and photocatalytic oxidation via uv tio2 hco3 lai et al 2017b the difference in toxicity evolution from that of another electrochemical oxidation system siedlecka et al 2018 could be attributed to the completely different experimental conditions particularly the sensitivity of v fischeri and l minor which exerted a combined effect on the final toxicity in the latter study multiple reaction mechanisms were proposed such as hydroxylation deamination and c n c c bond cleavage lai et al 2017b the produced co3 preferentially attacked the 4 aba moiety of the mtx molecule leading to the formation of different tps with higher toxicity additionally uv peroxymonosulfate pms technology was investigated for eliminating mtx by producing sulfate radicals so4 and ho in water kanjal et al 2020 this oxidative system rapidly decomposed and effectively mineralized mtx achieving 90 removal and 65 mineralization within 30 min table 2 four major tps of mtx were identified and degradation pathways were proposed accordingly the degradation mechanisms included the cleavage of the peptide bond of mtx to yield tp 325 c n bond cleavage to generate tp 190 and tp 151 and the oxidation of the aldehyde moiety of tp 190 to form tp 206 with the carboxylic acid group fig s4 regarding the aqueous transformation of mtx during conventional disinfection both roig et al 2014 and yin et al 2017 reported rapid mtx removal by chlorination at an initial concentration of 1 mg l table 2 the incomplete mineralization indicated the formation of different tps which were identified as four mono chlorinated products i e tp 488a tp 488b tp 488c and tp 488d and a di chlorinated product i e tp 522 of mtx using lc ms fig s4a the environmental occurrence of tp 488a and tp 522 was confirmed in real hospital wastewater samples yin et al 2017 a battery of qsar based prediction software was used to evaluate the genotoxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of these tps and no clear increase in the toxicity of mtx after chlorination was suggested roig et al 2014 subsequent in vitro bioassays suggested that tp 488a had an inhibitory potency on the proliferation of zebrafish liver cells similar to that of mtx as indicated by the s phase arrest yin et al 2017 uv irradiation can also remove mtx residues while forming two tps tp 382 and tp 324 fig s4a zhang et al 2017b the photolysis half life under the test conditions was 35 54 min which was affected by the co existing water components i e natural organic matters noms and inorganic anions and water types similar to the above studies the removal efficiency of mtx can be significantly improved by introducing h2o2 or persulfate ps to constitute the photo based aops zhang et al 2017b 3 5 in silico predictions in this study the multi endpoint toxicity and biodegradability of five antineoplastic compounds and their tps during different water treatment processes were evaluated theoretically the smiles codes for these chemicals were exported based on their mol files using chemdraw software the carcinogenicity genotoxicity and in vitro in vivo mutagenicity were predicted using the oecd qsar toolbox https www oecd org chemicalsafety risk assessment oecd qsar toolbox htm data regarding developmental toxicity ames mutagenicity and endocrine disrupting effects expressed as estrogen receptor binding were obtained using comptox https comptox epa gov dashboard predictions index and their biodegradability and acute and chronic toxicity to aquatic species were individually assessed using biowin5 and ecosar from epi suitetm https www epa gov tsca screening tools epi suitetm estimation program interface models all predicted data for these chemicals and the detailed meanings for the defined abbreviations are presented in table 3 fig 2b and c for tam and its tps table s1 fig s1b and s1c for cp and its tps table s2 fig s2b and s2c for ifo and its tps table s3 fig s3b and s3c for 5 fu and its tps and table s4 fig s4b and s4c for mtx and its tps the multi endpoint toxicity data indicate that all five antineoplastic drugs and their tps exhibited different degrees of toxicity suggesting their potential adverse effects on aquatic species and public health in particular the biodegradation recalcitrance of most tps figs 2b and s1b s4b suggested the likelihood of ineffectiveness of post biological technologies when treating this class of micropollutants with aops which have been recommended for the efficient remediation of polluted water and wastewater laera et al 2012 méndez arriaga et al 2010 mousset et al 2021 oller et al 2011 regarding the acute and chronic toxicity assessment species dependent sensitivity was observed for cp ifo 5 fu mtx and their identified tps figs s1c s4c for example cp and its tps exhibited high acute toxicity to daphnia and chronic toxicity to fish while no such effects were observed for other aquatic species and exposure modes fig s1c similar results were also observed for ifo and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to daphnia during acute exposure and fish during chronic exposure fig s2c 5 fu and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to green algae during both acute and chronic exposure fig s3c and mtx and its tps i e toxicity sensitivity to daphnia during chronic exposure fig s4c these phenomena suggest the possible applications of specific test species as bioindicators for early warnings of water dominantly polluted by these four antineoplastic compounds it should be noted that tam and most of its tps e g tp 370 tp 386 tp 388a tp 388b and tp 402 are highly toxic to all three aquatic organisms during both short term and long term exposure fig 2b these predicted data indicate that these pollutants may generate various non biodegradable tps with multiple toxicity endpoints during oxidative treatments the environmental persistence and risks introduced by these tps cannot be overlooked in water safety assessments additionally it should be highlighted that co existing tps may exert more severe toxic effects by multiple mechanisms which may be indicated using integrative high throughput screening techniques e g multi omics analysis and in vitro assays fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 3 6 complexity in matrices affecting the reaction mechanisms and toxicity evolution the presence of different water components e g co3 2 hco3 noms halides no2 and no3 can trigger the generation of multiple reactive species such as co3 triplet excited state nom 3nom or singlet oxygen 1o2 halogen radicals and no2 no fig 3 guo et al 2020 lei et al 2021 von gunten 2018 zhou et al 2019 generally co3 can be produced by the reaction of co3 2 hco3 with ho 3nom so4 cl or cl2 wojnárovits et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in contrast to the oxidation mechanisms of ho e g oh addition and h abstraction co3 can preferentially and selectively attack organic compounds containing electron rich moieties such as n and s containing compounds and aromatic substrates via electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction wojnárovits et al 2020 the distinct reaction mechanisms could result in the formation of tps with different structures and toxic potencies it has recently been demonstrated that co3 played a critical role in the efficient degradation of micropollutants by different uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv ps uv cl2 and uv nh2cl zhou et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 recently found that hco3 could also activate ps to form 1o2 which is responsible for the efficient decomposition of acetaminophen as a class of ubiquitous organics with high abundance noms can be excited by uv light irradiation to produce reactive 3nom and 1o2 vione and carena 2020 which may alter the photochemical transformation pathways of micropollutants and the resulting toxicity caused by uv light alone in particular as two typical halides br and i could significantly influence many oxidative processes such as so4 based oxidation uv based oxidation and disinfection using ozone and chlorine by generating various reactive bromine iodine species fig 3 these species could attack organic contaminants and form bromine iodine containing tps that pose severe environmental risks duirk et al 2011 liberatore et al 2017 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2014 furthermore recent studies have reported that the occurrence of no2 no3 within so4 based and uv based oxidative systems could lead to the production of no2 and no which could introduce no2 group into the parent compounds to yield different types of toxic nitrated byproducts ji et al 2017 li et al 2021b yang et al 2019 regarding aqueous cations such as fe ii cu ii and co ii increasing evidence has demonstrated the generation of different high valent metal intermediates such as fe iv cu iii and co iii co iv particularly under acidic conditions which make non overlooked contributions to organic degradation kim et al 2019 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zong et al 2020 these metal based oxidants may possess different reaction mechanisms in oxidizing organic pollutants as compared to the radical species this may result in the generation of new tps with unexpected toxicity most of the toxicity evolution of micropollutants induced by different reactive species remains unclear particularly for reaction systems containing transition metals e g fe ii cu ii and co ii and so4 based oxidation this may be partly attributed to the potential toxicity of the associated residual agents e g cu ii co ii and ps pms which may exert synergistic toxic effects on the test species as suggested by vione and carena 2020 and von gunten 2018 the possible formation of harmful intermediates as a function of water chemistry remains the dark side of micropollutants during their photochemical transformation and oxidative water treatments zhou et al 2020 recently investigated the individual changes in the genotoxicity of treated naproxen solutions by co3 ho and uv cl2 negligible mutagenic potency was observed for the first two systems which was attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the hydroxylated tps however significantly enhanced genotoxicity was observed for the uv cl2 system which produced different cl containing tps with high mutagenicity additionally the presence of br and i has been widely demonstrated to introduce the higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity during disinfection of drinking water and wastewater using chlorine and chloramine which requires special attention for water safety and public health yang et al 2014 dong et al 2017 overall these produced species could significantly affect the product formation and reaction pathways of a wide range of organic contaminants during water treatment e g mtx degradation by uv tio2 hco3 system lai et al 2017b therefore a more in depth mechanistic analysis should be conducted to evaluate the water matrix induced product formation and toxicity changes of organic micropollutants after chemical oxidation 4 conclusions and future perspectives this study provides a retrospective and systematic review of the current status of transformation derived removal efficiency mineralization tp formation and toxicity evolution of five typical antineoplastic compounds in water the widespread environmental persistence of these micropollutants is indicated by different natural attenuation mechanisms i e photolysis hydrolysis and biodegradation they exhibited different degrees of reactivity to aqueous oxidizing species such as ozone ho and co3 with ho exhibiting outstanding oxidative performance 109 m 1 s 1 for antineoplastics in contrast the reactivity of aqueous ozone with these compounds was much lower ranging from 10 m 1 s 1 cp and ifo to 0 383 1 04 106 m 1 s 1 tam it should be noted that different reactive species have distinct reaction mechanisms which may lead to more efficient elimination of pollutants by certain radicals even with a lower reactivity for instance co3 generated from a uv tio2 hco3 system with higher abundance and lower k value i e 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 achieved more significant removal of mtx than ho k 8 7 109 m 1 s 1 by preferentially attacking its 4 aba moiety the results recorded in the literature suggest that aops particularly photochemical and electrochemical processes could effectively eliminate these micropollutants i e almost complete removal after treatment for 30 min to 16 h however the mineralization rates for most treatments were relatively low 70 indicating the formation of more recalcitrant tps notably a total of 14 21 28 32 and 32 tps were identified for tam cp ifo 5 fu and mtx under different oxidative treatments respectively the overall transformation pathways of these antineoplastic agents were proposed with hydroxylation and bond cleavage or ring opening being the dominant reaction mechanisms an extensive increase in toxicity was observed during their aqueous transformation which was demonstrated based on experimental bioassays such as acute toxicity and endocrine disrupting effects and in silico toxicity predictions the poor biodegradability of most tps necessitates the use of appropriate post treatments for cost efficient mineralization additionally toxicological approaches for water safety assessment should be improved to acquire mechanistic insights into the overlooked combined effects of the treated water and wastewater on aquatic organisms at the molecular level based on the current state of knowledge some research gaps and future perspectives are recommended for safer water quality evaluation during the remediation of antineoplastic pollutants 1 analytical accuracy of product identification as mentioned above the lc ms technique has been commonly applied to identify the structures of tps despite its high resolution characteristics it has limited accuracy in proposing detailed structures which can also be greatly influenced by personal knowledge networks for example hydroxylation may occur within different chemical moieties of the compounds which cannot be properly characterized using lc ms analysis the inaccurate identification of tps can directly cause false interpretations of in silico qsar based evaluations of their biodegradability and multi endpoint toxicity additionally even with non targeted product analysis it is highly likely that some tps produced during oxidative treatments cannot be characterized using lc ms because of their inherent analytical limitations and possible omissions during product extraction e g solid phase extraction these undetected tps might largely cause the increased environmental risks therefore the combined use of other analytical technologies such as 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms is highly recommended to identify more tps and verify their proposed chemical structures 2 environmental relevance of toxicity bioassays of tps the current literature regarding the aqueous transformation of antineoplastics has widely used significantly higher concentrations e g mg l than their environmentally relevant levels i e ng l μg l the toxicity evolution of these pollutants should be investigated at the trace levels observed during water treatment processes this may provide more realistic insights into the environmental risks introduced by their chemical transformation 3 co existence of other micropollutants for combined toxicity it is well acknowledged that different classes of environmental contaminants e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and endocrine disrupting chemicals co exist in natural water bodies deeb et al 2017 feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the complexity of chemical mixtures of multiple micropollutants and their persistent tps may exert unexpected toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems and even public health therefore integrated high throughput screening techniques e g multi omics should be introduced for more comprehensive risk assessments of treated water and wastewater 4 efficiency for the detoxification of water polluted by antineoplastic compounds current literature has demonstrated that aops are the promising remediation technologies for the effective removal of these emerging pollutants considering the limited mineralization and increased toxicity by tps during these oxidative treatments more efficient purification strategies or their combinations are urgently required to achieve clean and complete detoxification of contaminated water kümmerer et al 2018 5 differences in the remediation technologies reported in literature and practical water treatment processes despite the excellent removal efficiency of aops for antineoplastic compounds uv based technologies and electrochemical treatments have rarely been applied in the practical elimination of these micropollutant residues as effective removal would require long reaction times i e 30 min to 16 h see table 2 additionally uv irradiation did not achieve significant removal when using the disinfection intensities or doses as commonly used physical treatments adsorption or other removal options such as membranes are generally preferred to oxidation to avoid the formation of harmful tps during the production of drinking water thus in some countries aops are not allowed for this application therefore only chlorine and ozone used as the disinfectants significantly contribute to the transformation of micropollutants in water which might exert secondary environmental risks derived from the co existence with their tps table 2 it should also be noted that the studied antineoplastic compounds excluding tam are structurally highly polar and therefore not easily retained by adsorbents such as activated carbons therefore adsorption might not be an appropriate alternative for the effective capture of these toxic micropollutants overall in full scale wastewater treatment plants oxidation treatments e g aops can be applied after biological treatments in some cases such as water reuse or to protect aquatic ecosystems while the implementation of these technologies for the practical remediation of antineoplastic compounds and other organic contaminants in water and wastewater remains rare appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online credit authorship

16534,the nitrogen n cycle is one of the most important nutrient cycles in river systems and it plays an important role in maintaining biogeochemical balance and global climate stability one of the main ways that humans have altered riverine ecosystems is through the construction of hydropower dams which have major effects on biogeochemical cycles most previous studies examining the effects of damming on n cycling have focused on the whole budget or flux along rivers and the role of river as n sources or sinks at the global or catchment scale however so far there is still lack of comprehensive and systematic summarize on n cycling and the controlling mechanisms in reservoirs affected by dam impoundment in this review we firstly summarize n cycling processes along the longitudinal riverine transition lacustrine gradient and the vertically stratified epilimnion thermocline hypolimnion gradient specifically we highlight the direct and indirect roles of multi trophic microbiota and their interactions in n cycling and discuss the main factors controlling these biotic processes in addition future research directions and challenges in incorporating multi trophic levels in bioassessment environmental flow design as well as reservoir regulation and restoration are summarized this review will aid future studies of n fluxes along dammed rivers and provide an essential reference for reservoir management to meet ecological needs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir impoundment stratification nutrient cycles multiple trophic levels microbial food web 1 introduction rivers are important channels connecting terrestrial and marine ecosystems and serve as transportation systems for large amounts of materials and nutrients currently more than 50 of global rivers are fragmented by dams for hydropower production water supply flood control and navigation grill et al 2019 dam construction has major effects on hydro geomorphology biogeochemical cycles and the ecological environment first dams convert rivers into lentic reservoirs characterized by decreased flow velocity and increased hydraulic residence time nilsson et al 2005 hydrological variations associated with damming also affect annual runoff thermal regimes and sediment loads wang et al 2016 yigzaw et al 2019 second dams disrupt the river continuum which increases nutrient loads and induces changes in nutrient stoichiometric ratios along river systems wang et al 2018a third hydrological and biogeochemical variations reshape riparian and riverine habitats and alter the structure diversity and distribution of biological communities poff et al 2007 ultimately dams can modify the ecosystem functions e g nutrient cycling and energy flow and services e g fisheries of rivers turgeon et al 2019 nutrients such as carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and silicon si are transported along rivers damming can alter riverine nutrient cycles in multiple and complex ways and have positive or negative impacts for example reservoirs can eliminate nutrients from the water column via sedimentation or gaseous release thus alleviating eutrophication pressure on downstream ecosystems van cappellen and maavara 2016 however the longer hydraulic residence time and the higher transparency may promote primary productivity and nutrient transformation within reservoirs resulting in increased eutrophication downstream chen et al 2018 reservoirs tend to facilitate the retention of nutrients from rivers in large quantities taylor maavara from the university of waterloo has quantified the effects of dams on c p si and n fluxes based on global data they estimated that the global primary productivity and c mineralization ratio p r will double by 2030 because of damming maavara et al 2017 meanwhile approximately 17 and 5 3 of the global total p and total reactive si loading to rivers are expected to be sequestered in reservoirs respectively maavara et al 2014 2015 compared with p and si which are eliminated most efficiently in reservoirs through particle sedimentation n cycling within reservoirs is more complex and is typically dominated by transformation processes reservoirs contributed approximately 33 of the total n removed by lentic systems in 2000 and denitrification and burial eliminated 7 of n loading to the global river network this is predicted to double to 14 by 2030 akbarzadeh et al 2019 harrison et al 2009 recently a review article by maavara et al 2020 discussed the impacts of damming on the biogeochemistry of these nutrients along river networks from a global perspective the authors emphasized that responsible dam construction and management require consideration of nutrient elimination and loading to achieve a balance between environmental impacts and damming services given the relative complexity of n transformation a complete knowledge of n cycling processes in reservoirs and dammed river systems is critically important n inputs to reservoirs are transformed by a series of biotic and abiotic processes such as nitrification and denitrification biological assimilatory uptake sedimentation and benthic release keys et al 2019 ran et al 2017 the cycle of n in river systems was reviewed by xia et al 2018 summarizing a series of n transformation pathways active in the water column suspended particle water surfaces in overlying water sediment water interfaces and riparian zones n transformations in rivers and streams are mainly controlled by microbial mediated oxidation and reduction processes and thus are usually referred to as the microbial n cycle several researchers have summarized these biological processes kuypers et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b briefly dinitrogen gas n2 is first fixed to ammonia n nh4 which is assimilated into organic n the degradation of organic n through ammonification can in turn release nh4 which is subsequently oxidized to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 through the nitrification process and eventually converted back to n2 via denitrification and anammox processes the n cycling in river systems is influenced by both natural and man made disturbances rivers are being changed because of human activities and damming is the most severe anthropogenic disturbance the widespread construction of dams and reservoirs may impede the hydrologic connectivity of rivers limit physical exchange modify the distribution of species and result in variation in n transformation and flux akbarzadeh et al 2019 gao et al 2021b the importance of n as a biogenic element and water quality indicator has motivated several studies of n cycling in river systems as mentioned above some related review articles have summarized the processes mechanisms and drivers of n cycling as well as the methods for identifying the sources of n or tracing the flux of n xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b dam construction has long been a major focus of research published review articles have mainly focused on the entire n budget or flux along rivers and the role of rivers as n sources or sinks affected by damming at the global or catchment scale akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 van cappellen and maavara 2016 wang et al 2018a however no studies to date have comprehensively characterized n cycling processes and the controlling factors within a relatively small region i e river reservoir systems this review provides a comprehensive overview of n cycling processes along both the longitudinal river flow gradient and the vertical water column gradient for the first time we summarize the role of multi trophic microbiota and their biotic and abiotic interactions which have often been overlooked by previous studies in controlling n cycling in river reservoir systems learning and mastering these n cycling processes in a single reservoir is key for understanding n patterns along entire rivers the goal of this review is to promote future research on n cycles along dammed rivers as well as provide guidance for the restoration of trophic conditions and management of reservoirs from an ecosystem perspective 2 nitrogen cycling in longitudinal river reservoir systems 2 1 riverine transition lacustrine gradient induced by damming reservoirs are hybrid systems with pronounced environmental gradients from river inflows to dams and thus are characterized by a mixture of lotic and lentic conditions typically three zones are recognized along the longitudinal axes of reservoirs riverine or lotic transition and lacustrine or lentic thornton 1990 the area of each zone depends on the flow flux morphology residence time season and geographical location soares guedes et al 2020 the upstream riverine zone is a turbulent system characterized by higher flow velocity and shorter hydraulic residence time fig 1 horizontal flow is dominant in this area and is accompanied by large amounts of suspended particles resulting in higher turbidity and lower transparency the transition zone which has the properties of both natural rivers and large lakes is characterized by gradually decreasing flow velocity and particulate concentration as well as increased retention time and light penetration the lacustrine zone is located close to the dam and remains in an almost stationary state with longer water residence times lower turbidity and a deeper euphotic layer this region has properties similar to large lakes and the vertical processes are more pronounced vertical stratification may occur because of the weak hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the central reservoir area which has a high thermal stratification index especially during the warm seasons yu et al 2010 the lotic to lentic gradient in the reservoir results in shifts in species composition and distribution lotic adapted species prefer upstream riverine and transitionary habitats whereas lentic adapted species tend to occur in downstream lacustrine habitats moitra and leff 2015 pennock et al 2021 poznanska et al 2010 rychtecky and znachor 2011 overall physicochemical variations coupled with biotic properties can alter ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling along the riverine transition lacustrine system 2 2 longitudinal nitrogen cycling processes the special hydrological and biological properties of reservoirs alter various biogeochemical processes compared with natural rivers n retention and transformation are closely associated with flow patterns trophic status and sedimentation conditions xia et al 2018 consequently a series of n cycling processes such as n fixation n redox reactions and n removal are affected by heterogeneity along the riverine transition lacustrine gradient 2 2 1 nitrogen fixation n fixation in which dinitrogen gas n2 is converted to ammonium nh4 is the only biological route for fixed n creation in aquatic systems n fixation is mainly controlled by a subset of taxonomically and metabolically diverse prokaryotes called diazotrophs which exclusively rely on nitrogenase along with significant amounts of atp and reductant hoffman et al 2014 reservoirs are considered hot spots of n fixation especially in the transition zone researchers have found that n fixation is consistently low in riverine and lacustrine zones of reservoirs and peaks in the transition zone thus the risk of water quality degradation is probably higher in the transition zone doyle et al 2010 scott et al 2009 possible reasons for longitudinal variations in n fixation along the riverine transition lacustrine system were outlined by scott et al 2009 n fixation is closely related to phytoplankton production which depends on light and nutrient availability phytoplankton production is relatively low in the riverine zone and gradually increases in the transition zone because of higher light and nutrient availability but decreases in the lacustrine zone owing to nutrient limitation these observations may explain the spatial discrepancies in n fixation scott et al 2009 furthermore the amount of n fixation is known to be related to the n p balance in lakes and reservoirs de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010 vrede et al 2009 a low external input of n relative to p could stimulate cyanobacteria production and n fixation ruan et al 2014 in the reservoir system variation in transformation and sedimentation may alter the n p ratio along the longitudinal gradient p has generally been considered a limiting nutrient in freshwater schindler et al 2008 because of the exogenous n inputs from inflow rivers the riverine zone typically has a high n p ratio cubas et al 2019 most n is removed via denitrification or biotic assimilation in the transition zone which causes the limiting nutrient to shift from p to n saunders and kalff 2001 however in the lacustrine zone n is abundant and active in the overlying water and might be released endogenously from sediments under anaerobic conditions and p is largely removed from the surface water because of particle sedimentation thus increasing the n p ratio in the water column maavara et al 2015 nowlin et al 2005 this may also explain the gradual increase and then decrease in n fixation along the riverine transition lacustrine system 2 2 2 nitrogen transformation a series of complex and interactive n transformations could occur synchronously in freshwater ecosystems no3 is the main form of n entering reservoirs together with nh4 these dissolved forms of inorganic n are usually assimilated and transformed into organic n by plants phytoplankton and microbes glibert et al 2016 kreiling et al 2011 maia and moura 2014 nh4 is more easily assimilated into biomass than no3 and its accumulation is rarely observed especially under light and aerobic conditions within central reservoirs i e the static lacustrine zone the increased production of phytoplankton in central reservoirs can enhance no3 assimilation thus promoting the formation of particulate organic nitrogen pon after organisms die organic n in residues or detritus is decomposed to nh4 through mineralization which is mainly carried out by heterotrophic microbes zhang et al 2020b in the lacustrine zone high nh4 availability and low flow conditions can promote the nitrification process which is typically carried out by nitrifying microbes that use nh4 as an energy source zhang et al 2020b during this process n2o is produced and released from the water column and its concentration significantly varies among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones chen et al 2014 given that n2o is a highly potent greenhouse gas some researchers have proposed that reservoirs may exacerbate its greenhouse effects and this has received increased research attention dos santos et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 in lakes or reservoirs the surface sediment water interface is considered a hotspot of n removal including denitrification and anaerobic nh4 oxidation lansdown et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 denitrification is the primary route by which fixed n is lost from aquatic systems and it is controlled by a series of denitrification enzymes and organisms zhang et al 2020b in reservoirs the coarse particles tend to settle in the upper riverine zone and fine sediment is usually carried to the lacustrine zone and settles in the stagnant reservoir favorable conditions for denitrification usually exist in the fine sediment close to the dam chen et al 2014 wallace et al 2020 in the deep bottom water of the lacustrine zone hypoxia limits aerobic nitrification and leads to the accumulation of nh4 roberts et al 2012 overall the increased hydraulic residence time stemming from dam impoundments alters n transformations in reservoirs and induces a shift in the inorganic n composition from no3 to nh4 2 2 3 nitrogen sedimentation and release once the reservoir is formed the decreased flow velocity and mixing and greater depth lead to the retention or settlement of suspended particles including particulate organic n and inorganic suspended n wang 2020 the longitudinal heterogeneity of the particulate settlement property causes the sediment size to gradually decrease downstream mor et al 2018 the increased residence time also promotes the growth and assimilation efficiency of pelagic organisms resulting in the accumulation of endogenous n these processes coupled with the low degradation rate under hypoxic conditions in the sediment water interface are conducive to the accumulation of n in sediment chen et al 2018 reservoir sediment acts as an important sink of exogenous and autogenous organic matter the temporary or permanent burial of nutrients along with particulate matter may alleviate n enrichment in the water column meanwhile the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and nutrient mineralization often occur in the water column leading to the release of nutrients to the overlying water wang 2020 n is mainly released back into the water as nh4 via sediment resuspension which is affected by many factors such as bioturbation and the oxygen content thus the balance between deposition and release determines the n load in sediments in the continuum from the upstream riverine system to the downstream lacustrine system 3 nitrogen cycling in vertically stratified reservoirs 3 1 epilimnion thermocline hypolimnion gradient induced by stratification in the lacustrine zone the classic pattern of lake stratification is typically observed especially in the deep hydroelectric reservoirs wang et al 2018a as the water level and ambient temperature increase seasonal thermal stratification often develops along the water column creating a well mixed epilimnion a thermocline where temperature and density decrease sharply from top to bottom and a homogeneous hypolimnion jin et al 2019 xing et al 2014 multiple interfaces are observed in the stratified reservoir including the water air interface the photic aphotic interface based on the light availability the temperature transition interface i e thermocline the oxidation reduction interface depending on the hydrochemical properties and the sediment water interface chen et al 2018 the frequent exchange of material and energy at or near the interfaces has a major effect on the evolution of the eco environment this phenomenon has also led to the development of chemical stratification dissolved oxygen and nutrient content and biological stratification composition and distribution chen et al 2018 in the stratified reservoir photosynthesis occurs in the epilimnion which increases the dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph in contrast the thermocline limits the convection exchange between the top and bottom water bodies thus leading to hypoxia and low ph in deep water wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b the temporary stratification can inhibit mass transfer between the upper and lower layers resulting in different chemical properties such as the eutrophication status redox reaction degradation and mineralization of organic matter chen et al 2018 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a the development of thermal and oxygen stratification also shapes the phylogenetic composition and spatial distribution of microorganism phytoplankton zooplankton and fungi populations chen et al 2014 for example producers and consumers are usually dominant in the upper layers because of the increased stability and photosynthesis whereas decomposers are often abundant in the hypolimnion 3 2 vertical nitrogen cycling processes in the vertical profile of the reservoir the n dynamics are characterized by a series of complex biochemical processes which are primarily determined by the interaction between n enrichment and removal the n cycling processes such as assimilation benthic release nitrification and denitrification are affected by site specific environmental conditions in the lentic water during the period of thermal stratification the bottom water is usually abundant in reducing substances these nutrients may react with oxidizing substances in the surface water when seasonal exchange or sudden convective mixing occurs inducing variation in water quality previous studies have confirmed that thermal and oxygen stratification controls the speciation form and transformation of n in the water column wang 2020 the shift in the vertical distribution of n cycling processes also depends on the pattern of reservoir operation and is discrepant under high and low flow conditions the main n cycling processes in different layers during the stratification periods are shown in fig 2 3 2 1 the upper layer in the upper layer of water bodies phytoplankton densities often increase because of the longer hydraulic residence time and higher light availability which provides favorable conditions for aerobic processes mcmillan et al 2010 phytoplankton assimilation is a major process controlling the composition of n in the epilimnion phytoplankton can utilize dissolved inorganic n especially no3 and nh4 for photosynthesis primary production and the synthesis of organic compounds galloway et al 2004 part of the newly formed organic matter is degraded in this region and the dissolved n is released back to the water wang 2020 the other part of organic matter is gradually transported to the bottom which is accelerated under stagnant conditions the assimilation rate is positively related to phytoplankton abundance which is the dominant factor controlling the degree of n consumption wang et al 2018b the growth of phytoplankton in the surface water is limited by nutrient concentrations particularly dissolved inorganic p likely because of the sedimentation of particulate p in the central reservoir wang 2020 in addition during the stratification period the do concentration in the upper epilimnion is sufficient for creating an environment conducive to nitrification in which nh4 is oxidized to no2 and no3 galloway et al 2004 liu et al 2018 in the reservoir system the main source of n input is no3 which is consumed through assimilation and produced by nitrification yool et al 2007 the rate of no3 assimilation is light dependent and increases with nh4 concentration and temperature the rate of nitrification is partly inhibited by light and is positively affect by water temperature wang 2020 the epilimnion usually contains an upper euphotic layer and twilight layer extending well below the euphotic zone assimilation and nitrification are spatially separated between these two layers the n cycling processes in the euphotic layer are much simpler and are dominated by assimilation the mixed conditions in the twilight layer allow nitrifiers to compete with phytoplankton for the assimilation of nh4 suggesting that nitrification and no3 assimilation co occur in this layer fawcett et al 2015 fripiat et al 2015 3 2 2 the middle layer the thermocline is a low turbulence region that separates the surface nutrient depleted layer and the nutrient replete layer below the thermocline ross and sharples 2007 this zone affects the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the middle layer as well as the transfer of do and nutrients deep reservoirs restricted by thermal and oxygen stratification often show seasonal do scarcity therefore the decomposition of the settled organic matter is usually accompanied by the denitrification process the upward migration of the reduced n component also contributes to the nitrification process as a result nitrification and denitrification often occur in adjacent water layers wang et al 2019 the thermocline or oxycline is considered the center for n transformation and acts as an intermediary between the upper and bottom water the deposited particulate organic nitrogen pon from the surface water can be degraded by microorganisms thus causing hypoxia in the bottom water this increases the sediment release of n mainly nh4 part of the released nh4 is used for nitrification in the upper oxidized zone however a large proportion of nh4 accumulates in the bottom of the thermocline zone and the hypolimnion this can be attributed to the depletion of oxygen in the deep layers and limitations in nutrient transfer stemming from stratification 3 2 3 the bottom layer the n content in the bottom of the reservoir is controlled by denitrification and sediment release under anoxic conditions the settled organic matter is decomposed by microorganisms which consume large amounts of oxygen in the bottom water the stratified reservoirs also restrict the vertical mixing and oxygen transfer from the upper to the lower layer thus resulting in hypoxia in the hypolimnion maeck et al 2013 the low saturation degree of do in the bottom water limits aerobic nitrification and is conducive to denitrification processes cubas et al 2019 fadhullah et al 2020 roberts et al 2012 the exchange of n between sediment and water and downstream transport are also altered consequently nh4 accumulation is often observed in the bottom water which shifts the dominant form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from no3 to nh4 in the dammed reservoirs chen et al 2020 denitrification is the primary mechanism of n removal from the reservoirs which typically takes place in the anoxic hypolimnion and is characterized by high nh4 and low no3 concentrations liu et al 2018 the first steps of denitrification nitrate reduction occur in the suboxic zone and below where transcripts associated with denitrifiers are usually detected suter et al 2021 complete denitrification requires the absence of oxygen denitrification is positively related to water residence time and n load seitzinger et al 2006 higher n2 concentration in bottom water also indicates that n2 is released in the denitrification process at the sediment water interface the vertical distribution of n2 is affected not only by the denitrification process but also by the hydrological dynamics controlling fluvial transport through the water mass chen et al 2014 anammox has been shown to remove n in the reservoirs by oxidizing nh4 with no2 under hypoxic or anoxic conditions contributing to the production of n2 lin et al 2020 xue et al 2017 the hyporheic zone is another hotspot of n cycling the increase in the hydraulic residence time and sedimentation of autochthonous organic matter and the development of hypoxia in the bottom water can jointly affect the n dynamics in the hyporheic zone because of the heterogeneity of sediment deposition and riverine lacustrine transformation the nutrient supply pattern in the hyporheic zone shifts from horizontal transport to vertical deposition and diffusion seitzinger et al 2006 these processes increase in the anaerobic zone in the sediment thus enhancing sediment denitrification 3 3 nitrogen cycling feedbacks due to stratification in the stratified reservoir the thermocline or oxycline inhibits the transfer of do resulting in an oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion n cycling feedbacks may occur in the vertical profile and this requires more research attention zhang et al 2020b proposed two types of n cycling feedbacks in marine systems the first is based on n2 fixation in this process the increase in the newly fixed n increases the n inventory and the n p ratio which inhibits n2 fixation by phytoplankton the second type of feedback is more likely to occur in the reservoir system given that no3 is the main source of n in the reservoir in this process fig 3 the high no3 concentration in upstream inputs promotes the assimilation of nutrients by phytoplankton the increased biological productivity creates an organic matter sink in the bottom water column and the sediments this organic matter is then degraded to nh4 by decomposers the degradation processes consume large amounts of oxygen and increase the extent of hypoxia in the hypolimnion the hypoxic sediment can release more n in the form of nh4 which further increases n loading in the upper water column thus a positive feedback loop may form among the increased n input the higher primary productivity the increased organic matter sedimentation severe hypoxia in the bottom water increased n released from sediment and increased n in the water body chen et al 2018 rabalais et al 2010 given the n cycling feedback loop ecosystem restoration is difficult if eutrophication occurs in reservoirs thus preventing eutrophication and the formation of a positive feedback loop is critically important and controlling external inputs and improving the do level in the bottom water is essential for achieving this there is also a need to increase the denitrification rate and associated redox processes e g anammox that remove n from deep reservoirs 4 nitrogen cycling processes mediated by multi trophic microbiota 4 1 biota ecosystem interactions from a food web perspective ecosystem functions of the riverine system include the processes and properties of a given habitat these processes are driven by abiotic factors such as temperature nutrient concentrations and hydrological features but also by biotic factors such as biological composition and diversity smeti et al 2019 recently palmer and ruhi 2019 summarized the relationships among streamflow biota and ecosystem processes and proposed that the three way flow biota ecosystem processes nexus interaction should be considered when restoring and protecting river systems understanding how biological processes affect and are affected by ecosystem processes under flowing conditions is particularly important especially in rivers in which the streamflow has been altered by damming nutrient cycling in deep reservoirs is complex as nutrient concentrations in reservoirs are affected by many factors including nutrient inputs thermal stratification primary production and biological degradation wang 2020 the cycling of c n and many other elements is primarily driven by microorganisms which carry out many important ecosystem functions ferrera et al 2015 the efficiency with which microbes perform these functions is controlled by both bottom up physicochemical properties and top bottom higher trophic level species forces kellogg et al 2019 the microbial food web can regenerate and transfer elements to larger organisms and thus may alter nutrient and energy flows in aquatic ecosystems numerous studies and review articles have examined the roles of microbes in nutrient cycling mostly focusing on bacterial roles in degradation transformation and mineralization processes arora williams et al 2018 luo et al 2017 other microbes such as virus zimmerman et al 2020 fungi grossart et al 2019 and other eukaryotic microorganisms gadd and raven 2010 also participate in nutrient cycling however comprehensive reviews on the impacts of multi trophic microbiota and biotic interactions on nutrient cycles are scarce especially in river reservoir systems 4 2 the role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen cycling n cycling is a ubiquitous and important element cycle in aquatic ecosystems that has long been thought to be mediated by microorganisms these microorganisms can convert n compounds spanning redox states from 3 to 5 through 14 redox reactions kuypers et al 2018 the growth limiting nutrients are then transformed to bioavailable n such as nh4 and no3 thus facilitating nutrient utilization by other organisms previous studies have mainly focused on the prokaryotic contributions to n transformation however eukaryotes have also been shown to participate in n cycling in direct e g assimilation and denitrification and indirect e g predation excretion and bioturbation ways here we focus on multi trophic eukaryotes and summarize their roles in aquatic n cycling fig 4 4 2 1 direct involvement eukaryotes are directly involved in the assimilation process of n cycling phytoplankton are primary producers in aquatic systems bioavailable low molecular mass inorganic n mainly no3 and nh4 can be assimilated by phytoplankton via photosynthesis the absorbed n is then transformed through biosynthesis to macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids which support the growth of phytoplankton cai et al 2019 phytoplankton assimilation has been shown to contribute to n consumption rates over the entire water column molina et al 2012 varela et al 2003 eukaryotes are also directly involved in n transformation through reduction reactions in photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes the assimilated no3 is transferred to organic n macromolecules the rate limiting step of this process is the reduction of no3 to no2 which is catalyzed by assimilatory nitrate reductase nr nr genes are ubiquitous and have been detected in diatoms dinoflagellates other flagellates chlorophytes and unknown microbial eukaryotes comeau et al 2019 in non photosynthetic eukaryotic microbes no3 and no2 can be transferred to n2 or n2o through reduction reactions under hypoxic or anoxic conditions these denitrification processes are carried out via dissimilatory nitrate and or nitrite reduction nitrite reductase gene nirk has also been shown to catalyze nitrite reduction in several microbial eukaryotes gadd and raven 2010 new pathways and processes in n cycling mediated by eukaryotic microbes were summarized by thamdrup 2012 and kamp et al 2015 these processes include intracellular nitrate storage denitrification anaerobic nh4 oxidation and anaerobic methane oxidation with no2 which are carried out by ciliates fungi foraminifera and some algae 4 2 2 grazer excretion the regeneration of nutrients by grazers is important for the growth of both primary producers and other bacteria the excreted n can release algae from competition with microbes for inorganic n and thus increase primary production palmer and ruhi 2019 nh4 is the common form of excreted n and is considered recycled n in both pelagic and benthic habitats protozoans are small consumers with high turnover and excretion rates and are the main contributors to nh4 excretion dolan 1997 other grazers such as metazoans can also excrete excess nutrients in excess of their growth demands eukaryotes can enhance the nitrification potential and proliferation of nitrifying bacteria prast et al 2007 schratzberger and ingels 2018 this can be attributed to the excretion of large quantities of nh4 by grazers which leads to changes in the c n ratio and increases in nh4 bioavailability for nitrifying bacteria the increased availability of no3 and organic compounds can also promote the heterotrophic denitrification process 4 2 3 predator prey interaction trophic interactions among microbiota can also affect n cycling processes via top down forces protozoans which are dominated by heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates are the direct predators of bacteria in aquatic habitats and their grazing on bacteria is also an important source of regenerated n pernthaler 2005 they can ingest their body weight in microorganisms per hour nitrifying bacteria are more susceptible to predation because of their relatively slow growth rates strauss and dodds 1997 therefore grazing by protozoans can stimulate n cycling by increasing the abundance of recycled limiting nutrients removing senescent cells and reducing bacterial competition tso and taghon 2006 furthermore a significant proportion of mineralized n can be passed up to metazoans via the microbial loop meiofaunal species are capable of eating their own cell volume of particles per hour daily they can counteract nitrate reduction associated with grazing microphytobenthos and bacteria they can also release organic and inorganic n thus altering the c n ratio in the water column and the sediment stock et al 2014 4 2 4 meiofaunal bioturbation macrofaunal species are generally known to enhance the turnover and transport of n via burrowing ventilation and bio irrigation have a negative effect on denitrification and have a positive effect on dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra stief 2013 recent research has examined the effects of meiofaunal bioturbation in superficial sediments on n cycling bonaglia et al 2014 meiofaunal bioturbation can stimulate the transport of no3 and nh4 in the surface of sediments by a factor of 1 5 to 3 1 compared with molecular diffusion schratzberger and ingels 2018 the increase in the do concentration creates an oxic environment that promotes aerobic processes such as nitrification the denitrification rate is also increased when the abundance and diversity of meiofauna are high this might be attributed to the increase in bioavailable substrates such as no3 and nh4 for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria which suggests that meiofauna bioturbation promotes benthic n cycling 4 3 factors affecting multi trophic microbiota and their interactions 4 3 1 hydrological and hydraulic regime the hydrological regime is a key driver of freshwater ecosystems that structures geomorphological features riverine connectivity biological diversity and stability thereby altering ecosystem functions theoretical research on food web structure has highlighted the importance of linking flow biota and ecosystem processes palmer and ruhi 2019 flow induced variations in dominant resource types biomass and the content of nutrients can propagate to higher trophic levels via bottom up forces and affect biological functions and ecological services in reservoir systems the hydraulic retention time is a key variable structuring planktonic communities including phytoplankton heterotrophic bacteria and zooplankton that induces the longitudinal succession of these communities along the riverine transition lacustrine system after the building of dams the increased transparency water temperature and nutrient bioavailability coupled with reduced turbulent mixing facilitate the development of phytoplankton the abundance of phytoplankton is usually positively correlated to water retention time chen et al 2020 the composition and succession of phytoplankton are also affected by the periodic operation of reservoirs which results in shifts from river dominated species to lake dominated species xu et al 2020 high hydraulic retention time typically accelerates the deposition of p and organic matter which inhibits the utilization of biogenic elements by bacteria and alters the availability of food resources to zooplankton domingues et al 2017 therefore water retention time may have negative effects on the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria and the dominant zooplankton may shift from bacterivores to herbivores in addition the occurrence abundance and composition of zooplankton are all associated with the quality of their environment including hydrological connectivity and lentic or lotic conditions napiórkowski et al 2019 wan maznah et al 2018 reservoir impoundments can also affect the flow regime in benthic habitats the altered benthic boundary layer flow may significantly affect sedimentary biogeochemistry and benthos ecology the abundance population growth community structure and dispersal ability of benthic bacteria flagellates ciliates and meiofauna are closely associated with processes such as sediment resuspension and hydrodynamic disturbance shimeta et al 2001 because various flow regimes occur along the river reservoir system coarse sediments preferentially deposit on the upper reaches of reservoirs whereas fine particles tend to be transported downward and become deposited in the lacustrine zone sang et al 2019 the particle size distribution can alter the abundance structure and spatial distribution of surface oriented and sediment inhabiting organisms and has a significant effect on n cycling especially the denitrification process zhang et al 2020a 4 3 2 nutrient conditions in addition to hydrology nutrients are a key factor limiting the metabolic processes of plankton given that most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are heterotrophs their n cycling rates are largely dependent on the c n ratio the concentration of dissolved organic c in reservoir systems is affected by external inputs upstream or terrestrial sources and internal disturbances induced by the flow regime or natural variations which lead to variation in primary productivity and zooplankton production gao et al 2021a palmer and ruhi 2019 dissolved inorganic n is the fundamental substance of multiple n cycling processes mediated by bacteria and phytoplankton thus the concentration of dissolved inorganic n is closely associated with n transformation efficiency domingues et al 2017 nutrient conditions can also alter the interactions of multiple trophic levels for example in highly oligotrophic systems the growth of protistan predators is bottom up controlled by the low availability of bacteria by contrast eutrophic waters can release bacterial communities from predation control and their growth is largely limited by competition for nutrients pernthaler 2005 in benthic habitats the altered biological interactions may further affect nutrient and energy transfer through different trophic levels yang et al 2019 nutrient enrichment is thought to increase bacterial and algal biomass which in turn enhances the growth of meiofauna and microfauna at higher trophic levels the shifts in microbial food web components and interactions are also associated with the availability of other essential nutrient elements such as si and p which have received extensive attention in river reservoir systems chen et al 2020 van cappellen and maavara 2016 4 3 3 thermal stratification thermal stratification is an important factor controlling material transformation in dam induced deep reservoirs several studies have shown that seasonal stratification significantly affects the composition and diversity of bacteria fungi phytoplankton and zooplankton williams et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 many factors regulate the vertical distribution of biological communities in stratified reservoirs such as water column stability do and water temperature zhou et al 2020 water column stability within reservoirs plays an important role in determining the succession of plankton food web types which leads to variation between algae based green food webs and detritus based brown food webs the mechanism of bacterial control might be altered from bottom up control during the water mixing period to top down control following stratification šolić et al 2020 do and water temperature are the most important factors as they have been observed to shape the composition of bacterial communities and plankton metabolic processes domingues et al 2017 all these factors can lead to variation in nutrient concentrations thereby affecting biological community structure and ecological functions the n cycles in central reservoirs are mediated by organisms at several trophic levels under stratification the distinct environmental conditions and biological mechanisms in different layers affect the major factors determining n cycling for example phytoplankton assimilation is the major process controlling n composition in the epilimnion and do concentration and temperature are the main factors affecting the composition of n in the oxyline and the hypolimnion su et al 2019 tran et al 2021 observed sharp contrasts in community composition and metabolic potential between the oxygenated mixed upper layer and deep anoxic water these differences shape microbial n cycling processes by removing fixed n from water fixing the upwelled n and replenishing bioavailable n in the surface water the abundances of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifying bacteria also show significant variation depending on the content of nutrients which generates vertical variation in nitrification and denitrification processes yue et al 2021 conclusions and future perspectives n cycling in the dam induced river reservoir system involves several complex processes that are affected by longitudinal variation in hydrological nutritional and particulate conditions as well as vertical temperature and oxygen gradients these n cycling processes are mediated by multi trophic microbiota and their interactions in direct e g assimilation and denitrification or indirect e g predation excretion and bioturbation ways which also depend on the unique environmental conditions in river reservoir systems based on the above reviews the following scientific and technological improvements may benefit the ecological conservation of reservoirs affected by damming the collection of long term observational biological data in river reservoir systems is essential for protecting the sustainability of ecosystems the composition and structure of multi trophic communities from bacteria to marine mammals and the complex relationship among species food web have already been integrated into bioassessments and are considered essential for making ecosystem based ecological protection and restoration decisions zhang et al 2020c zhao et al 2019 however more work on multi trophic microbiota and microbial food webs is needed and qualitative and quantitative methods to detect these organisms require improvement with advances in molecular methodologies coupled with taxonomically broad sequence repositories dna metabarcoding can be used to increase the range of taxa sampled which would increase the sampling resolution aid bioassessments and provide new insights into functional ecology hering et al 2018 although this technique has been used to monitor biodiversity detect rare endangered species and characterize biotic relationships this method still needs to be improved for it to be used to describe food web properties the current applications of dna metabarcoding in food web analysis are listed in table 1 the combination of molecular omics and machine learning approaches could help unravel hidden patterns in the structure function interaction relationships of multi trophic levels this approach could also be used to rapidly construct food webs with unprecedented precision and accuracy generally these methods can provide a clear picture of biological patterns in the upstream downstream riverine and lacustrine zones as well as in front of and behind dams subsequently ecological models that incorporate environmental parameters e g do concentration temperature and flow velocity biological processes e g composition diversity and interaction and ecosystem functions e g energy flux and nutrient cycles can be constructed the design of river flow i e environmental flow and the management of dam operations require consideration of various factors including hydrological properties morphological features and biological community structure and functions interdisciplinary collaboration is necessary for enhancing our understanding of damming related changes to nutrient dynamics and determining how dam operations can be manipulated to regulate trophic conditions anderson et al 2019 the design of environmental flows in impoundment rivers has generally been based on particular organisms such as fish vegetation and invertebrates rather than through consideration of entire food webs or ecosystems although environmental flows in the context of food webs have been studied robson et al 2017 the roles of multi trophic microbiota have received little attention therefore the direct and indirect biogeochemical impacts of damming discussed in this review underscore the need to consider multi trophic microbiota when designing environmental flows in addition a series of reservoir regulation and restoration approaches have been used to aid the protection of dammed rivers including temperature control devices hypolimnic aeration critical habitats reconnection and ecological engineering for improving water quality and trophic conditions hu et al 2016 miles and west 2011 naiman et al 2012 saito et al 2001 we

16534,the nitrogen n cycle is one of the most important nutrient cycles in river systems and it plays an important role in maintaining biogeochemical balance and global climate stability one of the main ways that humans have altered riverine ecosystems is through the construction of hydropower dams which have major effects on biogeochemical cycles most previous studies examining the effects of damming on n cycling have focused on the whole budget or flux along rivers and the role of river as n sources or sinks at the global or catchment scale however so far there is still lack of comprehensive and systematic summarize on n cycling and the controlling mechanisms in reservoirs affected by dam impoundment in this review we firstly summarize n cycling processes along the longitudinal riverine transition lacustrine gradient and the vertically stratified epilimnion thermocline hypolimnion gradient specifically we highlight the direct and indirect roles of multi trophic microbiota and their interactions in n cycling and discuss the main factors controlling these biotic processes in addition future research directions and challenges in incorporating multi trophic levels in bioassessment environmental flow design as well as reservoir regulation and restoration are summarized this review will aid future studies of n fluxes along dammed rivers and provide an essential reference for reservoir management to meet ecological needs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reservoir impoundment stratification nutrient cycles multiple trophic levels microbial food web 1 introduction rivers are important channels connecting terrestrial and marine ecosystems and serve as transportation systems for large amounts of materials and nutrients currently more than 50 of global rivers are fragmented by dams for hydropower production water supply flood control and navigation grill et al 2019 dam construction has major effects on hydro geomorphology biogeochemical cycles and the ecological environment first dams convert rivers into lentic reservoirs characterized by decreased flow velocity and increased hydraulic residence time nilsson et al 2005 hydrological variations associated with damming also affect annual runoff thermal regimes and sediment loads wang et al 2016 yigzaw et al 2019 second dams disrupt the river continuum which increases nutrient loads and induces changes in nutrient stoichiometric ratios along river systems wang et al 2018a third hydrological and biogeochemical variations reshape riparian and riverine habitats and alter the structure diversity and distribution of biological communities poff et al 2007 ultimately dams can modify the ecosystem functions e g nutrient cycling and energy flow and services e g fisheries of rivers turgeon et al 2019 nutrients such as carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and silicon si are transported along rivers damming can alter riverine nutrient cycles in multiple and complex ways and have positive or negative impacts for example reservoirs can eliminate nutrients from the water column via sedimentation or gaseous release thus alleviating eutrophication pressure on downstream ecosystems van cappellen and maavara 2016 however the longer hydraulic residence time and the higher transparency may promote primary productivity and nutrient transformation within reservoirs resulting in increased eutrophication downstream chen et al 2018 reservoirs tend to facilitate the retention of nutrients from rivers in large quantities taylor maavara from the university of waterloo has quantified the effects of dams on c p si and n fluxes based on global data they estimated that the global primary productivity and c mineralization ratio p r will double by 2030 because of damming maavara et al 2017 meanwhile approximately 17 and 5 3 of the global total p and total reactive si loading to rivers are expected to be sequestered in reservoirs respectively maavara et al 2014 2015 compared with p and si which are eliminated most efficiently in reservoirs through particle sedimentation n cycling within reservoirs is more complex and is typically dominated by transformation processes reservoirs contributed approximately 33 of the total n removed by lentic systems in 2000 and denitrification and burial eliminated 7 of n loading to the global river network this is predicted to double to 14 by 2030 akbarzadeh et al 2019 harrison et al 2009 recently a review article by maavara et al 2020 discussed the impacts of damming on the biogeochemistry of these nutrients along river networks from a global perspective the authors emphasized that responsible dam construction and management require consideration of nutrient elimination and loading to achieve a balance between environmental impacts and damming services given the relative complexity of n transformation a complete knowledge of n cycling processes in reservoirs and dammed river systems is critically important n inputs to reservoirs are transformed by a series of biotic and abiotic processes such as nitrification and denitrification biological assimilatory uptake sedimentation and benthic release keys et al 2019 ran et al 2017 the cycle of n in river systems was reviewed by xia et al 2018 summarizing a series of n transformation pathways active in the water column suspended particle water surfaces in overlying water sediment water interfaces and riparian zones n transformations in rivers and streams are mainly controlled by microbial mediated oxidation and reduction processes and thus are usually referred to as the microbial n cycle several researchers have summarized these biological processes kuypers et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b briefly dinitrogen gas n2 is first fixed to ammonia n nh4 which is assimilated into organic n the degradation of organic n through ammonification can in turn release nh4 which is subsequently oxidized to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 through the nitrification process and eventually converted back to n2 via denitrification and anammox processes the n cycling in river systems is influenced by both natural and man made disturbances rivers are being changed because of human activities and damming is the most severe anthropogenic disturbance the widespread construction of dams and reservoirs may impede the hydrologic connectivity of rivers limit physical exchange modify the distribution of species and result in variation in n transformation and flux akbarzadeh et al 2019 gao et al 2021b the importance of n as a biogenic element and water quality indicator has motivated several studies of n cycling in river systems as mentioned above some related review articles have summarized the processes mechanisms and drivers of n cycling as well as the methods for identifying the sources of n or tracing the flux of n xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b dam construction has long been a major focus of research published review articles have mainly focused on the entire n budget or flux along rivers and the role of rivers as n sources or sinks affected by damming at the global or catchment scale akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 van cappellen and maavara 2016 wang et al 2018a however no studies to date have comprehensively characterized n cycling processes and the controlling factors within a relatively small region i e river reservoir systems this review provides a comprehensive overview of n cycling processes along both the longitudinal river flow gradient and the vertical water column gradient for the first time we summarize the role of multi trophic microbiota and their biotic and abiotic interactions which have often been overlooked by previous studies in controlling n cycling in river reservoir systems learning and mastering these n cycling processes in a single reservoir is key for understanding n patterns along entire rivers the goal of this review is to promote future research on n cycles along dammed rivers as well as provide guidance for the restoration of trophic conditions and management of reservoirs from an ecosystem perspective 2 nitrogen cycling in longitudinal river reservoir systems 2 1 riverine transition lacustrine gradient induced by damming reservoirs are hybrid systems with pronounced environmental gradients from river inflows to dams and thus are characterized by a mixture of lotic and lentic conditions typically three zones are recognized along the longitudinal axes of reservoirs riverine or lotic transition and lacustrine or lentic thornton 1990 the area of each zone depends on the flow flux morphology residence time season and geographical location soares guedes et al 2020 the upstream riverine zone is a turbulent system characterized by higher flow velocity and shorter hydraulic residence time fig 1 horizontal flow is dominant in this area and is accompanied by large amounts of suspended particles resulting in higher turbidity and lower transparency the transition zone which has the properties of both natural rivers and large lakes is characterized by gradually decreasing flow velocity and particulate concentration as well as increased retention time and light penetration the lacustrine zone is located close to the dam and remains in an almost stationary state with longer water residence times lower turbidity and a deeper euphotic layer this region has properties similar to large lakes and the vertical processes are more pronounced vertical stratification may occur because of the weak hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the central reservoir area which has a high thermal stratification index especially during the warm seasons yu et al 2010 the lotic to lentic gradient in the reservoir results in shifts in species composition and distribution lotic adapted species prefer upstream riverine and transitionary habitats whereas lentic adapted species tend to occur in downstream lacustrine habitats moitra and leff 2015 pennock et al 2021 poznanska et al 2010 rychtecky and znachor 2011 overall physicochemical variations coupled with biotic properties can alter ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling along the riverine transition lacustrine system 2 2 longitudinal nitrogen cycling processes the special hydrological and biological properties of reservoirs alter various biogeochemical processes compared with natural rivers n retention and transformation are closely associated with flow patterns trophic status and sedimentation conditions xia et al 2018 consequently a series of n cycling processes such as n fixation n redox reactions and n removal are affected by heterogeneity along the riverine transition lacustrine gradient 2 2 1 nitrogen fixation n fixation in which dinitrogen gas n2 is converted to ammonium nh4 is the only biological route for fixed n creation in aquatic systems n fixation is mainly controlled by a subset of taxonomically and metabolically diverse prokaryotes called diazotrophs which exclusively rely on nitrogenase along with significant amounts of atp and reductant hoffman et al 2014 reservoirs are considered hot spots of n fixation especially in the transition zone researchers have found that n fixation is consistently low in riverine and lacustrine zones of reservoirs and peaks in the transition zone thus the risk of water quality degradation is probably higher in the transition zone doyle et al 2010 scott et al 2009 possible reasons for longitudinal variations in n fixation along the riverine transition lacustrine system were outlined by scott et al 2009 n fixation is closely related to phytoplankton production which depends on light and nutrient availability phytoplankton production is relatively low in the riverine zone and gradually increases in the transition zone because of higher light and nutrient availability but decreases in the lacustrine zone owing to nutrient limitation these observations may explain the spatial discrepancies in n fixation scott et al 2009 furthermore the amount of n fixation is known to be related to the n p balance in lakes and reservoirs de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010 vrede et al 2009 a low external input of n relative to p could stimulate cyanobacteria production and n fixation ruan et al 2014 in the reservoir system variation in transformation and sedimentation may alter the n p ratio along the longitudinal gradient p has generally been considered a limiting nutrient in freshwater schindler et al 2008 because of the exogenous n inputs from inflow rivers the riverine zone typically has a high n p ratio cubas et al 2019 most n is removed via denitrification or biotic assimilation in the transition zone which causes the limiting nutrient to shift from p to n saunders and kalff 2001 however in the lacustrine zone n is abundant and active in the overlying water and might be released endogenously from sediments under anaerobic conditions and p is largely removed from the surface water because of particle sedimentation thus increasing the n p ratio in the water column maavara et al 2015 nowlin et al 2005 this may also explain the gradual increase and then decrease in n fixation along the riverine transition lacustrine system 2 2 2 nitrogen transformation a series of complex and interactive n transformations could occur synchronously in freshwater ecosystems no3 is the main form of n entering reservoirs together with nh4 these dissolved forms of inorganic n are usually assimilated and transformed into organic n by plants phytoplankton and microbes glibert et al 2016 kreiling et al 2011 maia and moura 2014 nh4 is more easily assimilated into biomass than no3 and its accumulation is rarely observed especially under light and aerobic conditions within central reservoirs i e the static lacustrine zone the increased production of phytoplankton in central reservoirs can enhance no3 assimilation thus promoting the formation of particulate organic nitrogen pon after organisms die organic n in residues or detritus is decomposed to nh4 through mineralization which is mainly carried out by heterotrophic microbes zhang et al 2020b in the lacustrine zone high nh4 availability and low flow conditions can promote the nitrification process which is typically carried out by nitrifying microbes that use nh4 as an energy source zhang et al 2020b during this process n2o is produced and released from the water column and its concentration significantly varies among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones chen et al 2014 given that n2o is a highly potent greenhouse gas some researchers have proposed that reservoirs may exacerbate its greenhouse effects and this has received increased research attention dos santos et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 in lakes or reservoirs the surface sediment water interface is considered a hotspot of n removal including denitrification and anaerobic nh4 oxidation lansdown et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 denitrification is the primary route by which fixed n is lost from aquatic systems and it is controlled by a series of denitrification enzymes and organisms zhang et al 2020b in reservoirs the coarse particles tend to settle in the upper riverine zone and fine sediment is usually carried to the lacustrine zone and settles in the stagnant reservoir favorable conditions for denitrification usually exist in the fine sediment close to the dam chen et al 2014 wallace et al 2020 in the deep bottom water of the lacustrine zone hypoxia limits aerobic nitrification and leads to the accumulation of nh4 roberts et al 2012 overall the increased hydraulic residence time stemming from dam impoundments alters n transformations in reservoirs and induces a shift in the inorganic n composition from no3 to nh4 2 2 3 nitrogen sedimentation and release once the reservoir is formed the decreased flow velocity and mixing and greater depth lead to the retention or settlement of suspended particles including particulate organic n and inorganic suspended n wang 2020 the longitudinal heterogeneity of the particulate settlement property causes the sediment size to gradually decrease downstream mor et al 2018 the increased residence time also promotes the growth and assimilation efficiency of pelagic organisms resulting in the accumulation of endogenous n these processes coupled with the low degradation rate under hypoxic conditions in the sediment water interface are conducive to the accumulation of n in sediment chen et al 2018 reservoir sediment acts as an important sink of exogenous and autogenous organic matter the temporary or permanent burial of nutrients along with particulate matter may alleviate n enrichment in the water column meanwhile the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and nutrient mineralization often occur in the water column leading to the release of nutrients to the overlying water wang 2020 n is mainly released back into the water as nh4 via sediment resuspension which is affected by many factors such as bioturbation and the oxygen content thus the balance between deposition and release determines the n load in sediments in the continuum from the upstream riverine system to the downstream lacustrine system 3 nitrogen cycling in vertically stratified reservoirs 3 1 epilimnion thermocline hypolimnion gradient induced by stratification in the lacustrine zone the classic pattern of lake stratification is typically observed especially in the deep hydroelectric reservoirs wang et al 2018a as the water level and ambient temperature increase seasonal thermal stratification often develops along the water column creating a well mixed epilimnion a thermocline where temperature and density decrease sharply from top to bottom and a homogeneous hypolimnion jin et al 2019 xing et al 2014 multiple interfaces are observed in the stratified reservoir including the water air interface the photic aphotic interface based on the light availability the temperature transition interface i e thermocline the oxidation reduction interface depending on the hydrochemical properties and the sediment water interface chen et al 2018 the frequent exchange of material and energy at or near the interfaces has a major effect on the evolution of the eco environment this phenomenon has also led to the development of chemical stratification dissolved oxygen and nutrient content and biological stratification composition and distribution chen et al 2018 in the stratified reservoir photosynthesis occurs in the epilimnion which increases the dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph in contrast the thermocline limits the convection exchange between the top and bottom water bodies thus leading to hypoxia and low ph in deep water wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b the temporary stratification can inhibit mass transfer between the upper and lower layers resulting in different chemical properties such as the eutrophication status redox reaction degradation and mineralization of organic matter chen et al 2018 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a the development of thermal and oxygen stratification also shapes the phylogenetic composition and spatial distribution of microorganism phytoplankton zooplankton and fungi populations chen et al 2014 for example producers and consumers are usually dominant in the upper layers because of the increased stability and photosynthesis whereas decomposers are often abundant in the hypolimnion 3 2 vertical nitrogen cycling processes in the vertical profile of the reservoir the n dynamics are characterized by a series of complex biochemical processes which are primarily determined by the interaction between n enrichment and removal the n cycling processes such as assimilation benthic release nitrification and denitrification are affected by site specific environmental conditions in the lentic water during the period of thermal stratification the bottom water is usually abundant in reducing substances these nutrients may react with oxidizing substances in the surface water when seasonal exchange or sudden convective mixing occurs inducing variation in water quality previous studies have confirmed that thermal and oxygen stratification controls the speciation form and transformation of n in the water column wang 2020 the shift in the vertical distribution of n cycling processes also depends on the pattern of reservoir operation and is discrepant under high and low flow conditions the main n cycling processes in different layers during the stratification periods are shown in fig 2 3 2 1 the upper layer in the upper layer of water bodies phytoplankton densities often increase because of the longer hydraulic residence time and higher light availability which provides favorable conditions for aerobic processes mcmillan et al 2010 phytoplankton assimilation is a major process controlling the composition of n in the epilimnion phytoplankton can utilize dissolved inorganic n especially no3 and nh4 for photosynthesis primary production and the synthesis of organic compounds galloway et al 2004 part of the newly formed organic matter is degraded in this region and the dissolved n is released back to the water wang 2020 the other part of organic matter is gradually transported to the bottom which is accelerated under stagnant conditions the assimilation rate is positively related to phytoplankton abundance which is the dominant factor controlling the degree of n consumption wang et al 2018b the growth of phytoplankton in the surface water is limited by nutrient concentrations particularly dissolved inorganic p likely because of the sedimentation of particulate p in the central reservoir wang 2020 in addition during the stratification period the do concentration in the upper epilimnion is sufficient for creating an environment conducive to nitrification in which nh4 is oxidized to no2 and no3 galloway et al 2004 liu et al 2018 in the reservoir system the main source of n input is no3 which is consumed through assimilation and produced by nitrification yool et al 2007 the rate of no3 assimilation is light dependent and increases with nh4 concentration and temperature the rate of nitrification is partly inhibited by light and is positively affect by water temperature wang 2020 the epilimnion usually contains an upper euphotic layer and twilight layer extending well below the euphotic zone assimilation and nitrification are spatially separated between these two layers the n cycling processes in the euphotic layer are much simpler and are dominated by assimilation the mixed conditions in the twilight layer allow nitrifiers to compete with phytoplankton for the assimilation of nh4 suggesting that nitrification and no3 assimilation co occur in this layer fawcett et al 2015 fripiat et al 2015 3 2 2 the middle layer the thermocline is a low turbulence region that separates the surface nutrient depleted layer and the nutrient replete layer below the thermocline ross and sharples 2007 this zone affects the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the middle layer as well as the transfer of do and nutrients deep reservoirs restricted by thermal and oxygen stratification often show seasonal do scarcity therefore the decomposition of the settled organic matter is usually accompanied by the denitrification process the upward migration of the reduced n component also contributes to the nitrification process as a result nitrification and denitrification often occur in adjacent water layers wang et al 2019 the thermocline or oxycline is considered the center for n transformation and acts as an intermediary between the upper and bottom water the deposited particulate organic nitrogen pon from the surface water can be degraded by microorganisms thus causing hypoxia in the bottom water this increases the sediment release of n mainly nh4 part of the released nh4 is used for nitrification in the upper oxidized zone however a large proportion of nh4 accumulates in the bottom of the thermocline zone and the hypolimnion this can be attributed to the depletion of oxygen in the deep layers and limitations in nutrient transfer stemming from stratification 3 2 3 the bottom layer the n content in the bottom of the reservoir is controlled by denitrification and sediment release under anoxic conditions the settled organic matter is decomposed by microorganisms which consume large amounts of oxygen in the bottom water the stratified reservoirs also restrict the vertical mixing and oxygen transfer from the upper to the lower layer thus resulting in hypoxia in the hypolimnion maeck et al 2013 the low saturation degree of do in the bottom water limits aerobic nitrification and is conducive to denitrification processes cubas et al 2019 fadhullah et al 2020 roberts et al 2012 the exchange of n between sediment and water and downstream transport are also altered consequently nh4 accumulation is often observed in the bottom water which shifts the dominant form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from no3 to nh4 in the dammed reservoirs chen et al 2020 denitrification is the primary mechanism of n removal from the reservoirs which typically takes place in the anoxic hypolimnion and is characterized by high nh4 and low no3 concentrations liu et al 2018 the first steps of denitrification nitrate reduction occur in the suboxic zone and below where transcripts associated with denitrifiers are usually detected suter et al 2021 complete denitrification requires the absence of oxygen denitrification is positively related to water residence time and n load seitzinger et al 2006 higher n2 concentration in bottom water also indicates that n2 is released in the denitrification process at the sediment water interface the vertical distribution of n2 is affected not only by the denitrification process but also by the hydrological dynamics controlling fluvial transport through the water mass chen et al 2014 anammox has been shown to remove n in the reservoirs by oxidizing nh4 with no2 under hypoxic or anoxic conditions contributing to the production of n2 lin et al 2020 xue et al 2017 the hyporheic zone is another hotspot of n cycling the increase in the hydraulic residence time and sedimentation of autochthonous organic matter and the development of hypoxia in the bottom water can jointly affect the n dynamics in the hyporheic zone because of the heterogeneity of sediment deposition and riverine lacustrine transformation the nutrient supply pattern in the hyporheic zone shifts from horizontal transport to vertical deposition and diffusion seitzinger et al 2006 these processes increase in the anaerobic zone in the sediment thus enhancing sediment denitrification 3 3 nitrogen cycling feedbacks due to stratification in the stratified reservoir the thermocline or oxycline inhibits the transfer of do resulting in an oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion n cycling feedbacks may occur in the vertical profile and this requires more research attention zhang et al 2020b proposed two types of n cycling feedbacks in marine systems the first is based on n2 fixation in this process the increase in the newly fixed n increases the n inventory and the n p ratio which inhibits n2 fixation by phytoplankton the second type of feedback is more likely to occur in the reservoir system given that no3 is the main source of n in the reservoir in this process fig 3 the high no3 concentration in upstream inputs promotes the assimilation of nutrients by phytoplankton the increased biological productivity creates an organic matter sink in the bottom water column and the sediments this organic matter is then degraded to nh4 by decomposers the degradation processes consume large amounts of oxygen and increase the extent of hypoxia in the hypolimnion the hypoxic sediment can release more n in the form of nh4 which further increases n loading in the upper water column thus a positive feedback loop may form among the increased n input the higher primary productivity the increased organic matter sedimentation severe hypoxia in the bottom water increased n released from sediment and increased n in the water body chen et al 2018 rabalais et al 2010 given the n cycling feedback loop ecosystem restoration is difficult if eutrophication occurs in reservoirs thus preventing eutrophication and the formation of a positive feedback loop is critically important and controlling external inputs and improving the do level in the bottom water is essential for achieving this there is also a need to increase the denitrification rate and associated redox processes e g anammox that remove n from deep reservoirs 4 nitrogen cycling processes mediated by multi trophic microbiota 4 1 biota ecosystem interactions from a food web perspective ecosystem functions of the riverine system include the processes and properties of a given habitat these processes are driven by abiotic factors such as temperature nutrient concentrations and hydrological features but also by biotic factors such as biological composition and diversity smeti et al 2019 recently palmer and ruhi 2019 summarized the relationships among streamflow biota and ecosystem processes and proposed that the three way flow biota ecosystem processes nexus interaction should be considered when restoring and protecting river systems understanding how biological processes affect and are affected by ecosystem processes under flowing conditions is particularly important especially in rivers in which the streamflow has been altered by damming nutrient cycling in deep reservoirs is complex as nutrient concentrations in reservoirs are affected by many factors including nutrient inputs thermal stratification primary production and biological degradation wang 2020 the cycling of c n and many other elements is primarily driven by microorganisms which carry out many important ecosystem functions ferrera et al 2015 the efficiency with which microbes perform these functions is controlled by both bottom up physicochemical properties and top bottom higher trophic level species forces kellogg et al 2019 the microbial food web can regenerate and transfer elements to larger organisms and thus may alter nutrient and energy flows in aquatic ecosystems numerous studies and review articles have examined the roles of microbes in nutrient cycling mostly focusing on bacterial roles in degradation transformation and mineralization processes arora williams et al 2018 luo et al 2017 other microbes such as virus zimmerman et al 2020 fungi grossart et al 2019 and other eukaryotic microorganisms gadd and raven 2010 also participate in nutrient cycling however comprehensive reviews on the impacts of multi trophic microbiota and biotic interactions on nutrient cycles are scarce especially in river reservoir systems 4 2 the role of multi trophic microbiota in nitrogen cycling n cycling is a ubiquitous and important element cycle in aquatic ecosystems that has long been thought to be mediated by microorganisms these microorganisms can convert n compounds spanning redox states from 3 to 5 through 14 redox reactions kuypers et al 2018 the growth limiting nutrients are then transformed to bioavailable n such as nh4 and no3 thus facilitating nutrient utilization by other organisms previous studies have mainly focused on the prokaryotic contributions to n transformation however eukaryotes have also been shown to participate in n cycling in direct e g assimilation and denitrification and indirect e g predation excretion and bioturbation ways here we focus on multi trophic eukaryotes and summarize their roles in aquatic n cycling fig 4 4 2 1 direct involvement eukaryotes are directly involved in the assimilation process of n cycling phytoplankton are primary producers in aquatic systems bioavailable low molecular mass inorganic n mainly no3 and nh4 can be assimilated by phytoplankton via photosynthesis the absorbed n is then transformed through biosynthesis to macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids which support the growth of phytoplankton cai et al 2019 phytoplankton assimilation has been shown to contribute to n consumption rates over the entire water column molina et al 2012 varela et al 2003 eukaryotes are also directly involved in n transformation through reduction reactions in photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes the assimilated no3 is transferred to organic n macromolecules the rate limiting step of this process is the reduction of no3 to no2 which is catalyzed by assimilatory nitrate reductase nr nr genes are ubiquitous and have been detected in diatoms dinoflagellates other flagellates chlorophytes and unknown microbial eukaryotes comeau et al 2019 in non photosynthetic eukaryotic microbes no3 and no2 can be transferred to n2 or n2o through reduction reactions under hypoxic or anoxic conditions these denitrification processes are carried out via dissimilatory nitrate and or nitrite reduction nitrite reductase gene nirk has also been shown to catalyze nitrite reduction in several microbial eukaryotes gadd and raven 2010 new pathways and processes in n cycling mediated by eukaryotic microbes were summarized by thamdrup 2012 and kamp et al 2015 these processes include intracellular nitrate storage denitrification anaerobic nh4 oxidation and anaerobic methane oxidation with no2 which are carried out by ciliates fungi foraminifera and some algae 4 2 2 grazer excretion the regeneration of nutrients by grazers is important for the growth of both primary producers and other bacteria the excreted n can release algae from competition with microbes for inorganic n and thus increase primary production palmer and ruhi 2019 nh4 is the common form of excreted n and is considered recycled n in both pelagic and benthic habitats protozoans are small consumers with high turnover and excretion rates and are the main contributors to nh4 excretion dolan 1997 other grazers such as metazoans can also excrete excess nutrients in excess of their growth demands eukaryotes can enhance the nitrification potential and proliferation of nitrifying bacteria prast et al 2007 schratzberger and ingels 2018 this can be attributed to the excretion of large quantities of nh4 by grazers which leads to changes in the c n ratio and increases in nh4 bioavailability for nitrifying bacteria the increased availability of no3 and organic compounds can also promote the heterotrophic denitrification process 4 2 3 predator prey interaction trophic interactions among microbiota can also affect n cycling processes via top down forces protozoans which are dominated by heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates are the direct predators of bacteria in aquatic habitats and their grazing on bacteria is also an important source of regenerated n pernthaler 2005 they can ingest their body weight in microorganisms per hour nitrifying bacteria are more susceptible to predation because of their relatively slow growth rates strauss and dodds 1997 therefore grazing by protozoans can stimulate n cycling by increasing the abundance of recycled limiting nutrients removing senescent cells and reducing bacterial competition tso and taghon 2006 furthermore a significant proportion of mineralized n can be passed up to metazoans via the microbial loop meiofaunal species are capable of eating their own cell volume of particles per hour daily they can counteract nitrate reduction associated with grazing microphytobenthos and bacteria they can also release organic and inorganic n thus altering the c n ratio in the water column and the sediment stock et al 2014 4 2 4 meiofaunal bioturbation macrofaunal species are generally known to enhance the turnover and transport of n via burrowing ventilation and bio irrigation have a negative effect on denitrification and have a positive effect on dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra stief 2013 recent research has examined the effects of meiofaunal bioturbation in superficial sediments on n cycling bonaglia et al 2014 meiofaunal bioturbation can stimulate the transport of no3 and nh4 in the surface of sediments by a factor of 1 5 to 3 1 compared with molecular diffusion schratzberger and ingels 2018 the increase in the do concentration creates an oxic environment that promotes aerobic processes such as nitrification the denitrification rate is also increased when the abundance and diversity of meiofauna are high this might be attributed to the increase in bioavailable substrates such as no3 and nh4 for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria which suggests that meiofauna bioturbation promotes benthic n cycling 4 3 factors affecting multi trophic microbiota and their interactions 4 3 1 hydrological and hydraulic regime the hydrological regime is a key driver of freshwater ecosystems that structures geomorphological features riverine connectivity biological diversity and stability thereby altering ecosystem functions theoretical research on food web structure has highlighted the importance of linking flow biota and ecosystem processes palmer and ruhi 2019 flow induced variations in dominant resource types biomass and the content of nutrients can propagate to higher trophic levels via bottom up forces and affect biological functions and ecological services in reservoir systems the hydraulic retention time is a key variable structuring planktonic communities including phytoplankton heterotrophic bacteria and zooplankton that induces the longitudinal succession of these communities along the riverine transition lacustrine system after the building of dams the increased transparency water temperature and nutrient bioavailability coupled with reduced turbulent mixing facilitate the development of phytoplankton the abundance of phytoplankton is usually positively correlated to water retention time chen et al 2020 the composition and succession of phytoplankton are also affected by the periodic operation of reservoirs which results in shifts from river dominated species to lake dominated species xu et al 2020 high hydraulic retention time typically accelerates the deposition of p and organic matter which inhibits the utilization of biogenic elements by bacteria and alters the availability of food resources to zooplankton domingues et al 2017 therefore water retention time may have negative effects on the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria and the dominant zooplankton may shift from bacterivores to herbivores in addition the occurrence abundance and composition of zooplankton are all associated with the quality of their environment including hydrological connectivity and lentic or lotic conditions napiórkowski et al 2019 wan maznah et al 2018 reservoir impoundments can also affect the flow regime in benthic habitats the altered benthic boundary layer flow may significantly affect sedimentary biogeochemistry and benthos ecology the abundance population growth community structure and dispersal ability of benthic bacteria flagellates ciliates and meiofauna are closely associated with processes such as sediment resuspension and hydrodynamic disturbance shimeta et al 2001 because various flow regimes occur along the river reservoir system coarse sediments preferentially deposit on the upper reaches of reservoirs whereas fine particles tend to be transported downward and become deposited in the lacustrine zone sang et al 2019 the particle size distribution can alter the abundance structure and spatial distribution of surface oriented and sediment inhabiting organisms and has a significant effect on n cycling especially the denitrification process zhang et al 2020a 4 3 2 nutrient conditions in addition to hydrology nutrients are a key factor limiting the metabolic processes of plankton given that most nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are heterotrophs their n cycling rates are largely dependent on the c n ratio the concentration of dissolved organic c in reservoir systems is affected by external inputs upstream or terrestrial sources and internal disturbances induced by the flow regime or natural variations which lead to variation in primary productivity and zooplankton production gao et al 2021a palmer and ruhi 2019 dissolved inorganic n is the fundamental substance of multiple n cycling processes mediated by bacteria and phytoplankton thus the concentration of dissolved inorganic n is closely associated with n transformation efficiency domingues et al 2017 nutrient conditions can also alter the interactions of multiple trophic levels for example in highly oligotrophic systems the growth of protistan predators is bottom up controlled by the low availability of bacteria by contrast eutrophic waters can release bacterial communities from predation control and their growth is largely limited by competition for nutrients pernthaler 2005 in benthic habitats the altered biological interactions may further affect nutrient and energy transfer through different trophic levels yang et al 2019 nutrient enrichment is thought to increase bacterial and algal biomass which in turn enhances the growth of meiofauna and microfauna at higher trophic levels the shifts in microbial food web components and interactions are also associated with the availability of other essential nutrient elements such as si and p which have received extensive attention in river reservoir systems chen et al 2020 van cappellen and maavara 2016 4 3 3 thermal stratification thermal stratification is an important factor controlling material transformation in dam induced deep reservoirs several studies have shown that seasonal stratification significantly affects the composition and diversity of bacteria fungi phytoplankton and zooplankton williams et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 many factors regulate the vertical distribution of biological communities in stratified reservoirs such as water column stability do and water temperature zhou et al 2020 water column stability within reservoirs plays an important role in determining the succession of plankton food web types which leads to variation between algae based green food webs and detritus based brown food webs the mechanism of bacterial control might be altered from bottom up control during the water mixing period to top down control following stratification šolić et al 2020 do and water temperature are the most important factors as they have been observed to shape the composition of bacterial communities and plankton metabolic processes domingues et al 2017 all these factors can lead to variation in nutrient concentrations thereby affecting biological community structure and ecological functions the n cycles in central reservoirs are mediated by organisms at several trophic levels under stratification the distinct environmental conditions and biological mechanisms in different layers affect the major factors determining n cycling for example phytoplankton assimilation is the major process controlling n composition in the epilimnion and do concentration and temperature are the main factors affecting the composition of n in the oxyline and the hypolimnion su et al 2019 tran et al 2021 observed sharp contrasts in community composition and metabolic potential between the oxygenated mixed upper layer and deep anoxic water these differences shape microbial n cycling processes by removing fixed n from water fixing the upwelled n and replenishing bioavailable n in the surface water the abundances of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifying bacteria also show significant variation depending on the content of nutrients which generates vertical variation in nitrification and denitrification processes yue et al 2021 conclusions and future perspectives n cycling in the dam induced river reservoir system involves several complex processes that are affected by longitudinal variation in hydrological nutritional and particulate conditions as well as vertical temperature and oxygen gradients these n cycling processes are mediated by multi trophic microbiota and their interactions in direct e g assimilation and denitrification or indirect e g predation excretion and bioturbation ways which also depend on the unique environmental conditions in river reservoir systems based on the above reviews the following scientific and technological improvements may benefit the ecological conservation of reservoirs affected by damming the collection of long term observational biological data in river reservoir systems is essential for protecting the sustainability of ecosystems the composition and structure of multi trophic communities from bacteria to marine mammals and the complex relationship among species food web have already been integrated into bioassessments and are considered essential for making ecosystem based ecological protection and restoration decisions zhang et al 2020c zhao et al 2019 however more work on multi trophic microbiota and microbial food webs is needed and qualitative and quantitative methods to detect these organisms require improvement with advances in molecular methodologies coupled with taxonomically broad sequence repositories dna metabarcoding can be used to increase the range of taxa sampled which would increase the sampling resolution aid bioassessments and provide new insights into functional ecology hering et al 2018 although this technique has been used to monitor biodiversity detect rare endangered species and characterize biotic relationships this method still needs to be improved for it to be used to describe food web properties the current applications of dna metabarcoding in food web analysis are listed in table 1 the combination of molecular omics and machine learning approaches could help unravel hidden patterns in the structure function interaction relationships of multi trophic levels this approach could also be used to rapidly construct food webs with unprecedented precision and accuracy generally these methods can provide a clear picture of biological patterns in the upstream downstream riverine and lacustrine zones as well as in front of and behind dams subsequently ecological models that incorporate environmental parameters e g do concentration temperature and flow velocity biological processes e g composition diversity and interaction and ecosystem functions e g energy flux and nutrient cycles can be constructed the design of river flow i e environmental flow and the management of dam operations require consideration of various factors including hydrological properties morphological features and biological community structure and functions interdisciplinary collaboration is necessary for enhancing our understanding of damming related changes to nutrient dynamics and determining how dam operations can be manipulated to regulate trophic conditions anderson et al 2019 the design of environmental flows in impoundment rivers has generally been based on particular organisms such as fish vegetation and invertebrates rather than through consideration of entire food webs or ecosystems although environmental flows in the context of food webs have been studied robson et al 2017 the roles of multi trophic microbiota have received little attention therefore the direct and indirect biogeochemical impacts of damming discussed in this review underscore the need to consider multi trophic microbiota when designing environmental flows in addition a series of reservoir regulation and restoration approaches have been used to aid the protection of dammed rivers including temperature control devices hypolimnic aeration critical habitats reconnection and ecological engineering for improving water quality and trophic conditions hu et al 2016 miles and west 2011 naiman et al 2012 saito et al 2001 we suggest that multi trophic microbiota and food web models be integrated into these interdisciplinary engineering and ecological methods to clarify the impacts of damming on riverine food webs and biogeochemical cycling additional studies focused on employing modeling approaches and developing strategies to restore riverine ecosystems in the future are especially needed declaration of competing
