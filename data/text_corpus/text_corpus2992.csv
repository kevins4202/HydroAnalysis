14960,the effect of reservoir construction on nutrient dynamics is well recognized at flood event scale influence of reservoir flood regulation on nutrient transport however has received less attention taking the three gorges reservoir tgr in the changjiang river as an example during the tgr s regulation on a flood in sep 2021 this study collected water samples along the mainstream of the reservoir as well as pre post dam with the aim to identify the impact of flood regulation on nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus distribution and transportation results show that nitrate nitrogen no3 n and particulate phosphorus pp were the main fraction of the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp with the proportion of 46 5 95 6 and 57 4 81 6 respectively n and p responded different to flood regulation i along the stream p concentration significantly decreased due to pp deposited with sediment while n concentration barely changed during flood regulation ii p concentration was significantly higher at post dam section than at pre dam section while n concentration maintained the same the diffed response to flood regulation caused tn tp ratio increased from 4 to 8 in the reservoir tail to over 20 near the dam which probably arise eutrophication in the reservoir head area this study reveals the influence of flood regulation on nutrient transport in flood event and provides scientific basis for reservoir management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flood regulation nitrogen phosphorus suspended sediment three gorges reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and sediment are the main carriers and drivers of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the river system tang et al 2018 they mobilize nutrients from uplands into headwater streams and move them to high level rivers through complex water network alexander et al 2007 by altering physical processes such as deposition and resuspension and biogeochemical processes such as nitration and decomposition water and sediment generally control the transport and fate of in river nutrients burford et al 2012 due to the differences in occurrence the responses of nitrogen and phosphorus to changes in water and sediment vary from each other meybeck 2003 nitrogen mainly exists in inorganic form including ammonia n nh3 n and nitrate n no3 n both of which are largely dissolved in water ran et al 2017 while particulate n that adsorbed on sediment occupies smaller proportion in most of the global rivers e g chen et al 2019 therefore dynamics of sediment has less effect on nitrogen transport than water on the contrary phosphorus mainly occurs in particulate form especially in flood seasons particulate phosphorus pp could account for 90 of the total phosphorus tp e g yu et al 2021 coarse sediment adsorbs less phosphorus than fine sediment but is more liable to deposit and more difficult to resuspend at the same flow velocity stone and mudroch 1989 thus for phosphorus in rivers its transport is under the complex influence of both water and sediment in the last hundred years damming probably has become the most prominent human activity that significantly changes hydrological regime in global large rivers previous studies have found that damming alters longitudinal connectivity of rivers and increases water level in reservoirs thereby decreasing flow velocity as well as causing sediment deposition e g batalla et al 2004 moussa 2018 for example in the changjiang river also known as yangtze river after the construction of the three gorges reservoir tgr in 2003 the monthly average flow velocity near the dam decreased from about 3 m s to lower than 0 1 m s and led to considerable sediment deposition about 1 14 108 t yr tang et al 2018 another example is the aswan dam built across the nile coarse sediment quickly deposits in the reservoir 500 400 km ahead of the dam and sediment median diameter correspondingly decreased from 0 25 mm to 0 02 mm after 50 years of its construction the reservoir has lost 53 of its original capacity moussa 2018 dam construction noticeably changes water and sediment conditions within reservoir and influences processes of nutrients in the river previous studies have focused on this topic mainly from two aspects first on in year or multi year scales they revealed the differences in spatial temporal distribution and composition of nutrients between pre and post dam construction and tended to find the relation between nutrients and water and sediment dynamics for example in the tgr wang et al 2021 found that nitrogen concentration increases downstream while phosphorus concentration decreases downstream due to sediment deposition and this trend is more significant in flood seasons than non flood seasons second researchers studied nutrients dynamics post dam which usually is associated with the retention of the reservoir as well as the changes in hydrological regime due to the reservoir operation for example wang et al 2020 found that after the operation of the tgr total nitrogen tn and tp flux at the estuary were averagely increased by 28 3 in dry seasons because of the closed dam reduced flow velocity of lower channels and enabled nutrients to gather into the river on relatively large spatial temporal scales existing studies have comprehensively discussed the influence of dam construction and operation on water and sediment and thus on nutrient transport based on routine monitoring data obtained pre and post dam zhou et al 2013 behrendt and opitz 1999 nutrient dynamics on flood event scale and pre post dam scale however has received less attention especially the influence of flood regulation has barely discussed while flood can rapidly mobilize a great deal of water and sediment from riparian zone into the reservoir flood regulation quickly changes flow velocity water level and sediment content thereby affecting nutrients within the reservoir moreover the differences in nutrient concentration and fraction between pre and post dam directly reflects the physical trapping of the dam and probably different nutrients responses different to this regulation consequently studying the response of nutrients dynamics to reservoir flood regulation at this spatial temporal scale is important as the world s largest reservoir the operation of the tgr in a flood event definitely affects water and sediment conditions and therefore influences the transport of nutrients fu et al 2010 in light of this we hypothesize that under the tgr s regulation in flood event retention of water and sediment caused changes in nitrogen and phosphorus and resulted in altered n p ratio to test the hypothesize in flood events in sep 2021 the study monitored hydrological conditions and collected water samples along the mainstream of the tgr as well as below the reservoir dam historical data of runoff sediment and nutrients were also collected we aim to i characterize the runoff sediment and nutrient along the mainstream of the tgr during flood regulation ii reveal the response of nutrients transportation to flood regulation and iii discuss the influence of flood regulation on n p ratio this study reveals the influence of flood regulation on nutrient transport in flood event and provides scientific basis for reservoir management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tgr has a total water surface area of 1080 km2 and a storage capacity of 3 93 1010 m3 and is now the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project wang et al 2013 the highest water level of the reservoir was raised to 135 156 and 175 m in 2003 2006 and 2010 respectively after 2010 the tgr has been operated following the so called scheme of storing clear water and releasing muddy water tang et al 2019 i e water level reduced to 145 m in flood seasons jun to sep to release muddy water once sediment peak formed and increased to and maintained at 175 m to store clear water after flood seasons as a matter of fact operation of tgr considered various targets such as flood control power generation water supply and navigation which caused the complex regulation practices in the flood season in order to ensure the safety of flood control the water level initially kept at 145 m during the flood season since 2009 however for improving the comprehensive benefits medium small sized flood peak flow 30 000 55 000 m3 s dispatch has been more and more practiced open at least one bottom outlet sluice which resulted in the water level usually higher than 150 m from 2009 to 2017 33 medium small sized floods with total volume of 893 billion m3 has been intercepted and stored accounting for 82 5 and 73 of the total floods and sum of flood storage capacities respectively zhang 2019 2 2 field and laboratory work the tgr is a river type reservoir with a mainstream length of 600 km the reservoir inflow at ct cuntan section in the flood season ranged between 20 000 m3 s and 75 000 m3 s moreover it takes an average of 22 h for flood to transport from the ct to the three gorges dam tgd and the sediment peak lags the flood peak zhang et al 2021 according to our previous study wang et al 2021 water quality in front of the tgd exhibited obvious spatial differences with stratification while water quality post dam was homogeneous due to fully mix zhang et al 2019 on sep 1st 3rd 2021 the tgr carried out small medium sized flood dispatching with recorded average reservoir inflow and ss concentrations of 29 200 m3 s and 0 125 kg m3 and outflow and ss concentrations of 29 200 m3 s and 0 026 kg m3 respectively three consecutive daily monitoring and sampling of water sediment and nutrient in front of and back of the tgd has been conducted fig 1 among these sites 3 namely guojiaba gj quyuanzhen qy and baqian bq were 30 km 20 km and 100 m in front of the tgd whereas 2 namely huanglingmiao hl and nanjinguan nj were 5 km and 30 km behind the tgd three vertical sampling lines left middle and right were set for the gj qy and bq sections and five stratified water and sediment samples were collected at the relative water depth of 0 0 2 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 for each vertical line surface water and sediment samples 0 5 m below the water surface were collected at the hl and nj sections water depth was determined using a depth sounder 1601 hy flow velocity at each sampling point was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler wh300 rdi on sep 6th 10th the tgr started to resist the no 1 flood of the changjiang river in 2021 meantime water samples 0 5 m below the surface were collected along the mainstream of the reservoir at each of the 10 representative cross sections namely zhutuo zt ct fuling fl qingxichang qx fengdu fd zhongxian zx wanzhou wz yunyang yy fengjie fj wushan ws and zigui zg to trace the changes of nutrient distribution from tail to the dam among these sites zt ct fl qx fd zx wz yy fj ws and zg were approximately 750 600 490 430 370 280 250 160 125 and 3 km in front of the tgd during the sampling period reservoir inflow and outflow ranged between 30 000 54 000 m3 s and 27 000 32 000 m3 s respectively and outflow of ss ranged between 0 01 0 206 kg m3 water samples 200 ml were stored in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles ph water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured immediately using a portable water quality meter ysi exo2 which was pre calibrated in laboratory about 1 2 ml chloroform was added into the samples to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of each sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter filter residue filtered water and original water were stored at 4 c for laboratory analysis original water was used to measure tn and tp filtered water was used to measure total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp no3 n nh3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n residue was used to measure ss content drying to constant weight in an oven at 105 c particulate phosphorus pp mainly bounded to water column particles such as ss and was calculated as the difference between tp and tdp concentration of nutrients were measured on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu according to instruction for national surface water environment quality monitoring published by ministry of ecology and environment of the prc in 2017 great efforts have been made to reduce the sampling and measuring uncertainty for 10 pre dam sections from zt to zg surface water samples were collected as close as possible to the middle thread on the premise of safety for 3 pre dam sections of gj qy and bq dense profile water samples were collected by professional hydrological monitoring vessel of hydrology bureau of changjiang water resources commission hbcwrc moreover all the samples were collected and determined in parallel and quality control sample was also used to reduce the test errors 2 3 historical data collection and statistical analysis historical data of runoff ss and nutrients was collected from hbcwrc historical data and sampling data were comparable the sampling sites in this study were completely consistent with the historical monitoring work and they were all hydrological and environmental control cross sections moreover measurement of hydrology sediment and nutrient were strictly according to the same standards including regulations of water environmental monitoring sl 219 2013 and code for reservoir hydrologic and sediment survey sl 339 2006 trends in nutrient concentration along the reservoir were tested using simple linear regression model significant differences p 0 05 in nutrient concentration between pre dam and post dam were tested using t text and wilcoxon rank sum test correlations between parameters were tested using pearson or spearman rank correlation analysis statistical analysis was performed on spss ibm hereinafter significant means statistically significant at p 0 05 taking the reservoir capacity at the initial stage of the flood as base line the amount of water locked by the reservoir lw was calculated according to the changes in reservoir capacity during the flood and the amount of locked sediment ls was calculated as ls lw cs where cs is the mean sediment concentration during the flood within the reservoir the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus retained with water and sediment were also calculated using their mean values of concentration 3 results 3 1 hydrological dynamics during flood regulation during the no 1 flood in 2021 inflow of the tgr continued to increase from aug 10th and peaked at 54 000 m3 s in sep 6th fig 2 correspondingly the tgr began to regulate flood due to flood retention water level of the reservoir increased from 146 34 m in aug 20th to 168 27 m in sep 9th and peak outflow decreased from 31 600 m3 s in aug 29th to 25 200 m3 s in sep 7th during the reservoir regulation average reservoir inflow at ct and outflow at hl were 29 200 m3 s and 27 300 m3 s respectively and the outflow ss was 0 026 0 125 kg m3 both water and ss content varied greatly for example ss content in 2020 maximumly reached 0 98 kg m3 about 30 higher than the average value in 2003 2019 during the flood from 1st 10th sep water and sediment locked by the reservoir were about 73 108 m3 and 62 104 t respectively tgr s flood regulation increased water level of the reservoir and resulted in the decrease in flow velocity above the dam surface flow velocity within the reservoir declined from 1 m s at the reservoir tail ct cross section to about 0 2 m s near the dam pre dam flow velocity increased with depth to a maximum of 0 3 m s and then sharply decreased to 0 1 m s fig 3 a ss content also decreased along the reservoir from 200 tail to 50 mg l head pre dam ss content gradually increased with depth from 40 mg l near the surface to 100 mg l near the bottom ss content was greatly higher at post dam section about 48 mg l than at pre dam section about 36 mg l fig 3 b water temperature in the mainstream of the tgr ranged between 23 7 and 25 2 c and gradually increased downstream table 1 reservoir water was weak alkaline with a ph of 7 67 7 90 along the mainstream of the tgr surface water ec and do were fluctuated between 285 and 373 μs cm and 7 30 8 30 mg l respectively and no significant trends were found 3 2 nutrient distribution in the reservoir during flood regulation during flood regulation tp concentrations ranged between 0 077 0 335 mg l and tended to decrease downstream within the reservoir compared with reservoir inflow phosphorus concentration in outflow was decreased by about 77 fig 4 a pp was the major fraction of the tp and accounted for 46 5 95 6 of the tp while srp concentration was lower than 0 030 mg l no significant trend of nitrogen concentration along the tgr was observed tn concentration fluctuated between 1 513 2 464 mg l from tail to head of the reservoir fig 4 b no3 n concentration varied from 0 948 to 1 510 mg l which was the majority of nitrogen and accounted for 57 4 81 6 of tn nh3 n concentration was lower than no3 n and ranged between 0 060 0 136 mg l 3 3 nutrient distribution nearby the reservoir dam during flood regulation at bq cross section 100 m in front of the dam pp concentration ranged between 0 071 0 096 mg l and generally increased from surface water to bottom water while no3 n concentration 1 632 1 756 mg l evenly distributed fig 5 a due to release pre dam s bottom muddy water fig 3 b and flush post dam s river bed tp concentration post dam 0 123 0 028 mg l at hl section was immediately 7 30 higher than pre dam 0 114 0 037 mg l at bq section while the difference in tn concentration between pre and post dam was insignificant fig 5 b c 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between water and sediment transport under the tgr s regulation the correlation between water and sediment transport maintained positive before and after the tgr s construction but with differences fig 6 a before the tgr in operation 1996 2002 suspended sediment was freely transported with water and ss content was largely depended upon the upstream sediment input thus ss content was linearly related to outflow at the initial stage of tgr s operation 2003 2008 when its highest water level gradually increased from 135 to 175 m the relationship between runoff and sediment was unclear because of the rapidly changed hydrological regime due to unfixed reservoir regulation since 2009 when the tgr was impounded to 175 m and fully operated the relationship between water and sediment changed from linear to exponential and the positive correlation was also weakened r 2 from 0 89 to 0 63 moreover it is also implied that only when reservoir outflow 20 000 m3 s does ss content greatly increases while outflow 20 000 m3 s merely brings sediment from 2007 to 2021 fig 6 b the first reason for the altered relationship between water and sediment was obviously the retention of the dam since decreased flow velocity weakened the capacity of water to suspend and transport sediment and accelerated sediment deposition along the reservoir as observed both in our and previous studies e g huang et al 2014 wang et al 2021 another reason was that peak sediment lags behind peak outflow due to the reservoir s operation during flood regulation due to raised water level flood in the reservoir travelled in the form of gravity wave at a faster speed than normal while suspended sediment transport dramatically slowed down as the flow velocity decreased and thus lagged far behind flood propagation hu and fang 2022 the average transport time of sediment peak from ct to zg was extended from 4 9 d to 7 6 d after the tgr s operation and the maximum propagation time was increased from 8 d to 15 d wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 before the tgr s operation it took about three days for the flood to be transported from ct to hl and peak sediment content occurred about three days later than peak flow yao et al 2021 the existence of the dam increases water depth and changes the flood waves thereby accelerating propagation of peak flow from 3 d to 1 d zhang et al 2020 meanwhile decreased flow velocity prolongs sediment movement thus increased the lag time of water and sediment peaks for example outflow at hl reached the maximal value of 51 000 m3 s on aug 21th 2020 while ss concentration peaked 0 97 kg m3 six days later on 27th aug 27th fig 2 tgd operation greatly changed the meeting opportunity and scenario between flood peak and sediment peak thus generated two exponential relationships between outflow and ss at hl section fig 6 as in fig 6 b eq 3 represents the curve when receded flood peak encounters sediment peak while eq 4 represents that flood peak not encounters sediment peak the curves indicates that outflow ss varies under the same outflow 4 2 response of the nutrient transportation to flood regulation during the flood from 1st 10th sep tn locked by the reservoir was about 1 41 104 t most of which was no3 n and dissolved in the water outflow no3 n concentration at hl section was positively p 0 05 correlated to flow after the tgr s operation fig 7 a in both flood and non flood seasons this relationship however was weak because of three reasons first agricultural runoff municipal wastewater and submerged sediment soil are the major sources of waterborne no3 n because the sources of nitrogen are stable nitrogen load in the reservoir has barely changed since 1996 even the channel has experienced dynamic changes in hydrological regime xiang et al 2021 second no3 n in the reservoir mainly depends on the processes including algal assimilation and microbial denitrification yang et al 2021 adequate do usually 7 mg l along the tgr and non obvious thermal stratification table 1 prohibits denitrification third although nh3 n can be converted to no3 n via nitrifying bacteria under aerobic environment xia et al 2017 nh3 n was not the major component of the tn fig 4 moreover nh3 n is more easily to be assimilated by phytoplankton compared with no3 n yang et al 2021 the weak correlation between nitrogen and flow as well as the neglectable difference in tn concentration between pre and post dam fig 5 c suggests that the tgr s flood regulation merely affects nitrogen concentration for phosphorus however it was another story during the flood from 1st to 10th sep tp locked by the reservoir was about 1311 t of which 1122 t was in particulate form and deposited with sediment flux of pp significantly decreased from 2 48 kg s at bq section to 1 83 kg s at hl zeng et al 2022 reported a decline trend for tp concentrations at the reservoir inflow section over the past two decades in this study flood regulation has not changed the general trend of p distribution in the reservoir even in the flood event but the influence of flood dispatching on phosphorus concentration and composition was prominent tp concentration below the dam was immediately 7 30 higher than that above the dam fig 5 b except for increasing pp content via release pre dam s bottom muddy water fig 3 b and flush post dam s river bed another probable reason was that sediment in outflow water was finer than in reservoir water intercepting flood increases water level and facilitates the deposition of coarse sediment through extending the hydraulic retention time xu and yuan 2022 previous study found that the reservoir could intercept nearly 75 of the total inflow ss load in flood season and over 60 of coarse sediment could be deposited within two hours tang et al 2018 in contrast sediment passed through the dam was relatively fine and uniform which diameter ranged between 0 001 0 010 mm median 0 007 mm ma et al 2012 fine sediment binds more phosphorus than coarse one up to 135 mg kg cao et al 2011 and facilitates phosphorus bioavailability bioavailable phosphorus content can reach 191 mg kg for sediment diameter 16 μm cao et al 2011 moreover fine sediment usually contains more exchangeable calcium organic matter and fe al hydroxides that enhance the phosphorus adsorption performance results in 42 7 76 8 augment in phosphorus adsorption capacity wang et al 2009 since pp is the main component of tp tp concentration was positively correlated with ss especially in the tail area zt ws fig 7 b under the same ss load tp concentration was higher near the reservoir head than that near the tail this probably because that sediment in reservoir head was finer than in tail area and decreased flow velocity near reservoir head favored ss flocculation and thus enhanced phosphorus binding capacity li et al 2020 previous studies have found that the tgr can trap nearly 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp in the flood season tang et al 2018 and most of which was deposited in the tail area table 2 lower ss load results in lower tp concentration once ss load 200 mg l pp would no longer the major component of tp accompanied by deposition and retention of pp increases in bioavailability of soluble phosphorus could lead to eutrophication pan et al 2013 lower ss content and sufficient soluble phosphorus 0 02 mg l can greatly enhance the bioavailability of phosphorus to algae thus creates favorable condition for water bloom powers et al 2015 4 3 influence of flood regulation on tn tp ratio flood regulation altered tn tp ratio through sediment trapping during the no 1 flood pp the majority of tp concentration decreased downstream with ss content causing tn tp ratio significantly increased from 4 to 8 in the reservoir tail to over 20 near the dam fig 8 a this is also proved by historical data in 2003 2015 tn tp ratio at ct cross section was about 11 16 while at hl cross section was about 16 24 lu 2019 from 2015 to 2017 mainstream tn tp ratio in the tgr ranged between 11 and 18 in the non flood season wang et al 2021 which was much more uniformly distributed in contrast to our study conducted in the flood season fig 8a moreover sections of upper wz in the tgr showed significantly lower tn tp ratio 8 fig 8a in the flood season when compared to 11 18 in the non flood season wang et al 2021 flood regulation slightly affected the transportation of dissolved nitrogen but greatly intercepted particulate phosphorus through sediment deposition the difference in retention performance between nitrogen and phosphorus led to the increase in tn tp ratio along the reservoir sediment input into the reservoir mainly occurs from jun to sep and the majority of ss retention due to flood regulation is also realized in the same period liu et al 2019 due to water and soil conservation in the upper changjiang river annual ss imported into the tgr was reduced from 0 17 billion t in 2002 2012 to 0 04 billion t in 2013 2016 yan et al 2021 correspondingly more than 99 of the reduced sediment occurred in the flood season shan et al 2022 sediment delivery ratio reflects the performance of sediment interception higher ratio suggests less deposition within the reservoir ma et al 2016 sediment delivery ratio not only depended on dam operation but also been greatly impacted by factors including inflow flux of water and sediment reservoir bottom topography and mainstream morphology since 2012 sediment reduction regulation for the tgr had been conducted in the flood season ren et al 2021 which may partly resulted in the relatively higher sediment delivery ratio between 2012 and 2020 from 2005 to 2018 sediment delivery ratio of the tgr declined from 43 6 to 28 2 fig 8 b this indicates that a huge amount of phosphorus was buried with sediment deposition and tn tp ratio gradually increased since the tgr s operation the tn tp ratio is important for aquatic ecology and environment the redfield ratio suggests that tn tp ratio between 16 and 40 facilitates algae growth smith and jarvie 2018 thus the reservoir head is more likely to suffer eutrophication compared with the tail area especially considering the relatively lower flow velocity long term monitoring data indicates that the difference in tp concentration between tail and head of the tgr has narrowed with the proceeding of the impoundment zhai et al 2019 this implies that the section at which dramatic reduction in tn tp ratio will move upwards and the difference in tn tp between pre and post dam may decrease moreover the average particle size of ss flowing into and out of the tgr has decreased from 0 011 mm and 0 009 mm in the 1990s to 0 009 mm and 0 004 mm in 2003 2010 respectively mao et al 2012 proportion for sediment particle with grain size 0 125 mm has been reduced from 4 1 in 2003 2008 to 0 9 in 2009 2019 because of the negative relation between sediment size and phosphorus concentration decline in ss load and size may mitigate the increasing trend of outflow tn tp and favor the downstream nutrient stoichiometry ratio to return to its normal status eutrophication are the prominent water environment problems for most reservoirs majority of the water sediment and nutrient collectively entered into the reservoir in the flood season and flood regulation can greatly affect the water and sediment and thus nutrients transportation the inflow water and sediment flux impounded water level reservoir operational mode and nutrient transporting behaviors e g nitrogen dissolved in water and phosphorus adhered to the sediment particles can significantly affect the distribution and retention of nutrients identifying the dynamics of water sediment and nutrient during the flood dispatching period is helpful to optimize the reservoir operation and promote the adjustment of the nutrient stoichiometric ratio and improvement of the water environments in the tgr and other reservoir river systems elsewhere 5 conclusion taking the tgr in the changjiang river as an example this study discussed the generalizable influence of reservoir flood regulation on nutrients transport our results demonstrated that tgr s flood regulation locked both water and sediment and increased reservoir s water level along with water and sediment trapping nitrogen and phosphorus were retained within the reservoir thereby resulting in significant and different transportation of nutrients in the reservoir river system no3 n and pp are the main component of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively in the reservoir when flood regulation applied a great amount of pp was deposited with sediment while nitrogen flowed downstream with water the difference in response to flood regulation resulted in decreased tp along the reservoir and evenly distributed nitrogen correspondingly tn tp ratio increased from reservoir tail to head this study suggests the crucial role of water and sediment conditions through which reservoir operation affects water environment declaration of

14960,the effect of reservoir construction on nutrient dynamics is well recognized at flood event scale influence of reservoir flood regulation on nutrient transport however has received less attention taking the three gorges reservoir tgr in the changjiang river as an example during the tgr s regulation on a flood in sep 2021 this study collected water samples along the mainstream of the reservoir as well as pre post dam with the aim to identify the impact of flood regulation on nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus distribution and transportation results show that nitrate nitrogen no3 n and particulate phosphorus pp were the main fraction of the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp with the proportion of 46 5 95 6 and 57 4 81 6 respectively n and p responded different to flood regulation i along the stream p concentration significantly decreased due to pp deposited with sediment while n concentration barely changed during flood regulation ii p concentration was significantly higher at post dam section than at pre dam section while n concentration maintained the same the diffed response to flood regulation caused tn tp ratio increased from 4 to 8 in the reservoir tail to over 20 near the dam which probably arise eutrophication in the reservoir head area this study reveals the influence of flood regulation on nutrient transport in flood event and provides scientific basis for reservoir management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flood regulation nitrogen phosphorus suspended sediment three gorges reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and sediment are the main carriers and drivers of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the river system tang et al 2018 they mobilize nutrients from uplands into headwater streams and move them to high level rivers through complex water network alexander et al 2007 by altering physical processes such as deposition and resuspension and biogeochemical processes such as nitration and decomposition water and sediment generally control the transport and fate of in river nutrients burford et al 2012 due to the differences in occurrence the responses of nitrogen and phosphorus to changes in water and sediment vary from each other meybeck 2003 nitrogen mainly exists in inorganic form including ammonia n nh3 n and nitrate n no3 n both of which are largely dissolved in water ran et al 2017 while particulate n that adsorbed on sediment occupies smaller proportion in most of the global rivers e g chen et al 2019 therefore dynamics of sediment has less effect on nitrogen transport than water on the contrary phosphorus mainly occurs in particulate form especially in flood seasons particulate phosphorus pp could account for 90 of the total phosphorus tp e g yu et al 2021 coarse sediment adsorbs less phosphorus than fine sediment but is more liable to deposit and more difficult to resuspend at the same flow velocity stone and mudroch 1989 thus for phosphorus in rivers its transport is under the complex influence of both water and sediment in the last hundred years damming probably has become the most prominent human activity that significantly changes hydrological regime in global large rivers previous studies have found that damming alters longitudinal connectivity of rivers and increases water level in reservoirs thereby decreasing flow velocity as well as causing sediment deposition e g batalla et al 2004 moussa 2018 for example in the changjiang river also known as yangtze river after the construction of the three gorges reservoir tgr in 2003 the monthly average flow velocity near the dam decreased from about 3 m s to lower than 0 1 m s and led to considerable sediment deposition about 1 14 108 t yr tang et al 2018 another example is the aswan dam built across the nile coarse sediment quickly deposits in the reservoir 500 400 km ahead of the dam and sediment median diameter correspondingly decreased from 0 25 mm to 0 02 mm after 50 years of its construction the reservoir has lost 53 of its original capacity moussa 2018 dam construction noticeably changes water and sediment conditions within reservoir and influences processes of nutrients in the river previous studies have focused on this topic mainly from two aspects first on in year or multi year scales they revealed the differences in spatial temporal distribution and composition of nutrients between pre and post dam construction and tended to find the relation between nutrients and water and sediment dynamics for example in the tgr wang et al 2021 found that nitrogen concentration increases downstream while phosphorus concentration decreases downstream due to sediment deposition and this trend is more significant in flood seasons than non flood seasons second researchers studied nutrients dynamics post dam which usually is associated with the retention of the reservoir as well as the changes in hydrological regime due to the reservoir operation for example wang et al 2020 found that after the operation of the tgr total nitrogen tn and tp flux at the estuary were averagely increased by 28 3 in dry seasons because of the closed dam reduced flow velocity of lower channels and enabled nutrients to gather into the river on relatively large spatial temporal scales existing studies have comprehensively discussed the influence of dam construction and operation on water and sediment and thus on nutrient transport based on routine monitoring data obtained pre and post dam zhou et al 2013 behrendt and opitz 1999 nutrient dynamics on flood event scale and pre post dam scale however has received less attention especially the influence of flood regulation has barely discussed while flood can rapidly mobilize a great deal of water and sediment from riparian zone into the reservoir flood regulation quickly changes flow velocity water level and sediment content thereby affecting nutrients within the reservoir moreover the differences in nutrient concentration and fraction between pre and post dam directly reflects the physical trapping of the dam and probably different nutrients responses different to this regulation consequently studying the response of nutrients dynamics to reservoir flood regulation at this spatial temporal scale is important as the world s largest reservoir the operation of the tgr in a flood event definitely affects water and sediment conditions and therefore influences the transport of nutrients fu et al 2010 in light of this we hypothesize that under the tgr s regulation in flood event retention of water and sediment caused changes in nitrogen and phosphorus and resulted in altered n p ratio to test the hypothesize in flood events in sep 2021 the study monitored hydrological conditions and collected water samples along the mainstream of the tgr as well as below the reservoir dam historical data of runoff sediment and nutrients were also collected we aim to i characterize the runoff sediment and nutrient along the mainstream of the tgr during flood regulation ii reveal the response of nutrients transportation to flood regulation and iii discuss the influence of flood regulation on n p ratio this study reveals the influence of flood regulation on nutrient transport in flood event and provides scientific basis for reservoir management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tgr has a total water surface area of 1080 km2 and a storage capacity of 3 93 1010 m3 and is now the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project wang et al 2013 the highest water level of the reservoir was raised to 135 156 and 175 m in 2003 2006 and 2010 respectively after 2010 the tgr has been operated following the so called scheme of storing clear water and releasing muddy water tang et al 2019 i e water level reduced to 145 m in flood seasons jun to sep to release muddy water once sediment peak formed and increased to and maintained at 175 m to store clear water after flood seasons as a matter of fact operation of tgr considered various targets such as flood control power generation water supply and navigation which caused the complex regulation practices in the flood season in order to ensure the safety of flood control the water level initially kept at 145 m during the flood season since 2009 however for improving the comprehensive benefits medium small sized flood peak flow 30 000 55 000 m3 s dispatch has been more and more practiced open at least one bottom outlet sluice which resulted in the water level usually higher than 150 m from 2009 to 2017 33 medium small sized floods with total volume of 893 billion m3 has been intercepted and stored accounting for 82 5 and 73 of the total floods and sum of flood storage capacities respectively zhang 2019 2 2 field and laboratory work the tgr is a river type reservoir with a mainstream length of 600 km the reservoir inflow at ct cuntan section in the flood season ranged between 20 000 m3 s and 75 000 m3 s moreover it takes an average of 22 h for flood to transport from the ct to the three gorges dam tgd and the sediment peak lags the flood peak zhang et al 2021 according to our previous study wang et al 2021 water quality in front of the tgd exhibited obvious spatial differences with stratification while water quality post dam was homogeneous due to fully mix zhang et al 2019 on sep 1st 3rd 2021 the tgr carried out small medium sized flood dispatching with recorded average reservoir inflow and ss concentrations of 29 200 m3 s and 0 125 kg m3 and outflow and ss concentrations of 29 200 m3 s and 0 026 kg m3 respectively three consecutive daily monitoring and sampling of water sediment and nutrient in front of and back of the tgd has been conducted fig 1 among these sites 3 namely guojiaba gj quyuanzhen qy and baqian bq were 30 km 20 km and 100 m in front of the tgd whereas 2 namely huanglingmiao hl and nanjinguan nj were 5 km and 30 km behind the tgd three vertical sampling lines left middle and right were set for the gj qy and bq sections and five stratified water and sediment samples were collected at the relative water depth of 0 0 2 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 for each vertical line surface water and sediment samples 0 5 m below the water surface were collected at the hl and nj sections water depth was determined using a depth sounder 1601 hy flow velocity at each sampling point was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler wh300 rdi on sep 6th 10th the tgr started to resist the no 1 flood of the changjiang river in 2021 meantime water samples 0 5 m below the surface were collected along the mainstream of the reservoir at each of the 10 representative cross sections namely zhutuo zt ct fuling fl qingxichang qx fengdu fd zhongxian zx wanzhou wz yunyang yy fengjie fj wushan ws and zigui zg to trace the changes of nutrient distribution from tail to the dam among these sites zt ct fl qx fd zx wz yy fj ws and zg were approximately 750 600 490 430 370 280 250 160 125 and 3 km in front of the tgd during the sampling period reservoir inflow and outflow ranged between 30 000 54 000 m3 s and 27 000 32 000 m3 s respectively and outflow of ss ranged between 0 01 0 206 kg m3 water samples 200 ml were stored in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles ph water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured immediately using a portable water quality meter ysi exo2 which was pre calibrated in laboratory about 1 2 ml chloroform was added into the samples to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of each sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter filter residue filtered water and original water were stored at 4 c for laboratory analysis original water was used to measure tn and tp filtered water was used to measure total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp no3 n nh3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n residue was used to measure ss content drying to constant weight in an oven at 105 c particulate phosphorus pp mainly bounded to water column particles such as ss and was calculated as the difference between tp and tdp concentration of nutrients were measured on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu according to instruction for national surface water environment quality monitoring published by ministry of ecology and environment of the prc in 2017 great efforts have been made to reduce the sampling and measuring uncertainty for 10 pre dam sections from zt to zg surface water samples were collected as close as possible to the middle thread on the premise of safety for 3 pre dam sections of gj qy and bq dense profile water samples were collected by professional hydrological monitoring vessel of hydrology bureau of changjiang water resources commission hbcwrc moreover all the samples were collected and determined in parallel and quality control sample was also used to reduce the test errors 2 3 historical data collection and statistical analysis historical data of runoff ss and nutrients was collected from hbcwrc historical data and sampling data were comparable the sampling sites in this study were completely consistent with the historical monitoring work and they were all hydrological and environmental control cross sections moreover measurement of hydrology sediment and nutrient were strictly according to the same standards including regulations of water environmental monitoring sl 219 2013 and code for reservoir hydrologic and sediment survey sl 339 2006 trends in nutrient concentration along the reservoir were tested using simple linear regression model significant differences p 0 05 in nutrient concentration between pre dam and post dam were tested using t text and wilcoxon rank sum test correlations between parameters were tested using pearson or spearman rank correlation analysis statistical analysis was performed on spss ibm hereinafter significant means statistically significant at p 0 05 taking the reservoir capacity at the initial stage of the flood as base line the amount of water locked by the reservoir lw was calculated according to the changes in reservoir capacity during the flood and the amount of locked sediment ls was calculated as ls lw cs where cs is the mean sediment concentration during the flood within the reservoir the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus retained with water and sediment were also calculated using their mean values of concentration 3 results 3 1 hydrological dynamics during flood regulation during the no 1 flood in 2021 inflow of the tgr continued to increase from aug 10th and peaked at 54 000 m3 s in sep 6th fig 2 correspondingly the tgr began to regulate flood due to flood retention water level of the reservoir increased from 146 34 m in aug 20th to 168 27 m in sep 9th and peak outflow decreased from 31 600 m3 s in aug 29th to 25 200 m3 s in sep 7th during the reservoir regulation average reservoir inflow at ct and outflow at hl were 29 200 m3 s and 27 300 m3 s respectively and the outflow ss was 0 026 0 125 kg m3 both water and ss content varied greatly for example ss content in 2020 maximumly reached 0 98 kg m3 about 30 higher than the average value in 2003 2019 during the flood from 1st 10th sep water and sediment locked by the reservoir were about 73 108 m3 and 62 104 t respectively tgr s flood regulation increased water level of the reservoir and resulted in the decrease in flow velocity above the dam surface flow velocity within the reservoir declined from 1 m s at the reservoir tail ct cross section to about 0 2 m s near the dam pre dam flow velocity increased with depth to a maximum of 0 3 m s and then sharply decreased to 0 1 m s fig 3 a ss content also decreased along the reservoir from 200 tail to 50 mg l head pre dam ss content gradually increased with depth from 40 mg l near the surface to 100 mg l near the bottom ss content was greatly higher at post dam section about 48 mg l than at pre dam section about 36 mg l fig 3 b water temperature in the mainstream of the tgr ranged between 23 7 and 25 2 c and gradually increased downstream table 1 reservoir water was weak alkaline with a ph of 7 67 7 90 along the mainstream of the tgr surface water ec and do were fluctuated between 285 and 373 μs cm and 7 30 8 30 mg l respectively and no significant trends were found 3 2 nutrient distribution in the reservoir during flood regulation during flood regulation tp concentrations ranged between 0 077 0 335 mg l and tended to decrease downstream within the reservoir compared with reservoir inflow phosphorus concentration in outflow was decreased by about 77 fig 4 a pp was the major fraction of the tp and accounted for 46 5 95 6 of the tp while srp concentration was lower than 0 030 mg l no significant trend of nitrogen concentration along the tgr was observed tn concentration fluctuated between 1 513 2 464 mg l from tail to head of the reservoir fig 4 b no3 n concentration varied from 0 948 to 1 510 mg l which was the majority of nitrogen and accounted for 57 4 81 6 of tn nh3 n concentration was lower than no3 n and ranged between 0 060 0 136 mg l 3 3 nutrient distribution nearby the reservoir dam during flood regulation at bq cross section 100 m in front of the dam pp concentration ranged between 0 071 0 096 mg l and generally increased from surface water to bottom water while no3 n concentration 1 632 1 756 mg l evenly distributed fig 5 a due to release pre dam s bottom muddy water fig 3 b and flush post dam s river bed tp concentration post dam 0 123 0 028 mg l at hl section was immediately 7 30 higher than pre dam 0 114 0 037 mg l at bq section while the difference in tn concentration between pre and post dam was insignificant fig 5 b c 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between water and sediment transport under the tgr s regulation the correlation between water and sediment transport maintained positive before and after the tgr s construction but with differences fig 6 a before the tgr in operation 1996 2002 suspended sediment was freely transported with water and ss content was largely depended upon the upstream sediment input thus ss content was linearly related to outflow at the initial stage of tgr s operation 2003 2008 when its highest water level gradually increased from 135 to 175 m the relationship between runoff and sediment was unclear because of the rapidly changed hydrological regime due to unfixed reservoir regulation since 2009 when the tgr was impounded to 175 m and fully operated the relationship between water and sediment changed from linear to exponential and the positive correlation was also weakened r 2 from 0 89 to 0 63 moreover it is also implied that only when reservoir outflow 20 000 m3 s does ss content greatly increases while outflow 20 000 m3 s merely brings sediment from 2007 to 2021 fig 6 b the first reason for the altered relationship between water and sediment was obviously the retention of the dam since decreased flow velocity weakened the capacity of water to suspend and transport sediment and accelerated sediment deposition along the reservoir as observed both in our and previous studies e g huang et al 2014 wang et al 2021 another reason was that peak sediment lags behind peak outflow due to the reservoir s operation during flood regulation due to raised water level flood in the reservoir travelled in the form of gravity wave at a faster speed than normal while suspended sediment transport dramatically slowed down as the flow velocity decreased and thus lagged far behind flood propagation hu and fang 2022 the average transport time of sediment peak from ct to zg was extended from 4 9 d to 7 6 d after the tgr s operation and the maximum propagation time was increased from 8 d to 15 d wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 before the tgr s operation it took about three days for the flood to be transported from ct to hl and peak sediment content occurred about three days later than peak flow yao et al 2021 the existence of the dam increases water depth and changes the flood waves thereby accelerating propagation of peak flow from 3 d to 1 d zhang et al 2020 meanwhile decreased flow velocity prolongs sediment movement thus increased the lag time of water and sediment peaks for example outflow at hl reached the maximal value of 51 000 m3 s on aug 21th 2020 while ss concentration peaked 0 97 kg m3 six days later on 27th aug 27th fig 2 tgd operation greatly changed the meeting opportunity and scenario between flood peak and sediment peak thus generated two exponential relationships between outflow and ss at hl section fig 6 as in fig 6 b eq 3 represents the curve when receded flood peak encounters sediment peak while eq 4 represents that flood peak not encounters sediment peak the curves indicates that outflow ss varies under the same outflow 4 2 response of the nutrient transportation to flood regulation during the flood from 1st 10th sep tn locked by the reservoir was about 1 41 104 t most of which was no3 n and dissolved in the water outflow no3 n concentration at hl section was positively p 0 05 correlated to flow after the tgr s operation fig 7 a in both flood and non flood seasons this relationship however was weak because of three reasons first agricultural runoff municipal wastewater and submerged sediment soil are the major sources of waterborne no3 n because the sources of nitrogen are stable nitrogen load in the reservoir has barely changed since 1996 even the channel has experienced dynamic changes in hydrological regime xiang et al 2021 second no3 n in the reservoir mainly depends on the processes including algal assimilation and microbial denitrification yang et al 2021 adequate do usually 7 mg l along the tgr and non obvious thermal stratification table 1 prohibits denitrification third although nh3 n can be converted to no3 n via nitrifying bacteria under aerobic environment xia et al 2017 nh3 n was not the major component of the tn fig 4 moreover nh3 n is more easily to be assimilated by phytoplankton compared with no3 n yang et al 2021 the weak correlation between nitrogen and flow as well as the neglectable difference in tn concentration between pre and post dam fig 5 c suggests that the tgr s flood regulation merely affects nitrogen concentration for phosphorus however it was another story during the flood from 1st to 10th sep tp locked by the reservoir was about 1311 t of which 1122 t was in particulate form and deposited with sediment flux of pp significantly decreased from 2 48 kg s at bq section to 1 83 kg s at hl zeng et al 2022 reported a decline trend for tp concentrations at the reservoir inflow section over the past two decades in this study flood regulation has not changed the general trend of p distribution in the reservoir even in the flood event but the influence of flood dispatching on phosphorus concentration and composition was prominent tp concentration below the dam was immediately 7 30 higher than that above the dam fig 5 b except for increasing pp content via release pre dam s bottom muddy water fig 3 b and flush post dam s river bed another probable reason was that sediment in outflow water was finer than in reservoir water intercepting flood increases water level and facilitates the deposition of coarse sediment through extending the hydraulic retention time xu and yuan 2022 previous study found that the reservoir could intercept nearly 75 of the total inflow ss load in flood season and over 60 of coarse sediment could be deposited within two hours tang et al 2018 in contrast sediment passed through the dam was relatively fine and uniform which diameter ranged between 0 001 0 010 mm median 0 007 mm ma et al 2012 fine sediment binds more phosphorus than coarse one up to 135 mg kg cao et al 2011 and facilitates phosphorus bioavailability bioavailable phosphorus content can reach 191 mg kg for sediment diameter 16 μm cao et al 2011 moreover fine sediment usually contains more exchangeable calcium organic matter and fe al hydroxides that enhance the phosphorus adsorption performance results in 42 7 76 8 augment in phosphorus adsorption capacity wang et al 2009 since pp is the main component of tp tp concentration was positively correlated with ss especially in the tail area zt ws fig 7 b under the same ss load tp concentration was higher near the reservoir head than that near the tail this probably because that sediment in reservoir head was finer than in tail area and decreased flow velocity near reservoir head favored ss flocculation and thus enhanced phosphorus binding capacity li et al 2020 previous studies have found that the tgr can trap nearly 76 25 of ss and 75 35 of pp in the flood season tang et al 2018 and most of which was deposited in the tail area table 2 lower ss load results in lower tp concentration once ss load 200 mg l pp would no longer the major component of tp accompanied by deposition and retention of pp increases in bioavailability of soluble phosphorus could lead to eutrophication pan et al 2013 lower ss content and sufficient soluble phosphorus 0 02 mg l can greatly enhance the bioavailability of phosphorus to algae thus creates favorable condition for water bloom powers et al 2015 4 3 influence of flood regulation on tn tp ratio flood regulation altered tn tp ratio through sediment trapping during the no 1 flood pp the majority of tp concentration decreased downstream with ss content causing tn tp ratio significantly increased from 4 to 8 in the reservoir tail to over 20 near the dam fig 8 a this is also proved by historical data in 2003 2015 tn tp ratio at ct cross section was about 11 16 while at hl cross section was about 16 24 lu 2019 from 2015 to 2017 mainstream tn tp ratio in the tgr ranged between 11 and 18 in the non flood season wang et al 2021 which was much more uniformly distributed in contrast to our study conducted in the flood season fig 8a moreover sections of upper wz in the tgr showed significantly lower tn tp ratio 8 fig 8a in the flood season when compared to 11 18 in the non flood season wang et al 2021 flood regulation slightly affected the transportation of dissolved nitrogen but greatly intercepted particulate phosphorus through sediment deposition the difference in retention performance between nitrogen and phosphorus led to the increase in tn tp ratio along the reservoir sediment input into the reservoir mainly occurs from jun to sep and the majority of ss retention due to flood regulation is also realized in the same period liu et al 2019 due to water and soil conservation in the upper changjiang river annual ss imported into the tgr was reduced from 0 17 billion t in 2002 2012 to 0 04 billion t in 2013 2016 yan et al 2021 correspondingly more than 99 of the reduced sediment occurred in the flood season shan et al 2022 sediment delivery ratio reflects the performance of sediment interception higher ratio suggests less deposition within the reservoir ma et al 2016 sediment delivery ratio not only depended on dam operation but also been greatly impacted by factors including inflow flux of water and sediment reservoir bottom topography and mainstream morphology since 2012 sediment reduction regulation for the tgr had been conducted in the flood season ren et al 2021 which may partly resulted in the relatively higher sediment delivery ratio between 2012 and 2020 from 2005 to 2018 sediment delivery ratio of the tgr declined from 43 6 to 28 2 fig 8 b this indicates that a huge amount of phosphorus was buried with sediment deposition and tn tp ratio gradually increased since the tgr s operation the tn tp ratio is important for aquatic ecology and environment the redfield ratio suggests that tn tp ratio between 16 and 40 facilitates algae growth smith and jarvie 2018 thus the reservoir head is more likely to suffer eutrophication compared with the tail area especially considering the relatively lower flow velocity long term monitoring data indicates that the difference in tp concentration between tail and head of the tgr has narrowed with the proceeding of the impoundment zhai et al 2019 this implies that the section at which dramatic reduction in tn tp ratio will move upwards and the difference in tn tp between pre and post dam may decrease moreover the average particle size of ss flowing into and out of the tgr has decreased from 0 011 mm and 0 009 mm in the 1990s to 0 009 mm and 0 004 mm in 2003 2010 respectively mao et al 2012 proportion for sediment particle with grain size 0 125 mm has been reduced from 4 1 in 2003 2008 to 0 9 in 2009 2019 because of the negative relation between sediment size and phosphorus concentration decline in ss load and size may mitigate the increasing trend of outflow tn tp and favor the downstream nutrient stoichiometry ratio to return to its normal status eutrophication are the prominent water environment problems for most reservoirs majority of the water sediment and nutrient collectively entered into the reservoir in the flood season and flood regulation can greatly affect the water and sediment and thus nutrients transportation the inflow water and sediment flux impounded water level reservoir operational mode and nutrient transporting behaviors e g nitrogen dissolved in water and phosphorus adhered to the sediment particles can significantly affect the distribution and retention of nutrients identifying the dynamics of water sediment and nutrient during the flood dispatching period is helpful to optimize the reservoir operation and promote the adjustment of the nutrient stoichiometric ratio and improvement of the water environments in the tgr and other reservoir river systems elsewhere 5 conclusion taking the tgr in the changjiang river as an example this study discussed the generalizable influence of reservoir flood regulation on nutrients transport our results demonstrated that tgr s flood regulation locked both water and sediment and increased reservoir s water level along with water and sediment trapping nitrogen and phosphorus were retained within the reservoir thereby resulting in significant and different transportation of nutrients in the reservoir river system no3 n and pp are the main component of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively in the reservoir when flood regulation applied a great amount of pp was deposited with sediment while nitrogen flowed downstream with water the difference in response to flood regulation resulted in decreased tp along the reservoir and evenly distributed nitrogen correspondingly tn tp ratio increased from reservoir tail to head this study suggests the crucial role of water and sediment conditions through which reservoir operation affects water environment declaration of

14961,both quantifiable and semi quantifiable poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas were evaluated in the influent effluent and biosolids of 38 wastewater treatment plants pfas were detected in all streams at all facilities for the means of the sums of detected quantifiable pfas concentrations were 98 28 ng l 80 24 ng l and 160 000 46 000 ng kg dry weight basis in the influent effluent and biosolids respectively in the aqueous influent and effluent streams this quantifiable pfas mass was typically associated with perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in contrast quantifiable pfas in the biosolids were primarily polyfluoroalkyl substances that potentially serve as precursors to the more recalcitrant pfaas results of the total oxidizable precursor top assay on select influent and effluent samples showed that semi quantified or unidentified precursors accounted for a substantial portion 21 to 88 of the fluorine mass compared to that associated with quantified pfas and that this fluorine precursor mass was not appreciably transformed to perfluoroalkyl acids within the wwtps as influent and effluent precursor concentrations via the top assay were statistically identical evaluation of semi quantified pfas consistent with results of the top assay showed the presence of several classes of precursors in the influent effluent and biosolids perfluorophosphonic acids pfpas and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters di paps occurred in 100 and 92 of biosolid samples respectively analysis of mass flows showed that for both quantified on a fluorine mass basis and semi quantified pfas the majority of pfas exited wwtps through the aqueous effluent compared to the biosolids stream overall these results highlight the importance of semi quantified pfas precursors in wwtps and the need to further understand the impacts of their ultimate fate in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas perfluorinated precursors wastewater biosolids data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are known to occur in groundwater surface water wastewater soil and air gawor et al 2014 munoz et al 2017 roth et al 2020 sepulvado et al 2011 wei et al 2018 xiao et al 2012 pfas occur widely in the environment due to their use in numerous commercial and industrial applications including fire fighting foams metal finishing textiles food packaging materials and consumer products buck et al 2011 kempisty et al 2019 the widespread use of these products has resulted in their occurrence in wastewater treatment plants wwtps from commercial and industrial discharges and potentially from domestic use of consumer products kurwadkar et al 2022 lenka et al 2021 letcher et al 2020 although transformation from parent pfas to intermediate and terminal pfas products can occur conventional wastewater treatment generally does not remove or destroy pfas resulting in their release through the effluent or biosolids houtz et al 2018 2016 for example a meta analysis concluded perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos did not significantly change between influent and effluent while perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa tended to be 6 ng l higher in effluent than influent thompson et al 2022 several perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa precursors including perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates ftss have been reported to transform to pfaas in wastewater benskin et al 2012 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 the enhanced biological process e g aeration activated sludge process that occur in wwtps are likely to facilitate and enhance such reactions the recurring detection of pfaa precursors in wastewater might explain the observed increase of pfaas in wwtp effluents relative to influents for example xiao et al 2012 observed increases in pfhxa in effluents relative to influents in 60 of minnesota s 37 wwtps while the concentration of quantifiable pfaa precursors decreased from the influent to the effluent pfaa precursor transformation in wwtps is dependent on treatment processes used and process temperature higher pfaa formation rates have been observed in activated sludge systems operating at longer retention times and higher temperatures guerra et al 2014 furthermore houtz et al 2018 observed new classes of potential pfaa precursors including fluorotelomer thioether surfactants ftshcs and fluorotelomer thioether alkylamido hydroxyl carboxylates ftsahcs in wwtp influents but not in the effluent this suggests transformation during treatment to pfaas or strong sorption to sludge by precursors these results indicate that wwtp processes may cause an increase in the loading of pfaas into the environment future monitoring of precursors will likely become increasingly important since the annual production of precursors has surpassed the production of other pfas buck et al 2011 a growing number of studies have highlighted the important role of unknown pfas which can only currently be identified using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms coupled with semi quantitative concentration estimates due to a lack of analytical standards for these compounds miaz et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 wang et al 2018 semi quantified pfas are often polyfluorinated and pfaa precursors in a recent occurrence survey in china 30 of the total pfas detected in wwtp influents and effluents were semi quantified pfas these semi quantified pfas were primarily represented by hydro substituted perfluoro carboxylic acids h pfcas hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates h pfesas and fasas wang et al 2020 several studies also identified another class of semi quantifiable pfas polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters di paps that were observed in wastewater sludge and biosolids d eon et al 2009 lee et al 2014 schaefer et al 2022 di paps were also reported to transform into pfaas suggesting that di paps may transform through wwtp processes and facilitate increased pfaa discharges lewis et al 2016 a recent study focusing on the influent of 16 belgian wwtps identified 18 semi quantified pfas jeong et al 2022 in addition to hrms based techniques another analytical tool to quantify the extent of unknown pfaa precursors is the total oxidizable precursor top assay a recent study applying the top assay showed that unknown precursors accounted for 2 to 6 times the identified pfas mass present following primary treatment in a survey of 6 wwtps tavasoli et al 2021 while these studies provide some critical initial insights into the role of semi quantifiable pfas a considerable data gap still exists regarding the occurrence and fate of these semi quantifiable compounds in wwtps gallen et al 2018 conducted a pfas mass balance at 14 wwtps in australia mass loading from the individual effluents reached up to 2 4 lbs per year each for pfoa and pfos and the annual load from biosolids were 0 81 and 1 4 lbs for pfoa and pfos respectively in another pfas mass balance study performed at a single wwtp by schultz et al 2006 2 5 times more pfos mass per day exited the plant via the finished effluent than in the anaerobic sludge while these studies were useful in providing some initial insights into mass flows only a limited number of pfas and wwtps were examined leaving a substantial data gap with respect to the pfas related fluorine mass balance while the occurrence and persistence of pfaas in wwtps have been well demonstrated there remains only limited information on the nature and fate of the wide range of pfaa precursors in wwtps particularly for semi quantified pfas in addition pfas phase distribution and the subsequent impacts on wwtp aqueous and solid mass flows remains poorly understood typical pfas have changed since the time of previous studies due to long term trends and changes in industrial practice thompson et al 2022 regulatory actions relating to pfas and wwtps currently in consideration by the agencies such as the usepa should thus consider up to date scientific data us epa 2021 the purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence along with the overall transformation and mass flows in aqueous and solid streams of pfas including quantified and non quantified precursors at 38 wwtps across 23 states while larger numbers of wwtps have been sampled for pfas within certain states california state water resources control board 2022 egle 2020 public hearing 2021 those datasets may not be representative nationally to our knowledge this study is the largest nationwide wwtp pfas sampling campaign to date while this effort focuses on the mass flows semi quantitative pfas precursors and fluorine balances a more detailed statistical evaluation of this dataset relating pfas occurrence to wwtp characteristics and processes will be the focus of a subsequent study 2 materials and methods 2 1 participating utilities there were 38 participating

assigned to the classes of compounds identified in barzen hanson et al 2017b and buck et al 2011 approximately 20 of samples were analyzed in triplicate and 80 were analyzed in duplicate 2 2 1 sample preparation following centrifugation aqueous samples i e influent effluent were prepared for analysis by transferring 1190 µl of sample to an autosampler vial with 510 µl of lc ms grade methanol amended with internal standard to a final concentration of 200 ng l after preparation of the aqueous sample the supernatant was decanted and the solid phase was air dried and retained for extraction and analysis aqueous samples that remained high in suspended solids e g influent were prepared in microcentrifuge tubes with methanol and internal standard as described above following microcentrifugation 30 min samples were transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis to optimize data quality and detect as many pfas as possible an aliquot of each influent sample was also prepared using liquid liquid extraction lle following previously published methods allred et al 2014 lang et al 2017 briefly 3 ml of influent were amended with 2 ng of each internal standard sodium

3 mm 3 µm this injection size is capable of achieving limits of quantitation loqs of 1 10 ng l for the majority of quantifiable pfas although loqs are matrix and run dependent typical values are shown in table s3a matrix spike recoveries are presented in table s3b a phenomenex luna c18 column 30 3 mm 5 µm was used in line between the pump and the autosampler to retain and retard any background pfas

for the quantifiable pfas in table s2 additional information regarding the chromatographic and instrument operation conditions and quality assurance quality control qa qc are provided in the supporting information see instrumental acquisition and processing qa qc and table s4 collected samples were also screened for 1400 semi quantifiable pfas using previously published methods nickerson et al 2021 2020 shojaei et al 2022a 2021 table s5 briefly data were acquired using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra swath and peaks were considered for identification if they were present in a minimum of 2 replicates and the response was 10x the response in blanks remaining mass spectral features were screened for matches to a library of 1400 pfas positive identifications were assigned confidence based on the schymanski scale schymanski et al 2014 confidence levels were determined using criteria for mass error isotope ratio difference match to library ms ms spectra and kendrick mass defect kmd semi quantified pfas were assigned to the classes of compounds identified in barzen hanson et al 2017b and buck et al 2011 additional information on qa qc suspect screening match criteria and associated confidence intervals is provided in the supporting information see qa qc suspect screening match criteria and figures s1a and s1b peak areas from the chromatogram were normalized to volume aqueous or mass biosolids and utilized to characterize the relative intensity of detections concentrations were not calculated due to a lack of calibration standards for these analytes a screening level analysis was conducted to separate suspect analytes that occurred with relatively higher peak areas and at a greater frequency of detection these included peak areas that were either greater than 10 000 counts per second cps in 50 or more of the facilities or 2 greater than 10 000 cps in less than 50 of the facilities but peak areas were within the 90th percentile of those measured the identified suspect analytes were identified with level 2a 3 or 4 as described in figure s1a table s5 shows the suspect pfas detected above the screening criteria a subset of samples was also prepared using the top assay methodology for the top assay which is based on previously developed methods al amin et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 houtz and sedlak 2012 shojaei et al 2022b is provided in the supplementary materials based on each facility s selected level of participation in this study the top assay was performed in 9 out of the 38 facilities 3 results discussion 3 1 occurrence of quantifiable pfas quantifiable pfas were detected in the influent and effluent fig 1 as well as the finished biosolids at all 38 facilities the average sum of quantifiable pfas detected across all facilities was 98 28 ng l for the influent and 80 24 ng l for the effluent indicating pfas concentrations typically resided within a relatively narrow range for these facilities despite differences in their geographic locations sizes dischargers and treatment schemes total pfas concentrations were comparable to several recent studies in north america china and oceania where the sum of quantifiable influent pfas concentrations ranged from 10 to 415 ng l and effluent pfas concentrations ranged from 14 to 520 ng l coggan et al 2019 lenka et al 2022 pan et al 2016 shigei et al 2020 the sum of quantifiable pfas detections were also comparable with the results from several wwtps in california sampled in 2020 and 2021 california state water resources control board 2022 sufficient influent solids i e a minimum of 235 mg l total suspended solids were present for pfas analysis in 12 of the 38 facilities influent solids pfas concentrations were converted to corresponding aqueous concentrations based on the solids content of the influent sample i e measured pfas concentration in the solids multiplied by the mass of solids per aqueous volume of the influent solution table s6 shows the influent solid pfas by grouping the quantifiable pfas according to chain length e g 4 6 total carbons and 6 total carbons pfaa type sulfonates and carboxylates and quantifiable precursors quantifiable pfas associated with influent solids were typically precursors and long chained pfas e g 6 total carbons across these 12 facilities influent solids accounted for 1 2 to 30 mean 7 4 of the quantifiable pfas entering the wwtp thus these results are consistent with those of cookson and detwiler 2022 who showed that pfas loading attributable to influent solids can be significant there was no significant difference between influent and effluent total quantifiable pfas associated fluorine concentrations t 0 79 p 0 43 when all facilities are considered fig 2 these results differ from that observed by xiao et al 2012 and helmer et al 2022 for which the latter observed that pfas levels in the effluent were several times greater than in the influent however results presented herein are consistent with several other studies documenting that the total pfas concentration in the effluent was similar to that of the influent lenka et al 2021 pan et al 2016 shigei et al 2020 vierke et al 2013 a comparison of classes of pfas between the influent and effluent and the occurrence of suspect pfas are further described below pfos and pfoa which are the focus of most regulatory attention in the united states were detected in the influent effluent or biosolids of 84 and 100 of the facilities respectively comparing the distribution of quantifiable pfas figs 3 and fig s2 only the short chain 4 6 total carbons perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas showed an increase from influent to effluent while precursors long chain 6 total carbons pfcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas decreased figure s2 precursors were the most abundant quantifiable pfas in the biosolids suggesting the potential for formation of pfaas in these solids after leaving the wwtps fig 3 shows quantifiable precursors were present at the influent and effluent 19 6 and 5 4 respectively a notable exception was facility 24 where precursors consisted of approximately 84 of the quantifiable influent pfas the dominant quantifiable precursor in facility 24 as well as 18 other facilities was 6 2 fts which accounted for 66 to 100 of the quantifiable precursor mass this is of particular interest as the use of 6 2 fts has increased as longer chain fluorinated compounds continue to be phased out of industrial products hamid et al 2020 previous studies have found that biotransformation of 6 2 fts can yield formation of 4 6 pfcas such as pfpea and pfhxa as well as other precursors such as 5 3 ftca field and seow 2017 gonzalez et al 2021 hamid et al 2020 harding marjanovic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the overall decrease in 6 2 fts or precursors and the significant increase in 4 6 pfcas from the influent to the effluent across the facilities shown in fig 3 are consistent with this mechanism kim et al 2022 also observed substantial increases in 5 6 pfcas in wwtp effluent compared to the influent with 6 2 fts noted as one of the most abundant quantified precursors present while quantifiable precursors were observed in the influent of 30 of the 38 facilities they were observed in the effluent for only 9 of the facilities for facilities where quantifiable precursors were observed in the influent precursor concentrations decreased an average of 93 between the influent and effluent with the exception of facility 13 which had an increase in precursors between the influent and effluent from 0 6 to 8 3 ng l decreases in some precursor concentrations between the influent and effluent have been observed in previous wwtp studies houtz et al 2018 and are best explained by transformation of the precursors throughout the treatment process via biotic and or abiotic mechanisms or possibly sorption to solids it is possible that the observed increase in total quantifiable precursor concentration for facility13 was due to transformation of semi quantifiable or unidentified precursors to intermediate transformation products rather than terminal pfaas for example 6 2 fts can form from other polyfluoroalkyl substances such as those in modern afff formulations gonzalez et al 2021 fig 4 shows on a molar fluorine basis the sum of precursors detected using the top assay for influent and effluent samples from nine wwtps the sum of quantifiable pfas molar concentrations including pfaas and precursors are shown for comparison the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas were on average for the 9 facilities in fig 4 4 0 3 9 and 4 7 3 7 nm f respectively the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas following the top assay were on average for the nine facilities in fig 4 6 8 2 5 and 9 1 4 0 nm f respectively when considering the ratio of quantifiable pfas post top to that of the quantifiable pfas pre top individually at each facility the average ratio among the 9 facilities in fig 4 was 2 9 1 5 for the influent and 2 3 0 84 averaged among the nine facilities semi quantified or unidentified precursors ranged from 21 to 88 of the fluorine mass among the influents and effluents of these 9 facilities these results indicate that a substantial component of molar fluorine present in the influent and effluent was associated with precursors that could not be directly quantified i e not quantified until transformation using the top assay on average among the 9 facilities in fig 4 66 17 of the pfas based organic fluorine in the influent was attributable to precursors quantified and semi quantified while 51 16 of the pfas based organic fluorine in the effluent was attributable to precursors quantified and semi quantified it is also significant to note that the top based precursor concentrations exiting the wwtps were statistically identical to those entering the wwtp p 0 39 two tailed t test suggesting that only a relatively small fraction of potential precursors transformed to pfaas in the wwtps top precursors relative to quantifiable pfas that were found in this study compared well to previous studies applying the top assay to us wastewater influent or effluent glover et al 2018 found top assay increases in total molar pfas concentrations ranging from 42 to approximately 3 fold in three tertiary effluent samples tavasoli et al 2021 found an 8 fold increase in unidentified precursors from the top assay relative to quantified pfas in influent in march and lower increases 1 to 6 fold in effluent or july samples the effluent total molar fluorine formation from the top assay were within the same order of magnitude from 3 2 to 20 5 nm f for the nine facilities some pfas sources may have a greater potential for transformation than others depending on the types of pfas used at specific point sources for example aqueous film forming foam afff used for firefighting was spiked in laboratory sequencing bioreactors simulating a full scale wwtp by gonzalez et al 2021 and a 9 fold increase in pfaas was observed from the influent to the effluent a specific evaluation of collection system sources was not conducted for this study though relatively consistent concentrations were observed at the facilities despite variability in the types of collection system point source dischargers the sum of quantifiable pfas in the biosolids averaged 160 000 46 000 ng kg biosolids dry weight basis fig s3 these pfas biosolid concentrations were within the range reported in recent studies moodie et al 2021 schaefer et al 2022 as observed for the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas concentrations in the biosolids fell within the same order of magnitude despite the noted differences among the facilities that participated in this study whereas the aqueous influent and effluent samples were composed primarily of pfaas the majority of the quantifiable pfas in biosolids were precursors which accounted for an average of 65 22 of the pfas mass in biosolids for the 38 facilities fig 3 the dominant quantifiable precursors detected in biosolids were 5 3 ftca and 7 3 ftca which were detected in 92 and 95 of facilities respectively 5 3 ftca is known to be a potential biotransformation product of 6 2 fts harding marjanovic et al 2015 which was detected in the influent of 27 facilities but was found in the biosolids at 3 facilities and at relatively low levels e g 366 to 2960 ng kg several of the long chained pfcas pfuda pfdoa pftrda pfteda were detected only in the influent solids and biosolids samples suggesting that these more hydrophobic compounds tend to partition into the solids conversely fig 3 shows that the short chained pfcas accounted for a smaller percentage in the biosolids relative to the influent and effluent aqueous phases this lower percentage of pfcas in the biosolids is likely due to their comparatively low hydrophobicity ebrahimi et al 2021 3 2 mass flows of quantifiable pfas using the quantifiable pfas analytes as a basis the mass flows of fluorine into each of the treatment facilities the fluorine mass flow exiting as treated water and the fluorine mass flow exiting as finished biosolids were calculated mass flows were based upon the measured pfas concentrations in the influent effluent and finished biosolids multiplied by each facility s reported average flows of these streams as shown in fig 5 with the exception of ten of the 38 facilities numbers 5 6 7 17 20 24 26 31 32 and 33 the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass out of the treatment plant was statistically equal to or greater than the pfas based fluorine mass entering the facility this is likely due to the transformation of non quantified pfas precursors to quantifiable compounds during the treatment process for the ten facilities where the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass was greater entering the facility than that exiting an explanation is not readily apparent however for facilities 6 7 24 and 26 the influent consisted of elevated concentrations of quantifiable precursors primarily fluorotelomer sulfonates that may have been transformed to volatile intermediates e g ketones or fluorotelomer alcohols that were released during the wastewater treatment process zhang et al 2016 fig 5 also shows that with the exception of eight facilities numbers 5 8 10 18 19 25 28 and 29 at least half of the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass exited via the aqueous effluent stream rather than through biosolids fourteen of the 38 facilities had at least 75 of the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass exiting via the aqueous effluent these results highlight the importance of the aqueous effluent as a source of pfas release back to the environment and are consistent with the findings of schultz et al 2006 who showed that 72 of the pfos mass exited a wwtp through the aqueous phase while only 28 exited via the solids stream for seven of the eight facilities where a greater fraction of the fluorine mass exited via the biosolids more than 50 of the influent mass loadings were either long chained precursors or pfaas e g c6 the stronger hydrophobicity of these constituents may have explained why a larger fraction was associated with the biosolids 3 3 occurrence of semi quantifiable pfas from the library of approximately 1400 analytes used for semi quantified pfas screening 307 were detected in this study fig 6 shows 34 suspect analytes where peak area detections met the screening criteria e g peak areas 10 000 cps and detected at 50 of the facilities or detected at 50 of utilities but with peak areas 90th percentile and their associated confidence levels the frequent occurrence of several semi quantifiable analytes many of which are precursors was qualitatively consistent with the top assay results indicating a relatively large fraction of the total molar fluorine was associated with precursors rather than quantifiable pfaas importantly all identifications of semi quantified pfas in this study should be considered tentative with increasing uncertainty at higher confidence intervals they indicate pfas that may be present and additional work would be needed to increase certainty in these identifications the most frequently detected classes in influent aqueous samples included n carboxymethyl dimethylammoniopropyl perfluorohexane sulfonamido acetic acid cmeampr fhxsaa 58 of samples n methyl perfluorodecane sulfonamide mefdsaa 58 of samples and fluorotelomer sulfonamido propyl methyl amine 4 2 ftsa pr mean 53 of samples cmeampr fasaa has been identified as a pfaa precursor in afff used for fire fighting schaefer et al 2020 mefdsaas are used in stain and water resistant textiles including synthetic leather cleaning solutions for semiconductors and printing inks glüge et al 2020 and 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamido amines have been identified in telomer based afff backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017a both mefdsaa and 4 2 ftsas are precursor compounds that can transform into either perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids from mefdsaa ullah et al 2014 or 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamides from 4 2 ftsas munoz et al 2017 interestingly cmeampr fasaa was only detected in influent aqueous samples though structurally similar n carboxymethyldimethyl ammoniopropyl perfluoropropane sulfonamido propanoic acid cmeampr fasapra was detected in 42 of biosolids influent and effluent peak areas of mefdsaa were similar 8 6 107 2 0 107 and 1 2 108 2 6 107 respectively p value 0 094 n 55 suggesting limited removal or transformation of these constituents through treatment mefdsaa was also the most frequently detected analyte for influent solids 58 of samples and effluent samples 87 there were nine semi quantified pfas that were detected in 50 or more of biosolids with peak areas ranging over an order of magnitude 106 to 107 importantly perfluorophosphonic acids pfpas and di paps occurred in 100 and 92 of samples respectively the pfpa perfluorocyclohexanephosphonic acid pfchxpa was detected in 42 of influent solids samples and di paps were detected in 6 of the 14 influent solids samples 43 pfpas and dipaps are both widely used and strongly hydrophobic e g log kow 7 us epa 2022 preferential partitioning of these constituents into solids may account for the observed occurrence in biosolids despite being below detection in the aqueous influent pfpas have been used as antifoaming agents in pesticides and detergents carpet and upholstery cleaning products surface coatings such as floor polish and for fiber optics glüge et al 2020 di paps have been used as food packaging surface coatings begley et al 2008 surface treatment and protectant applications buck et al 2011 and personal care products and pharmaceuticals lee and mabury 2011 di paps were detected in all biosolids samples collected from seven us wwtps and represented the greatest molar fluorine fraction detected at 77 to 97 in a previous study schaefer et al 2022 schaefer et al 2022 further showed that the di paps were suspected to account for the observed sustained leaching of pfaas over 6 months in field deployed mesocosms due to precursor transformation similar results were observed by moodie et al 2021 in australia where di paps were detected in 94 of samples and represented 45 of the pfas mass kim et al 2022 also identified di paps as a prominent precursor in wwtp influent classes that occurred at fewer facilities but represented relatively high percentiles e g 90th of the peak areas detected are shown as hollow circles in fig 6 these constituents are also of importance for assessing pfas loading due to their higher semi quantitative peak areas when they were detected unknown pfas3 unknown pfas5 and perfluoroalkyl octanedioic acid pfodia had the highest average peak areas of greater than 1 109 l but occurred in 20 or less of samples the unknown pfas3 and unknown pfas5 had the highest average peak areas detected in the aqueous influent at 6 facilities 16 these constituents were not detected in the effluent but were detected in the biosolids at just 2 facilities with three orders of magnitude lower peak areas l than the influent suggesting possible precursor transformation pfodia was only detected in the effluent at one facility and was not detected in the influent or influent solids a few studies have specifically investigated the occurrence of semi quantified pfas in wwtps though not previously in the us to the best of our knowledge wang et al 2020 found hydro substituted pfcas h pfca perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides pfsm and hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates h pfesa were the dominant suspect classes identified representing 80 of the emerging pfas identified in both influents and effluents sampled in china wang et al 2018 investigated target and suspect pfas from one of the largest fluorochemical industrial wastewater parks in china the composition of detected pfas was dominated by legacy quantifiable pfcas 22 of the relative peak area and the following suspect classes chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl carboxylates cl pfcas 35 to 45 h pfcas 28 and perfluorinated ethers and alcohols approximately 5 the 18 semi quantified compounds identified by jeong et al 2022 included fluorotelomer based compounds a perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid a perfluorosulfonamido acetic acid and chloride and bromide substituted compounds ultra short chain pfas are typically not reported due to their difficulty to resolve analytically they include pfas with two or three carbon backbone chain lengths trifluoracetic acid tfa perfluoropropanoic acid pfpra perfluoroethane sulfonate pfets and perfluoropropane sulfonate pfprs the suspect screening list in our study did include ultra short chain pfas but they were difficult to differentiate due to very short retention time and matrix interference 3 4 mass flows of semi quantified pfas mass flows of semi quantified pfas for each facility where peak areas were used to assess relative pfas detections are provided in fig 7 influent pfas represents net pfas detected in the influent aqueous and solid phases for each facility where influent solids were collected values shown above the bars indicate the fraction of pfas area exiting via the aqueous effluent with the remaining balance exiting via the biosolids stream peak areas correlate to concentration but it is important to note that the response of an individual compound during analysis can vary by compound and by media thus there are uncertainties when comparing peak areas between individual pfas and also of a single pfas between multiple media e g aqueous vs solid in particular peak areas in solid extracts can be reduced relative to response in aqueous matrices by both incomplete extraction from the solid and matrix suppression ferrer et al 2011 stahnke et al 2012 additionally suspect pfas were identified with various levels of confidence nevertheless this analysis is an opportunity to assess trends in semi quantified pfas for the semi quantified analytes 27 of the 38 facilities 71 had semi quantified pfas exiting in the aqueous effluents that were greater than those exiting in the biosolids these findings are similar to the quantifiable pfas and thus highlight the importance of aqueous effluents as source of quantified and semi quantified pfas into the environment 4 conclusions results of this study consistent with prior studies on the occurrence of pfas in wwtps demonstrated the widespread presence of pfas both entering and exiting wwtps herein it is shown that precursors accounted for 66 and 51 of the pfas based fluorine entering and leaving wwtps in the aqueous flows respectively on average and that the majority of precursors based on a comparison of top results for the influent and effluent were not transformed to pfaas during the treatment processes the majority of pfas exited the wwtps via the aqueous effluent compared to the biosolids stream semi quantified analysis identified several frequently detected classes of pfas these results highlight the need for improved pfas quantification in wwtp aqueous and solid matrices in addition the impacts of precursor releases through both the aqueous and solid discharges as well as improved understanding of the sources and fate of precursors through wwtps merits further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14961,both quantifiable and semi quantifiable poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas were evaluated in the influent effluent and biosolids of 38 wastewater treatment plants pfas were detected in all streams at all facilities for the means of the sums of detected quantifiable pfas concentrations were 98 28 ng l 80 24 ng l and 160 000 46 000 ng kg dry weight basis in the influent effluent and biosolids respectively in the aqueous influent and effluent streams this quantifiable pfas mass was typically associated with perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in contrast quantifiable pfas in the biosolids were primarily polyfluoroalkyl substances that potentially serve as precursors to the more recalcitrant pfaas results of the total oxidizable precursor top assay on select influent and effluent samples showed that semi quantified or unidentified precursors accounted for a substantial portion 21 to 88 of the fluorine mass compared to that associated with quantified pfas and that this fluorine precursor mass was not appreciably transformed to perfluoroalkyl acids within the wwtps as influent and effluent precursor concentrations via the top assay were statistically identical evaluation of semi quantified pfas consistent with results of the top assay showed the presence of several classes of precursors in the influent effluent and biosolids perfluorophosphonic acids pfpas and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters di paps occurred in 100 and 92 of biosolid samples respectively analysis of mass flows showed that for both quantified on a fluorine mass basis and semi quantified pfas the majority of pfas exited wwtps through the aqueous effluent compared to the biosolids stream overall these results highlight the importance of semi quantified pfas precursors in wwtps and the need to further understand the impacts of their ultimate fate in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas perfluorinated precursors wastewater biosolids data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are known to occur in groundwater surface water wastewater soil and air gawor et al 2014 munoz et al 2017 roth et al 2020 sepulvado et al 2011 wei et al 2018 xiao et al 2012 pfas occur widely in the environment due to their use in numerous commercial and industrial applications including fire fighting foams metal finishing textiles food packaging materials and consumer products buck et al 2011 kempisty et al 2019 the widespread use of these products has resulted in their occurrence in wastewater treatment plants wwtps from commercial and industrial discharges and potentially from domestic use of consumer products kurwadkar et al 2022 lenka et al 2021 letcher et al 2020 although transformation from parent pfas to intermediate and terminal pfas products can occur conventional wastewater treatment generally does not remove or destroy pfas resulting in their release through the effluent or biosolids houtz et al 2018 2016 for example a meta analysis concluded perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos did not significantly change between influent and effluent while perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa tended to be 6 ng l higher in effluent than influent thompson et al 2022 several perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa precursors including perfluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates ftss have been reported to transform to pfaas in wastewater benskin et al 2012 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 the enhanced biological process e g aeration activated sludge process that occur in wwtps are likely to facilitate and enhance such reactions the recurring detection of pfaa precursors in wastewater might explain the observed increase of pfaas in wwtp effluents relative to influents for example xiao et al 2012 observed increases in pfhxa in effluents relative to influents in 60 of minnesota s 37 wwtps while the concentration of quantifiable pfaa precursors decreased from the influent to the effluent pfaa precursor transformation in wwtps is dependent on treatment processes used and process temperature higher pfaa formation rates have been observed in activated sludge systems operating at longer retention times and higher temperatures guerra et al 2014 furthermore houtz et al 2018 observed new classes of potential pfaa precursors including fluorotelomer thioether surfactants ftshcs and fluorotelomer thioether alkylamido hydroxyl carboxylates ftsahcs in wwtp influents but not in the effluent this suggests transformation during treatment to pfaas or strong sorption to sludge by precursors these results indicate that wwtp processes may cause an increase in the loading of pfaas into the environment future monitoring of precursors will likely become increasingly important since the annual production of precursors has surpassed the production of other pfas buck et al 2011 a growing number of studies have highlighted the important role of unknown pfas which can only currently be identified using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms coupled with semi quantitative concentration estimates due to a lack of analytical standards for these compounds miaz et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 wang et al 2018 semi quantified pfas are often polyfluorinated and pfaa precursors in a recent occurrence survey in china 30 of the total pfas detected in wwtp influents and effluents were semi quantified pfas these semi quantified pfas were primarily represented by hydro substituted perfluoro carboxylic acids h pfcas hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates h pfesas and fasas wang et al 2020 several studies also identified another class of semi quantifiable pfas polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters di paps that were observed in wastewater sludge and biosolids d eon et al 2009 lee et al 2014 schaefer et al 2022 di paps were also reported to transform into pfaas suggesting that di paps may transform through wwtp processes and facilitate increased pfaa discharges lewis et al 2016 a recent study focusing on the influent of 16 belgian wwtps identified 18 semi quantified pfas jeong et al 2022 in addition to hrms based techniques another analytical tool to quantify the extent of unknown pfaa precursors is the total oxidizable precursor top assay a recent study applying the top assay showed that unknown precursors accounted for 2 to 6 times the identified pfas mass present following primary treatment in a survey of 6 wwtps tavasoli et al 2021 while these studies provide some critical initial insights into the role of semi quantifiable pfas a considerable data gap still exists regarding the occurrence and fate of these semi quantifiable compounds in wwtps gallen et al 2018 conducted a pfas mass balance at 14 wwtps in australia mass loading from the individual effluents reached up to 2 4 lbs per year each for pfoa and pfos and the annual load from biosolids were 0 81 and 1 4 lbs for pfoa and pfos respectively in another pfas mass balance study performed at a single wwtp by schultz et al 2006 2 5 times more pfos mass per day exited the plant via the finished effluent than in the anaerobic sludge while these studies were useful in providing some initial insights into mass flows only a limited number of pfas and wwtps were examined leaving a substantial data gap with respect to the pfas related fluorine mass balance while the occurrence and persistence of pfaas in wwtps have been well demonstrated there remains only limited information on the nature and fate of the wide range of pfaa precursors in wwtps particularly for semi quantified pfas in addition pfas phase distribution and the subsequent impacts on wwtp aqueous and solid mass flows remains poorly understood typical pfas have changed since the time of previous studies due to long term trends and changes in industrial practice thompson et al 2022 regulatory actions relating to pfas and wwtps currently in consideration by the agencies such as the usepa should thus consider up to date scientific data us epa 2021 the purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence along with the overall transformation and mass flows in aqueous and solid streams of pfas including quantified and non quantified precursors at 38 wwtps across 23 states while larger numbers of wwtps have been sampled for pfas within certain states california state water resources control board 2022 egle 2020 public hearing 2021 those datasets may not be representative nationally to our knowledge this study is the largest nationwide wwtp pfas sampling campaign to date while this effort focuses on the mass flows semi quantitative pfas precursors and fluorine balances a more detailed statistical evaluation of this dataset relating pfas occurrence to wwtp characteristics and processes will be the focus of a subsequent study 2 materials and methods 2 1 participating utilities there were 38 participating facilities in this study located in 23 states within the us the facilities represented a diverse range of sizes with average flows from 0 019 106 to 2 5 106 m3 d 1 collection systems represented both

qa qc suspect screening match criteria and associated confidence intervals is provided in the supporting information see qa qc suspect screening match criteria and figures s1a and s1b peak areas from the chromatogram were normalized to volume aqueous or mass biosolids and utilized to characterize the relative intensity of detections concentrations were not calculated due to a lack of calibration standards for these analytes a screening level analysis was conducted to separate suspect analytes that occurred with relatively higher peak areas and at a greater frequency of detection these included peak areas that were either greater than 10 000 counts per second cps in 50 or more of the facilities or 2 greater than 10 000 cps in less than 50 of the facilities but peak areas were within the 90th percentile of those measured the identified suspect analytes were identified with level 2a 3 or 4 as described in figure s1a table s5 shows the suspect pfas detected above the screening criteria a subset of samples was also prepared using the top assay methodology for the top assay which is based on previously developed methods al amin et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 houtz and sedlak 2012 shojaei et al 2022b is provided in the supplementary materials based on each facility s selected level of participation in this study the top assay was performed in 9 out of the 38 facilities 3 results discussion 3 1 occurrence of quantifiable pfas quantifiable pfas were detected in the influent and effluent fig 1 as well as the finished biosolids at all 38 facilities the average sum of quantifiable pfas detected across all facilities was 98 28 ng l for the influent and 80 24 ng l for the effluent indicating pfas concentrations typically resided within a relatively narrow range for these facilities despite differences in their geographic locations sizes dischargers and treatment schemes total pfas concentrations were comparable to several recent studies in north america china and oceania where the sum of quantifiable influent pfas concentrations ranged from 10 to 415 ng l and effluent pfas concentrations ranged from 14 to 520 ng l coggan et al 2019 lenka et al 2022 pan et al 2016 shigei et al 2020 the sum of quantifiable pfas detections were also comparable with the results from several wwtps in california sampled in 2020 and 2021 california state water resources control board 2022 sufficient influent solids i e a minimum of 235 mg l total suspended solids were present for pfas analysis in 12 of the 38 facilities influent solids pfas concentrations were converted to corresponding aqueous concentrations based on the solids content of the influent sample i e measured pfas concentration in the solids multiplied by the mass of solids per aqueous volume of the influent solution table s6 shows the influent solid pfas by grouping the quantifiable pfas according to chain length e g 4 6 total carbons and 6 total carbons pfaa type sulfonates and carboxylates and quantifiable precursors quantifiable pfas associated with influent solids were typically precursors and long chained pfas e g 6 total carbons across these 12 facilities influent solids accounted for 1 2 to 30 mean 7 4 of the quantifiable pfas entering the wwtp thus these results are consistent with those of cookson and detwiler 2022 who showed that pfas loading attributable to influent solids can be significant there was no significant difference between influent and effluent total quantifiable pfas associated fluorine concentrations t 0 79 p 0 43 when all facilities are considered fig 2 these results differ from that observed by xiao et al 2012 and helmer et al 2022 for which the latter observed that pfas levels in the effluent were several times greater than in the influent however results presented herein are consistent with several other studies documenting that the total pfas concentration in the effluent was similar to that of the influent lenka et al 2021 pan et al 2016 shigei et al 2020 vierke et al 2013 a comparison of classes of pfas between the influent and effluent and the occurrence of suspect pfas are further described below pfos and pfoa which are the focus of most regulatory attention in the united states were detected in the influent effluent or biosolids of 84 and 100 of the facilities respectively comparing the distribution of quantifiable pfas figs 3 and fig s2 only the short chain 4 6 total carbons perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas showed an increase from influent to effluent while precursors long chain 6 total carbons pfcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas decreased figure s2 precursors were the most abundant quantifiable pfas in the biosolids suggesting the potential for formation of pfaas in these solids after leaving the wwtps fig 3 shows quantifiable precursors were present at the influent and effluent 19 6 and 5 4 respectively a notable exception was facility 24 where precursors consisted of approximately 84 of the quantifiable influent pfas the dominant quantifiable precursor in facility 24 as well as 18 other facilities was 6 2 fts which accounted for 66 to 100 of the quantifiable precursor mass this is of particular interest as the use of 6 2 fts has increased as longer chain fluorinated compounds continue to be phased out of industrial products hamid et al 2020 previous studies have found that biotransformation of 6 2 fts can yield formation of 4 6 pfcas such as pfpea and pfhxa as well as other precursors such as 5 3 ftca field and seow 2017 gonzalez et al 2021 hamid et al 2020 harding marjanovic et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the overall decrease in 6 2 fts or precursors and the significant increase in 4 6 pfcas from the influent to the effluent across the facilities shown in fig 3 are consistent with this mechanism kim et al 2022 also observed substantial increases in 5 6 pfcas in wwtp effluent compared to the influent with 6 2 fts noted as one of the most abundant quantified precursors present while quantifiable precursors were observed in the influent of 30 of the 38 facilities they were observed in the effluent for only 9 of the facilities for facilities where quantifiable precursors were observed in the influent precursor concentrations decreased an average of 93 between the influent and effluent with the exception of facility 13 which had an increase in precursors between the influent and effluent from 0 6 to 8 3 ng l decreases in some precursor concentrations between the influent and effluent have been observed in previous wwtp studies houtz et al 2018 and are best explained by transformation of the precursors throughout the treatment process via biotic and or abiotic mechanisms or possibly sorption to solids it is possible that the observed increase in total quantifiable precursor concentration for facility13 was due to transformation of semi quantifiable or unidentified precursors to intermediate transformation products rather than terminal pfaas for example 6 2 fts can form from other polyfluoroalkyl substances such as those in modern afff formulations gonzalez et al 2021 fig 4 shows on a molar fluorine basis the sum of precursors detected using the top assay for influent and effluent samples from nine wwtps the sum of quantifiable pfas molar concentrations including pfaas and precursors are shown for comparison the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas were on average for the 9 facilities in fig 4 4 0 3 9 and 4 7 3 7 nm f respectively the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas following the top assay were on average for the nine facilities in fig 4 6 8 2 5 and 9 1 4 0 nm f respectively when considering the ratio of quantifiable pfas post top to that of the quantifiable pfas pre top individually at each facility the average ratio among the 9 facilities in fig 4 was 2 9 1 5 for the influent and 2 3 0 84 averaged among the nine facilities semi quantified or unidentified precursors ranged from 21 to 88 of the fluorine mass among the influents and effluents of these 9 facilities these results indicate that a substantial component of molar fluorine present in the influent and effluent was associated with precursors that could not be directly quantified i e not quantified until transformation using the top assay on average among the 9 facilities in fig 4 66 17 of the pfas based organic fluorine in the influent was attributable to precursors quantified and semi quantified while 51 16 of the pfas based organic fluorine in the effluent was attributable to precursors quantified and semi quantified it is also significant to note that the top based precursor concentrations exiting the wwtps were statistically identical to those entering the wwtp p 0 39 two tailed t test suggesting that only a relatively small fraction of potential precursors transformed to pfaas in the wwtps top precursors relative to quantifiable pfas that were found in this study compared well to previous studies applying the top assay to us wastewater influent or effluent glover et al 2018 found top assay increases in total molar pfas concentrations ranging from 42 to approximately 3 fold in three tertiary effluent samples tavasoli et al 2021 found an 8 fold increase in unidentified precursors from the top assay relative to quantified pfas in influent in march and lower increases 1 to 6 fold in effluent or july samples the effluent total molar fluorine formation from the top assay were within the same order of magnitude from 3 2 to 20 5 nm f for the nine facilities some pfas sources may have a greater potential for transformation than others depending on the types of pfas used at specific point sources for example aqueous film forming foam afff used for firefighting was spiked in laboratory sequencing bioreactors simulating a full scale wwtp by gonzalez et al 2021 and a 9 fold increase in pfaas was observed from the influent to the effluent a specific evaluation of collection system sources was not conducted for this study though relatively consistent concentrations were observed at the facilities despite variability in the types of collection system point source dischargers the sum of quantifiable pfas in the biosolids averaged 160 000 46 000 ng kg biosolids dry weight basis fig s3 these pfas biosolid concentrations were within the range reported in recent studies moodie et al 2021 schaefer et al 2022 as observed for the influent and effluent quantifiable pfas concentrations in the biosolids fell within the same order of magnitude despite the noted differences among the facilities that participated in this study whereas the aqueous influent and effluent samples were composed primarily of pfaas the majority of the quantifiable pfas in biosolids were precursors which accounted for an average of 65 22 of the pfas mass in biosolids for the 38 facilities fig 3 the dominant quantifiable precursors detected in biosolids were 5 3 ftca and 7 3 ftca which were detected in 92 and 95 of facilities respectively 5 3 ftca is known to be a potential biotransformation product of 6 2 fts harding marjanovic et al 2015 which was detected in the influent of 27 facilities but was found in the biosolids at 3 facilities and at relatively low levels e g 366 to 2960 ng kg several of the long chained pfcas pfuda pfdoa pftrda pfteda were detected only in the influent solids and biosolids samples suggesting that these more hydrophobic compounds tend to partition into the solids conversely fig 3 shows that the short chained pfcas accounted for a smaller percentage in the biosolids relative to the influent and effluent aqueous phases this lower percentage of pfcas in the biosolids is likely due to their comparatively low hydrophobicity ebrahimi et al 2021 3 2 mass flows of quantifiable pfas using the quantifiable pfas analytes as a basis the mass flows of fluorine into each of the treatment facilities the fluorine mass flow exiting as treated water and the fluorine mass flow exiting as finished biosolids were calculated mass flows were based upon the measured pfas concentrations in the influent effluent and finished biosolids multiplied by each facility s reported average flows of these streams as shown in fig 5 with the exception of ten of the 38 facilities numbers 5 6 7 17 20 24 26 31 32 and 33 the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass out of the treatment plant was statistically equal to or greater than the pfas based fluorine mass entering the facility this is likely due to the transformation of non quantified pfas precursors to quantifiable compounds during the treatment process for the ten facilities where the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass was greater entering the facility than that exiting an explanation is not readily apparent however for facilities 6 7 24 and 26 the influent consisted of elevated concentrations of quantifiable precursors primarily fluorotelomer sulfonates that may have been transformed to volatile intermediates e g ketones or fluorotelomer alcohols that were released during the wastewater treatment process zhang et al 2016 fig 5 also shows that with the exception of eight facilities numbers 5 8 10 18 19 25 28 and 29 at least half of the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass exited via the aqueous effluent stream rather than through biosolids fourteen of the 38 facilities had at least 75 of the quantifiable pfas based fluorine mass exiting via the aqueous effluent these results highlight the importance of the aqueous effluent as a source of pfas release back to the environment and are consistent with the findings of schultz et al 2006 who showed that 72 of the pfos mass exited a wwtp through the aqueous phase while only 28 exited via the solids stream for seven of the eight facilities where a greater fraction of the fluorine mass exited via the biosolids more than 50 of the influent mass loadings were either long chained precursors or pfaas e g c6 the stronger hydrophobicity of these constituents may have explained why a larger fraction was associated with the biosolids 3 3 occurrence of semi quantifiable pfas from the library of approximately 1400 analytes used for semi quantified pfas screening 307 were detected in this study fig 6 shows 34 suspect analytes where peak area detections met the screening criteria e g peak areas 10 000 cps and detected at 50 of the facilities or detected at 50 of utilities but with peak areas 90th percentile and their associated confidence levels the frequent occurrence of several semi quantifiable analytes many of which are precursors was qualitatively consistent with the top assay results indicating a relatively large fraction of the total molar fluorine was associated with precursors rather than quantifiable pfaas importantly all identifications of semi quantified pfas in this study should be considered tentative with increasing uncertainty at higher confidence intervals they indicate pfas that may be present and additional work would be needed to increase certainty in these identifications the most frequently detected classes in influent aqueous samples included n carboxymethyl dimethylammoniopropyl perfluorohexane sulfonamido acetic acid cmeampr fhxsaa 58 of samples n methyl perfluorodecane sulfonamide mefdsaa 58 of samples and fluorotelomer sulfonamido propyl methyl amine 4 2 ftsa pr mean 53 of samples cmeampr fasaa has been identified as a pfaa precursor in afff used for fire fighting schaefer et al 2020 mefdsaas are used in stain and water resistant textiles including synthetic leather cleaning solutions for semiconductors and printing inks glüge et al 2020 and 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamido amines have been identified in telomer based afff backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017a both mefdsaa and 4 2 ftsas are precursor compounds that can transform into either perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids from mefdsaa ullah et al 2014 or 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamides from 4 2 ftsas munoz et al 2017 interestingly cmeampr fasaa was only detected in influent aqueous samples though structurally similar n carboxymethyldimethyl ammoniopropyl perfluoropropane sulfonamido propanoic acid cmeampr fasapra was detected in 42 of biosolids influent and effluent peak areas of mefdsaa were similar 8 6 107 2 0 107 and 1 2 108 2 6 107 respectively p value 0 094 n 55 suggesting limited removal or transformation of these constituents through treatment mefdsaa was also the most frequently detected analyte for influent solids 58 of samples and effluent samples 87 there were nine semi quantified pfas that were detected in 50 or more of biosolids with peak areas ranging over an order of magnitude 106 to 107 importantly perfluorophosphonic acids pfpas and di paps occurred in 100 and 92 of samples respectively the pfpa perfluorocyclohexanephosphonic acid pfchxpa was detected in 42 of influent solids samples and di paps were detected in 6 of the 14 influent solids samples 43 pfpas and dipaps are both widely used and strongly hydrophobic e g log kow 7 us epa 2022 preferential partitioning of these constituents into solids may account for the observed occurrence in biosolids despite being below detection in the aqueous influent pfpas have been used as antifoaming agents in pesticides and detergents carpet and upholstery cleaning products surface coatings such as floor polish and for fiber optics glüge et al 2020 di paps have been used as food packaging surface coatings begley et al 2008 surface treatment and protectant applications buck et al 2011 and personal care products and pharmaceuticals lee and mabury 2011 di paps were detected in all biosolids samples collected from seven us wwtps and represented the greatest molar fluorine fraction detected at 77 to 97 in a previous study schaefer et al 2022 schaefer et al 2022 further showed that the di paps were suspected to account for the observed sustained leaching of pfaas over 6 months in field deployed mesocosms due to precursor transformation similar results were observed by moodie et al 2021 in australia where di paps were detected in 94 of samples and represented 45 of the pfas mass kim et al 2022 also identified di paps as a prominent precursor in wwtp influent classes that occurred at fewer facilities but represented relatively high percentiles e g 90th of the peak areas detected are shown as hollow circles in fig 6 these constituents are also of importance for assessing pfas loading due to their higher semi quantitative peak areas when they were detected unknown pfas3 unknown pfas5 and perfluoroalkyl octanedioic acid pfodia had the highest average peak areas of greater than 1 109 l but occurred in 20 or less of samples the unknown pfas3 and unknown pfas5 had the highest average peak areas detected in the aqueous influent at 6 facilities 16 these constituents were not detected in the effluent but were detected in the biosolids at just 2 facilities with three orders of magnitude lower peak areas l than the influent suggesting possible precursor transformation pfodia was only detected in the effluent at one facility and was not detected in the influent or influent solids a few studies have specifically investigated the occurrence of semi quantified pfas in wwtps though not previously in the us to the best of our knowledge wang et al 2020 found hydro substituted pfcas h pfca perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides pfsm and hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates h pfesa were the dominant suspect classes identified representing 80 of the emerging pfas identified in both influents and effluents sampled in china wang et al 2018 investigated target and suspect pfas from one of the largest fluorochemical industrial wastewater parks in china the composition of detected pfas was dominated by legacy quantifiable pfcas 22 of the relative peak area and the following suspect classes chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl carboxylates cl pfcas 35 to 45 h pfcas 28 and perfluorinated ethers and alcohols approximately 5 the 18 semi quantified compounds identified by jeong et al 2022 included fluorotelomer based compounds a perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid a perfluorosulfonamido acetic acid and chloride and bromide substituted compounds ultra short chain pfas are typically not reported due to their difficulty to resolve analytically they include pfas with two or three carbon backbone chain lengths trifluoracetic acid tfa perfluoropropanoic acid pfpra perfluoroethane sulfonate pfets and perfluoropropane sulfonate pfprs the suspect screening list in our study did include ultra short chain pfas but they were difficult to differentiate due to very short retention time and matrix interference 3 4 mass flows of semi quantified pfas mass flows of semi quantified pfas for each facility where peak areas were used to assess relative pfas detections are provided in fig 7 influent pfas represents net pfas detected in the influent aqueous and solid phases for each facility where influent solids were collected values shown above the bars indicate the fraction of pfas area exiting via the aqueous effluent with the remaining balance exiting via the biosolids stream peak areas correlate to concentration but it is important to note that the response of an individual compound during analysis can vary by compound and by media thus there are uncertainties when comparing peak areas between individual pfas and also of a single pfas between multiple media e g aqueous vs solid in particular peak areas in solid extracts can be reduced relative to response in aqueous matrices by both incomplete extraction from the solid and matrix suppression ferrer et al 2011 stahnke et al 2012 additionally suspect pfas were identified with various levels of confidence nevertheless this analysis is an opportunity to assess trends in semi quantified pfas for the semi quantified analytes 27 of the 38 facilities 71 had semi quantified pfas exiting in the aqueous effluents that were greater than those exiting in the biosolids these findings are similar to the quantifiable pfas and thus highlight the importance of aqueous effluents as source of quantified and semi quantified pfas into the environment 4 conclusions results of this study consistent with prior studies on the occurrence of pfas in wwtps demonstrated the widespread presence of pfas both entering and exiting wwtps herein it is shown that precursors accounted for 66 and 51 of the pfas based fluorine entering and leaving wwtps in the aqueous flows respectively on average and that the majority of precursors based on a comparison of top results for the influent and effluent were not transformed to pfaas during the treatment processes the majority of pfas exited the wwtps via the aqueous effluent compared to the biosolids stream semi quantified analysis identified several frequently detected classes of pfas these results highlight the need for improved pfas quantification in wwtp aqueous and solid matrices in addition the impacts of precursor releases through both the aqueous and solid discharges as well as improved understanding of the sources and fate of precursors through wwtps merits further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14962,aquaculture is a crucial industry in the agri food sector but it is linked to serious environmental problems there is a need for efficient treatment systems that allow water recirculation to mitigate pollution and water scarcity this work aimed to evaluate the self granulation process of a microalgae based consortium and its capacity to bioremediate coastal aquaculture streams that sporadically contain the antibiotic florfenicol ff a photo sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with an autochthonous phototrophic microbial consortium and was fed with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture streams a rapid granulation process occurred within ca 21 days accompanied by a substantially increase of extracellular polymeric substances in the biomass the developed microalgae based granules exhibited high and stable organic carbon removal 83 100 sporadically wastewater contained ff which was partially removed ca 5 5 11 4 from the effluent in periods of ff load the ammonium removal slightly decreased from 100 to ca 70 recovering 2 days after ff feeding ceased a high chemical quality effluent was obtained complying with ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations for water recirculation within a coastal aquaculture farm even during ff feeding periods members belonging to the chloroidium genus were predominant in the reactor inoculum ca 99 but were replaced from day 22 onwards by an unidentified microalga from the phylum chlorophyta 61 a bacterial community proliferated in the granules after reactor inoculation whose composition varied in response to feeding conditions bacteria from the muricauda and filomicrobium genera rhizobiaceae balneolaceae and parvularculaceae families thrived upon ff feeding this study demonstrates the robustness of microalgae

1 introduction aquaculture production is strategic in providing food and nutrition and is at a record level with global production reaching 87 5 million tonnes of aquatic animals in 2020 fao 2022 however land based aquacultures require large water volumes to sustain their productivity generating enormous volumes of effluent carrying suspended solids and pollutants c n and p ansari et al 2019 if not properly handled these effluents represent a major environmental issue leading to among others the eutrophication of the receiving water bodies thomsen et al 2020 the intensification of fish farming in land based aquaculture facilities exacerbates the potential negative impacts on surrounding environments due to the concentration of pollutants in limited areas li et al 2021 on the other hand aquaculture production is highly dependent on some environmental variables e g rainfall temperature salinity etc and highly vulnerable to the climate change effects ahmed and turchini 2021 therefore the aquaculture industry has been challenged to maintain its high productivity whilst lowering its ecological footprint to face water scarcity and environmental issues recirculating aquaculture systems ras are highly productive intensive farming systems that make use of technological solutions to effectively treat and recycle aquaculture effluents reducing the water need and dependence whilst maintaining fish production ahmed and turchini 2021 xiao et al 2019 nevertheless to achieve such high standards successful ras must ensure a high efficiency of several sequential processes such as solids removal dissolved pollutants removal oxygenation levels and carbon dioxide removal and lastly when required a disinfection step before water recirculation to the fish tanks ebeling and timmons 2012 while mechanical processes can be easily monitored and controlled the dissolved pollutants biological removal relies on the interaction of microorganisms amongst themselves and the incoming wastewater which greatly influences its efficacy schreier et al 2010 although most recent aquaculture practices limit the use of chemicals in fish farming pharmaceuticals disinfectants and antifoulants are still used dauda et al 2019 that is the case of florfenicol ff a broad spectrum antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the 50s ribosomal subunit zhang et al 2020 it is broadly used in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat infectious diseases due to its efficacy low cost and high potency gao et al 2018 in fact since the 1990s ff has been used in aquaculture farms and currently it is the most used antibiotic as it is one of the few authorized pharmaceuticals for aquatic medical use fernando j sutili and letícia t gressler 2021 a significant antibiotic fraction 70 80 in its active metabolic form often ends up in the surrounding environment posing a threat to those ecosystems reverter et al 2020 indeed the ff antibiotic has been detected in aquatic systems surrounding fish farms at concentrations ranging between μg l 1 to up to mg l 1 zong et al 2010 moreover the antibiotics present in aquaculture effluents can negatively impact the biological treatment units in ras inhibiting organic matter removal nitrification and denitrification processes gao et al 2018 there has been an increasing interest in the use of microalgae for the treatment of saline wastewater and particularly of aquaculture streams due to their high adaptability to different salinities nutrients and contaminants removal efficiency lower greenhouse gas emissions and potential for resource recovery lee and lei 2019 li et al 2019 however the separation of the biomass from the treated effluent represents a bottleneck in such systems microalgae cells small size 3 30 μm low density and negative surface charges greatly contribute to their poor settling characteristics wang et al 2022 granulation of microalgae biomass represents an attractive solution to overcome separation and harvesting issues several studies have focused on the use of specific microalgae strains for the treatment of aquaculture effluents in batch assays many of which aiming at biomass valorization ansari et al 2017 guldhe et al 2017 guo et al 2013 khatoon et al 2016 liu et al 2019 limited studies reported the use of granular biomass microalgae bacterial granular sludge and aerobic granular sludge colonized by microalgae for the bioremediation of such effluents fan et al 2021 rajitha et al 2020 santorio et al 2022 the present study aims to demonstrate the feasibility to form microalgae based granules from a native microbial consortium occurring in coastal aquaculture streams in a photo sequencing reactor and their efficiency in treating coastal aquaculture effluents moreover the effect of the sporadic presence of ff in wastewater on reactor performance and microbial community were elucidated it is anticipated that this work would contribute for the application of microalgae based granules in coastal ras 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae based granules photo sequencing reactor set up the non axenic

characteristics 3 1 1 granules morphology the seed biomass was mainly composed by flocs with a loose structure after 21 days irregularly shaped granules started to appear with floccular and filamentous structures still being observed fig 1 these biomass structural changes were accompanied by an increase of the biomass settling velocity from 0 933 to 9 33m h 1 during the first 21 days from day 41 onwards round regular shaped granules dominated the biomass fig 1 a transition in the aggregate s coloration from light to dark green was also observed the size distribution of biomass particles and granules was monitored regularly fig 2 and classified according to their equivalent diameter deq into flocs 0 08 mm deq 0 2 mm small to intermediate granules 0 2 mm deq 1 5 mm and large granules deq 1 5 mm during phase i minor changes were observed in the floc s percentage 53 to 51 and in small to intermediate granules 47 to 49 while large granules were present in a neglectable number the high percentage of small to intermediate granules on day 0 occurred because the microbial consortium used as inoculum tended to aggregate or form large flocs of filamentous biomass during its cultivation prior to reactor inoculation nevertheless the biomass clearly shows an evolution towards granulation between day 0 and 21 showing less flocs with a loose structure fig 1 from day 41 onwards small to intermediate granules became predominant in the biomass and the number of large granules increased gradually reaching up to 27 of the biomass on day 146 flocs numbers increased again towards the end of reactor operation as biomass showed a more even distribution between the three established deq ranges during phase i as the granulation process occurred the effluent tss and vss contents exhibiting identical values gradually decreased from 0 4 0 01 to 0 02 0 001 g l 1 stabilizing thereafter within a low range of 0 006 0 037 g l 1 fig s1 on the other hand till day 85 the mlss and mlvss concentrations in the reactor increased from 1 3 to 9 1 g l 1 and 1 1 to 7 6 g l 1 stabilizing thereafter even during ff shock loads with average concentrations of 5 5 1 1 g l 1 and 4 4 0 9 g l 1 respectively table s1 in fact during phase iii when mature granules were well established in the reactor the biomass bed height exhibited overall low values ranging between 3 and 5 75 cm but the sporadic presence of ff in the wastewater did not cause major disturbances neither in the effluent s solids contents nor in the bed height fig s1 3 1 2 dynamics of the eps content in biomass throughout operation the eps composition within the granules differed significantly in terms of polysaccharides proteins and pn ps ratio p 0 05 fig 3 the main eps component varied throughout operation as polysaccharides concentration surpassed that of proteins on some days day 0 64 85 126 167 and 188 and the opposite occurred on the remaining analyzed days day 22 41 105 and 147 the eps polysaccharides content increased gradually from day 0 to 64 followed by a sharp increase on day 85 reaching a maximum concentration of 110 32 mg g 1 tss afterwards polysaccharides concentrations decreased significantly until day 147 p 0 05 increasing again towards the end of reactor operation day 167 and 188 a sharp increase of the eps proteins content was observed from day 0 to 22 0 8 0 05 to 38 5 2 6 mg g 1 tss contributing to the drastic rise of pn ps ratio 0 1 0 01 to 2 0 0 17 the maximum proteins concentration in the eps was detected on day 85 ca 70 21 mg g 1 tss after which only minor variations occurred without significant differences p 0 05 even in periods when ff was present in the wastewater despite the maximum concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins being reached on day 85 polysaccharides content had a higher contribution for total eps on that day leading to the lowest mean pn ps ratio of phase iii 0 6 0 01 after day 85 the eps exhibited significant fluctuations in the pn ps ratio p 0 05 3 1 3 dynamics of the pigments content in biomass a pronounced increase of chlorophyll a b and total carotenoids contents in the biomass was observed from day 0 to 64 reaching ca 1546 63 µg mg 1 ts of total pigments sum of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids representing a 23 fold increase fig 4 from day 85 onwards the pigments content stabilized even in periods when ff was present in the wastewater throughout operation chlorophyll a was the predominant pigment produced by the biomass followed by carotenoids and chlorophyll b 3 2 reactor performance and effluent quality 3 2 1 carbon removal high doc removal efficiencies were achieved shortly after the beginning of operation with an average removal of 89 21 and 94 6 during phases i and ii respectively fig 5 a as the doc in the wastewater decreased in phase iii the system maintained its high removal efficiency with minor variations namely during the ff shock loads during which removal efficiencies ranged between 83 and 100 3 2 2 n species and phosphate removal the ammonium removal efficiency fig 5b during phases i ii and early phase iii fluctuated greatly 6 to 94 complete ammonium removal was achieved around day 70 phase iii with small variations in the removal efficiency occurring whenever ff was absent from the wastewater maintaining an ammonium depletion efficiency of ca 93 100 during the four periods when the antibiotic ff was present in the wastewater a decline of the ammonium removal efficiency occurred to 74 78 74 and 70 respectively being reestablished 2 days after the ff feeding ceased nitrate was introduced into the feeding wastewater in phases ii and iii of reactor operation fig 5c the nitrate removal increased considerably during phase ii reaching its maximum efficiency ca 75 subsequently in phase iii nitrate removal fluctuated greatly before and during ff shock loads 13 73 similarly to nitrate nitrite was integrated into the wastewater from phase ii onwards fig 5d on most days a slight nitrite consumption occurred during the aerobic period of the treatment cycle however this removal was not sufficiently expressive leading to higher nitrite levels in the effluent than those in the feeding and to the accumulation of this nitrogen form in the reactor the overall n removal ranged between 93 and 94 during phase i 18 and 79 during phase ii and 4 and 62 during phase iii with the lowest removal being achieved during a ff shock phosphate removal efficiency fluctuated during operation showing low overall removal of this compound and a maximum efficiency of 46 around day 49 fig 5e 3 2 3 dissolved oxygen and ph in the effluent minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations in the reactor bulk liquid were reached during the feeding period of the treatment cycle during which the reactor was non aerated also the antibiotic presence in the wastewater contributed to a slight increase in dissolved oxygen levels as a minimum of 7 4 0 4 mg o2 l 1 in the absence of ff and 8 4 0 4 mg o2 l 1 in the presence of ff were detected fig s2 in phases i ii and iii the ph values during the operational cycles ranged from 7 6 to 8 8 8 2 to 8 5 and 8 4 to 9 2 respectively stabilizing in the last phase whenever the wastewater contained ff no relevant ph variations were detected fig s3 3 3 4 fate of ff during phase iii the reactor biomass was exposed to the intermittent presence of ff in the wastewater for four periods of two consecutive days table 2 shows the mass balance of ff in the reactor the ff removal in each shock load of the antibiotic was low based on the ff deficit observed between its concentration in the wastewater and in the effluent microalgae based granules removed ca 11 4 7 9 and 5 3 mg of ff in the first third and fourth shocks respectively on the other hand ff was released on the second shock given the higher ff content in the effluent 87 1 mg than in the wastewater 79 8 mg on the hplc profiles of the effluent samples no metabolites resulting from ff degradation were detected fig s4 furthermore fluorine ions content in the effluent samples was negligible fig s5 removal of ff due to photodegradation was tested since the presence of nitrate and dissolved organic matter in the medium can affect the ff photolysis and showed to be negligible as the antibiotic was not susceptible to photodegradation within the treatment cycles established fig s6 3 4 evolution of the microbial communities in biomass 3 4 1 microalgae community a total number of 802871 reads were obtained from 10 samples with the vast majority of the asvs 85 affiliated with taxonomic groups other than microalgae microalgae were represented by 13 asvs 712349 reads distributed over 4 different phyla chlorophyta charophyta bacillariophyta and ochrophyta the microalgae community exhibited low diversity shannon index between 0 02 and 0 724 richness 4 to 10 asvs per sample and equitability 0 014 to 0 372 fig s7 the genus chloroidium was predominant in the inoculum ca 99 but its abundance gradually decreased over time reaching a relative abundance lower than 0 1 from day 105 onwards concomitantly an unidentified microalgae species from the chlorophyta phylum not detected in the inoculum was the most abundant taxa from day 22 onwards 61 also an asv assigned to the genus nitzschia was first identified in the biomass on day 167 and its abundance increased towards the end of operation reaching ca 13 on day 188 3 4 2 bacterial community ten samples were sequenced but on day 0 no reads were obtained a total number of 70124 reads was obtained from the remaining 9 samples corresponding to 126 asvs assigned to 8 different bacterial phyla the community diversity shannon index increased gradually until day 126 fig 6 a the presence of ff in the wastewater triggered a decrease of the bacterial diversity showing values ca 13 lower than those on day 126 prior to the first ff shock load the community evenness on the other hand showed a general decrease throughout operation with abrupt reductions upon the feeding with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents phase iii and upon the load of wastewater containing ff the nmds ordination plot fig 6b revealed noticeable changes in the bacterial community structure over time with the distribution of the samples in the plot reflecting the sampling timeline in the later sampling times a greater stability of the communities is noted reflected in a tight clustering between samples from day 147 167 and 188 pseudomonadota was the most abundant phylum in all samples representing on average 59 5 8 8 followed by bacteroidota 23 2 11 9 and planctomycetota 16 6 6 9 these three phyla were present in all samples fig s8 at genus level marinobacter roseovarius pseudomonas an unknown phycisphaeraceae member sm1a02 and an uncultured genus assigned to the saprospiraceae family were present in all samples collected from day 22 to 188 representing together 29 8 to 77 8 of the total bacterial community fig 7 a despite not being detected in all samples members from the thauera muricauda and sphingorhabdus genera represented a large portion of the bacterial community as well particularly in phase iii members of the thauera and muricauda genera were detected from day 41 and 105 onwards reaching 17 5 and 27 0 of the total community on day 188 respectively the sphingorhabdus taxon first observed on day 64 increased its abundance to 10 1 of the total community on day 105 together these three genera reached a maximum relative abundance of 45 8 on day 188 during phase iii the wastewater composition along with the sporadic presence of ff in the wastewater changed the bacterial community taxonomic composition fig 7b upon the introduction of a feeding medium that mimics a coastal aquaculture effluent the relative abundance of several genera increased as it is the case of roseovarius muricauda thaurea sphingorhabdus and paracoccus which relative abundance by the end of operation increased from 1 3 to 21 7 0 to 11 4 2 2 to 9 9 0 to 5 6 and 0 to 0 3 respectively for other community members the opposite occurred with their abundance decreasing considerably namely pseudomonas 15 6 to 0 marinobacter 6 5 to 0 6 and stappia 1 8 to 0 fig s9 the relative abundance of genera roseovarius muricauda and filomicrobium increased from 21 7 to 29 3 11 4 to 22 and 2 8 to 4 6 respectively after the first ff shock load contrarily the relative abundances of unknown genus sm1a02 of the phycisphaeraceae family uncultured genus assigned to the saprospiraceae family ruegeria sphingorhabdus and paracocccus decreased during the same period from 18 3 to 13 0 6 to 0 2 4 2 to 0 4 5 6 to 2 8 and 0 3 to 0 respectively fig s9 statistical analysis t test p 0 05 revealed that eleven asvs showed significantly different relative abundances before and after the ff shock loadings within phase iii in fact the relative abundance of five asvs decreased asvs assigned to genera hyphomonas and thauera families rhizobiaceae and saprospiraceae and order parvibaculales whilst the remaining asvs increased their relative abundancies asvs assigned to genera muricauda and filomicrobium and families balneolaceae rhizobiaceae and parvularculaceae fig 8 4 discussion a microalgae based granular sludge was developed in a photo sequencing reactor and successfully applied to remove carbon and nutrients from coastal aquaculture effluents even when the antibiotic ff was present in those effluents the chemical quality of the treated water would allow recirculation of water back into the fish tanks representing a potential alternative biological treatment system that can be implemented as part of a ras the phototrophic microbial consortium autochthonous to the water streams of a coastal aquaculture facility successfully self granulated within 21 days without the need of any carrier material fig 1 after those 21 days small to intermediate granules 0 2 mm deq 1 5 mm were the predominant biomass form in the reactor nevertheless towards the end of operation day 169 to 188 the abundance of small to intermediate granules and large granules decreased and the abundance of flocs increased fig 2 the upsurge of flocs is often associated with the breakage of large and intermediate granules into smaller granules and fragments oliveira et al 2021 2020 which may be due to the long operational period and or environmental stressors e g the antibiotic ff stable and low biomass bed height and effluents solid tss and vss contents were detected throughout operation a similar trend was reported by santorio et al 2021 that used an aerobic granular sludge system to treat freshwater aquaculture effluents the low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in this kind of effluents induce a metabolic selective pressure only supporting the viability of small biomass portions this low biomass content 5 1 2 2 g mlss l 1 table s1 was indeed sufficient to ensure the efficient treatment of the coastal aquaculture wastewater achieving high removal efficiencies crucial for water recirculation microalgae pigments are indirect biomarkers of cell viability furthermore microalgae demonstrate their adaptation to various stimuli through changes in enzymes hydrocarbon and pigment levels vo et al 2020 in the present study pigments concentrations increased sharply until day 65 stabilizing thereafter even in periods when wastewater contained ff fig 4 these results as well as the granules coloration shift from light to dark green are likely due to an initial microalgae proliferation and subsequent adaptation to the feeding composition granulation process and dynamics of the bacterial community co habiting the granules the eps production increase in the first days of operation is linked to the granulation process and to the biomass higher settleability moreover as pointed out in previous studies a higher relative hydrophobicity is linked to a higher pn ps ratio which in turn is considered a triggering factor for granulation wang et al 2022 indeed a pn ps ratio sharp increase occurred from day 0 to 22 pointing this period as the beginning of the granulation process fig 3 the eps biosynthesis is an intensive energy and resource consuming process inevitably affecting microbial growth and competitiveness of eps producers an et al 2016 a high loaded wastewater was used at the beginning of operation so that microorganisms have enough energy to proliferate and produce eps which could benefit the self aggregation process the stepwise carbon decrease in the feeding could have contributed for the granule s formation and stabilization in the early stages of operation perhaps a start up period to acclimatize the biomass to the operating and feeding conditions is not needed nevertheless further research with low doc in the start up wastewater is needed to confirm this hypothesis members of the flavobacterium brevundimonas and pseudomonas genera and members of the sphingomonadaceae family found in the bacterial community have been identified as eps producers subramanian et al 2010 verhoef et al 2002 weissbrodt et al 2014 like certain bacterial strains microalgae can also produce eps gaignard et al 2018 but the scarce taxonomic information about the microalgae community found in the present study mostly high taxonomic levels assigned makes it difficult to speculate regarding their eps producing capacity interestingly ff shock loads did not significantly disturb the eps production indeed some asvs that proliferated during ff feeding were assigned to eps producers fig 8a such as muricauda han et al 2022 while other eps producers such as hyphomonas quintero et al 1998 and saprospiraceae zhu et al 2022 showed to be susceptible to that stressor fig 8b interestingly some members of the rhizobiaceae family known eps producers alvarez et al 2018 have shown to be susceptible to ff while other members of that family proliferated in the same conditions as reported in previous studies the microbial community diversity and functional redundancy are key factors for the adaptability and resilience of biological systems under stress factors allowing for populations susceptible to stressors e g antibiotics to be replaced by others more adapted to such conditions enabling the community to cooperate in a synergistic way amorim et al 2018 a good chemical and microbiological water quality is of utmost importance for the fish growth and survival since their entire life process depends on the quality of the surrounding environment therefore water quality is determinant for the success of aquaculture productions table 3 shows the ammonium nitrite and nitrate toxicity limits and the dissolved oxygen and ph ideal ranges for brackishwater and marine fish as well as their concentrations in the reactor effluent when fed with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents organic carbon and phosphate are not toxic to fish but high concentrations of these compounds can potentiate the growth of bacteria naturally present in aquaculture pond water reducing the dissolved oxygen levels possibly inducing hypoxia health problems and mortality in fish kim et al 2013 in the worst case scenario it can lead to fish pathogens outbreaks the high carbon removal efficiency 83 to 100 even in the presence of ff in the wastewater fig 5a thus contributes to the high quality of the treated water aiming at recirculation in an aquaculture facility contrarily a low and variable phosphate removal efficiency 46 was observed fig 5e although bacteria assigned to the saprospiraceae family frequently abundant in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems nielsen et al 2012 and to pseudomonas genus known denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms he et al 2018 were detected in the biomass throughout operation microalgae can also use phosphorus for growth as an essential element required for making cellular constituents or during a stationary phase through the assimilation and storage of polyphosphate khanzada 2020 the well known redfield s ratio sets the optimal nutrient ratio required for eukaryotic algae growth as 106 16 1 c n p figler et al 2021 when the wastewater mimicked an aquaculture effluent phase iii the c n p ratio was of 9 8 1 7 1 which implies a carbon and nitrogen deficiency furthermore environmental factors such as light osmotic shocks and nutrient availability have been found to hinder intracellular phosphorus accumulation during microalgae stationary phase khanzada 2020 thus the low phosphate removal could have been due to competition between microalgae and bacteria for the available carbon possibly leading to a low activity of phosphorus removing organisms another explanation for the low phosphate removal is linked to the incomplete nitrification process since nitrite levels as low as 2 mg l 1 have been shown to decrease the polyphosphate accumulating organisms activity saito et al 2004 ammonia is the main nitrogenous waste produced by aquatic animals and is highly toxic to fish anusuya et al 2017 aqueous ammonia occurs in equilibrium with ammonium and ph and temperature are major factors influencing their proportions since it is very difficult to directly determine the levels of aqueous ammonia ammonium nitrogen is quantified and ammonia nitrogen concentration is estimated considering the ph and temperature franklin and edward 2019 considering the maximum ph and temperature registered during operation ph 9 2 and 28 7 c fig s3 and the maximum ammonium nitrogen effluent concentration 0 09 mg l 1 a maximum ammonia nitrogen effluent concentration of ca 0 06 mg l 1 was estimated which is below the fish toxicity limits even for the most sensitive species table 3 typically in the presence of multiple nitrogen sources microalgae often prioritize the ammonium consumption as this is the most energetically efficient nitrogen source perez garcia et al 2011 a slight nitrite accumulation in the effluent was observed fig 5d probably caused by the simultaneous ammonium oxidation and nitrate reduction into nitrite by microorganisms in the reactor e g members of the genera paracoccus thauera and denitromonas likely play a role in the latter chen et al 2020 nitrate on the other hand was degraded by the biomass but with a variable removal efficiency 13 73 fig 5c these observations are corroborated by studies by kaplan et al 2000 and huang et al 2015 who noted that the activity of nitrifying bacteria was significantly reduced when exposed to sunlight and that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were more sensitive to sunlight than ammonium oxidizing bacteria possibly due to the disruption of electron transfer from cytochrome c to nitrite reductase in nob aquatic animals are also sensitive to nitrite and nitrate contents in the water but despite the slight nitrite accumulation and the variable nitrate removal efficiency observed in the present study the maximum concentrations of both pollutants were maintained below brackishwater and marine fish toxicity limits table 3 even though the reactor wastewater composition already met the requirements to be recirculated with ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations below fish toxicity limits table 1 and table 3 its continuous recirculation without applying any treatment process would lead to the accumulation of pollutants at levels toxic for the fish therefore the biological treatment with the proposed microalgae based granular sludge could improve even further the water quality theoretically increasing the number of cycles that water could be recycled nevertheless at this point it is not possible to estimate the number of times that water can be recycled as this study does not take into consideration the accumulation of pollutants in the water due to fish metabolism that is dependent on fish species size of the fish tank and number of fish per tank and it does not consider the reactor microbial community response to the variable pollution levels on each water recycling cycle further research needs to be performed to attest if compounds toxic to fish would build up or if the microbial community would adapt over time and remove them to a higher extent dissolved oxygen and ph are also important water quality parameters in aquaculture the ph values in the treated effluent especially in phase iii were considerably higher than advisable table 3 photosynthetic reactions undertaken by microalgae continuously assimilate co2 dissolved in the water rising the ph to values that may not be adequate for fish rearing nevertheless this can be easily corrected to maintain the ph of the recirculation water within ideal values contrarily the dissolved oxygen levels were within the ideal range for fish growth table 3 even exhibiting slightly higher values whenever the ff was present in the wastewater fig s2 probably due to the inhibition of the bacterial activity the dissolved oxygen level is the first limiting factor in intensive aquaculture systems and one of the main energy consumption components in ras badiola et al 2018 a biological treatment system such as the one described in the present study represents an attractive solution in ras since it reduces the need for oxygenation and potentially the aquaculture farm operational costs on the other hand energy costs related to led lights for microalgae survival need to be taken into consideration as well further research and life cycle assessment needs to be conducted to confirm lower operational costs and energy savings of this biological treatment system nevertheless the system is promising for decreasing the water needs and dependence of the land based aquacultures important issues that this industry is facing due to water scarcity although none of the identified microalgae species belongs to the harmful algae bloom species list a thorough evaluation of the presence of toxins should be performed to prevent economic losses linked with fish mortality as well as the transfer of toxins up the food chain microalgae strains such as chlorella sp utex1602 and chlorella sp l38 have been described as able to biodegrade ff at a concentration of 46 mg l 1 97 removal after 20 days song et al 2019 contrarily isochrysis galbana and microcystis flos aqua are highly susceptible to ff at 1 mg l 1 and 50 μg l 1 respectively causing biomass growth and chlorophyll production inhibition as well as oxidative stress in both microalgae species wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 evidently the effect of ff on microalgae growth viability and physiology is strain and dose dependent the microalgae based granular sludge in the present study table 2 partially removed ff in the first third and fourth shock loads most likely due to ff adsorption onto granules degradation or biotransformation of the ff seemed to be unlikely to occur within the timeframe of the treatment cycle as fluorine ions typically released during degradation of fluorinated compounds were almost absent from the effluent fig s5 and no metabolites were detected by the used hplc method furthermore ff effluent release on the second shock highlights that adsorption and desorption phenomena are more likely than biotransformation several studies have demonstrated the adsorption capacity of granules when subjected to recalcitrant pollutants amorim et al 2017 2016 the decreasing trend of the removal capacity from the first to the fourth ff shock load also supports adsorption desorption hypothesis as this is probably linked to saturation of the bonding sites like what was observed in a previous study oliveira et al 2021 further ff removal improvement is required if recirculation is envisaged to prevent its accumulation in the recirculation water and prevent a possible negative impact in the biological treatment microbial community and in the aquaculture fish for instance the bioaugmentation of the biological treatment system with ff degrading strains or even chemical and physical methods using for example magnetic biochar as an adsorbent could be integrated in the treatment system or as part of a sequential treatment system and used whenever antibiotics were used in the aquaculture farm zhao and lang 2018 nevertheless further research needs to be conducted to prove the efficiency of such proposed systems the reactor inoculum was composed by a non axenic well adapted consortium mainly composed by microalgae when the 16s rrna gene was the target region no sequencing results were obtained for the inoculum day 0 probably due to the low numbers of bacterial cells in this sample however after starting reactor operation a bacterial community has developed the microalgae and bacterial communities structure in treatment systems are highly dependent on water quality parameters nutrient ratios and availability ph chemical stressors environmental factors temperature light darkness cycles and physiological aspects intrinsic to the microbial community and its symbiotic relations a dynamic microbial community existed in the granules whose structure was susceptible and adaptable to the changing operational and environmental reactor conditions fig 7a the introduction of feeding conditions mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents phase iii led to the proliferation of known eps producers and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha storing bacteria such as thauera fall et al 2022 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 and paracoccus fall et al 2022 which may have supported granular stability fig 7b interestingly during the transition from phase ii to iii an increase of the relative abundance of a phototrophic bacterial genus roseovarius fig 7b was observed likely as a response to the lowering carbon content in the wastewater and favorable photosynthetic conditions gu and mitchell 2006 however in the same period a population decrease of the nitrifying and possible anammox genus sm1a02 occurred as well as of ruegeria fig 7b often found in ras nitrifying filters chu et al 2015 schreier et al 2010 tian et al 2017 xie et al 2021 considering the nitrification performance nob were likely the most affected nitrifying bacteria since nitrite removal was nearly null major bacterial community structural changes and a clear diversity reduction occurred upon ff shock loads fig 6a the relative abundance of several bacterial asvs probably susceptible to this antibiotic declined considerably namely asvs affiliated with genera hyphomonas and thauera and rhizobiaceae saprospiraceae and parvibaculales families but the relative abundance of other members of thauera increased after ff shocks fig 8 members of this genus have shown to have ff resistance genes and members of the rhizobiaceae family were abundant in the intestinal microbiota of fish fed with ff gupta et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the introduction of ff also led to the thriving of muricauda and filomicrobium genera and rhizobiaceae family fig 8 all identified as antibiotic resistant bacteria in literature gerzova et al 2014 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 proliferation of parvulaculaceae and of members of the recently established balneolaceae family was also observed fig 8 for which there are no literature reports on antibiotic resistance hence the present study provides evidence that these families might have bacterial strains with ff resistance mechanisms microalgae genus nitzschia has also shown to proliferate after ff shocks the susceptibility of certain bacterial strains to ff could have provided advantageous conditions for this microalgae diatom genus increasing its capacity to compete for nutrients in a study performed by molina cárdenas and sánchez saavedra 2017 three nitzschia strains were shown to exert antibacterial activity against pathogenic vibrio species presumably due to production of inhibitory compounds it can be hypothesized that a possible synergistic effect could have occurred between the ff shocks and the nitzschia population increase with both contributing for the bacterial diversity decrease within biomass despite the bacterial diversity reduction and the slight ammonium removal efficiency inhibition from 100 to 70 upon ff presence in the wastewater the removal processes were not disrupted maintaining the chemical quality of the treated effluent uncompromised the proposed biological treatment system has the potential to be applied as part of a ras promoting water recirculation in a coastal aquaculture farm and potentially decreasing the costs associated with water oxygenation as previously stated the microbial diversity and functional redundancy can play a crucial role in biological systems adaptability supporting their ability to withstand adverse conditions and environmental stressors 5 conclusions the present study can be regarded as a proof of concept for the use of an autochthonous self granulating microbial consortium in aquaculture effluent bioremediation processes the main following conclusions were drawn a rapid granulation process occurred ca 21 days supported by increased eps production rendering dense granules microalgae based granular sludge is a robust and efficient biological treatment system to remove carbon and n species from coastal aquaculture streams even in periods of ff shock loads resulting in effluents complying with fish toxicity limits the antibiotic ff was partially removed through sorption but further improvement of ff removal is needed to prevent its accumulation in recirculation water the study emphasizes the implementation potential of such granular systems in coastal aquaculture facilities as

14962,aquaculture is a crucial industry in the agri food sector but it is linked to serious environmental problems there is a need for efficient treatment systems that allow water recirculation to mitigate pollution and water scarcity this work aimed to evaluate the self granulation process of a microalgae based consortium and its capacity to bioremediate coastal aquaculture streams that sporadically contain the antibiotic florfenicol ff a photo sequencing batch reactor was inoculated with an autochthonous phototrophic microbial consortium and was fed with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture streams a rapid granulation process occurred within ca 21 days accompanied by a substantially increase of extracellular polymeric substances in the biomass the developed microalgae based granules exhibited high and stable organic carbon removal 83 100 sporadically wastewater contained ff which was partially removed ca 5 5 11 4 from the effluent in periods of ff load the ammonium removal slightly decreased from 100 to ca 70 recovering 2 days after ff feeding ceased a high chemical quality effluent was obtained complying with ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations for water recirculation within a coastal aquaculture farm even during ff feeding periods members belonging to the chloroidium genus were predominant in the reactor inoculum ca 99 but were replaced from day 22 onwards by an unidentified microalga from the phylum chlorophyta 61 a bacterial community proliferated in the granules after reactor inoculation whose composition varied in response to feeding conditions bacteria from the muricauda and filomicrobium genera rhizobiaceae balneolaceae and parvularculaceae families thrived upon ff feeding this study demonstrates the robustness of microalgae based granular systems for aquaculture effluent bioremediation even during periods of ff loading highlighting their potential as a feasible and compact solution in recirculation aquaculture systems

1 introduction aquaculture production is strategic in providing food and nutrition and is at a record level with global production reaching 87 5 million tonnes of aquatic animals in 2020 fao 2022 however land based aquacultures require large water volumes to sustain their productivity generating enormous volumes of effluent carrying suspended solids and pollutants c n and p ansari et al 2019 if not properly handled these effluents represent a major environmental issue leading to among others the eutrophication of the receiving water bodies thomsen et al 2020 the intensification of fish farming in land based aquaculture facilities exacerbates the potential negative impacts on surrounding environments due to the concentration of pollutants in limited areas li et al 2021 on the other hand aquaculture production is highly dependent on some environmental variables e g rainfall temperature salinity etc and highly vulnerable to the climate change effects ahmed and turchini 2021 therefore the aquaculture industry has been challenged to maintain its high productivity whilst lowering its ecological footprint to face water scarcity and environmental issues recirculating aquaculture systems ras are highly productive intensive farming systems that make use of technological solutions to effectively treat and recycle aquaculture effluents reducing the water need and dependence whilst maintaining fish production ahmed and turchini 2021 xiao et al 2019 nevertheless to achieve such high standards successful ras must ensure a high efficiency of several sequential processes such as solids removal dissolved pollutants removal oxygenation levels and carbon dioxide removal and lastly when required a disinfection step before water recirculation to the fish tanks ebeling and timmons 2012 while mechanical processes can be easily monitored and controlled the dissolved pollutants biological removal relies on the interaction of microorganisms amongst themselves and the incoming wastewater which greatly influences its efficacy schreier et al 2010 although most recent aquaculture practices limit the use of chemicals in fish farming pharmaceuticals disinfectants and antifoulants are still used dauda et al 2019 that is the case of florfenicol ff a broad spectrum antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the 50s ribosomal subunit zhang et al 2020 it is broadly used in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat infectious diseases due to its efficacy low cost and high potency gao et al 2018 in fact since the 1990s ff has been used in aquaculture farms and currently it is the most used antibiotic as it is one of the few authorized pharmaceuticals for aquatic medical use fernando j sutili and letícia t gressler 2021 a significant antibiotic fraction 70 80 in its active metabolic form often ends up in the surrounding environment posing a threat to those ecosystems reverter et al 2020 indeed the ff antibiotic has been detected in aquatic systems surrounding fish farms at concentrations ranging between μg l 1 to up to mg l 1 zong et al 2010 moreover the antibiotics present in aquaculture effluents can negatively impact the biological treatment units in ras inhibiting organic matter removal nitrification and denitrification processes gao et al 2018 there has been an increasing interest in the use of microalgae for the treatment of saline wastewater and particularly of aquaculture streams due to their high adaptability to different salinities nutrients and contaminants removal efficiency lower greenhouse gas emissions and potential for resource recovery lee and lei 2019 li et al 2019 however the separation of the biomass from the treated effluent represents a bottleneck in such systems microalgae cells small size 3 30 μm low density and negative surface charges greatly contribute to their poor settling characteristics wang et al 2022 granulation of microalgae biomass represents an attractive solution to overcome separation and harvesting issues several studies have focused on the use of specific microalgae strains for the treatment of aquaculture effluents in batch assays many of which aiming at biomass valorization ansari et al 2017 guldhe et al 2017 guo et al 2013 khatoon et al 2016 liu et al 2019 limited studies reported the use of granular biomass microalgae bacterial granular sludge and aerobic granular sludge colonized by microalgae for the bioremediation of such effluents fan et al 2021 rajitha et al 2020 santorio et al 2022 the present study aims to demonstrate the feasibility to form microalgae based granules from a native microbial consortium occurring in coastal aquaculture streams in a photo sequencing reactor and their efficiency in treating coastal aquaculture effluents moreover the effect of the sporadic presence of ff in wastewater on reactor performance and microbial community were elucidated it is anticipated that this work would contribute for the application of microalgae based granules in coastal ras 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae based granules photo sequencing reactor set up the non axenic

characteristics 3 1 1 granules morphology the seed biomass was mainly composed by flocs with a loose structure after 21 days irregularly shaped granules started to appear with floccular and filamentous structures still being observed fig 1 these biomass structural changes were accompanied by an increase of the biomass settling velocity from 0 933 to 9 33m h 1 during the first 21 days from day 41 onwards round regular shaped granules dominated the biomass fig 1 a transition in the aggregate s coloration from light to dark green was also observed the size distribution of biomass particles and granules was monitored regularly fig 2 and classified according to their equivalent diameter deq into flocs 0 08 mm deq 0 2 mm small to intermediate granules 0 2 mm deq 1 5 mm and large granules deq 1 5 mm during phase i minor changes were observed in the floc s percentage 53 to 51 and in small to intermediate granules 47 to 49 while large granules were present in a neglectable number the high percentage of small to intermediate granules on day 0 occurred because the microbial consortium used as inoculum tended to aggregate or form large flocs of filamentous biomass during its cultivation prior to reactor inoculation nevertheless the biomass clearly shows an evolution towards granulation between day 0 and 21 showing less flocs with a loose structure fig 1 from day 41 onwards small to intermediate granules became predominant in the biomass and the number of large granules increased gradually reaching up to 27 of the biomass on day 146 flocs numbers increased again towards the end of reactor operation as biomass showed a more even distribution between the three established deq ranges during phase i as the granulation process occurred the effluent tss and vss contents exhibiting identical values gradually decreased from 0 4 0 01 to 0 02 0 001 g l 1 stabilizing thereafter within a low range of 0 006 0 037 g l 1 fig s1 on the other hand till day 85 the mlss and mlvss concentrations in the reactor increased from 1 3 to 9 1 g l 1 and 1 1 to 7 6 g l 1 stabilizing thereafter even during ff shock loads with average concentrations of 5 5 1 1 g l 1 and 4 4 0 9 g l 1 respectively table s1 in fact during phase iii when mature granules were well established in the reactor the biomass bed height exhibited overall low values ranging between 3 and 5 75 cm but the sporadic presence of ff in the wastewater did not cause major disturbances neither in the effluent s solids contents nor in the bed height fig s1 3 1 2 dynamics of the eps content in biomass throughout operation the eps composition within the granules differed significantly in terms of polysaccharides proteins and pn ps ratio p 0 05 fig 3 the main eps component varied throughout operation as polysaccharides concentration surpassed that of proteins on some days day 0 64 85 126 167 and 188 and the opposite occurred on the remaining analyzed days day 22 41 105 and 147 the eps polysaccharides content increased gradually from day 0 to 64 followed by a sharp increase on day 85 reaching a maximum concentration of 110 32 mg g 1 tss afterwards polysaccharides concentrations decreased significantly until day 147 p 0 05 increasing again towards the end of reactor operation day 167 and 188 a sharp increase of the eps proteins content was observed from day 0 to 22 0 8 0 05 to 38 5 2 6 mg g 1 tss contributing to the drastic rise of pn ps ratio 0 1 0 01 to 2 0 0 17 the maximum proteins concentration in the eps was detected on day 85 ca 70 21 mg g 1 tss after which only minor variations occurred without significant differences p 0 05 even in periods when ff was present in the wastewater despite the maximum concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins being reached on day 85 polysaccharides content had a higher contribution for total eps on that day leading to the lowest mean pn ps ratio of phase iii 0 6 0 01 after day 85 the eps exhibited significant fluctuations in the pn ps ratio p 0 05 3 1 3 dynamics of the pigments content in biomass a pronounced increase of chlorophyll a b and total carotenoids contents in the biomass was observed from day 0 to 64 reaching ca 1546 63 µg mg 1 ts of total pigments sum of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids representing a 23 fold increase fig 4 from day 85 onwards the pigments content stabilized even in periods when ff was present in the wastewater throughout operation chlorophyll a was the predominant pigment produced by the biomass followed by carotenoids and chlorophyll b 3 2 reactor performance and effluent quality 3 2 1 carbon removal high doc removal efficiencies were achieved shortly after the beginning of operation with an average removal of 89 21 and 94 6 during phases i and ii respectively fig 5 a as the doc in the wastewater decreased in phase iii the system maintained its high removal efficiency with minor variations namely during the ff shock loads during which removal efficiencies ranged between 83 and 100 3 2 2 n species and phosphate removal the ammonium removal efficiency fig 5b during phases i ii and early phase iii fluctuated greatly 6 to 94 complete ammonium removal was achieved around day 70 phase iii with small variations in the removal efficiency occurring whenever ff was absent from the wastewater maintaining an ammonium depletion efficiency of ca 93 100 during the four periods when the antibiotic ff was present in the wastewater a decline of the ammonium removal efficiency occurred to 74 78 74 and 70 respectively being reestablished 2 days after the ff feeding ceased nitrate was introduced into the feeding wastewater in phases ii and iii of reactor operation fig 5c the nitrate removal increased considerably during phase ii reaching its maximum efficiency ca 75 subsequently in phase iii nitrate removal fluctuated greatly before and during ff shock loads 13 73 similarly to nitrate nitrite was integrated into the wastewater from phase ii onwards fig 5d on most days a slight nitrite consumption occurred during the aerobic period of the treatment cycle however this removal was not sufficiently expressive leading to higher nitrite levels in the effluent than those in the feeding and to the accumulation of this nitrogen form in the reactor the overall n removal ranged between 93 and 94 during phase i 18 and 79 during phase ii and 4 and 62 during phase iii with the lowest removal being achieved during a ff shock phosphate removal efficiency fluctuated during operation showing low overall removal of this compound and a maximum efficiency of 46 around day 49 fig 5e 3 2 3 dissolved oxygen and ph in the effluent minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations in the reactor bulk liquid were reached during the feeding period of the treatment cycle during which the reactor was non aerated also the antibiotic presence in the wastewater contributed to a slight increase in dissolved oxygen levels as a minimum of 7 4 0 4 mg o2 l 1 in the absence of ff and 8 4 0 4 mg o2 l 1 in the presence of ff were detected fig s2 in phases i ii and iii the ph values during the operational cycles ranged from 7 6 to 8 8 8 2 to 8 5 and 8 4 to 9 2 respectively stabilizing in the last phase whenever the wastewater contained ff no relevant ph variations were detected fig s3 3 3 4 fate of ff during phase iii the reactor biomass was exposed to the intermittent presence of ff in the wastewater for four periods of two consecutive days table 2 shows the mass balance of ff in the reactor the ff removal in each shock load of the antibiotic was low based on the ff deficit observed between its concentration in the wastewater and in the effluent microalgae based granules removed ca 11 4 7 9 and 5 3 mg of ff in the first third and fourth shocks respectively on the other hand ff was released on the second shock given the higher ff content in the effluent 87 1 mg than in the wastewater 79 8 mg on the hplc profiles of the effluent samples no metabolites resulting from ff degradation were detected fig s4 furthermore fluorine ions content in the effluent samples was negligible fig s5 removal of ff due to photodegradation was tested since the presence of nitrate and dissolved organic matter in the medium can affect the ff photolysis and showed to be negligible as the antibiotic was not susceptible to photodegradation within the treatment cycles established fig s6 3 4 evolution of the microbial communities in biomass 3 4 1 microalgae community a total number of 802871 reads were obtained from 10 samples with the vast majority of the asvs 85 affiliated with taxonomic groups other than microalgae microalgae were represented by 13 asvs 712349 reads distributed over 4 different phyla chlorophyta charophyta bacillariophyta and ochrophyta the microalgae community exhibited low diversity shannon index between 0 02 and 0 724 richness 4 to 10 asvs per sample and equitability 0 014 to 0 372 fig s7 the genus chloroidium was predominant in the inoculum ca 99 but its abundance gradually decreased over time reaching a relative abundance lower than 0 1 from day 105 onwards concomitantly an unidentified microalgae species from the chlorophyta phylum not detected in the inoculum was the most abundant taxa from day 22 onwards 61 also an asv assigned to the genus nitzschia was first identified in the biomass on day 167 and its abundance increased towards the end of operation reaching ca 13 on day 188 3 4 2 bacterial community ten samples were sequenced but on day 0 no reads were obtained a total number of 70124 reads was obtained from the remaining 9 samples corresponding to 126 asvs assigned to 8 different bacterial phyla the community diversity shannon index increased gradually until day 126 fig 6 a the presence of ff in the wastewater triggered a decrease of the bacterial diversity showing values ca 13 lower than those on day 126 prior to the first ff shock load the community evenness on the other hand showed a general decrease throughout operation with abrupt reductions upon the feeding with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents phase iii and upon the load of wastewater containing ff the nmds ordination plot fig 6b revealed noticeable changes in the bacterial community structure over time with the distribution of the samples in the plot reflecting the sampling timeline in the later sampling times a greater stability of the communities is noted reflected in a tight clustering between samples from day 147 167 and 188 pseudomonadota was the most abundant phylum in all samples representing on average 59 5 8 8 followed by bacteroidota 23 2 11 9 and planctomycetota 16 6 6 9 these three phyla were present in all samples fig s8 at genus level marinobacter roseovarius pseudomonas an unknown phycisphaeraceae member sm1a02 and an uncultured genus assigned to the saprospiraceae family were present in all samples collected from day 22 to 188 representing together 29 8 to 77 8 of the total bacterial community fig 7 a despite not being detected in all samples members from the thauera muricauda and sphingorhabdus genera represented a large portion of the bacterial community as well particularly in phase iii members of the thauera and muricauda genera were detected from day 41 and 105 onwards reaching 17 5 and 27 0 of the total community on day 188 respectively the sphingorhabdus taxon first observed on day 64 increased its abundance to 10 1 of the total community on day 105 together these three genera reached a maximum relative abundance of 45 8 on day 188 during phase iii the wastewater composition along with the sporadic presence of ff in the wastewater changed the bacterial community taxonomic composition fig 7b upon the introduction of a feeding medium that mimics a coastal aquaculture effluent the relative abundance of several genera increased as it is the case of roseovarius muricauda thaurea sphingorhabdus and paracoccus which relative abundance by the end of operation increased from 1 3 to 21 7 0 to 11 4 2 2 to 9 9 0 to 5 6 and 0 to 0 3 respectively for other community members the opposite occurred with their abundance decreasing considerably namely pseudomonas 15 6 to 0 marinobacter 6 5 to 0 6 and stappia 1 8 to 0 fig s9 the relative abundance of genera roseovarius muricauda and filomicrobium increased from 21 7 to 29 3 11 4 to 22 and 2 8 to 4 6 respectively after the first ff shock load contrarily the relative abundances of unknown genus sm1a02 of the phycisphaeraceae family uncultured genus assigned to the saprospiraceae family ruegeria sphingorhabdus and paracocccus decreased during the same period from 18 3 to 13 0 6 to 0 2 4 2 to 0 4 5 6 to 2 8 and 0 3 to 0 respectively fig s9 statistical analysis t test p 0 05 revealed that eleven asvs showed significantly different relative abundances before and after the ff shock loadings within phase iii in fact the relative abundance of five asvs decreased asvs assigned to genera hyphomonas and thauera families rhizobiaceae and saprospiraceae and order parvibaculales whilst the remaining asvs increased their relative abundancies asvs assigned to genera muricauda and filomicrobium and families balneolaceae rhizobiaceae and parvularculaceae fig 8 4 discussion a microalgae based granular sludge was developed in a photo sequencing reactor and successfully applied to remove carbon and nutrients from coastal aquaculture effluents even when the antibiotic ff was present in those effluents the chemical quality of the treated water would allow recirculation of water back into the fish tanks representing a potential alternative biological treatment system that can be implemented as part of a ras the phototrophic microbial consortium autochthonous to the water streams of a coastal aquaculture facility successfully self granulated within 21 days without the need of any carrier material fig 1 after those 21 days small to intermediate granules 0 2 mm deq 1 5 mm were the predominant biomass form in the reactor nevertheless towards the end of operation day 169 to 188 the abundance of small to intermediate granules and large granules decreased and the abundance of flocs increased fig 2 the upsurge of flocs is often associated with the breakage of large and intermediate granules into smaller granules and fragments oliveira et al 2021 2020 which may be due to the long operational period and or environmental stressors e g the antibiotic ff stable and low biomass bed height and effluents solid tss and vss contents were detected throughout operation a similar trend was reported by santorio et al 2021 that used an aerobic granular sludge system to treat freshwater aquaculture effluents the low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in this kind of effluents induce a metabolic selective pressure only supporting the viability of small biomass portions this low biomass content 5 1 2 2 g mlss l 1 table s1 was indeed sufficient to ensure the efficient treatment of the coastal aquaculture wastewater achieving high removal efficiencies crucial for water recirculation microalgae pigments are indirect biomarkers of cell viability furthermore microalgae demonstrate their adaptation to various stimuli through changes in enzymes hydrocarbon and pigment levels vo et al 2020 in the present study pigments concentrations increased sharply until day 65 stabilizing thereafter even in periods when wastewater contained ff fig 4 these results as well as the granules coloration shift from light to dark green are likely due to an initial microalgae proliferation and subsequent adaptation to the feeding composition granulation process and dynamics of the bacterial community co habiting the granules the eps production increase in the first days of operation is linked to the granulation process and to the biomass higher settleability moreover as pointed out in previous studies a higher relative hydrophobicity is linked to a higher pn ps ratio which in turn is considered a triggering factor for granulation wang et al 2022 indeed a pn ps ratio sharp increase occurred from day 0 to 22 pointing this period as the beginning of the granulation process fig 3 the eps biosynthesis is an intensive energy and resource consuming process inevitably affecting microbial growth and competitiveness of eps producers an et al 2016 a high loaded wastewater was used at the beginning of operation so that microorganisms have enough energy to proliferate and produce eps which could benefit the self aggregation process the stepwise carbon decrease in the feeding could have contributed for the granule s formation and stabilization in the early stages of operation perhaps a start up period to acclimatize the biomass to the operating and feeding conditions is not needed nevertheless further research with low doc in the start up wastewater is needed to confirm this hypothesis members of the flavobacterium brevundimonas and pseudomonas genera and members of the sphingomonadaceae family found in the bacterial community have been identified as eps producers subramanian et al 2010 verhoef et al 2002 weissbrodt et al 2014 like certain bacterial strains microalgae can also produce eps gaignard et al 2018 but the scarce taxonomic information about the microalgae community found in the present study mostly high taxonomic levels assigned makes it difficult to speculate regarding their eps producing capacity interestingly ff shock loads did not significantly disturb the eps production indeed some asvs that proliferated during ff feeding were assigned to eps producers fig 8a such as muricauda han et al 2022 while other eps producers such as hyphomonas quintero et al 1998 and saprospiraceae zhu et al 2022 showed to be susceptible to that stressor fig 8b interestingly some members of the rhizobiaceae family known eps producers alvarez et al 2018 have shown to be susceptible to ff while other members of that family proliferated in the same conditions as reported in previous studies the microbial community diversity and functional redundancy are key factors for the adaptability and resilience of biological systems under stress factors allowing for populations susceptible to stressors e g antibiotics to be replaced by others more adapted to such conditions enabling the community to cooperate in a synergistic way amorim et al 2018 a good chemical and microbiological water quality is of utmost importance for the fish growth and survival since their entire life process depends on the quality of the surrounding environment therefore water quality is determinant for the success of aquaculture productions table 3 shows the ammonium nitrite and nitrate toxicity limits and the dissolved oxygen and ph ideal ranges for brackishwater and marine fish as well as their concentrations in the reactor effluent when fed with wastewater mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents organic carbon and phosphate are not toxic to fish but high concentrations of these compounds can potentiate the growth of bacteria naturally present in aquaculture pond water reducing the dissolved oxygen levels possibly inducing hypoxia health problems and mortality in fish kim et al 2013 in the worst case scenario it can lead to fish pathogens outbreaks the high carbon removal efficiency 83 to 100 even in the presence of ff in the wastewater fig 5a thus contributes to the high quality of the treated water aiming at recirculation in an aquaculture facility contrarily a low and variable phosphate removal efficiency 46 was observed fig 5e although bacteria assigned to the saprospiraceae family frequently abundant in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems nielsen et al 2012 and to pseudomonas genus known denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms he et al 2018 were detected in the biomass throughout operation microalgae can also use phosphorus for growth as an essential element required for making cellular constituents or during a stationary phase through the assimilation and storage of polyphosphate khanzada 2020 the well known redfield s ratio sets the optimal nutrient ratio required for eukaryotic algae growth as 106 16 1 c n p figler et al 2021 when the wastewater mimicked an aquaculture effluent phase iii the c n p ratio was of 9 8 1 7 1 which implies a carbon and nitrogen deficiency furthermore environmental factors such as light osmotic shocks and nutrient availability have been found to hinder intracellular phosphorus accumulation during microalgae stationary phase khanzada 2020 thus the low phosphate removal could have been due to competition between microalgae and bacteria for the available carbon possibly leading to a low activity of phosphorus removing organisms another explanation for the low phosphate removal is linked to the incomplete nitrification process since nitrite levels as low as 2 mg l 1 have been shown to decrease the polyphosphate accumulating organisms activity saito et al 2004 ammonia is the main nitrogenous waste produced by aquatic animals and is highly toxic to fish anusuya et al 2017 aqueous ammonia occurs in equilibrium with ammonium and ph and temperature are major factors influencing their proportions since it is very difficult to directly determine the levels of aqueous ammonia ammonium nitrogen is quantified and ammonia nitrogen concentration is estimated considering the ph and temperature franklin and edward 2019 considering the maximum ph and temperature registered during operation ph 9 2 and 28 7 c fig s3 and the maximum ammonium nitrogen effluent concentration 0 09 mg l 1 a maximum ammonia nitrogen effluent concentration of ca 0 06 mg l 1 was estimated which is below the fish toxicity limits even for the most sensitive species table 3 typically in the presence of multiple nitrogen sources microalgae often prioritize the ammonium consumption as this is the most energetically efficient nitrogen source perez garcia et al 2011 a slight nitrite accumulation in the effluent was observed fig 5d probably caused by the simultaneous ammonium oxidation and nitrate reduction into nitrite by microorganisms in the reactor e g members of the genera paracoccus thauera and denitromonas likely play a role in the latter chen et al 2020 nitrate on the other hand was degraded by the biomass but with a variable removal efficiency 13 73 fig 5c these observations are corroborated by studies by kaplan et al 2000 and huang et al 2015 who noted that the activity of nitrifying bacteria was significantly reduced when exposed to sunlight and that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were more sensitive to sunlight than ammonium oxidizing bacteria possibly due to the disruption of electron transfer from cytochrome c to nitrite reductase in nob aquatic animals are also sensitive to nitrite and nitrate contents in the water but despite the slight nitrite accumulation and the variable nitrate removal efficiency observed in the present study the maximum concentrations of both pollutants were maintained below brackishwater and marine fish toxicity limits table 3 even though the reactor wastewater composition already met the requirements to be recirculated with ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations below fish toxicity limits table 1 and table 3 its continuous recirculation without applying any treatment process would lead to the accumulation of pollutants at levels toxic for the fish therefore the biological treatment with the proposed microalgae based granular sludge could improve even further the water quality theoretically increasing the number of cycles that water could be recycled nevertheless at this point it is not possible to estimate the number of times that water can be recycled as this study does not take into consideration the accumulation of pollutants in the water due to fish metabolism that is dependent on fish species size of the fish tank and number of fish per tank and it does not consider the reactor microbial community response to the variable pollution levels on each water recycling cycle further research needs to be performed to attest if compounds toxic to fish would build up or if the microbial community would adapt over time and remove them to a higher extent dissolved oxygen and ph are also important water quality parameters in aquaculture the ph values in the treated effluent especially in phase iii were considerably higher than advisable table 3 photosynthetic reactions undertaken by microalgae continuously assimilate co2 dissolved in the water rising the ph to values that may not be adequate for fish rearing nevertheless this can be easily corrected to maintain the ph of the recirculation water within ideal values contrarily the dissolved oxygen levels were within the ideal range for fish growth table 3 even exhibiting slightly higher values whenever the ff was present in the wastewater fig s2 probably due to the inhibition of the bacterial activity the dissolved oxygen level is the first limiting factor in intensive aquaculture systems and one of the main energy consumption components in ras badiola et al 2018 a biological treatment system such as the one described in the present study represents an attractive solution in ras since it reduces the need for oxygenation and potentially the aquaculture farm operational costs on the other hand energy costs related to led lights for microalgae survival need to be taken into consideration as well further research and life cycle assessment needs to be conducted to confirm lower operational costs and energy savings of this biological treatment system nevertheless the system is promising for decreasing the water needs and dependence of the land based aquacultures important issues that this industry is facing due to water scarcity although none of the identified microalgae species belongs to the harmful algae bloom species list a thorough evaluation of the presence of toxins should be performed to prevent economic losses linked with fish mortality as well as the transfer of toxins up the food chain microalgae strains such as chlorella sp utex1602 and chlorella sp l38 have been described as able to biodegrade ff at a concentration of 46 mg l 1 97 removal after 20 days song et al 2019 contrarily isochrysis galbana and microcystis flos aqua are highly susceptible to ff at 1 mg l 1 and 50 μg l 1 respectively causing biomass growth and chlorophyll production inhibition as well as oxidative stress in both microalgae species wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 evidently the effect of ff on microalgae growth viability and physiology is strain and dose dependent the microalgae based granular sludge in the present study table 2 partially removed ff in the first third and fourth shock loads most likely due to ff adsorption onto granules degradation or biotransformation of the ff seemed to be unlikely to occur within the timeframe of the treatment cycle as fluorine ions typically released during degradation of fluorinated compounds were almost absent from the effluent fig s5 and no metabolites were detected by the used hplc method furthermore ff effluent release on the second shock highlights that adsorption and desorption phenomena are more likely than biotransformation several studies have demonstrated the adsorption capacity of granules when subjected to recalcitrant pollutants amorim et al 2017 2016 the decreasing trend of the removal capacity from the first to the fourth ff shock load also supports adsorption desorption hypothesis as this is probably linked to saturation of the bonding sites like what was observed in a previous study oliveira et al 2021 further ff removal improvement is required if recirculation is envisaged to prevent its accumulation in the recirculation water and prevent a possible negative impact in the biological treatment microbial community and in the aquaculture fish for instance the bioaugmentation of the biological treatment system with ff degrading strains or even chemical and physical methods using for example magnetic biochar as an adsorbent could be integrated in the treatment system or as part of a sequential treatment system and used whenever antibiotics were used in the aquaculture farm zhao and lang 2018 nevertheless further research needs to be conducted to prove the efficiency of such proposed systems the reactor inoculum was composed by a non axenic well adapted consortium mainly composed by microalgae when the 16s rrna gene was the target region no sequencing results were obtained for the inoculum day 0 probably due to the low numbers of bacterial cells in this sample however after starting reactor operation a bacterial community has developed the microalgae and bacterial communities structure in treatment systems are highly dependent on water quality parameters nutrient ratios and availability ph chemical stressors environmental factors temperature light darkness cycles and physiological aspects intrinsic to the microbial community and its symbiotic relations a dynamic microbial community existed in the granules whose structure was susceptible and adaptable to the changing operational and environmental reactor conditions fig 7a the introduction of feeding conditions mimicking coastal aquaculture effluents phase iii led to the proliferation of known eps producers and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha storing bacteria such as thauera fall et al 2022 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 and paracoccus fall et al 2022 which may have supported granular stability fig 7b interestingly during the transition from phase ii to iii an increase of the relative abundance of a phototrophic bacterial genus roseovarius fig 7b was observed likely as a response to the lowering carbon content in the wastewater and favorable photosynthetic conditions gu and mitchell 2006 however in the same period a population decrease of the nitrifying and possible anammox genus sm1a02 occurred as well as of ruegeria fig 7b often found in ras nitrifying filters chu et al 2015 schreier et al 2010 tian et al 2017 xie et al 2021 considering the nitrification performance nob were likely the most affected nitrifying bacteria since nitrite removal was nearly null major bacterial community structural changes and a clear diversity reduction occurred upon ff shock loads fig 6a the relative abundance of several bacterial asvs probably susceptible to this antibiotic declined considerably namely asvs affiliated with genera hyphomonas and thauera and rhizobiaceae saprospiraceae and parvibaculales families but the relative abundance of other members of thauera increased after ff shocks fig 8 members of this genus have shown to have ff resistance genes and members of the rhizobiaceae family were abundant in the intestinal microbiota of fish fed with ff gupta et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the introduction of ff also led to the thriving of muricauda and filomicrobium genera and rhizobiaceae family fig 8 all identified as antibiotic resistant bacteria in literature gerzova et al 2014 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 proliferation of parvulaculaceae and of members of the recently established balneolaceae family was also observed fig 8 for which there are no literature reports on antibiotic resistance hence the present study provides evidence that these families might have bacterial strains with ff resistance mechanisms microalgae genus nitzschia has also shown to proliferate after ff shocks the susceptibility of certain bacterial strains to ff could have provided advantageous conditions for this microalgae diatom genus increasing its capacity to compete for nutrients in a study performed by molina cárdenas and sánchez saavedra 2017 three nitzschia strains were shown to exert antibacterial activity against pathogenic vibrio species presumably due to production of inhibitory compounds it can be hypothesized that a possible synergistic effect could have occurred between the ff shocks and the nitzschia population increase with both contributing for the bacterial diversity decrease within biomass despite the bacterial diversity reduction and the slight ammonium removal efficiency inhibition from 100 to 70 upon ff presence in the wastewater the removal processes were not disrupted maintaining the chemical quality of the treated effluent uncompromised the proposed biological treatment system has the potential to be applied as part of a ras promoting water recirculation in a coastal aquaculture farm and potentially decreasing the costs associated with water oxygenation as previously stated the microbial diversity and functional redundancy can play a crucial role in biological systems adaptability supporting their ability to withstand adverse conditions and environmental stressors 5 conclusions the present study can be regarded as a proof of concept for the use of an autochthonous self granulating microbial consortium in aquaculture effluent bioremediation processes the main following conclusions were drawn a rapid granulation process occurred ca 21 days supported by increased eps production rendering dense granules microalgae based granular sludge is a robust and efficient biological treatment system to remove carbon and n species from coastal aquaculture streams even in periods of ff shock loads resulting in effluents complying with fish toxicity limits the antibiotic ff was partially removed through sorption but further improvement of ff removal is needed to prevent its accumulation in recirculation water the study emphasizes the implementation potential of such granular systems in coastal aquaculture facilities as an integral part of recirculating aquaculture systems and potentially reducing the farms oxygenation costs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14963,cold seeps with methane rich fluids leaking out of the seafloor usually support massive biomass of chemosynthetic organisms and associated fauna a substantial amount of methane is converted to dissolved inorganic carbon by microbial metabolism and this process also releases dissolved organic matter dom into pore water here pore water samples from haima cold seeps sediments and the non seep reference sediments in the northern south china sea were analyzed for optical properties and molecular compositions of pore water dom our results showed that the relative abundance of protein like dom h cwa and molecular lability boundary percentage mlbl in the seep sediments were significantly higher than those in the reference sediments indicating that more labile dom related to unsaturated aliphatic compounds is produced in the seep sediments spearman s correlation of the fluoresce and molecular data suggested that the humic like components c1 and c2 mainly constituted the refractory compounds cram highly unsaturated and aromatics compounds in contrast the protein like component c3 had high h c ratios featuring high degree of dom lability the amount of s containing formulas chos and chons was greatly elevated in the seep sediments likely caused by abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom in the sulfidic environment although the abiotic sulfurization was proposed to have a stabilizing effect on organic matter our results implied that the biotic sulfurization in the cold seep sediments would increase dom lability overall the labile dom accumulated in the seep sediments is closely linked to methane oxidation which not only support heterotrophic communities and but also likely have an impact on carbon and sulfur cycling in the sediments and the ocean graphical

in the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients burdige 2001 komoda et al 2012 hansell and carlson 2014 in general the properties of pore water dom are mainly influenced by organic matter source microbial communities and redox conditions komoda et al 2004 koch et al 2005 chen et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 dom is released into pore water by depolymerisation and hydrolysis of particulate organic matter pom driven by biological enzyme activity arnosti et al 2011 komoda et al 2013 burdige et al 2016 besides lysis of microbial cells is another source of dom in the sediments middelboe and jorgensen 2006 schmidt et al 2017 elevated chromophoric dom cdom and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations compared to bottom water are often observed in the uppermost few cm of sediments where the mixed redox conditions and fresh organic matter stimulate enhanced microbial activity and enzyme production martin and mccorkle 1993 alperin et al 1994 burdige et al 2004 lahajnar et al 2005 chen et al 2016 globally doc release from marine sediments can supply 0 18 gt c yr 1 to the overlying water roughly equivalent to the riverine doc fluxes burdige et al 1999 thereby likely influencing the properties of doc in the deep ocean methane seeps usually sustain many chemosynthetic communities levin et al 2005 joye et al 2010 joye 2020 feng et al 2021 the critical process consuming methane in the seep sediments is the anaerobic oxidation methane aom ch4 so4 2 hco3 hs h2o which is mainly mediated by methanotrophic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 although most methane is converted to inorganic carbon aom also produces doc reeburgh 2007 pohlman et al 2011 fu et al 2020 hu et al 2021 thus pore water doc in the seep sediments is a mixture of poc and methane derived doc which leads to higher doc concentrations in the seep sediments compared to non seep sediments hung et al 2016 fu et al 2020 amaral et al 2021 valentine et al 2005 found that seep sediments are characterized by 13c and 14c depleted doc and the proportion of methane derived doc increases with enhanced aom intensities and microbial activity based on a mass balance calculation using δ13c and δ14c data methane derived doc can reach 86 of pore water doc in the arctic cold seep sediments fu et al 2020 further pohlman et al 2011 reported that methane derived doc accounted for 28 of doc pool in the overlying water of seep areas suggesting that the fossil methane derived doc may contribute significantly to the pre aged 4000 6400 years b p of doc in the deep ocean optical analysis is an important tool for examining the composition and reactivity of dom coble et al 1996 2007 burdige et al 2004 dittmar and stubbins 2014 chen et al 2016 wagner et al 2020 dom in the seep sediments contains higher fluorescent intensities of protein like and lower humic like components compared to non seep sediments suggesting that aom can significantly affect the composition and lability of dom amaral et al 2021 hu et al 2021 however as the fluorescence fraction cannot fully represent the bulk dom pool examining the molecular compositions of dom is required in order to obtain a complete information on the nature source and fate of pore water dom in fact it has been suggested that the reactivity of dom is determined by its molecular structure and the environmental conditions hedges and keil 1995 schmidt et al 2017 hence as pore water dom represents the intermediate or end products of the biogeochemical reactions in the sediments its molecular characterization would contribute to the understanding of the importance of dom as substrate for benthic microbial organisms and in linking carbon and sulfur cycling in the seep sediments in this study we applied fluorescence spectral and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to investigate the dom compositions in the pore water from the haima cold seeps and non seep sediments in the northern south china sea scs together with the analysis of optical features of dom and concentrations of pore water sulfate so4 2 sulfide hs and doc as well as sedimentary total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total sulfur content ts we aim at obtaining a comprehensive understanding of dom properties in the seep sediments with a focus on i the lability and molecular fingerprints of dom ii the distinct sulfurization process of dom in the seep environment and iii the effect of aom on pore water dom signatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the haima cold seeps are located in the southern part of the qiongdongnan basin which primarily lies in the extensional sector of the northern scs xie et al 2006 the haima cold seeps comprise two active seep sites rov1 and rov2 7 km apart at the water depth of 1400 m fig 1 abundant authigenic carbonates in the forms of nodules and tubular concretions as well as gas hydrates were recovered from the shallow sediments in addition living chemosynthetic communities e g tubeworms mussels and clams and gas ebullition were observed by remotely operated vehicle rov surveys at the two seep sites liang et al 2017 2 2 sampling two gravity cores pc01 and pc02 were retrieved from the haima cold seeps during the r v haiyang 4 cruise in may 2021 fig 1 a reference core s05 was obtained from non seep area using the gravity corer during r v haiyang 6 cruise in october 2019 the recovered cores were immediately brought to the onboard laboratory for pore water extraction the pore water was collected at 6 80 cm intervals using rhizon samplers 0 22 μm connected to 20 ml syringes to avoid contamination by surrounding pore water the 6 80 cm sediment intervals were sliced and stored in sterilized bags before extraction aliquots for dom analysis doc

ms analysis multiple pore water samples of nearby intervals were combined altogether seven samples were acquired two from each of the seep cores and three from the reference core table s1 although the mixed samples can obscure the dom properties of a specific layer it probably has negligible influence on the overall characteristics of dom in the seep sediments the spe dom extraction efficiency by ppl cartridges was estimated to be 39 87 for the pore water in marine sediments schmidt et al 2014 schmdit et al 2017 in this study we assumed a low extraction efficiency 30 value due to restricted spe volumes for determining doc concentrations the dom was concentrated by spe on pre cleaned ppl cartridges according to the method of dittmar et al 2008 the subsequent procedures were detailed in the si 2 6 ft icr ms analysis and data processing dom molecular analysis was performed with the bruker solarix ft icr ms instrument equipped with a 7 0 t superconducting magnet spe dom samples were

murphy et al 2013 these fdom components were matched to previously identified fluorescence material in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 c1 ex em maxima 360 466 nm and c2 ex em maxima 310 400 were matched to several models in the openfluor database and identified as refractory terrestrial humic like component and marine microbial humic like component respectively coble 1996 murphy et al 2014 chen et al 2016 fig 3 c3 ex em maxima 270 306 identified as a labile protein like component was matched to studies focusing on seawater and pore water burdige et al 2004 murphy et al 2014 hu et al 2021 more specifically c3 was assumed to be tyrosine like compounds in various natural environments chen et al 2017 he et al 2022 also the labile protein like component was likely associated with aliphatic hydrocarbons dvorski et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 mirnaghi et al 2019 the sum of relative abundance of refractory humic like components c1 and c2 ranges between 55 and 97 with an average value of 85 for pc01 79 for pc02 and 95 for s05 fig 3 in contrary the overall relative abundances of protein like component at the seep cores 4 to 45 were higher than the reference core 3 to 12 furthermore fi values 1 53 2 08 did not show significant differences between the seep cores and the reference core table s2 hix values in the reference core 0 85 0 94 were higher than those in the seep cores 0 62 0 93 while bix showed similar values in the three cores sr values varied from 0 88 to 25 62 with an average of 3 26 for pc01 4 49 for pc02 and 0 98 for s05 3 3 molecular composition of dom determined by ft icr ms 3 3 1 the inventory of molecular formula in all pore water samples 15 763 formulas were identified in the mass range of 150 800 da compounds containing chon chos chons and cho accounted for 34 6 18 0 26 8 and 19 4 of all the formulas however the number of formulas per dom sample varied significantly the largest number of formulas was found in the reference core s05 3 9083 and the least number of formulas was found in the seep core pc02 1 5779 table 1 in general the seep core dom samples had fewer formulas than the reference core samples with an average of 8760 for s05 n 3 7506 for pc01 n 2 and 6762 for pc02 n 2 besides 2854 molecular formulas were shared by all pore water samples n 7 corresponding to 31 to 49 of formulas per sample the contribution of these shared formulas to total peak intensity per sample ranged between 40 and 74 with higher values for reference core samples 72 74 conversely the individual formulas in seep samples formula number 592 exhibited higher relative intensities 14 35 than the reference samples 5 6 individual formula number 1693 notably the 96 3 formulas are containing s in seep individual formulas which is significant higher than non seep samples 2 7 in the vk diagram the individual formulas of seep samples showed the higher h c than reference samples fig s2 moreover there were marked differences in the distribution of the four formula groups cho chon chos and chons between the seep and reference core samples fig 4 cho and chon formulas are the dominant dom compounds in reference core samples which occupied 27 48 of the total formula number and 35 55 of total formula intensity in contrast the percentages and relative intensities of formulas containing s were remarkably higher in the seep core samples than those in the reference core samples fig 4 although chos formulas only accounted for 24 26 of total number of formulas their relative intensity of peaks can reach nearly 60 in the seep core samples 3 3 2 molecular groups and relevant parameters the molecular formulas of the sedimentary dom in the three cores covered a wide range of h c 0 23 2 25 and o c ratios 0 1 2 and these formulas were divided into different dom compounds based on aimod h c and o c the structures of pore water dom include aliphatic highly unsaturated aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds highly unsaturated and cram compounds were most abundant in all the samples except for the samples of pc01 1 and pc01 2 fig 5 the relative intensities and proportions of formulas of these two groups in the reference samples were higher than in the seep samples fig 5 a similar trend was held for the aromatic and condensed aromatic formulas in contrast the unsaturated aliphatic and peptide compounds i e formulas with low unsaturation and acyclic structure were highly enriched in the seep samples pc01 and pc02 dom samples in the seep cores had relative intensities of unsaturated aliphatic compounds ranging between 27 and 44 and the highest value was observed in pc01 1 sample which is significantly higher than samples in the reference core 6 to 9 the relative intensities of sugar and saturated fatty acid compounds were low in all dom samples ranging from 0 to 3 5 no statistically significant differences in the abundance of these two compounds between the reference and seep samples were observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 dom had elevated weighted average wa h cwa 1 41 to 1 52 and o cwa 0 53 to 0 56 ratios compared to the reference core samples with h cwa of 1 18 1 23 and o cwa of 0 49 0 51 table 1 lower values of weighted average c cwa and n nwa were found in the seep samples cwa 14 55 16 04 nwa 0 31 0 48 compared to the reference core samples cwa 17 45 17 58 nwa 0 60 0 67 in addition dom in the seep cores was characterized by an increased number of s bearing compounds 0 56 swa 1 18 which is five to ten times higher than those in the reference core samples 0 10 swa 0 12 although the dataset in this study was limited to a molecular mass range of 150 800 da the intensity weight average molecular mass mwa showed apparent variations between the reference and seep samples mwa of pore water dom samples in the reference core ranging from 376 to 382 da was higher than that in the seep cores 361 375 da in addition dom in the reference core was generally characterized by more unsaturated compounds showing higher dbewa aimod but lower mlbl 9 13 compared to seep dom samples table 1 the maximum mlbl and minimum dbewa aimodwa were observed in the core pc01 indicating that more labile compounds were produced 3 3 3 relating parafac compounds to molecular formulas the potential linkage of dom molecules to the parafac compounds was established by investigating the relationship between the relative abundances of normalized mass spectral peak intensities of all identified formulas with fluorescent compounds the molecular formulas associated with each parafac component were listed in the supplement utilizing spearman s rank correlations at the 90 confidence limit section 2 6 42 of molecular formulas and 65 of peak intensities were assigned to one or more parafac components thus within the analytical windows of coupled ppl extraction and negative ionization esi ft icr ms it seemed that more than half of dom molecular formulas were characterized by parafac components individual parafac components were estimated to contain 3479 to 5465 formulas 35 of molecular formulas correlated with terrestrial humic like c1 accounted for 61 of total ms peak intensity 22 of molecular formulas correlated with marine microbial humic like c2 accounted for 23 of total ms peak intensity formulas with relative intensities that were positively correlated with relative fluorescence intensities of c1 and c2 r 0 generally had low h c ratios and moderate o c ratios fig 6 these formulas likely represent molecules with aromatic and refractory features and they may contributed directly to the optical properties of c1 and c2 in contrast the negatively correlated formulas with c1 and c2 r 0 displayed the opposite trend with high h c and o c formulas commonly associated with the labile components 25 of molecular formulas tracking protein like c3 accounted for 31 of total peak intensity contrary to the humic like compounds protein like c3 were mainly positively correlated to the unsaturated formulas which had high h c and moderate o c ratios fig 6 3 3 4 principal component analysis of dom composition principal component analysis pca was carried out on all the samples to identify the major factors that may affect dom composition fig 7 the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 72 18 and 17 10 of the variance in dom compositions respectively pca yielded two clusters of regimes that separated the reference core samples and seep core samples reference core and seep core samples have different pc1 values which were significantly correlated with dbewa and h cwa respectively further dom in the reference core samples was characterized by high aromaticity aimod highly unsaturated cram aromatic and the high humification degree hix c1 and c2 in contrast dom in the seep core samples was characterized by high mlbl ts hs and s containing formulas chos chons swa and labile components unsaturated aliphatic peptides and c3 4 discussion 4 1 production of labile dom in the cold seep sediments dom in the marine sediments is typically produced during the pom mineralization process komoda et al 2013 schmidt et al 2014 buridige et al 2016 pore water dom is mainly composed of refractory dom humic like cram and aromatics substances in the deep sea estuarine and nearshore sediments lahajnar et al 2005 chen et al 2015 burdige et al 2016 however in the seep sediments in addition to pom mineralization dom is also associated with microbe mediated methane turnover valentine et al 2005 pohlman et al 2011 fu et al 2020 here in the haima cold seeps the high relative intensity of fluorescent protein like and low humic like relative intensity were observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 fig 3 suggesting enhanced production of labile fdom in the seep sediments than the reference core similar results have been reported at the mud volcanoes in the gulf of cádiz where the protein like components accounted for 70 of total fdom amaral et al 2021 hu et al 2021 also inferred that the labile fluorescence protein like was produced during the anaerobic oxidation of methane aom in addition the low hix values in pc01 and pc02 cores also indicated a lower degree of humification of dom in the seep sediments compared to the reference core where pore water dom was mostly produced by pom mineralization besides the lower dom molecular weight shown by higher values of sr was observed in pc01 and pc02 compared to the reference core table s2 although prior studies suggested that the low molecular weight dom was considered as highly degraded refractory compounds in the continental margin sediments burdige et al 2016 simple low molecular weight compounds such as acetate and taurine produced in the seep sediments can be readily accessible to heterotrophic microbes heuer et al 2009 yang et al 2020 in addition some other proxies derived from ft icr ms analysis further supported the idea of an enhanced production of labile dom in the seep sediments the higher h cwa and mlbl values as well as lower cwa mwa aimod and dbewa values observed in the seep core samples suggested the occurrence of more unsaturated and labile dom with relatively simple molecular structures in the seep sediments compared to the reference core table 1 correspondingly dom in the seep sediments contains less amount of the refractory compounds cram aromatics condensed aromatics and highly unsaturated compounds than in the reference core samples fig 5 also dom in pc01 with more intense methane seepage tended to contain an elevated amount of labile materials dominated by the unsaturated aliphatic component than pc02 with less intense methane seepage fig 5 and table 1 these findings are consistent with previous studies that the high methane partial pressure can promote methane conversion to methyl like substances and short chain low molecular weight labile dom for supporting heterotrophs yang et al 2020 lv et al 2022 therefore we suggest that the labile dom dominated by the unsaturated aliphatic component is likely produced by intense microbial activities associated with methane oxidation processes spearman s rank correlations were performed between normalized mass spectral peak intensities and normalized fluorescence intensities to identify the groups of compounds that are potentially associated with each parafac component 42 of assigned formulas were associated with parafac components n 6573 65 of intensity the van krevenlen plots of molecular formulas associated with each parafac component are shown in fig 6 the number of formulas associated with c1 and c2 was 6537 which accounts for 42 of the assigned formulas and almost covers all formulas related to fluorescent components the number of shared formulas associated with c1 and c2 was 2409 indicating the high similarity between these two fluorescent components the formulas positively correlated with c1 and c2 are characterized by relatively low h c with increased contribution from highly unsaturated compounds cram and aromatics compounds in contrast the formulas negatively correlated with c1 and c2 were mainly distributed in the upper part of vk diagram which represents the labile dom components with high h c although the number of formulas associated with protein like c3 was 4062 which accounts for 26 of total assigned formulas and 31 of the intensity the number of formulas that exhibited positive correlation with c3 was small n 520 the 520 formulas contributed 10 18 peak intensity in the seep samples which was significantly less than the relative fluorescent abundance of c3 4 45 two possibilities may explain the decoupling between fluorescence protein like component and spe dom molecules on the one hand esi is known to be selective which ionizes the molecules that are both polar for retaining the charge and nonpolar for enhancing surface activity dittmar et al 2008 schmidt et al 2014 for example although peptide compounds are present in dom and peptides give multiple charged species during esi multi charged species in esi of dom are uncommon mopper et al 2007 studies have confirmed that using ppl and negative mode esi may have discriminated against n rich compounds dittmar et al 2008 stubbins et al 2014 on the other hand the fluorescent component only partially accounts for the color dom cdom and cannot accurately represent the properties of non color dom coble et al 2007 hansell and carlson 2014 however ft icr ms can provide a comprehensive molecular analysis for spe dom koch et al 2005 qi et al 2022 therefore the decoupling of dom molecules and c3 component may result from the inconsistent expression of optically inactive components e g aliphatic 4 2 formula composition and sulfurization of dom in the seep sediments the molecular diversity of dom is influenced by various physical chemical and biotic processes imposed on the dom molecules the main factors that control the richness of dom formulas are microbial diversity and composition of the substrate utilized via microbial respiration hertkorn et al 2007 schmidt et al 2017 jiao et al 2010 lønborg et al 2020 chen et al 2022 cold seep ecosystem is known for elevated biomass and microbial activity compared to nearby non seep settings but dom in the sediments of haima cold seeps showed lower formula richness 5779 8206 than those in the reference core 8132 9083 this observation may be related to the selective utilization of organic compounds and the limited microbial diversity in the seep sediments seep microbial communities mainly feed on hydrocarbon rather than pom which is mostly composed of complex organic molecules with different sources in addition to the substrate difference the distinct microbial diversity in the seep sediments can also influence the dom molecular compositions in contrast to non seep areas microbial community in the seep sediments exhibits higher densities but less diversity levin 2005 niu et al 2017 2022 sun et al 2022 therefore dom produced via methane turnover by distinct seep microbial with less diversity may explain the observation of fewer dom formulas in the seep sediments the percentages and relative intensities of formulas containing s chos and chons were significantly higher in the seep samples than in the reference samples fig 4 abiotic sulfurization of organic matter usually occurs during early diagenesis through the reaction of polysulfide and bisulfide on cc double bonds and oxo groups sinninghe damsté and de leeuw 1990 werne et al 2008 raven et al 2015 abdulla et al 2020 schmidt et al 2017 suggested that hs produced by microbial sulfate reduction is the major source for the s bearing dom compounds as reflected by an increase in the relative abundance of chos compounds in general seep sediments are characterized by anoxic and sulfidic conditions due to intense aom feng et al 2018 suess 2020 the higher hs and ts contents higher relative intensity of sulfur containing compounds chos and chons and elevated swa values observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 are likely associated with the abiotic sulfurization of dom however in addition to the abiotic process s containing organic compounds are likely to be produced through microbial metabolism it is inferred that abiotic sulfurization of dom tends to form n depleted molecules schmidt et al 2009 pohlabeln 2015 but a substantial number of formulas containing chons were observed in our seep samples fig 4 implying the close linkage between s bearing compounds and microbial metabolites that usually contain nitrogen besides the lower molecular weight of dom featuring the seep sediments may also indicate the presence of microbe mediated dom sulfurization as the abiotic sulfurization process tends to increase the molecular mass schmidt et al 2017 also certain seep microbial species e g cupriavidus and ralstonia have been shown to be capable of degrading alkanesulfonate and taurine to sulfite which is further reduced to sulfide and cysteine lv et al 2022 moreover studies suggested that the assimilatory sulfate reduction represents a source of sedimentary organic sulfur because organic sulfur components e g methionine and cysteine can be biosynthesized through microbe mediated sulfate reduction kim and gadd 2008 thus we propose that the s containing components produced by microbial metabolic processes are also an important source of dos in the seep sediments it is suggested that organic matter sulfurization reaction substantially enhanced long term carbon storage in the anoxic sediments by protecting organic compounds from being microbially degraded sinninghe damsté and de leeuw 1990 wakeham et al 1995 kok et al 2000 schmidt et al 2017 indeed suominen et al 2022 showed that the majority of s containing formulas were refractory dom in the black sea water column which is consistent with the perception that the sulfurization processes that served to enhance organic matter preservation raven et al 2021 in contrast our analysis revealed that the dom with higher s c ratios in the seep samples exhibited elevated lability as indicated by the higher mlbl values the average contribution of molecular formulas in the seep dom dataset bearing at least one s atom to the overall sample intensities was 64 when only the relative contributions included in the mlbl h c 1 5 were considered molecular formulas containing s contributed more than 90 fig s3 thus s containing molecular formulas are disproportionally coupled with the labile dom pool likewise the dom pool showed a high bioavailable level in the anoxic deep groundwater of the fennoscandian shield and the s containing formulas constitute an important proportion of labile dom pool osterholz et al 2022 furthermore the formulas containing s in the seep samples contributed to about 90 of the intensity in unsaturated aliphatic compounds but only accounted for 0 59 of the intensity in refractory components cram highly unsaturated aromatics and condensed aromatics compounds fig 8 note that higher relative intensity of s containing formulas in condensed aromatics of s05 3 than those of s05 1 and s05 2 was observed which may be caused by the accumulation of refractory s containing condensed aromatics with depth these observations also suggest the preferential association of s with the labile compounds in contrast to the abiotic sulfurization process that is generally unselective in term of the precursor compounds chemical properties hence both abiotic and biotic reactions can contribute to the sulfurization of dom in the seep sediments and biotic sulfurization may serve to increase the lability of dom 4 3 conceptual model of dom cycling in the seep sediments the chemosynthetic microbial communities inhabiting the cold seeps mainly reply on methane as carbon and energy sources niemann et al 2006 knittel et al 2009 in addition to the chemosynthetic microbial communities different species of heterotrophic microorganisms also exist in cold seeps lee et al 2013 cui et al 2019 these heterotrophic microorganisms can feed on low molecular weight labile organic acid e g acetate produced during aom as reflected by the genomic and enzymatic evidence for acetogenesis by anme in the seep sediments yang et al 2020 lv et al 2022 consistent with these microbial studies our optical and ft icr ms analysis of dom confirmed an enhanced production of relatively labile and low molecular weight compounds associated with methane cycling in the seep sediments intensive studies on the sulfur cycling in the seep sediments mostly hinged on the transformation and fate of the inorganic sulfur species related to aom e g h2s pyrite e g peckmann and thiel 2004 gong et al 2018 suess 2020 their organic counterparts received much less attention it has been shown that protein synthesis incorporates sulfur and subsequent cell lysis could release labile s containing components cuhel et al 1984 jiao et al 2010 our analyses of the pore water dom in the haima cold seeps suggested the presence of both abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom and selective binding of s to the labile dom compounds by biotic sulfurization process in the seep sediments therefore we speculate that aom process not only produces sulfide but also low molecular weight labile s bearing organic compounds as reflected by the occurrence of a large proportion of s containing formulas associated with the labile compounds figs 8 9 dos acts as the largest pool of organic sulfur in the ocean 6 7 pg s with the dominant source from the benthic dos flux due to the abiotic sulfurization of dom in the sediments ksionzek et al 2016 pohlabeln et al 2017 sulfur can thereby be incorporated into different types of dom compounds and result in high dos concentrations in sulfidic sediments sleighter et al 2014 gomez saez et al 2016 although dos concentrations were not quantified a substantially greater amount of s containing compounds were observed in the seep sediments compared to the reference sediments which may be an important supply of dos to the overlying seawater in addition we also show that the biotic dos produced by microbial assimilation of sulfate likely contributed to the production of labile dom thereby sustaining the seep communities fig 9 therefore when the labile dos is released into the overlying seawater it could also be utilized by microorganisms and potentially impact the oceanic sulfur cycle 5 conclusion this is the first study that unraveled the imprints of aom in the molecular compositions of pore water dom in the seep sediments combining optical ft icr ms and other geochemical analyses of pore water dom from the seep and reference sediments three conclusions were drawn as follows 1 seep sediments are characterized by an elevated amount of labile dom compounds compared to the reference sediments based on the spectral and ft icr ms parameters protein like hix and mlbl the lability of dom in the seep sediments is mostly attributed to the unsaturated aliphatic components molecular formulas with low h c ratios constitute the refractory compounds cram highly unsaturated and aromatics compounds and are positively correlated to the refractory fluorescent components c1 and c2 molecular formulas with high h c ratios represent the labile compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds and peptides and are positively correlated to the fluorescence protein like component c3 2 the lower formula richness observed in the seep sediments than in the reference sediments can be ascribed to variations in types of substrates utilized by microorganisms and in the diversity of microbial community between these two distinct environments notably the average number of formulas containing s chos and chons was significantly greater in the seep sediments resulting from the abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom although the abiotic sulfurization of organic matter is inferred to be capable of stabilizing organic matter the biotic sulfurization process likely serves to improve the lability of dom 3 the underlying mechanism of the production of labile s containing dom is yet to be explored by laboratory experiments however we highlight that the relatively labile dom produced in the seep sediments could not only contribute to sustaining the heterotrophic communities but also likely have a critical

14963,cold seeps with methane rich fluids leaking out of the seafloor usually support massive biomass of chemosynthetic organisms and associated fauna a substantial amount of methane is converted to dissolved inorganic carbon by microbial metabolism and this process also releases dissolved organic matter dom into pore water here pore water samples from haima cold seeps sediments and the non seep reference sediments in the northern south china sea were analyzed for optical properties and molecular compositions of pore water dom our results showed that the relative abundance of protein like dom h cwa and molecular lability boundary percentage mlbl in the seep sediments were significantly higher than those in the reference sediments indicating that more labile dom related to unsaturated aliphatic compounds is produced in the seep sediments spearman s correlation of the fluoresce and molecular data suggested that the humic like components c1 and c2 mainly constituted the refractory compounds cram highly unsaturated and aromatics compounds in contrast the protein like component c3 had high h c ratios featuring high degree of dom lability the amount of s containing formulas chos and chons was greatly elevated in the seep sediments likely caused by abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom in the sulfidic environment although the abiotic sulfurization was proposed to have a stabilizing effect on organic matter our results implied that the biotic sulfurization in the cold seep sediments would increase dom lability overall the labile dom accumulated in the seep sediments is closely linked to methane oxidation which not only support heterotrophic communities and but also likely have an impact on carbon and sulfur cycling in the sediments and the ocean graphical

in the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients burdige 2001 komoda et al 2012 hansell and carlson 2014 in general the properties of pore water dom are mainly influenced by organic matter

the mixed redox conditions and fresh organic matter stimulate enhanced microbial activity and enzyme production martin and mccorkle 1993 alperin et al 1994 burdige et al 2004 lahajnar et al 2005 chen et al 2016 globally doc release from marine sediments can supply 0 18 gt c yr 1 to the overlying water roughly equivalent to the riverine doc fluxes burdige et al 1999 thereby likely influencing the properties of doc in the deep ocean methane seeps usually sustain many chemosynthetic communities levin et al 2005 joye et al 2010 joye 2020 feng et al 2021 the critical process consuming methane in the seep sediments is the anaerobic oxidation methane aom ch4 so4 2 hco3 hs h2o which is mainly mediated by methanotrophic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria boetius et al 2000 although most methane is converted to inorganic carbon aom also produces doc reeburgh 2007 pohlman et al 2011 fu et al 2020 hu et al 2021 thus pore water doc in the seep sediments is a mixture of poc and methane derived doc which leads to higher doc concentrations in the seep sediments compared to non seep sediments hung et al 2016 fu et al 2020 amaral et al 2021 valentine et al 2005 found that seep sediments are characterized by 13c and 14c depleted doc and the proportion of methane derived doc increases with enhanced aom intensities and microbial activity based on a mass balance calculation using δ13c and δ14c data methane derived doc can reach 86 of pore water doc in the arctic cold seep sediments fu et al 2020 further pohlman et al 2011 reported that methane derived doc accounted for 28 of doc pool in the overlying water of seep areas suggesting that the fossil methane derived doc may contribute significantly to the pre aged 4000 6400 years b p of doc in the deep ocean optical analysis is an important tool for examining the composition and reactivity of dom coble et al 1996 2007 burdige et al 2004 dittmar and stubbins 2014 chen et al 2016 wagner et al 2020 dom in the seep sediments contains higher fluorescent intensities of protein like and lower humic like components compared to non seep sediments suggesting that aom can significantly affect the composition and lability of dom amaral et al 2021 hu et al 2021 however as the fluorescence fraction cannot fully represent the bulk dom pool examining the molecular compositions of dom is required in order to obtain a complete information on the nature source and fate of pore water dom in fact it has been suggested that the reactivity of dom is determined by its molecular structure and the environmental conditions hedges and keil 1995 schmidt et al 2017 hence as pore water dom represents the intermediate or end products of the biogeochemical reactions in the sediments its molecular characterization would contribute to the understanding of the importance of dom as substrate for benthic microbial organisms and in linking carbon and sulfur cycling in the seep sediments in this study we applied fluorescence spectral and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to investigate the dom compositions in the pore water from the haima cold seeps and non seep sediments in the northern south china sea scs together with the analysis of optical features of dom and concentrations of pore water sulfate so4 2 sulfide hs and doc as well as sedimentary total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total sulfur content ts we aim at obtaining a comprehensive understanding of dom properties in the seep sediments with a focus on i the lability and molecular fingerprints of dom ii the distinct sulfurization process of dom in the seep environment and iii the effect of aom on pore water dom signatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the haima cold seeps are located in the southern part of the qiongdongnan basin which primarily lies in the extensional sector of the northern scs xie et al 2006 the haima cold seeps comprise two active seep sites rov1 and rov2 7 km apart at the water depth of 1400 m fig 1 abundant authigenic carbonates in the forms of nodules and tubular concretions as well as gas hydrates were recovered from the shallow sediments in addition living chemosynthetic communities e g tubeworms mussels and clams and gas ebullition were observed by remotely operated vehicle rov surveys at the two seep sites liang et al 2017 2 2 sampling two gravity cores pc01 and pc02 were retrieved from the haima cold seeps during the r v haiyang 4 cruise in may 2021 fig 1 a reference core s05 was obtained from non seep area using the gravity corer during r v haiyang 6 cruise in october 2019 the recovered cores were immediately brought to the onboard laboratory for pore water extraction the pore water was collected at 6 80 cm intervals using rhizon samplers 0 22 μm connected to 20 ml syringes to avoid contamination by surrounding pore water the 6 80 cm sediment intervals were sliced and stored in sterilized bags before extraction aliquots for dom analysis doc concentration optical properties and ft icr ms were stored in pre combusted 550 for 4 h 20 ml brown glass bottles sealed with teflon lined cap and frozen at 20 until analysis the aliquot for so4 2 measurement was acidified with hno3 and stored at 4 the aliquot for hs analysis was fixed with znac immediately after sampling and preserved at 4 after pore water collection the sediment samples were frozen at 20 2 3 bulk sediment analyses toc tn and ts contents of sediments were analyzed using a thermo scientific flash 2000 elemental analyzer at shanghai ocean university replicated and standard samples were used for quality control with a relative uncertainty of 1 first sediment samples were grinded using a mortar and pestle after freeze dried and then stored in a desiccator approximately 2 g of the sediment powder was acidified by 10 hcl for 12 h to remove inorganic carbon and thoroughly washed three times with deionized water centrifuged and finally freeze dried approximately 40 mg of the dried samples was weighted into tin cups and analyzed for toc tn and ts contents 2 4 pore water chemistry 2 4 1 measurement of so4 2 hs and doc concentrations the so4 2 concentrations were determined using dionex ics 900 ion chromatograph after a 500 fold dilution with deionized water a mixed solution of nahco3 and na2co3 was used as eluent for so4 2 concentration measurements the analytical precision for so4 2 is less than 2 hs concentrations were determined by methylene blue spectrophotometry cline et al 1969 and the analytical precision is less than 5 doc concentrations were analyzed by high temperature catalytic oxidation method using shimadzu toc analyzer with the analytical precision of 3 determined using the standard deep seawater from hansell laboratory university of

ms analysis multiple pore water samples of nearby intervals were combined altogether seven samples were acquired two from each of the seep cores and three from the reference core table s1 although the mixed samples can obscure the dom properties of a specific layer it probably has negligible influence on the overall characteristics of dom in the seep sediments the spe dom extraction efficiency by ppl cartridges was estimated to be 39 87 for the pore water in marine sediments schmidt et al 2014 schmdit et al 2017 in this study we assumed a low extraction efficiency 30 value due to restricted spe volumes for determining doc concentrations the dom was concentrated by spe on pre cleaned ppl cartridges according to the method of dittmar et al 2008 the subsequent procedures were detailed in the si 2 6 ft icr ms analysis and data processing dom molecular analysis was performed with the bruker solarix ft icr ms instrument equipped with a 7 0 t superconducting magnet spe dom samples were analyzed with the electrospray ionization source esi in negative ion mode after dilution in 1 1 methanol mili q water to a final doc concentration of 50 100 mg c l prepared samples were infused into the unit at the flow rate of 150 µl h 1 with capillary voltage of 5 kv spectra mass limits were shown at mass to charge m z values of 150 and 800 da respectively 256 scans were averaged per spectrum with 4 m transient of data control blanks were analyzed using the same procedure the mass spectra were internally recalibrated using the dataanalysis ver 5 0 bruker daltonics the scan mass spectra were calibrated using a series of homologous compounds through the m z range molecular formulas assignment in the mass range from 150 to 800 da was achieved under the consideration of the following elements 12c 1 60 1h 2 120 16o 0 30 14n 0 3 32s 0 2 and an error threshold of 1 ppm besides formulas were restricted to a molecular element ratio of h c 2 25 o c 1 2 the molecular formulas were grouped into cho chon chos and chons compounds based on their elemental compositions these formulas were assigned to structural categories using their structural information deduced from the values of double bond equivalent dbe and aromaticity index of the formula the modified aromaticity index aimod particularly for natural organic matter consisting of c h o n s was applied koch and dittmar 2016 schmidt et al 2017 aimod estimates a compound s degree of aromaticity under the assumption that half of the o is bound to the double bonds and the aimod values were calculated as follows 1 a i mod 1 c

downcore profiles of so4 2 hs doc toc tn and ts the downcore variations in concentrations of so4 2 and hs were shown in fig 2 in the seep core pc01 so4 2 concentrations declined rapidly with depth and were depleted at the sulfate methane transition zone smtz of 2 mbsf in the other seep core pc02 so4 2 concentrations showed a slight decrease in the upper 2 5 mbsf followed by a sharp decrease to depletion at the smtz of 5 mbsf in contrast so4 2 concentrations decreased gently with depth throughout the reference core s05 the hs concentration profiles generally mirrored those of so4 2 profiles in the two seep cores in the reference core hs concentrations were below the detection limit doc concentrations generally exhibited downcore increasing trends at the three cores with the highest average doc concentration at pc01 1 7 mm and shallowest smtz fig 2 the depth profiles of toc tn and ts contents are shown in fig s1 toc contents of three cores varied from 0 81 to 2 23 with an average

ranging from 6 to 18 with an average of 14 n 22 for pc01 12 n 16 for pc02 and 8 n 14 for s05 the average ts contents in the seep cores 0 74 for pc01 and 0 85 for pc02 were significantly higher compared to the reference core 0 29 for s05 3 2 optical properties of dom three fluorescent components c1 c3 were obtained by the excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac model murphy et al 2013 these fdom components were matched to previously identified fluorescence material in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 c1 ex em maxima 360 466 nm and c2 ex em maxima 310 400 were matched to several models in the openfluor database and identified as refractory terrestrial humic like component and marine microbial humic like component respectively coble 1996 murphy et al 2014 chen et al 2016 fig 3 c3 ex em maxima 270 306 identified as a labile protein like component was matched to studies focusing on seawater and pore water burdige et al 2004 murphy et al 2014 hu et al 2021 more specifically c3 was assumed to be tyrosine like compounds in various natural environments chen et al 2017 he et al 2022 also the labile protein like component was likely associated with aliphatic hydrocarbons dvorski et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 mirnaghi et al 2019 the sum of relative abundance of refractory humic like components c1 and c2 ranges between 55 and 97 with an average value of 85 for pc01 79 for pc02 and 95 for s05 fig 3 in contrary the overall relative abundances of protein like component at the seep cores 4 to 45 were higher than the reference core 3 to 12 furthermore fi values 1 53 2 08 did not show significant differences between the seep cores and the reference core table s2 hix values in the reference core 0 85 0 94 were higher than those in the seep cores 0 62 0 93 while bix showed similar values in the three cores sr values varied from 0 88 to 25 62 with an average of 3 26 for pc01 4 49 for pc02 and 0 98 for s05 3 3 molecular composition of dom determined by ft icr ms 3 3 1 the inventory of molecular formula in all pore water samples 15 763 formulas were identified in the mass range of 150 800 da compounds containing chon chos chons and cho accounted for 34 6 18 0 26 8 and 19 4 of all the formulas however the number of formulas per dom sample varied significantly the largest number of formulas was found in the reference core s05 3 9083 and the least number of formulas was found in the seep core pc02 1 5779 table 1 in general the seep core dom samples had fewer formulas than the reference core samples with an average of 8760 for s05 n 3 7506 for pc01 n 2 and 6762 for pc02 n 2 besides 2854 molecular formulas were shared by all pore water samples n 7 corresponding to 31 to 49 of formulas per sample the contribution of these shared formulas to total peak intensity per sample ranged between 40 and 74 with higher values for reference core samples 72 74 conversely the individual formulas in seep samples formula number 592 exhibited higher relative intensities 14 35 than the reference samples 5 6 individual formula number 1693 notably the 96 3 formulas are containing s in seep individual formulas which is significant higher than non seep samples 2 7 in the vk diagram the individual formulas of seep samples showed the higher h c than reference samples fig s2 moreover there were marked differences in the distribution of the four formula groups cho chon chos and chons between the seep and reference core samples fig 4 cho and chon formulas are the dominant dom compounds in reference core samples which occupied 27 48 of the total formula number and 35 55 of total formula intensity in contrast the percentages and relative intensities of formulas containing s were remarkably higher in the seep core samples than those in the reference core samples fig 4 although chos formulas only accounted for 24 26 of total number of formulas their relative intensity of peaks can reach nearly 60 in the seep core samples 3 3 2 molecular groups and relevant parameters the molecular formulas of the sedimentary dom in the three cores covered a wide range of h c 0 23 2 25 and o c ratios 0 1 2 and these formulas were divided into different dom compounds based on aimod h c and o c the structures of pore water dom include aliphatic highly unsaturated aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds highly unsaturated and cram compounds were most abundant in all the samples except for the samples of pc01 1 and pc01 2 fig 5 the relative intensities and proportions of formulas of these two groups in the reference samples were higher than in the seep samples fig 5 a similar trend was held for the aromatic and condensed aromatic formulas in contrast the unsaturated aliphatic and peptide compounds i e formulas with low unsaturation and acyclic structure were highly enriched in the seep samples pc01 and pc02 dom samples in the seep cores had relative intensities of unsaturated aliphatic compounds ranging between 27 and 44 and the highest value was observed in pc01 1 sample which is significantly higher than samples in the reference core 6 to 9 the relative intensities of sugar and saturated fatty acid compounds were low in all dom samples ranging from 0 to 3 5 no statistically significant differences in the abundance of these two compounds between the reference and seep samples were observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 dom had elevated weighted average wa h cwa 1 41 to 1 52 and o cwa 0 53 to 0 56 ratios compared to the reference core samples with h cwa of 1 18 1 23 and o cwa of 0 49 0 51 table 1 lower values of weighted average c cwa and n nwa were found in the seep samples cwa 14 55 16 04 nwa 0 31 0 48 compared to the reference core samples cwa 17 45 17 58 nwa 0 60 0 67 in addition dom in the seep cores was characterized by an increased number of s bearing compounds 0 56 swa 1 18 which is five to ten times higher than those in the reference core samples 0 10 swa 0 12 although the dataset in this study was limited to a molecular mass range of 150 800 da the intensity weight average molecular mass mwa showed apparent variations between the reference and seep samples mwa of pore water dom samples in the reference core ranging from 376 to 382 da was higher than that in the seep cores 361 375 da in addition dom in the reference core was generally characterized by more unsaturated compounds showing higher dbewa aimod but lower mlbl 9 13 compared to seep dom samples table 1 the maximum mlbl and minimum dbewa aimodwa were observed in the core pc01 indicating that more labile compounds were produced 3 3 3 relating parafac compounds to molecular formulas the potential linkage of dom molecules to the parafac compounds was established by investigating the relationship between the relative abundances of normalized mass spectral peak intensities of all identified formulas with fluorescent compounds the molecular formulas associated with each parafac component were listed in the supplement utilizing spearman s rank correlations at the 90 confidence limit section 2 6 42 of molecular formulas and 65 of peak intensities were assigned to one or more parafac components thus within the analytical windows of coupled ppl extraction and negative ionization esi ft icr ms it seemed that more than half of dom molecular formulas were characterized by parafac components individual parafac components were estimated to contain 3479 to 5465 formulas 35 of molecular formulas correlated with terrestrial humic like c1 accounted for 61 of total ms peak intensity 22 of molecular formulas correlated with marine microbial humic like c2 accounted for 23 of total ms peak intensity formulas with relative intensities that were positively correlated with relative fluorescence intensities of c1 and c2 r 0 generally had low h c ratios and moderate o c ratios fig 6 these formulas likely represent molecules with aromatic and refractory features and they may contributed directly to the optical properties of c1 and c2 in contrast the negatively correlated formulas with c1 and c2 r 0 displayed the opposite trend with high h c and o c formulas commonly associated with the labile components 25 of molecular formulas tracking protein like c3 accounted for 31 of total peak intensity contrary to the humic like compounds protein like c3 were mainly positively correlated to the unsaturated formulas which had high h c and moderate o c ratios fig 6 3 3 4 principal component analysis of dom composition principal component analysis pca was carried out on all the samples to identify the major factors that may affect dom composition fig 7 the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 72 18 and 17 10 of the variance in dom compositions respectively pca yielded two clusters of regimes that separated the reference core samples and seep core samples reference core and seep core samples have different pc1 values which were significantly correlated with dbewa and h cwa respectively further dom in the reference core samples was characterized by high aromaticity aimod highly unsaturated cram aromatic and the high humification degree hix c1 and c2 in contrast dom in the seep core samples was characterized by high mlbl ts hs and s containing formulas chos chons swa and labile components unsaturated aliphatic peptides and c3 4 discussion 4 1 production of labile dom in the cold seep sediments dom in the marine sediments is typically produced during the pom mineralization process komoda et al 2013 schmidt et al 2014 buridige et al 2016 pore water dom is mainly composed of refractory dom humic like cram and aromatics substances in the deep sea estuarine and nearshore sediments lahajnar et al 2005 chen et al 2015 burdige et al 2016 however in the seep sediments in addition to pom mineralization dom is also associated with microbe mediated methane turnover valentine et al 2005 pohlman et al 2011 fu et al 2020 here in the haima cold seeps the high relative intensity of fluorescent protein like and low humic like relative intensity were observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 fig 3 suggesting enhanced production of labile fdom in the seep sediments than the reference core similar results have been reported at the mud volcanoes in the gulf of cádiz where the protein like components accounted for 70 of total fdom amaral et al 2021 hu et al 2021 also inferred that the labile fluorescence protein like was produced during the anaerobic oxidation of methane aom in addition the low hix values in pc01 and pc02 cores also indicated a lower degree of humification of dom in the seep sediments compared to the reference core where pore water dom was mostly produced by pom mineralization besides the lower dom molecular weight shown by higher values of sr was observed in pc01 and pc02 compared to the reference core table s2 although prior studies suggested that the low molecular weight dom was considered as highly degraded refractory compounds in the continental margin sediments burdige et al 2016 simple low molecular weight compounds such as acetate and taurine produced in the seep sediments can be readily accessible to heterotrophic microbes heuer et al 2009 yang et al 2020 in addition some other proxies derived from ft icr ms analysis further supported the idea of an enhanced production of labile dom in the seep sediments the higher h cwa and mlbl values as well as lower cwa mwa aimod and dbewa values observed in the seep core samples suggested the occurrence of more unsaturated and labile dom with relatively simple molecular structures in the seep sediments compared to the reference core table 1 correspondingly dom in the seep sediments contains less amount of the refractory compounds cram aromatics condensed aromatics and highly unsaturated compounds than in the reference core samples fig 5 also dom in pc01 with more intense methane seepage tended to contain an elevated amount of labile materials dominated by the unsaturated aliphatic component than pc02 with less intense methane seepage fig 5 and table 1 these findings are consistent with previous studies that the high methane partial pressure can promote methane conversion to methyl like substances and short chain low molecular weight labile dom for supporting heterotrophs yang et al 2020 lv et al 2022 therefore we suggest that the labile dom dominated by the unsaturated aliphatic component is likely produced by intense microbial activities associated with methane oxidation processes spearman s rank correlations were performed between normalized mass spectral peak intensities and normalized fluorescence intensities to identify the groups of compounds that are potentially associated with each parafac component 42 of assigned formulas were associated with parafac components n 6573 65 of intensity the van krevenlen plots of molecular formulas associated with each parafac component are shown in fig 6 the number of formulas associated with c1 and c2 was 6537 which accounts for 42 of the assigned formulas and almost covers all formulas related to fluorescent components the number of shared formulas associated with c1 and c2 was 2409 indicating the high similarity between these two fluorescent components the formulas positively correlated with c1 and c2 are characterized by relatively low h c with increased contribution from highly unsaturated compounds cram and aromatics compounds in contrast the formulas negatively correlated with c1 and c2 were mainly distributed in the upper part of vk diagram which represents the labile dom components with high h c although the number of formulas associated with protein like c3 was 4062 which accounts for 26 of total assigned formulas and 31 of the intensity the number of formulas that exhibited positive correlation with c3 was small n 520 the 520 formulas contributed 10 18 peak intensity in the seep samples which was significantly less than the relative fluorescent abundance of c3 4 45 two possibilities may explain the decoupling between fluorescence protein like component and spe dom molecules on the one hand esi is known to be selective which ionizes the molecules that are both polar for retaining the charge and nonpolar for enhancing surface activity dittmar et al 2008 schmidt et al 2014 for example although peptide compounds are present in dom and peptides give multiple charged species during esi multi charged species in esi of dom are uncommon mopper et al 2007 studies have confirmed that using ppl and negative mode esi may have discriminated against n rich compounds dittmar et al 2008 stubbins et al 2014 on the other hand the fluorescent component only partially accounts for the color dom cdom and cannot accurately represent the properties of non color dom coble et al 2007 hansell and carlson 2014 however ft icr ms can provide a comprehensive molecular analysis for spe dom koch et al 2005 qi et al 2022 therefore the decoupling of dom molecules and c3 component may result from the inconsistent expression of optically inactive components e g aliphatic 4 2 formula composition and sulfurization of dom in the seep sediments the molecular diversity of dom is influenced by various physical chemical and biotic processes imposed on the dom molecules the main factors that control the richness of dom formulas are microbial diversity and composition of the substrate utilized via microbial respiration hertkorn et al 2007 schmidt et al 2017 jiao et al 2010 lønborg et al 2020 chen et al 2022 cold seep ecosystem is known for elevated biomass and microbial activity compared to nearby non seep settings but dom in the sediments of haima cold seeps showed lower formula richness 5779 8206 than those in the reference core 8132 9083 this observation may be related to the selective utilization of organic compounds and the limited microbial diversity in the seep sediments seep microbial communities mainly feed on hydrocarbon rather than pom which is mostly composed of complex organic molecules with different sources in addition to the substrate difference the distinct microbial diversity in the seep sediments can also influence the dom molecular compositions in contrast to non seep areas microbial community in the seep sediments exhibits higher densities but less diversity levin 2005 niu et al 2017 2022 sun et al 2022 therefore dom produced via methane turnover by distinct seep microbial with less diversity may explain the observation of fewer dom formulas in the seep sediments the percentages and relative intensities of formulas containing s chos and chons were significantly higher in the seep samples than in the reference samples fig 4 abiotic sulfurization of organic matter usually occurs during early diagenesis through the reaction of polysulfide and bisulfide on cc double bonds and oxo groups sinninghe damsté and de leeuw 1990 werne et al 2008 raven et al 2015 abdulla et al 2020 schmidt et al 2017 suggested that hs produced by microbial sulfate reduction is the major source for the s bearing dom compounds as reflected by an increase in the relative abundance of chos compounds in general seep sediments are characterized by anoxic and sulfidic conditions due to intense aom feng et al 2018 suess 2020 the higher hs and ts contents higher relative intensity of sulfur containing compounds chos and chons and elevated swa values observed in the seep cores pc01 and pc02 are likely associated with the abiotic sulfurization of dom however in addition to the abiotic process s containing organic compounds are likely to be produced through microbial metabolism it is inferred that abiotic sulfurization of dom tends to form n depleted molecules schmidt et al 2009 pohlabeln 2015 but a substantial number of formulas containing chons were observed in our seep samples fig 4 implying the close linkage between s bearing compounds and microbial metabolites that usually contain nitrogen besides the lower molecular weight of dom featuring the seep sediments may also indicate the presence of microbe mediated dom sulfurization as the abiotic sulfurization process tends to increase the molecular mass schmidt et al 2017 also certain seep microbial species e g cupriavidus and ralstonia have been shown to be capable of degrading alkanesulfonate and taurine to sulfite which is further reduced to sulfide and cysteine lv et al 2022 moreover studies suggested that the assimilatory sulfate reduction represents a source of sedimentary organic sulfur because organic sulfur components e g methionine and cysteine can be biosynthesized through microbe mediated sulfate reduction kim and gadd 2008 thus we propose that the s containing components produced by microbial metabolic processes are also an important source of dos in the seep sediments it is suggested that organic matter sulfurization reaction substantially enhanced long term carbon storage in the anoxic sediments by protecting organic compounds from being microbially degraded sinninghe damsté and de leeuw 1990 wakeham et al 1995 kok et al 2000 schmidt et al 2017 indeed suominen et al 2022 showed that the majority of s containing formulas were refractory dom in the black sea water column which is consistent with the perception that the sulfurization processes that served to enhance organic matter preservation raven et al 2021 in contrast our analysis revealed that the dom with higher s c ratios in the seep samples exhibited elevated lability as indicated by the higher mlbl values the average contribution of molecular formulas in the seep dom dataset bearing at least one s atom to the overall sample intensities was 64 when only the relative contributions included in the mlbl h c 1 5 were considered molecular formulas containing s contributed more than 90 fig s3 thus s containing molecular formulas are disproportionally coupled with the labile dom pool likewise the dom pool showed a high bioavailable level in the anoxic deep groundwater of the fennoscandian shield and the s containing formulas constitute an important proportion of labile dom pool osterholz et al 2022 furthermore the formulas containing s in the seep samples contributed to about 90 of the intensity in unsaturated aliphatic compounds but only accounted for 0 59 of the intensity in refractory components cram highly unsaturated aromatics and condensed aromatics compounds fig 8 note that higher relative intensity of s containing formulas in condensed aromatics of s05 3 than those of s05 1 and s05 2 was observed which may be caused by the accumulation of refractory s containing condensed aromatics with depth these observations also suggest the preferential association of s with the labile compounds in contrast to the abiotic sulfurization process that is generally unselective in term of the precursor compounds chemical properties hence both abiotic and biotic reactions can contribute to the sulfurization of dom in the seep sediments and biotic sulfurization may serve to increase the lability of dom 4 3 conceptual model of dom cycling in the seep sediments the chemosynthetic microbial communities inhabiting the cold seeps mainly reply on methane as carbon and energy sources niemann et al 2006 knittel et al 2009 in addition to the chemosynthetic microbial communities different species of heterotrophic microorganisms also exist in cold seeps lee et al 2013 cui et al 2019 these heterotrophic microorganisms can feed on low molecular weight labile organic acid e g acetate produced during aom as reflected by the genomic and enzymatic evidence for acetogenesis by anme in the seep sediments yang et al 2020 lv et al 2022 consistent with these microbial studies our optical and ft icr ms analysis of dom confirmed an enhanced production of relatively labile and low molecular weight compounds associated with methane cycling in the seep sediments intensive studies on the sulfur cycling in the seep sediments mostly hinged on the transformation and fate of the inorganic sulfur species related to aom e g h2s pyrite e g peckmann and thiel 2004 gong et al 2018 suess 2020 their organic counterparts received much less attention it has been shown that protein synthesis incorporates sulfur and subsequent cell lysis could release labile s containing components cuhel et al 1984 jiao et al 2010 our analyses of the pore water dom in the haima cold seeps suggested the presence of both abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom and selective binding of s to the labile dom compounds by biotic sulfurization process in the seep sediments therefore we speculate that aom process not only produces sulfide but also low molecular weight labile s bearing organic compounds as reflected by the occurrence of a large proportion of s containing formulas associated with the labile compounds figs 8 9 dos acts as the largest pool of organic sulfur in the ocean 6 7 pg s with the dominant source from the benthic dos flux due to the abiotic sulfurization of dom in the sediments ksionzek et al 2016 pohlabeln et al 2017 sulfur can thereby be incorporated into different types of dom compounds and result in high dos concentrations in sulfidic sediments sleighter et al 2014 gomez saez et al 2016 although dos concentrations were not quantified a substantially greater amount of s containing compounds were observed in the seep sediments compared to the reference sediments which may be an important supply of dos to the overlying seawater in addition we also show that the biotic dos produced by microbial assimilation of sulfate likely contributed to the production of labile dom thereby sustaining the seep communities fig 9 therefore when the labile dos is released into the overlying seawater it could also be utilized by microorganisms and potentially impact the oceanic sulfur cycle 5 conclusion this is the first study that unraveled the imprints of aom in the molecular compositions of pore water dom in the seep sediments combining optical ft icr ms and other geochemical analyses of pore water dom from the seep and reference sediments three conclusions were drawn as follows 1 seep sediments are characterized by an elevated amount of labile dom compounds compared to the reference sediments based on the spectral and ft icr ms parameters protein like hix and mlbl the lability of dom in the seep sediments is mostly attributed to the unsaturated aliphatic components molecular formulas with low h c ratios constitute the refractory compounds cram highly unsaturated and aromatics compounds and are positively correlated to the refractory fluorescent components c1 and c2 molecular formulas with high h c ratios represent the labile compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds and peptides and are positively correlated to the fluorescence protein like component c3 2 the lower formula richness observed in the seep sediments than in the reference sediments can be ascribed to variations in types of substrates utilized by microorganisms and in the diversity of microbial community between these two distinct environments notably the average number of formulas containing s chos and chons was significantly greater in the seep sediments resulting from the abiotic and biotic sulfurization of dom although the abiotic sulfurization of organic matter is inferred to be capable of stabilizing organic matter the biotic sulfurization process likely serves to improve the lability of dom 3 the underlying mechanism of the production of labile s containing dom is yet to be explored by laboratory experiments however we highlight that the relatively labile dom produced in the seep sediments could not only contribute to sustaining the heterotrophic communities but also likely have a critical

14964,humic acids were known to inhibit sewage sludge anaerobic digestion ad and many studies have been investigated to deal with the inhibitory effect of humic acids ha in raw sludge feeding the digestor however ha could also be in situ produced during the sludge ad process with a significant amount but the relieving of the inhibitory effect posed by the in situ produced ha has been historically ignored thus this study attempted to use citric acid ca an easily biodegradable polyatomic acid to directly treat sludge in the anaerobic digestor instead of the feeding sludge for alleviating inhibition caused by the in situ produced ha results showed that methane production of ad batches with ca pretreatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts on digestor sludge were effectively enhanced with the highest production being 2 89 times of that observed in control ad without ca treatment and 2 08 times of that achieved by contrast ad with ca pretreatment on raw sludge however the ad batches with ca treatment at low dosages of 0 02 0 04 g g ts had lower methane production during which sludge solubilization and hydrolysis were enhanced initially associated with released ha surfactant and hydrolytic enzymes then later inhibited since higher structurally sound ha in sp easily rebind proteinaceous substrates and enzymes again whilst ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts could promote sludge solubilization and hydrolysis throughout the sludge ad process this dosage dependent effect of ca treatment can be caused by its discriminating impact on ha structure and distribution at low dosages complexes of ha proteins including hydrolases can be decrosslinked and transferred to the soluble phase sp thus enhancing solubilization and hydrolysis initially however the released ha in sp could rebind more organics and hydrolases during ad resulting in augmented inhibition while the dosage increased ha were drastically deconstructed with aromatic cores in sp migrating to extracellular polymeric substances preventing binding effects on organics and hydrolases accordingly a smart mutex switch operational strategy of ca treatment was proposed the results suggested to alleviate the inhibitory effect of ha on sludge ad more attention should be given to ha produced and accumulated in ad rather than raw sludge so that the ca treatment directly on sludge in the digestor can be a

the inevitable byproduct of biological wastewater treatment processes contains a large amount of perishable organic matter which could be utilized for bioenergy methane production through anaerobic digestion ad during ad processes the particulate organics in sewage sludge should be solubilized and hydrolyzed at first before being ingested by anaerobic bacteria for acidogenesis and methanogenesis however the solubilization and hydrolysis of particulate compounds are typically considered rate limiting steps in ad processes gonzalez et al 2018 imai et al 2010 hence to enhance methane production from sludge ad overcoming the bottlenecks of limited sludge solubilization and hydrolyzation efficiency should be a high priority recently an increasing number of studies have pointed out that humic acids ha contained in raw sludge can have inhibitory effects on the efficiency of biomass conversion in ad azman et al 2017 li et al 2021 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2018a 2019 for example xu et al 2019 claimed that the presence of sludge ha enhanced the structural stability of sludge organics via the complexation of o containing groups in ha with metal ions thus restricting sludge solubilization apart from sludge solubilization the ha induced inhibition on hydrolytic phase has been pointed out by li et al 2021 2019a who found the presence of ha lowered the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and the hydrolysis rate in the first order model azman et al 2017 and li et al 2019a advocated that the reason for ha as an inhibiting agent is the formation of ha metal hydrolases binding structures moreover the hydrophobic force induced by π π electron interaction between aromatic structures in ha and proteins could also result in the binding of ha enzymes directly liu et al 2015 xu et al 2018b it can be summarized that ha induced inhibition on sludge solubilization and hydrolysis easily occurs since ha would bind organic substrates especially proteins and enzymes via direct hydrophobic force or indirect metal bridges thus methods of reducing organic binding metal content or adding specific metal ions to precipitate ha from the soluble phase of raw sludge have shown some relieving effects of ha inhibition on ad performance li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 2020 unfortunately ha can be in situ produced during the sludge ad process with a significant amount dong et al 2013 shao et al 2013 tang et al 2020 2018 2022 this is because microorganisms can biosynthesize quinones and aromatic precursors in anaerobic conditions with the use of glycolytic intermediates towards redox mediates proteins as well as ha s cores choo and ahn 2019 tang et al 2022 notably especially in cases of thermal pretreatment providing initial sufficient carbohydrate high total solid content and long sludge retention time inducing quorum sensing the aromatic repolymerization in newly formed ha can be increasingly found in anaerobic digestor sludge tang et al 2020 2018 2022 however the inhibitory effects of ha that are produced and accumulated during ad on biomass conversion to methane have historically been overlooked to alleviate the inhibitory effects of ha on sludge ad efforts could be made to damage ha organics and ha hydrolases complexes by modifying ha structures supramolecular ha rely on the associations between aromatic cores and heterogeneous fragments which are held together by low energy bonds such as van der waals forces ion dipole forces and hydrogen bonds nuzzo et al 2013 piccolo et al 2019 trevisan et al 2010 hence ha structures might be altered by changing the interface property of fragments e g the protonation degree as well as shifting the interaction forces between cores and outer fragments such as low energy bonds and π π electron interactions to this end treatments using easily biodegradable polyatomic acids e g citric acid ca and oxalic acid oa can be promising ca can be one of the most effective polyatomic acids to make ha fragments protonated and to destroy metal bridges as the thermodynamic stability of carboxylate complexes with ca2 al3 and fe3 increases with the number of carboxylic groups in acids i e mono di tricarboxylic acids clarholm et al 2015 furthermore the use of ca may also reduce the stability of ha by destroying the low energy bonds piccolo et al 2019 thus releasing the bioactive fragments morais et al 2020 as well as the bound hydrolase however to date an attempt to improve sludge ad performance by using ca to treat ha in sewage sludge especially to treat the ha produced and accumulated during the sludge ad process has not been conducted additionally the detailed mechanisms by which ca treatment affects sludge ha remain unknown thus the main objectives of this study were to investigate whether ca treatment can effectively modify ha in sewage sludge to prevent possible inhibitory effects on sludge solubilization and hydrolysis and to promote methane production during sludge ad in the present study ca treatment was innovatively applied to the sludge in anaerobic digester instead of raw sludge furthermore the underlying mechanisms of how ca treatment induces ha structural modification and how the modification influences sludge solubilization and hydrolysis were explored accordingly a novel technology to improve methane production from sewage sludge based on ca treatment was proposed the results were expected to break the stereotype of ha as inert refractory organics and to provide a promising strategy to enhance bioenergy recovery from wasted sewage sludge during ad processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources ca treatment and batch tests for sludge anaerobic digestion batch tests were carried out to evaluate methane production by sludge ad with ca treatment raw sewage sludge rs was dewatered sludge collected from the bailonggang wastewater treatment plant wwtp shanghai china treatment capacity 2 8 million tons per day and stored at 4 c less than 1 day before use the total solids ts content of the rs was 20 5 w w and the volatile solids vs accounted for 49 7 w w of ts the inoculum sludge is was obtained from a lab mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester with a volume of 6 l and a sludge retention time of 15 d the anaerobic digester was fed with the dewatered sludge collected at the same wwtp as mentioned before the ts of the is was 9 48 and the vs ts was 32 84 table s1 the ca treatment was designed to be directly applied to sludge in the anaerobic digester i e the is for batch research as such sludge has a high content of ha tang et al 2020 for the ca treatment is was mixed with ca at gradient dosages of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 10 g g ts in an n2 atmosphere and shaken at 120 rpm at 37 1 c for 18 24 h during ca pretreatment on is for each ca dosage a total of 12 parallels 10 g each parallel were prepared for 4 times of sampling triple parallels each time for ph and alkalinity tests the sampling was conducted every 6 h once the ph and alkalinity of treated is became stable after 18 24 h half of the samples were used to characterize the soluble organics including composition and content of scfas while the left half samples were used to extract ha and measure ha structural changes in addition a ca dosage of no more than 0 10 g g ts was designed to avoid a drastic ph decrease to below 5 50 and the treatment time was set to achieve the stable ph and alkalinity conditions of the treated is table s2 for ad batch tests each 100 g of rs the mass of rs in its original state which was diluted with deionized water to 200 g diluted rs with the ts of 10 56 before ad and 100 g is the mass of is in its original state with or without ca treatment at 0 02 0 10 g g ts were transferred into 500 ml reactors in each reactor the ca addition was according to the designed dosage i e 0 190 0 379 0 569 0 758 0 948 g for 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 10 g g ts respectively then two groups of ad batches were conducted to directly test ad performance affected by ca treatment one group was subjected to a regular ad test to track methane production while another group was subjected to 50 mmol 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes addition to block methanogenesis to analyze the processes of sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidogenesis in terms of soluble total organic carbon hydrolytic enzymes as well as short chain volatile acids all ad reactors were started up after creating an n2 atmosphere and operated at 37 1 c in an air bath shaker 120 rpm in addition ad batches with ca treatment on rs were also conducted as the contrast groups for this each 100 g rs the mass of rs in its original state was diluted with deionized water to 200 g diluted rs with the ts of 10 56 and was pretreated ca at gradient dosages of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 10 g g ts here refers to the ts of is in a n2 atmosphere and shaken at 120 rpm at 37 1 c for 24 h then the ca treated rs was mixed with 100 g untreated is the reactors were operated under the same conditions as the regular ad batches and the methane production was tracked the biogas was collected using gas bags and the ch4 and co2 content of the biogas was determined using a gas chromatograph gc112a inesa china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the methane yield was represented per gram of vsadd based on the vs of the only added raw sludge to evaluate and compare methane production kinetics and potential of ad batches the hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 were estimated by fitting the methane data to a one substrate type in the first order model of b t b0 1 e kt with 95 confidence intervals 2 2 ha extraction for elemental and spectroscopic analyses the extraction and fractionation of ha in total were performed with references to the international humic substances society swift et al 1996 and previous reports provenzano et al 2016 2014 the detailed procedure for ha extraction is described in text s1 the carbon c hydrogen h nitrogen n oxygen o and sulfur s contents in ha were analyzed using an elemental analyzer vario el iii elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany with 5 mg freeze dried ha for each sample the

tested using uv2559 shimadzu japan within the wavelength range of 700 190 nm for 13c nmr solid state spectra of ha samples a 600 mhz wide bore solid state spectrometer avance iii hd bruker germany was used each fine powdered sample 5 mg was packed into a 4 mm zirconium rotor stoppered by a kel f cap and spum at a rate of 12 000 1 hz the 13c nmr spectra were acquired with the cross polarization magic angle spinning cpmas technique using 2 s of recycle delay 1 ms of contact time 30 ms of acquisition time and 5000 scans accordingly hydrophobic index hb hi and critical micelle concentration cmc of ha were calculated text s2 salati et al 2011 2 3 extraction and characterization of sludge soluble phase sp and extracellular polymeric substance eps a mixture of each 8 g is sample in original

deionized water was used to resuspend the remaining solids and then the formaldehyde plus naoh method was applied to separate the extracellular polymeric substances eps liu and fang 2002 xu et al 2018b the content of humic acids ha in eps and sp was analyzed using the modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 for this method the soluble samples were directly performed while eps samples were freeze dried and then dissolved as 1 mg with 10 ml ultrapure water after adjusting ph 8 5 using 0 05 m nahco3 fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was applied using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer tokyo japan at room temperature to record the occurrence states of sludge organics in sp and eps and the pretreatment procedures were the same as those for the ha content test 2 4 isothermal adsorption tests and binding force analyses to explain the ha redistribution in ca treated sludge the present study simulated the isothermal adsorption processes of ha in ca pretreated sp ca sp0 onto the control eps and recorded the ha changes in sp ca spend when reaching the adsorption equilibrium then the thermodynamic parameters were measured to analyze binding forces considering the eps from ca treated is may have saturated adsorption of ha in that case the adsorption thermodynamic parameter of ha immigration towards eps cannot be measured the eps from original is was used instead detailed conduction of isothermal adsorption tests can be checked in text s3 the equilibrium adsorbent phase eps concentration of the adsorbate was calculated using eq 2 1 while the eps adsorption capacity of the adsorbate is estimated by fitting experimental data within freundlich isotherm in eq 2 2 2 1 q e c 0 c e v m eps where q e is the equilibrium adsorbent phase

ph and alkalinity were tested according to standard methods apha 2005 the main obm contents ca mg al fe were determined according to the modified tessier method braga et al 2017 xu et al 2017 the protocols to evaluate the activities of protease and α glucosidase were based on gessesse et al 2003 and goel et al 1998 to analyze the short chain fatty acid scfa concentration the sludge samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtrated by 0 45 μm and acidified with formic acid to adjust the ph to approximately 2 0 using gc agilent technologies 6890 ca usa with a flame ionization detector the molecular size of the sludge supernatant filtrated by 0 22 μm was detected using a high performance liquid chromatography 1260 infinity agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a pl aquagel oh mixed m column 8 μm 300 7 5 mm agilent and a refractive index detector all samples used for analyses were performed in triplicate measurement data are shown as the mean standard deviation all analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 23 for windows ibm corp ny usa a p value 0 05 was used to judge whether the changes of actual accumulative methane production of ad batches when compared to that of the control group were significant or not also which was used to determine the structural changes of ha were significant or not 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ca treatment on sludge biochemical methane production during anaerobic digestion as shown in fig 1 a compared to control anaerobic digestion n ad that used normal anaerobic digester sludge as is the cumulative methane production declined in experimental ad with ca treatment of 0 02 0 04 g g ts i e ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad while which were improved at ca dosages of 0 06 0 10 g g ts i e ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad cumulative methane production in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad were 1 48 2 89 and 2 18 times respectively of that in n ad notably in all ads data of cumulative methane production was satisfactorily simulated within the first order kinetic model r2 0 97 fig 1a and table s3 indicating the hydrolysis reaction was the rate limiting step of the overall ad processes bolado rodriguez et al 2016 the model simulation showed that compared with n ad the estimated hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b 0 were much higher in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad with a k increase of 25 49 and b 0 growth of 42 174 clearly ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts could enhance both sludge hydrolysis rate and biochemical methane potential in the contrast group using ca to treat rs the promotion of cumulative methane production estimated k and b0 were limited by 28 25 and 34 respectively fig 1b and table s3 thus the methane production achieved by ca treatment on is was approximately 1 13 2 08 times as high as that achieved by ca treatment on rs fig 1 it should be noted that although ca is easily biodegradable it can be calculated that even if all the ca added at 0 02 0 10 g g ts can be utilized as a carbon resource for methane production the corresponding methane increase is only 4 4 21 9 ml g vsadd text s4 such corresponding increases were much lower than those achieved in the ad with ca treatment on is fig 1a 66 3 258 6 ml g vsadd thus it can be speculated that changes in methane production lie in is s ha modification by ca treatment additionally the ca treatment on ha produced and accumulated in the ad digester could be more effective in promoting methane production than the ca treatment on rs 3 2 ca treatment at adequate dosages enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis in anaerobic digestion the performance of sludge solubilization was investigated in terms of molecular weight mw distribution of soluble matter and the content of soluble total organic carbon stoc as seen in fig 2 a at day 0 when is and rs were well mixed for 18 h the percentage of soluble matter with mw 1000 kda significantly increased from 15 7 to 42 4 as the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 08 g g ts and then slightly decreased to 33 1 when the ca dosage reached 0 10 g g ts the increase in large mw soluble substance over a short period apparently suggested that ca treatment can facilitate sludge solubilization interestingly although ca treatment was applied to is when the mw distribution of the mixture of is and rs as shown in fig 2a subtracted the contribution of is fig s1a according to their volume ratio the soluble matter with mw 1000 kda in rs drastically increased after mixing with ca treated is fig s1b this indicated ca treatment may alter the properties of is and then which enable to facilitate the solubilization of rs the enhanced sludge solubilization at the initial stage could be further confirmed by the initial increase of stoc concentration in detail the stoc concentration in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was consistently high during the monitoring period while in ca0 02 ad ca0 40 ad the stoc levels were improved during the first 2 days but decreased afterward the distinctly enhanced solubilization in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad providing more available organics for methane production was in accordance with the promoted b0 section 3 1 changes in sludge hydrolysis were tracked according to the activities of typical hydrolases for proteins and glucose i e protease and α glucosidase compared with the control is n is the activities of both protease and α glucosidase gradually increased in ca0 02 is ca0 06 is while they became almost equal in ca0 06 is ca0 10 is fig 2b upon acidogenic fermentation at days 2 4 the activities of hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad declined to levels lower than those in n ad however those in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad still showed higher values than those in n ad fig 2b speculatively the hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad were restrained again despite their initial release while those in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad remained almost unaffected correspondingly the production of short chain fatty acids scfas was improved to 346 5 520 7 mg cod g vs in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad but declined to 175 6 161 9 mg cod g vs in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad compared with the control level of 271 2 mg cod g vs in n ad fig s3 the enhanced hydrolysis rate as revealed by the activities of hydrolases in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was also in accordance with the results of cumulative methane production fitting in the first order kinetic model overall it can be inferred that the dominant reason for the improved methane production in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was that they broke the ad bottlenecks i e solubilization and hydrolysis and detailed mechanisms are discussed in the following sections 3 3 alteration of ha compositions and structures in sludge under different ca dosing rates 3 3 1 damage of ha pn crosslinking caused by low ca dosing rates as shown in fig 3 a nitrogen n and sulfur s in ha in is after ca treatment sharply decreased as the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 06 g g ts and the decrease gradually weakened as the ca dosage further increased to 0 10 g g ts it should be noted that ha in sewage sludge is inclined to cross link with proteins pn via metal bridges and hydrophobic interactions so that such ha pn crosslinked structures can also be collected during ha extraction li et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2015 tang et al 2020 thus the decreasing trend of n and s in ha suggested that ha pn crosslinking was drastically damaged at low ca dosing rates of 0 02 0 04 g g ts and the damage was nearly finished when the ca dosage reached 0 06 g g ts notably this trend was in consistent with the reduction of organic binding metals obm which also mainly occurred at 0 02 0 06 g g ts but was less significant at 0 06 0 10 g g ts fig s2 suggesting that the destruction of metal bridges by ca highly contributed to ha pn decrosslinking additionally ha and pn can be essentially distinguished by their aromatic origins as o aryl is a key kind of groups in ha forming ha s core structures while most aryl residues in pn are aromatic residues from aromatic amino acids thus drastic o aryl growth and aryl reduction in ha of treated is at ca of 0 02 0 06 g g ts as indicated in 13c nmr spectra table 1 fig 3b further confirmed the proteinaceous portion was detached and in that case characteristic ha cores could be increasingly detected ha can serve as a surfactant since which can change the surface tension of a solution and increase the solubility of other organic compounds klavins and purmalis 2009 in this study along with the pn like moieties were cut down and separated from ha fig 3a and b the proportions of aromatic o aryl and aryl groups as well as the percentage of hydrophobic groups alkyl and aryl increased with the enhancement of the hydrophobicity index hb hi table 1 notably aromatic and hydrophobic groups in ha can arrange themselves as the core of the micelles in an aqueous solution with a hydrophilic shell along the water air interface thus reducing the surface tension of the solution and consequently enhancing the solubility of other hydrophobic organic compounds rosen 2012 salati et al 2011 in this sense the critical micelle concentration cmc calculated according to eq 1 2 in text s2 was used to define the lowest concentration of ha required to form the mentioned micelles salati et al 2011 as seen in table 1 ha s cmc significantly decreased with ca dosage of 0 02 0 06 g g ts but became relatively stable under the dosage of 0 06 0 10 g g ts the decrease in cmc suggested that a lower ha concentration was required to initiate micelle formation for the solubilization of other hydrophobic compounds which could explain the enhanced sludge solubilization at the initial stage of ad after ca treatment 3 3 2 significant ha deconstruction occurred at adequate ca dosing rates the deconstruction of is s ha under ca treatment can be tracked in terms of the mw and polydispersity degree pd morais et al 2020 nardi et al 2021 as seen in fig 3c compared with the main fractions of ha in untreated digested sludge i e 959 k da 192 k da 7 1 k da the ca dosage of 0 02 0 04 g g ts induced weak changes in mw but the ca dosage of 0 06 0 10 g g ts caused a sudden decrease in ha to that with a main mw of 753 748 k da 171 130 k da and 3 8 2 3 k da in addition as shown in table 2 the proportion of the macromolecular fractions over 100 kda also drastically decreased after ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts which were 56 0 for 959 kda and 11 9 for 192 kda in the untreated is but declined to 45 7 49 1 for 753 748 kda and 8 9 11 2 for 171 130 kda at 0 06 0 10 g g ts table 2 accompanied by the destruction in macromolecular ha by ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts the fraction of small molecular ha mw 10 kda increased from 19 8 in the untreated is to 26 0 36 8 in ca treated is meanwhile the pd of small molecule ha also increased from 3 6 to 4 9 5 7 suggesting that the small molecule ha was more diverse in ca treated is at 0 06 0 10 g g ts it should be noted that supramolecular ha assembles bioactive fragments with low mw around the core structures of o aryl and quinones via low energy bonds morais et al 2020 nuzzo et al 2013 piccolo et al 2003 2019 trevisan et al 2010 thus the downward of the macromolecular fraction in ha with the increase in the amount and diversity of small fragments after ca treatment represent that the low energy bonds in between were destroyed so that the original supramolecular ha could be deconstructed further results revealed that such ha deconstruction only effectively occurred when ca dosage reached an adequate level in the present study which referred to 0 06 0 10 g g ts for the cases moreover among the three ca dosages 0 08 g g ts induced the most severe ha deconstruction as indicated by the lowest macromolecular fraction and the most abundant small fragments with the highest pd fig 3c table 2 as for the macromolecular fraction of ha became slightly loosened with mw reduction under ca of 0 10 g g ts it can be inferred that the excessive protonation of o containing groups on the aromatic structures of ha at that high ca level resulting in the formation of hydrogen bonds between aromatic moieties thus stretching the distance from each other liu et al 2015 tang et al 2021 the variation in the molecular aromaticity and depolymerization of ha in ca treated is were also monitored using uv vis absorption analysis as shown in fig 3d the ha in ca treated is with 0 08 g g ts showed the highest normalized uv vis absorption at 253 nm 285 nm and 396 nm which indicated that the ha has the greatest proportion of aromatic rings and conjugated dienes 253 nm and 285 nm and the reduced forms of quinones 396 nm piccolo et al 2019 rau et al 2002 moreover with a ca dosage of 0 08 g g ts the ha in treated is had the largest uv vis absorption ratio at 465 nm to that at 665 nm i e the e4 e6 ratio representing the most significant mw reduction and polydispersity improvement morais et al 2020 penghui and hur 2017 piccolo et al 2019 these results highly corresponded to the greatest ha deconstruction in is with ca treatment at 0 08 g g ts as mentioned above furthermore the high polydispersity reflected ca treatment at 0 08 g g ts could hinder the formation of intermolecular low energy bonds connecting ha cores with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments as a result instead of aggregating into stable structures with a high polymerization degree the aromatic and conjugated cores in ha were exposed by relieving the encirclement of hydrophilic groups in summary how ca treatment affects ha in is would depend on the ca dosing rate under a low ca dosing rate ha pn crosslinking can be damaged but ha deconstruction can only occur when the ca dosage reaches a threshold level more importantly an adequate ca dosage might prevent the reformation of metal bridges and molecular low energy bonds and shape the sludge ha characterized with a large amount of aromatic and conjugated groups but a low polymerization degree such ca dosage dependent ha structure alteration may induce ha spatial redistribution in sludge flocs to be discussed in section 3 4 which may explain the considerable enhancement in sludge solubilization and hydrolysis under a certain dosing rate 3 4 the spatial distribution of ha fractions in sludge flocs shifts at different ca dosing rates 3 4 1 the shifting of ha distribution revealed by quantitative analyses and eem spectroscopy the ha redistribution in the flocs of is after ca treatment could be found by the quantitative changes of ha in the soluble phase sp and extracellular polymeric substances eps hereafter called sp ha and eps ha as shown in fig 4 a with a ca dosage of 0 02 g g ts sp ha considerably increased while eps ha significantly decreased compared to that in untreated is suggesting that the low dosage of 0 02 g g ts might induce ha to shift from eps to sp meanwhile the total amount of ha drastically dropped after ca treatment at 0 02 g g ts as the modified lowry method also calculates the cross linked pn in ha quantification frolund et al 1995 the decline in total ha can be explained by the release of pn due to pn ha crosslinking damage caused by ca treatment as discussed in section 3 3 1 moreover as the ca dosage increased to 0 04 g g ts the sp ha and eps ha turned down together indicating the pn ha decrosslinking also occurred in sp ha with ca increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts total ha decreased to a stable level however sp ha decreased to a value lower than that in untreated is with eps ha increasing accordingly this result could be highly explained by that with the adequate ca dosage the ha released to sp could migrate toward the eps again as discussed in section 3 3 2 under ca dosages of 0 06 0 10 g g ts aromatic and conjugated cores in ha could be exposed which were relieved from the encirclement of outer fragments thus the driving force of ha redistribution to eps may be the π π interaction force hydrophobic interaction between aromatic and conjugated groups in both eps and sp the ha and pn redistributed in eps and sp after ca treatment were further explored using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy according to the eem spectra fig 4b when the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 04 g g ts the intensities of both ha and pn peaks in eps were enhanced as discussed above under such ca dosing rates the ha in eps was shifted to sp fig 4a thus the enhancement of ha and pn peaks is probably attributed to the alleviation of metal masking effects on the fluorescence signal due to the obm reduction fig s2 tang et al 2020 it has been reported that some metal organic complexes can quench the fluorescence of organic matter as complexes are formed involving fluorescent binding sites antunes et al 2007 coble 2014 however when ca dosing rate further increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts the intensities of ha peaks in eps were still enhanced along with increased ca dosage even though the obm reduction became negligible fig s2 moreover compared to the unique ha in control is ex em 334 336 nm 412 423 nm one new ha peak appeared with longer ex and em ex em 366 368 nm 446 451 nm the fluorescent redshift suggested the accumulation of thick rings in planar network structures and enhanced delocalization degree of π electrons ishii and boyer 2012 kim et al 2018 romera castillo et al 2014 results further support ha reaggregating to eps at adequate ca dosages meanwhile the intensities of ha and pn peaks in sp also altered accordingly as the ca dosing rate increased from 0 to 0 04 g g ts both ha and pn peak intensities were enhanced confirming that the ha and pn originally in eps were released in sp surprisingly as the ca dosage increased to 0 06 g g ts the ha peaks in sp almost disappeared this corresponded highly to the quantitative result shown in fig 4a that sp ha drastically declined under ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts to that below the level in untreated is as well as the ha peak enhancement in eps recorded in fig 4b this result confirmed that the aromatic skeleton in ha could be released into sp in the form of ha pn at low ca dosage and once they were relieved from the encirclement of outer fragments at proper high ca dosage they could transfer into eps again thus contributing to the formation of new eps ha with higher condensed aromatic structures than the original one 3 4 2 thermodynamic analyses further confirmed the feasibility of ha reaggregation from sp into eps under high ca dosing rates to further verify whether the aromatic structures from ha in sp can spontaneously transfer into eps the adsorption tests of ca treated sp by eps were conducted and the thermodynamic parameters were analyzed for the binding force the adsorption of ha was tracked based on the ha signal in the eem spectra pan et al 2010 wang et al 2012 of sp just after ca treatment ha sp0 and of sp left in the system when the adsorption was finished ha spend the results showed that under the ca dosing rate of 0 06 0 10 g g ts the ha in the sp could be adsorbed by eps as indicated by a lower ha spend than ha sp0 in these cases fig s4 the amount of ha adsorbed by eps when reaching the same equilibrium concentration followed the trend of ca0 08 ca0 10 ca0 06 at both 298 k and 310 k fig 4c fitting the results with the freundlich adsorption isotherm showed the adsorptive capacity reflected by the binding constant of kf was also in the order of ca0 08 ca0 10 ca0 06 at 298 k and 310 k fig 4c according to the kf variation in response to temperature changes thermodynamic parameters of gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs can be determined as shown in fig 4d the δg for the adsorption were negative suggesting that ha reaggregation from sp into eps at ca dosing rates of 0 06 0 10 g g ts were thermodynamically spontaneous further with ca dosing rate of 0 06 0 08 g g ts δs and δh were positive and which directly suggested the hydrophobic interaction force led to the migration of ha sp0 into eps however at ca dosage of 0 10 g g ts the negative δs implied the increased hydrogen bonds among reaggregated ha thus making them more ordered so as not to closely connect with each other liu et al 2015 tang et al 2021 3 5 the proposed mechanisms of how solubilization and hydrolysis during sludge anaerobic digestion are affected by ca treatment based on the results above of ha reconstruction and redistribution in the sludge varying from ca dosing rates the mechanisms of how modified ha affects sludge solubilization and hydrolysis during sludge ad are proposed and illustrated in fig 5 a specifically at ca dosing rate of 0 02 0 04 g g ts along with the collapse of metal bridges the ha in eps could be relieved into sp meanwhile ha pn crosslinking can be damaged so that pn portion can also be relieved functionally the released ha in sp might serve as the surfactant promoting the solubilization of organics and the surfactant property of ha was already improved at low ca dosages as suggested by the decreased cmc table 1 liu et al 2015 thus the sludge solubilization could be enhanced at the initial stage when the ca treated is 0 02 0 04 g g ts was mixed with the rs fig 2 notably as hydrolases are pn in nature the pn release highly corresponded to the improvement of the activities of hydrolases and thus sludge hydrolysis was also promoted at the initial stage fig 2b however upon entering the ad process the ha in sp would combine with hydrolases again through hydrophobic interactions or re established metal bridges to inhibit sludge hydrolysis since the ha in sludge sp after ca treatment at 0 02 0 04 g g ts was higher than that in untreated sludge fig 4a more hydrolases were likely to be trapped by ha thus the activities of typical hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad were lower than those in n ad fig 2b and consequently methane production was also limited fig 1 however when the ca dosage further increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts not only pn ha crosslinking could be damaged but the low energy bonds between the cores of o aryl quinones and fragments of amino carboxylic and alkyl groups might also be destroyed as a result ha was deconstructed and the small fragments were significantly dispersed into sp which are greater surfactants to enhance sludge solubilization than the whole released ha at low dosages additionally accompanied by the removal of encircled small fragments the aromatic conjugated cores of ha in sp could be exposed and migrate to eps due to π π interaction forces fig 5a thus for ad process the recombination of ha and pn like substrate and hydrolases in sp can be alleviated meanwhile when more original cores of ha i e o aryl quinones redistributed into eps the surface of the eps became more negatively charged costa et al 2018 to repel the pn and prevent binding effects on pn thus when the ca dosages were 0 06 0 10 g g ts the hydrolases which are also pn in nature can be kept free in sp during ad processes and the sludge hydrolysis rate could be enhanced for a long period among these three dosages 0 08 g g ts induced the highest improvement in both sludge solubilization and hydrolysis fig 2 and consequently led to the greatest methane production fig 1 when the ca dosage further increased to 0 10 g g ts the migration of o aryl quinone groups into eps weakened slightly due to the excessive formation of hydrogen bonds thus the sludge solubilization hydrolysis and consequent methane production were less significantly improved than those in the case of the ca dosage at 0 08 g g ts 3 6 application perspectives of ca treatment technology for enhancing methane production in sludge anaerobic digestion this study demonstrates that ca treatment directly on the sludge in an anaerobic digestor can effectively enhance methane generation with a much more significant enhancement than that achieved with ca treatment on raw sludge the promotion of methane production can be ascribed to enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis because of ha deconstruction and redistribution in digestor sludge flocs after ca treatment on the contrary in the way of conducting ca pretreatment on rs the major ha inhibition on ad since most ha exist in ad sludge cannot be relieved considering future extensive application the preliminary estimation of ca consumption and cost to treat per ton of ad dry solids can be us 52 68 ca market price at real time corresponding to ca dosage of 0 08 g g ts with the highest methane production in the present study in addition as ca can be generated by microbial fermentation of carbohydrates developing in situ ca generation from carbohydrates in sludge is promising to further increase the economic benefits regarding further design for the application as ca is easily degraded ca is required to periodically add into the ad reactor to continuously solve ha induced inhibition the optimal ca dosage added is also critical to maintaining superior methane production according to the mechanisms this study found the optimal ca dosage should result in destructing low energy bonds in ha as much as possible and ensure aromatic and conjugated groups of ha formed in sp to migrate into eps fig 5a to achieve these goals as eem method used in this study was sensitive and reliable an eem based online system monitoring soluble ha and pn in the digestor and a smart mutex switch operational strategy for ca treatment and rs feeding can be proposed fig 5b specifically during the regular operation of ad the filtrate 0 45 μm of sludge in ad will be monitored using eem if the intensities of ha peaks were significant while the number of pn peaks decreased the sludge in the digestor would be treated using ca before the next feeding of raw sludge in the present study the ca dosage is recommended as 0 08 g g ts but it can be adjusted according to different sludge properties therefore the ca dosage can be determined by a simple trial and the one expected to result in eem spectra with the lowest intensities of ha peaks and highest intensities of pn after treatment can be considered proper this is because such spectra indicated that hydrolases bound in eps can be released as much as possible and the aromatic moieties in ha were reaggregated into eps thus preventing inhibition effects i e binding hydrolases during ad after ca treatment the ad could be switched back to routine operation by feeding the raw sludge until the next treatment event as indicated by the eem spectra the application of ca treatment is superior to being environmentally friendly as it is a nontoxic and biodegradable chemical peng et al 2018 that would not accumulate in the sludge fig s5 moreover it should also be noted that future investigations on continuously operated ad are expected to be conducted to fully establish the proposed technology the promotion of methane production can be ascribed to enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis because of ha deconstruction and redistribution in sludge flocs after ca treatment thus it is worth studying related promoting effects of ca treatment such as on regulating the ha role of electron shuttle and microbial population in future to obtain a more comprehensive understanding because which might be caused by increased available substrates and hydrolase via ha deconstruction and redistribution in addition we are planning to proceed with the pilot scale dosage adjustment technology to verify whether the eem spectrometry recommended by laboratory results is also available finally the results of this study revealed that the ha produced and accumulated in ad poses a more adverse impact on methane production compared to ha in raw sludge evidenced by ca treatment on raw sludge cannot significantly increase methane production fig 1b thus when developing technology to enhance methane production in ad in the future more attention should be given to ha quantity and properties produced and accumulated in ad rather than that in raw sludge 4 conclusion humic acids can be in situ produced during sludge anaerobic digestion process and pose inhibitory effects on methane production but it lacks an effective method to cope with such inhibition this study for the first time demonstrated that using adequate citric acid ca treatment directly on the sludge in the anaerobic digester is promising to allivate the inhibitory effect caused by the in situ produced ha the experimental results showed that methane production after ca treatment can reach 2 89 times of that generated in control ad without ca treatment and 2 08 times of that achieved by contrast ad of ca treated raw sludge the main mechanisms are ascribed to that ca treatment at adequate dosage can i enhance sludge solubilization via collapsing ha pn binding structures to release surfactant ha fragments and ii boost hydrolysis efficiency via relieving hydrolases and maintain their activities during the ad process by immobilizing aromatic ha cores in extracellular substances on this basis a smart mutex switch operational ca treatment strategy was proposed the results of this study are

14964,humic acids were known to inhibit sewage sludge anaerobic digestion ad and many studies have been investigated to deal with the inhibitory effect of humic acids ha in raw sludge feeding the digestor however ha could also be in situ produced during the sludge ad process with a significant amount but the relieving of the inhibitory effect posed by the in situ produced ha has been historically ignored thus this study attempted to use citric acid ca an easily biodegradable polyatomic acid to directly treat sludge in the anaerobic digestor instead of the feeding sludge for alleviating inhibition caused by the in situ produced ha results showed that methane production of ad batches with ca pretreatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts on digestor sludge were effectively enhanced with the highest production being 2 89 times of that observed in control ad without ca treatment and 2 08 times of that achieved by contrast ad with ca pretreatment on raw sludge however the ad batches with ca treatment at low dosages of 0 02 0 04 g g ts had lower methane production during which sludge solubilization and hydrolysis were enhanced initially associated with released ha surfactant and hydrolytic enzymes then later inhibited since higher structurally sound ha in sp easily rebind proteinaceous substrates and enzymes again whilst ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts could promote sludge solubilization and hydrolysis throughout the sludge ad process this dosage dependent effect of ca treatment can be caused by its discriminating impact on ha structure and distribution at low dosages complexes of ha proteins including hydrolases can be decrosslinked and transferred to the soluble phase sp thus enhancing solubilization and hydrolysis initially however the released ha in sp could rebind more organics and hydrolases during ad resulting in augmented inhibition while the dosage increased ha were drastically deconstructed with aromatic cores in sp migrating to extracellular polymeric substances preventing binding effects on organics and hydrolases accordingly a smart mutex switch operational strategy of ca treatment was proposed the results suggested to alleviate the inhibitory effect of ha on sludge ad more attention should be given to ha produced and accumulated in ad rather than raw sludge so that the ca treatment directly on sludge in the digestor can be a

the inevitable byproduct of biological wastewater treatment processes contains a large amount of perishable organic matter which could be utilized for bioenergy methane production through anaerobic digestion ad during ad processes the particulate organics in sewage sludge should be solubilized and hydrolyzed at first before being ingested by anaerobic bacteria for acidogenesis and methanogenesis however the solubilization and hydrolysis of particulate compounds are typically considered rate limiting steps in ad processes gonzalez et al 2018 imai et al 2010 hence to enhance methane production from sludge ad overcoming the bottlenecks of limited sludge solubilization and hydrolyzation efficiency should be a high priority recently an increasing number of studies have pointed out that humic acids ha contained in raw sludge can have inhibitory effects on the efficiency of biomass conversion in ad azman et al 2017 li et al 2021 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2018a 2019 for example xu et al 2019 claimed that the presence of sludge ha enhanced the structural stability of sludge organics via the complexation of o containing groups in ha with metal ions thus restricting sludge solubilization apart from sludge solubilization the ha induced inhibition on hydrolytic phase has been pointed out by li et al 2021 2019a who found the presence of ha lowered the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and the hydrolysis rate in the first order model azman et al 2017 and li et al 2019a advocated that the reason for ha as an inhibiting agent is the formation of ha metal hydrolases binding structures moreover the hydrophobic force induced by π π electron interaction between aromatic structures in ha and proteins could also result in the binding of ha enzymes directly liu et al 2015 xu et al 2018b it can be summarized that ha induced inhibition on sludge solubilization and hydrolysis easily occurs since ha would bind organic substrates especially proteins and enzymes via direct hydrophobic force or indirect metal bridges thus methods of reducing organic binding metal content or adding specific metal ions to precipitate ha from the soluble phase of raw sludge have shown some relieving effects of ha inhibition on ad performance li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 2020 unfortunately ha can be in situ produced during the sludge ad process with a significant amount dong et al 2013 shao et al 2013 tang et al 2020 2018 2022 this is because microorganisms can biosynthesize quinones and aromatic precursors in anaerobic conditions with the use of glycolytic intermediates towards redox mediates proteins as well as ha s cores choo and ahn 2019 tang et al 2022 notably especially in cases of thermal pretreatment providing initial sufficient carbohydrate high total solid content and long sludge retention time inducing quorum sensing the aromatic repolymerization in newly formed ha can be increasingly found in anaerobic digestor sludge tang et al 2020 2018 2022 however the inhibitory effects of ha that are produced and accumulated during ad on biomass conversion to methane have historically been overlooked to alleviate the inhibitory effects of ha on sludge ad efforts could be made to damage ha organics and ha hydrolases complexes by modifying ha structures supramolecular ha rely on the associations between aromatic cores and heterogeneous fragments which are held together by low energy bonds such as van der waals forces ion dipole forces and hydrogen bonds nuzzo et al 2013 piccolo et al 2019 trevisan et al 2010 hence ha structures might be altered by changing the interface property of fragments e g the protonation degree as well as shifting the interaction forces between cores and outer fragments such as low energy bonds and π π electron interactions to this end treatments using easily biodegradable polyatomic acids e g citric acid ca and oxalic acid oa can be promising ca can be one of the most effective polyatomic acids to make ha fragments protonated and to destroy metal bridges as the thermodynamic stability of carboxylate complexes with ca2 al3 and fe3 increases with the number of carboxylic groups in acids i e mono di tricarboxylic acids clarholm et al 2015 furthermore the use of ca may also reduce the stability of ha by destroying the low energy bonds piccolo et al 2019 thus releasing the bioactive fragments morais et al 2020 as well as the bound hydrolase however to date an attempt to improve sludge ad performance by using ca to treat ha in sewage sludge especially to treat the ha produced and accumulated during the sludge ad process has not been conducted additionally the detailed mechanisms by which ca treatment affects sludge ha remain unknown thus the main objectives of this study were to investigate whether ca treatment can effectively modify ha in sewage sludge to prevent possible inhibitory effects on sludge solubilization and hydrolysis and to promote methane production during sludge ad in the present study ca treatment was innovatively applied to the sludge in anaerobic digester instead of raw sludge furthermore the underlying mechanisms of how ca treatment induces ha structural modification and how the modification influences sludge solubilization and hydrolysis were explored accordingly a novel technology to improve methane production from sewage sludge based on ca treatment was proposed the results were expected to break the stereotype of ha as inert refractory organics and to provide a promising strategy to enhance bioenergy recovery from wasted sewage sludge during ad processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources ca treatment and batch tests for sludge anaerobic digestion batch tests were carried out to evaluate methane production by sludge ad with ca treatment raw

et al 2020 for the ca treatment is was mixed with ca at gradient dosages of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 10 g g ts in an n2 atmosphere and shaken at 120 rpm at 37 1 c for 18 24 h during ca pretreatment on is for each ca dosage a total of 12 parallels 10 g each parallel were prepared for 4 times of sampling triple parallels each time for ph and alkalinity tests the sampling was conducted every 6 h once the ph and alkalinity of treated is became stable after 18 24 h half of the samples were used to characterize the soluble organics including composition and content of scfas while the left half samples were used to extract ha and measure ha structural changes in addition a ca dosage of no more than 0 10 g g ts was designed to avoid a drastic ph decrease to below 5 50 and the treatment time was set to achieve the stable ph and alkalinity conditions of the treated is table s2 for ad batch tests each 100 g of rs the mass of rs in its original state which was diluted with deionized water to 200 g diluted rs with the ts of 10 56 before ad and 100 g is the mass of is in its original state with or without ca treatment at 0 02 0 10 g g ts were transferred into 500 ml reactors in each reactor

test ad performance affected by ca treatment one group was subjected to a regular ad test to track methane production while another group was subjected to 50 mmol 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes addition to block methanogenesis to analyze the processes of sludge solubilization hydrolysis and acidogenesis in terms of soluble total organic carbon hydrolytic enzymes as well as short chain volatile acids all ad reactors were started up after creating an n2 atmosphere and operated at 37 1 c in an air bath shaker 120 rpm in addition ad batches with ca treatment on rs were also conducted as the contrast groups for this each 100 g rs the mass of rs in its original state was diluted with deionized water to 200 g diluted rs with the ts of 10 56 and was pretreated ca at gradient dosages of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 10 g g ts here refers to the ts of is in a n2 atmosphere and shaken at 120 rpm at 37 1 c for 24 h then the ca treated rs was mixed with 100 g untreated is the reactors were operated under the same conditions as the regular ad batches and the methane production was tracked the biogas was collected using gas bags and the ch4 and co2 content of the biogas was determined using a gas chromatograph gc112a inesa china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the methane yield was represented per gram of vsadd based on the vs of the only added raw sludge to evaluate and compare methane production kinetics and potential of ad batches the hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 were estimated by fitting the methane data to a one substrate type in the first order model of b t b0 1 e kt with 95 confidence intervals 2 2 ha extraction for elemental and spectroscopic analyses the extraction and fractionation of ha in total were performed with references to the international humic substances society swift et al 1996 and previous reports provenzano et al 2016 2014 the detailed procedure for ha extraction is described in text s1 the carbon c hydrogen h

deionized water was used to resuspend the remaining solids and then the formaldehyde plus naoh method was applied to separate the extracellular polymeric substances eps liu and fang 2002 xu et al 2018b the content of humic acids ha in eps and sp was analyzed using the modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 for this method the soluble samples were directly performed while eps samples were freeze dried and then dissolved as 1 mg with 10 ml ultrapure water after adjusting ph 8 5 using 0 05 m nahco3 fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was applied using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer tokyo japan at room temperature to record the occurrence states of sludge organics in sp and eps and the pretreatment procedures were the same as those for the ha content test 2 4 isothermal adsorption tests and binding force analyses to explain the ha redistribution in ca treated sludge the present study simulated the isothermal adsorption processes of ha in ca pretreated sp ca sp0 onto the control eps and recorded the ha changes in sp ca spend when reaching the adsorption equilibrium then the thermodynamic parameters were measured to analyze binding forces considering the eps from ca treated is may have saturated adsorption of ha in that case the adsorption thermodynamic parameter of ha immigration towards eps cannot be measured the eps from original is was used instead detailed conduction of isothermal adsorption tests can be checked in text s3 the equilibrium adsorbent phase eps concentration of the adsorbate was calculated using eq 2 1

protocols to evaluate the activities of protease and α glucosidase were based on gessesse et al 2003 and goel et al 1998 to analyze the short chain fatty acid scfa concentration the sludge samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtrated by 0 45 μm and acidified with formic acid to adjust the ph to approximately 2 0 using gc agilent technologies 6890 ca usa

ad batches when compared to that of the control group were significant or not also which was used to determine the structural changes of ha were significant or not 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ca treatment on sludge biochemical methane production during anaerobic digestion as shown in fig 1 a compared to control anaerobic digestion n ad that used normal anaerobic digester sludge as is the cumulative methane production declined in experimental ad with ca treatment of 0 02 0 04 g g ts i e ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad while which were improved at ca dosages of 0 06 0 10 g g ts i e ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad cumulative methane production in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad were 1 48 2 89 and 2 18 times respectively of that in n ad notably in all ads data of cumulative methane production was satisfactorily simulated within the first order kinetic model r2 0 97 fig 1a and table s3 indicating the hydrolysis reaction was the rate limiting step of the overall ad processes bolado rodriguez et al 2016 the model simulation showed that compared with n ad the estimated hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b 0 were much higher in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad with a k increase of 25 49 and b 0 growth of 42 174 clearly ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts could enhance both sludge hydrolysis rate and biochemical methane potential in the contrast group using ca to treat rs the promotion of cumulative methane production estimated k and b0 were limited by 28 25 and 34 respectively fig 1b and table s3 thus the methane production achieved by ca treatment on is was approximately 1 13 2 08 times as high as that achieved by ca treatment on rs fig 1 it should be noted that although ca is easily biodegradable it can be calculated that even if all the ca added at 0 02 0 10 g g ts can be utilized as a carbon resource for methane production the corresponding methane increase is only 4 4 21 9 ml g vsadd text s4 such corresponding increases were much lower than those achieved in the ad with ca treatment on is fig 1a 66 3 258 6 ml g vsadd thus it can be speculated that changes in methane production lie in is s ha modification by ca treatment additionally the ca treatment on ha produced and accumulated in the ad digester could be more effective in promoting methane production than the ca treatment on rs 3 2 ca treatment at adequate dosages enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis in anaerobic digestion the performance of sludge solubilization was investigated in terms of molecular weight mw distribution of soluble matter and the content of soluble total organic carbon stoc as seen in fig 2 a at day 0 when is and rs were well mixed for 18 h the percentage of soluble matter with mw 1000 kda significantly increased from 15 7 to 42 4 as the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 08 g g ts and then slightly decreased to 33 1 when the ca dosage reached 0 10 g g ts the increase in large mw soluble substance over a short period apparently suggested that ca treatment can facilitate sludge solubilization interestingly although ca treatment was applied to is when the mw distribution of the mixture of is and rs as shown in fig 2a subtracted the contribution of is fig s1a according to their volume ratio the soluble matter with mw 1000 kda in rs drastically increased after mixing with ca treated is fig s1b this indicated ca treatment may alter the properties of is and then which enable to facilitate the solubilization of rs the enhanced sludge solubilization at the initial stage could be further confirmed by the initial increase of stoc concentration in detail the stoc concentration in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was consistently high during the monitoring period while in ca0 02 ad ca0 40 ad the stoc levels were improved during the first 2 days but decreased afterward the distinctly enhanced solubilization in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad providing more available organics for methane production was in accordance with the promoted b0 section 3 1 changes in sludge hydrolysis were tracked according to the activities of typical hydrolases for proteins and glucose i e protease and α glucosidase compared with the control is n is the activities of both protease and α glucosidase gradually increased in ca0 02 is ca0 06 is while they became almost equal in ca0 06 is ca0 10 is fig 2b upon acidogenic fermentation at days 2 4 the activities of hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad declined to levels lower than those in n ad however those in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad still showed higher values than those in n ad fig 2b speculatively the hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad were restrained again despite their initial release while those in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad remained almost unaffected correspondingly the production of short chain fatty acids scfas was improved to 346 5 520 7 mg cod g vs in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad but declined to 175 6 161 9 mg cod g vs in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad compared with the control level of 271 2 mg cod g vs in n ad fig s3 the enhanced hydrolysis rate as revealed by the activities of hydrolases in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was also in accordance with the results of cumulative methane production fitting in the first order kinetic model overall it can be inferred that the dominant reason for the improved methane production in ca0 06 ad ca0 10 ad was that they broke the ad bottlenecks i e solubilization and hydrolysis and detailed mechanisms are discussed in the following sections 3 3 alteration of ha compositions and structures in sludge under different ca dosing rates 3 3 1 damage of ha pn crosslinking caused by low ca dosing rates as shown in fig 3 a nitrogen n and sulfur s in ha in is after ca treatment sharply decreased as the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 06 g g ts and the decrease gradually weakened as the ca dosage further increased to 0 10 g g ts it should be noted that ha in sewage sludge is inclined to cross link with proteins pn via metal bridges and hydrophobic interactions so that such ha pn crosslinked structures can also be collected during ha extraction li et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2015 tang et al 2020 thus the decreasing trend of n and s in ha suggested that ha pn crosslinking was drastically damaged at low ca dosing rates of 0 02 0 04 g g ts and the damage was nearly finished when the ca dosage reached 0 06 g g ts notably this trend was in consistent with the reduction of organic binding metals obm which also mainly occurred at 0 02 0 06 g g ts but was less significant at 0 06 0 10 g g ts fig s2 suggesting that the destruction of metal bridges by ca highly contributed to ha pn decrosslinking additionally ha and pn can be essentially distinguished by their aromatic origins as o aryl is a key kind of groups in ha forming ha s core structures while most aryl residues in pn are aromatic residues from aromatic amino acids thus drastic o aryl growth and aryl reduction in ha of treated is at ca of 0 02 0 06 g g ts as indicated in 13c nmr spectra table 1 fig 3b further confirmed the proteinaceous portion was detached and in that case characteristic ha cores could be increasingly detected ha can serve as a surfactant since which can change the surface tension of a solution and increase the solubility of other organic compounds klavins and purmalis 2009 in this study along with the pn like moieties were cut down and separated from ha fig 3a and b the proportions of aromatic o aryl and aryl groups as well as the percentage of hydrophobic groups alkyl and aryl increased with the enhancement of the hydrophobicity index hb hi table 1 notably aromatic and hydrophobic groups in ha can arrange themselves as the core of the micelles in an aqueous solution with a hydrophilic shell along the water air interface thus reducing the surface tension of the solution and consequently enhancing the solubility of other hydrophobic organic compounds rosen 2012 salati et al 2011 in this sense the critical micelle concentration cmc calculated according to eq 1 2 in text s2 was used to define the lowest concentration of ha required to form the mentioned micelles salati et al 2011 as seen in table 1 ha s cmc significantly decreased with ca dosage of 0 02 0 06 g g ts but became relatively stable under the dosage of 0 06 0 10 g g ts the decrease in cmc suggested that a lower ha concentration was required to initiate micelle formation for the solubilization of other hydrophobic compounds which could explain the enhanced sludge solubilization at the initial stage of ad after ca treatment 3 3 2 significant ha deconstruction occurred at adequate ca dosing rates the deconstruction of is s ha under ca treatment can be tracked in terms of the mw and polydispersity degree pd morais et al 2020 nardi et al 2021 as seen in fig 3c compared with the main fractions of ha in untreated digested sludge i e 959 k da 192 k da 7 1 k da the ca dosage of 0 02 0 04 g g ts induced weak changes in mw but the ca dosage of 0 06 0 10 g g ts caused a sudden decrease in ha to that with a main mw of 753 748 k da 171 130 k da and 3 8 2 3 k da in addition as shown in table 2 the proportion of the macromolecular fractions over 100 kda also drastically decreased after ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts which were 56 0 for 959 kda and 11 9 for 192 kda in the untreated is but declined to 45 7 49 1 for 753 748 kda and 8 9 11 2 for 171 130 kda at 0 06 0 10 g g ts table 2 accompanied by the destruction in macromolecular ha by ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts the fraction of small molecular ha mw 10 kda increased from 19 8 in the untreated is to 26 0 36 8 in ca treated is meanwhile the pd of small molecule ha also increased from 3 6 to 4 9 5 7 suggesting that the small molecule ha was more diverse in ca treated is at 0 06 0 10 g g ts it should be noted that supramolecular ha assembles bioactive fragments with low mw around the core structures of o aryl and quinones via low energy bonds morais et al 2020 nuzzo et al 2013 piccolo et al 2003 2019 trevisan et al 2010 thus the downward of the macromolecular fraction in ha with the increase in the amount and diversity of small fragments after ca treatment represent that the low energy bonds in between were destroyed so that the original supramolecular ha could be deconstructed further results revealed that such ha deconstruction only effectively occurred when ca dosage reached an adequate level in the present study which referred to 0 06 0 10 g g ts for the cases moreover among the three ca dosages 0 08 g g ts induced the most severe ha deconstruction as indicated by the lowest macromolecular fraction and the most abundant small fragments with the highest pd fig 3c table 2 as for the macromolecular fraction of ha became slightly loosened with mw reduction under ca of 0 10 g g ts it can be inferred that the excessive protonation of o containing groups on the aromatic structures of ha at that high ca level resulting in the formation of hydrogen bonds between aromatic moieties thus stretching the distance from each other liu et al 2015 tang et al 2021 the variation in the molecular aromaticity and depolymerization of ha in ca treated is were also monitored using uv vis absorption analysis as shown in fig 3d the ha in ca treated is with 0 08 g g ts showed the highest normalized uv vis absorption at 253 nm 285 nm and 396 nm which indicated that the ha has the greatest proportion of aromatic rings and conjugated dienes 253 nm and 285 nm and the reduced forms of quinones 396 nm piccolo et al 2019 rau et al 2002 moreover with a ca dosage of 0 08 g g ts the ha in treated is had the largest uv vis absorption ratio at 465 nm to that at 665 nm i e the e4 e6 ratio representing the most significant mw reduction and polydispersity improvement morais et al 2020 penghui and hur 2017 piccolo et al 2019 these results highly corresponded to the greatest ha deconstruction in is with ca treatment at 0 08 g g ts as mentioned above furthermore the high polydispersity reflected ca treatment at 0 08 g g ts could hinder the formation of intermolecular low energy bonds connecting ha cores with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments as a result instead of aggregating into stable structures with a high polymerization degree the aromatic and conjugated cores in ha were exposed by relieving the encirclement of hydrophilic groups in summary how ca treatment affects ha in is would depend on the ca dosing rate under a low ca dosing rate ha pn crosslinking can be damaged but ha deconstruction can only occur when the ca dosage reaches a threshold level more importantly an adequate ca dosage might prevent the reformation of metal bridges and molecular low energy bonds and shape the sludge ha characterized with a large amount of aromatic and conjugated groups but a low polymerization degree such ca dosage dependent ha structure alteration may induce ha spatial redistribution in sludge flocs to be discussed in section 3 4 which may explain the considerable enhancement in sludge solubilization and hydrolysis under a certain dosing rate 3 4 the spatial distribution of ha fractions in sludge flocs shifts at different ca dosing rates 3 4 1 the shifting of ha distribution revealed by quantitative analyses and eem spectroscopy the ha redistribution in the flocs of is after ca treatment could be found by the quantitative changes of ha in the soluble phase sp and extracellular polymeric substances eps hereafter called sp ha and eps ha as shown in fig 4 a with a ca dosage of 0 02 g g ts sp ha considerably increased while eps ha significantly decreased compared to that in untreated is suggesting that the low dosage of 0 02 g g ts might induce ha to shift from eps to sp meanwhile the total amount of ha drastically dropped after ca treatment at 0 02 g g ts as the modified lowry method also calculates the cross linked pn in ha quantification frolund et al 1995 the decline in total ha can be explained by the release of pn due to pn ha crosslinking damage caused by ca treatment as discussed in section 3 3 1 moreover as the ca dosage increased to 0 04 g g ts the sp ha and eps ha turned down together indicating the pn ha decrosslinking also occurred in sp ha with ca increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts total ha decreased to a stable level however sp ha decreased to a value lower than that in untreated is with eps ha increasing accordingly this result could be highly explained by that with the adequate ca dosage the ha released to sp could migrate toward the eps again as discussed in section 3 3 2 under ca dosages of 0 06 0 10 g g ts aromatic and conjugated cores in ha could be exposed which were relieved from the encirclement of outer fragments thus the driving force of ha redistribution to eps may be the π π interaction force hydrophobic interaction between aromatic and conjugated groups in both eps and sp the ha and pn redistributed in eps and sp after ca treatment were further explored using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy according to the eem spectra fig 4b when the ca dosage increased from 0 to 0 04 g g ts the intensities of both ha and pn peaks in eps were enhanced as discussed above under such ca dosing rates the ha in eps was shifted to sp fig 4a thus the enhancement of ha and pn peaks is probably attributed to the alleviation of metal masking effects on the fluorescence signal due to the obm reduction fig s2 tang et al 2020 it has been reported that some metal organic complexes can quench the fluorescence of organic matter as complexes are formed involving fluorescent binding sites antunes et al 2007 coble 2014 however when ca dosing rate further increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts the intensities of ha peaks in eps were still enhanced along with increased ca dosage even though the obm reduction became negligible fig s2 moreover compared to the unique ha in control is ex em 334 336 nm 412 423 nm one new ha peak appeared with longer ex and em ex em 366 368 nm 446 451 nm the fluorescent redshift suggested the accumulation of thick rings in planar network structures and enhanced delocalization degree of π electrons ishii and boyer 2012 kim et al 2018 romera castillo et al 2014 results further support ha reaggregating to eps at adequate ca dosages meanwhile the intensities of ha and pn peaks in sp also altered accordingly as the ca dosing rate increased from 0 to 0 04 g g ts both ha and pn peak intensities were enhanced confirming that the ha and pn originally in eps were released in sp surprisingly as the ca dosage increased to 0 06 g g ts the ha peaks in sp almost disappeared this corresponded highly to the quantitative result shown in fig 4a that sp ha drastically declined under ca treatment at 0 06 0 10 g g ts to that below the level in untreated is as well as the ha peak enhancement in eps recorded in fig 4b this result confirmed that the aromatic skeleton in ha could be released into sp in the form of ha pn at low ca dosage and once they were relieved from the encirclement of outer fragments at proper high ca dosage they could transfer into eps again thus contributing to the formation of new eps ha with higher condensed aromatic structures than the original one 3 4 2 thermodynamic analyses further confirmed the feasibility of ha reaggregation from sp into eps under high ca dosing rates to further verify whether the aromatic structures from ha in sp can spontaneously transfer into eps the adsorption tests of ca treated sp by eps were conducted and the thermodynamic parameters were analyzed for the binding force the adsorption of ha was tracked based on the ha signal in the eem spectra pan et al 2010 wang et al 2012 of sp just after ca treatment ha sp0 and of sp left in the system when the adsorption was finished ha spend the results showed that under the ca dosing rate of 0 06 0 10 g g ts the ha in the sp could be adsorbed by eps as indicated by a lower ha spend than ha sp0 in these cases fig s4 the amount of ha adsorbed by eps when reaching the same equilibrium concentration followed the trend of ca0 08 ca0 10 ca0 06 at both 298 k and 310 k fig 4c fitting the results with the freundlich adsorption isotherm showed the adsorptive capacity reflected by the binding constant of kf was also in the order of ca0 08 ca0 10 ca0 06 at 298 k and 310 k fig 4c according to the kf variation in response to temperature changes thermodynamic parameters of gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs can be determined as shown in fig 4d the δg for the adsorption were negative suggesting that ha reaggregation from sp into eps at ca dosing rates of 0 06 0 10 g g ts were thermodynamically spontaneous further with ca dosing rate of 0 06 0 08 g g ts δs and δh were positive and which directly suggested the hydrophobic interaction force led to the migration of ha sp0 into eps however at ca dosage of 0 10 g g ts the negative δs implied the increased hydrogen bonds among reaggregated ha thus making them more ordered so as not to closely connect with each other liu et al 2015 tang et al 2021 3 5 the proposed mechanisms of how solubilization and hydrolysis during sludge anaerobic digestion are affected by ca treatment based on the results above of ha reconstruction and redistribution in the sludge varying from ca dosing rates the mechanisms of how modified ha affects sludge solubilization and hydrolysis during sludge ad are proposed and illustrated in fig 5 a specifically at ca dosing rate of 0 02 0 04 g g ts along with the collapse of metal bridges the ha in eps could be relieved into sp meanwhile ha pn crosslinking can be damaged so that pn portion can also be relieved functionally the released ha in sp might serve as the surfactant promoting the solubilization of organics and the surfactant property of ha was already improved at low ca dosages as suggested by the decreased cmc table 1 liu et al 2015 thus the sludge solubilization could be enhanced at the initial stage when the ca treated is 0 02 0 04 g g ts was mixed with the rs fig 2 notably as hydrolases are pn in nature the pn release highly corresponded to the improvement of the activities of hydrolases and thus sludge hydrolysis was also promoted at the initial stage fig 2b however upon entering the ad process the ha in sp would combine with hydrolases again through hydrophobic interactions or re established metal bridges to inhibit sludge hydrolysis since the ha in sludge sp after ca treatment at 0 02 0 04 g g ts was higher than that in untreated sludge fig 4a more hydrolases were likely to be trapped by ha thus the activities of typical hydrolases in ca0 02 ad ca0 04 ad were lower than those in n ad fig 2b and consequently methane production was also limited fig 1 however when the ca dosage further increased to 0 06 0 10 g g ts not only pn ha crosslinking could be damaged but the low energy bonds between the cores of o aryl quinones and fragments of amino carboxylic and alkyl groups might also be destroyed as a result ha was deconstructed and the small fragments were significantly dispersed into sp which are greater surfactants to enhance sludge solubilization than the whole released ha at low dosages additionally accompanied by the removal of encircled small fragments the aromatic conjugated cores of ha in sp could be exposed and migrate to eps due to π π interaction forces fig 5a thus for ad process the recombination of ha and pn like substrate and hydrolases in sp can be alleviated meanwhile when more original cores of ha i e o aryl quinones redistributed into eps the surface of the eps became more negatively charged costa et al 2018 to repel the pn and prevent binding effects on pn thus when the ca dosages were 0 06 0 10 g g ts the hydrolases which are also pn in nature can be kept free in sp during ad processes and the sludge hydrolysis rate could be enhanced for a long period among these three dosages 0 08 g g ts induced the highest improvement in both sludge solubilization and hydrolysis fig 2 and consequently led to the greatest methane production fig 1 when the ca dosage further increased to 0 10 g g ts the migration of o aryl quinone groups into eps weakened slightly due to the excessive formation of hydrogen bonds thus the sludge solubilization hydrolysis and consequent methane production were less significantly improved than those in the case of the ca dosage at 0 08 g g ts 3 6 application perspectives of ca treatment technology for enhancing methane production in sludge anaerobic digestion this study demonstrates that ca treatment directly on the sludge in an anaerobic digestor can effectively enhance methane generation with a much more significant enhancement than that achieved with ca treatment on raw sludge the promotion of methane production can be ascribed to enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis because of ha deconstruction and redistribution in digestor sludge flocs after ca treatment on the contrary in the way of conducting ca pretreatment on rs the major ha inhibition on ad since most ha exist in ad sludge cannot be relieved considering future extensive application the preliminary estimation of ca consumption and cost to treat per ton of ad dry solids can be us 52 68 ca market price at real time corresponding to ca dosage of 0 08 g g ts with the highest methane production in the present study in addition as ca can be generated by microbial fermentation of carbohydrates developing in situ ca generation from carbohydrates in sludge is promising to further increase the economic benefits regarding further design for the application as ca is easily degraded ca is required to periodically add into the ad reactor to continuously solve ha induced inhibition the optimal ca dosage added is also critical to maintaining superior methane production according to the mechanisms this study found the optimal ca dosage should result in destructing low energy bonds in ha as much as possible and ensure aromatic and conjugated groups of ha formed in sp to migrate into eps fig 5a to achieve these goals as eem method used in this study was sensitive and reliable an eem based online system monitoring soluble ha and pn in the digestor and a smart mutex switch operational strategy for ca treatment and rs feeding can be proposed fig 5b specifically during the regular operation of ad the filtrate 0 45 μm of sludge in ad will be monitored using eem if the intensities of ha peaks were significant while the number of pn peaks decreased the sludge in the digestor would be treated using ca before the next feeding of raw sludge in the present study the ca dosage is recommended as 0 08 g g ts but it can be adjusted according to different sludge properties therefore the ca dosage can be determined by a simple trial and the one expected to result in eem spectra with the lowest intensities of ha peaks and highest intensities of pn after treatment can be considered proper this is because such spectra indicated that hydrolases bound in eps can be released as much as possible and the aromatic moieties in ha were reaggregated into eps thus preventing inhibition effects i e binding hydrolases during ad after ca treatment the ad could be switched back to routine operation by feeding the raw sludge until the next treatment event as indicated by the eem spectra the application of ca treatment is superior to being environmentally friendly as it is a nontoxic and biodegradable chemical peng et al 2018 that would not accumulate in the sludge fig s5 moreover it should also be noted that future investigations on continuously operated ad are expected to be conducted to fully establish the proposed technology the promotion of methane production can be ascribed to enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis because of ha deconstruction and redistribution in sludge flocs after ca treatment thus it is worth studying related promoting effects of ca treatment such as on regulating the ha role of electron shuttle and microbial population in future to obtain a more comprehensive understanding because which might be caused by increased available substrates and hydrolase via ha deconstruction and redistribution in addition we are planning to proceed with the pilot scale dosage adjustment technology to verify whether the eem spectrometry recommended by laboratory results is also available finally the results of this study revealed that the ha produced and accumulated in ad poses a more adverse impact on methane production compared to ha in raw sludge evidenced by ca treatment on raw sludge cannot significantly increase methane production fig 1b thus when developing technology to enhance methane production in ad in the future more attention should be given to ha quantity and properties produced and accumulated in ad rather than that in raw sludge 4 conclusion humic acids can be in situ produced during sludge anaerobic digestion process and pose inhibitory effects on methane production but it lacks an effective method to cope with such inhibition this study for the first time demonstrated that using adequate citric acid ca treatment directly on the sludge in the anaerobic digester is promising to allivate the inhibitory effect caused by the in situ produced ha the experimental results showed that methane production after ca treatment can reach 2 89 times of that generated in control ad without ca treatment and 2 08 times of that achieved by contrast ad of ca treated raw sludge the main mechanisms are ascribed to that ca treatment at adequate dosage can i enhance sludge solubilization via collapsing ha pn binding structures to release surfactant ha fragments and ii boost hydrolysis efficiency via relieving hydrolases and maintain their activities during the ad process by immobilizing aromatic ha cores in extracellular substances on this basis a smart mutex switch operational ca treatment strategy was proposed the results of this study are
