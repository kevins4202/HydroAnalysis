3380,as wildfires become more frequent and severe there are concerns regarding their impacts on water yield from forested catchments while there are many studies in australia about the effects of individual wildfires on streamflow at fine scales 1 km2 in specific geographic settings the effects of wildfire regimes on streamflow at broad spatial scales across temperate forests in australia are not well understood in this paper we combined climate wildfire streamflow records 1975 to 2018 topographic and landcover data from 92 catchments 74 4740 km2 in the australian temperate zone to quantify the contribution of wildfire regimes over time to streamflow variability in different hydroclimatic settings humid dry sub humid and semi arid and geographic regions southeast australia sea southwest western australia swwa and tasmania tas wildfire regimes were represented by two metrics the burnt area to drainage area bda ratio for wildfire events in each year and a spatially averaged metric of time since fire tsf which is a spatial average of time since the last wildfire in the catchment by comparing prefire and postfire runoff ratios our study found that on average there was a short term increase in runoff ratio 3 in year 1 and 6 in year 2 post fire after wildfires with bda 25 no influence of fire was found in the long term 15 20 years after the wildfire runoff ratio we found that wildfire regime measured by tsf explained 8 8 of the variation in annual streamflow across the australian temperate zone and that with decreasing tsf i e increased wildfire impact the average streamflow increased streamflow variation explained by wildfire regimes varied with hydroclimate the explained variance of streamflow by wildfire regimes in semi arid catchments 23 and dry sub humid catchments 13 were higher than humid catchments 5 our results provide a broad scale understanding of how wildfire regimes influence streamflow variability at broad temporal and spatial scales and provided important context and baseline information for determining the implications of changes in climate and fire regimes for regional water availability keywords wildfires streamflow temperate forests water availability 1 introduction wildfires are increasingly altering forest hydrology in fire prone regions bladon et al 2014 hallema et al 2018 krawchuk et al 2009 robinne et al 2018 robinne et al 2021 these alterations appear to be increasing in both frequency and magnitude due to the intensification of wildfire activity driven by more extreme fire weather under climate change canadell et al 2021 dowdy 2018 head et al 2014 in southeast australia sea for example the recent millennium drought from 1997 to 2009 was associated with three mega fire events which impacted over four million hectares of forested catchments cameron et al 2009 mccarthy et al 2012 the unprecedented wildfire events of 2019 2020 were also linked to widespread drought nolan et al 2020 resulting in approximately five million hectares burned in sea filkov et al 2020 these events in sea have been mirrored by an increase in the frequency of large fire events in the western us and parts of europe holden et al 2018 seidl et al 2014 westerling 2016 the links between droughts and fire are of concern as climate change projections for temperate australia predict the region to become drier and hotter in the future and experience a higher number of extreme wildfires canadell et al 2021 clarke evans 2019 hasson et al 2009 hennessy et al 2005 lucas et al 2007 suppiah et al 2007 fire can cause major changes to hydrologic functioning in forested catchments the response of water yield to wildfires is influenced by interconnected hydrological and ecological mechanisms hallema et al 2018 wildfires affect evapotranspiration by changing the complexity and structure of the forests benyon et al 2015 ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2014b streamflow responses have been investigated in australia however studies have typically focused on the impacts of individual wildfires on streamflow in catchments within a specific geographic location and at relatively small scales using paired catchment designs benyon et al 2015 brookhouse et al 2013 buckley et al 2012 feikema et al 2013 gharun et al 2013 kuczera 1987 lane et al 2006 lane et al 2010 loiselle et al 2020 nolan et al 2015 webb jarrett 2013 the impact of fire on streamflow and water availability at larger scales in australia has not been investigated to the same extent however the increasing incidence of fire in many environments has driven research in this area in recent years particularly in the western us hallema et al 2017 hallema et al 2018 niemeyer et al 2020 robinne et al 2021 as large scale fire events often occur during dry or drought conditions they typically coincide with periods when water resources are already under stress understanding how wildfire may exacerbate the effect of drought on water availability is critical for planning and setting long term strategies in forest and fire management to optimize for outcomes around water availability to a significant extent understanding of the impact on streamflow from wildfires in australia has been shaped by the work of kuczera 1987 in a completely burnt montane ash forest mainly eucalyptus regnans and e delegatensis catchment there can be an initial short term increase in streamflow lane et al 2006 watson et al 2001 prior to a flow decrease although this may or may not occur depending on the depth of soil moisture deficits and pre and post fire precipitation feikema et al 2013 kuczera 1987 tan et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 in montane ash forests the long term hydrological responses of catchments burnt in their entirety are believed to follow the kuczera curve which indicates a substantial decrease up to 50 for a period 20 30 years after a stand replacing fire kuczera 1987 this is followed by a recovery of the water yield to the pre fire levels over the next 100 200 years brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 langford 1976 vertessy et al 2001 watson et al 1999 the reason for this response is the fire ecology of the species they are obligate seeders that typically produce a dense single age stand following high severity crown fires that result in widespread tree mortality that then vigorously compete for resources before self thinning is complete ashton 1976 trouv√© et al 2017 more recent work focusing on the post fire hydrology of other eucalypt species that are considered fire tolerant e g gharun et al 2013 heath et al 2014 nolan et al 2014a nolan et al 2014b 2015 have shown a much more subdued streamflow response outside forests that are dominated by obligate seeders varying responses have also been reported for instance nolan et al 2015 found a moderate streamflow decline for 1 4 years and then a return to background levels within 8 to 12 years while heath et al 2014 found no significant change in flow from multiple catchments lane et al 2006 observed a 70 flow increase in the first 2 years post fire some studies however point towards more complex response is dependent on patterns of fire severity in a disturbed catchment for example in three catchments covered with both ash and mixed eucalypt species in southeast australia hydrological models suggested streamflow increased for the first 15 years after wildfire zhou et al 2015 post disturbance streamflow in the yambulla catchments in southeastern new south wales nsw initially showed an increase in streamflow followed by a minor short term reduction in two catchments but not in three others webb jarrett 2013 in contrast a long term reduction in streamflow was modeled to occur after wildfires in the mitta mitta and thomson river catchments which comprise both ash and mixed species forests lane et al 2010 the mixture of responses highlights the role that environmental and geographic variability may play in shaping post fire hydrology most studies investigate this response to a single fire event within specific forest types within a constrained geographic area these settings limit the ability to extrapolate study results to broader scales understanding the impacts of wildfire regimes on water yield across multiple fires and catchments at the regional scale is a critical knowledge gap particularly when concerns about the influence of recent and future wildfires on water resources in the australian temperate zone are largely due to the historical response of whole burnt montane ash forests however only a minority of forested catchments in this region are dominated by ash type eucalyptus forests this lack of a generalized understanding of the impact of fire on streamflow in australia has become acute in the context of the questions speculation around the effects of the unprecedented 2019 2020 fires for planning and management of water resources there is a strong demand for clear guidance and predictive capacity to account for large scale wildfire regimes in streamflow predictions and water availability assessments bladon et al 2014 maina siirila woodburn 2020 in this research we combined data on wildfire climate precipitation and pet and catchment properties to investigate how historical wildfire regimes have contributed to the variation of annual streamflow in comparison with climate across the australian temperate forest regions we sought to understand the comparative influence of wildfire regimes and climate on streamflow variability across hydroclimatic gradients to provide insights into how potential changes in fire regimes and climate may influence future streamflow importantly the study seeks to understand the role of wildfire regimes within different geographic settings thereby taking into account both the amount of fire activity size and frequency of disturbances and the hydrological effect that they cause as such our objectives are different from earlier studies in this region where the focus has been on unpacking the effects of individual fires within a more constrained experimental setting e g paired catchment studies specifically we asked 1 how does wildfire occurrence extent and frequency vary across forested catchments in temperate australia 2 what influence do wildfire regimes have on the variation of streamflow at a regional scale 3 does the influence of wildfire regimes on streamflow variability vary spatially depending on hydroclimate or vegetation 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was set in the australian temperate zone defined based on the koppen geiger climate classification fig 1 encompassing southeast australia sea tasmania tas and some parts of the southwest of western australia swwa khaledi et al 2022 peel et al 2007 this area in australia accommodates the majority of the australian population with most of the population dependent on drinking water from forested catchments temperate zones worldwide are characterized by distinct seasons with wet winters and dry summers cowling et al 2005 murphy timbal 2008 the australian temperate zone experiences a high temporal and spatial variability in precipitation and streamflow some of which can be attributed to climate variability modes cai et al 2009 chiew mcmahon 2002b khaledi et al 2022 risbey et al 2009 the terrain across the study area is highly variable some catchments within the great dividing range located along the east coast have their headwaters in steep dissected uplands in other catchments such as those located in western victoria and swwa the terrain is less rugged catchments are typically dominated by native eucalyptus forests with variable structure due to spatial variability in climate donohue et al 2009 mok et al 2012 fire bradstock 2009 soils and topography bale et al 1998 dignan bren 2003 forest types range from open woodland to tall wet forests these different types of temperate forests have different tolerance to wildfires fairman et al 2016 for example tall open forests in high precipitation zones are often dominated by ash species mean annual precipitation typically 1200 mm which can be subject to widespread mortality after high severity wildfires fairman et al 2016 noble slatyer 1980 mixed eucalypt species forests on the other hand typically occupy the drier parts of the catchments mean annual precipitation typically 1200 mm and can tolerate high severity wildfires bennett et al 2016 mortality rates following severe wildfire in mixed eucalypt species forests are generally low but can range from 10 to 47 collins 2020 etchells et al 2020 fairman et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow streamflow data from 1975 to 2018 for 92 catchments were obtained from hydrologic reference stations hrs and water data online bureau of meteorology 2019a 2019b hrs has 222 sites and is a subset of water data online which provides high quality streamflow data maintained by bom according to strict criteria including the condition that streamflow is not affected by upstream diversions and water related developments like dams and irrigation bureau of meteorology 2019b water years definition by bom for these catchments varied however to ensure standardized analysis of all catchments in this study we summarized the annual streamflow according to the calendar year from january to december availability duration and quality of streamflow data among hrs sites are also different for example for st pauls river in tas and mitchell river in swwa streamflow data were recorded since 1988 while for the lodden river in sea and north esk river in tas the streamflow data go back to 1951 missing data among hrs sites is also different ranging from 0 in catchments such as genoa and tambo river in sea to 5 in blackwood river in swwa bom used hydrological models gr4j to fill missing data in the hrs database for the hrs dataset the median uncertainties in the mean response of the available gauged discharge relationship ranged from 4 5 to 4 2 mcmahon peel 2019 to obtain a representative sample of streamflow across the temperate forests within our domain catchments were selected based on the following criteria 1 longest available common duration of recorded streamflow data from 1975 to 2018 2 catchments that had less than 1 missing data and 3 catchments were well distributed spatially across the studied regions based on these criteria a total of 92 catchments were identified out of these 92 catchments 88 were from hrs sites the remaining four anson rivers sea canning river dombakup brook and shannon river swwa were downloaded from water data online while using geographic regions based on the koppen geiger climate classification is logical in terms of investigating the spatial distribution of hydrologic impacts the climate heterogeneity within these regions warrants an additional stratification based on hydroclimate characteristics of the catchments to this end we classified selected catchments based on the hydroclimate classes defined by koppa et al 2021 based on budyko s water and energy balance constraints and aridity index ai pet p where pet is potential evaporation and p is precipitation koppa et al defined five hydroclimate classes for watersheds 1 humid 0 ai 1 5 2 dry sub humid 1 5 ai 2 0 3 semi arid 2 0 ai 5 0 4 arid 5 0 ai 33 3 and 5 hyper arid ai 33 3 in this paper 48 catchments were classified as humid 22 as dry sub humid and 22 as semi arid table 1 more information about the list of catchments in each geographic region and hydroclimate class is available in supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 a shapefile for each catchment was delineated from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 0 004 degrees usgs 2019 the pysheds 0 2 6 python library bartos 2018 was used to delineate catchments to delineate the catchments first we filled depressions to remove any imperfections or cells that did not have an associated drainage value in the dem and resolved the flats areas in dem second we computed the flow direction by assigning a value to each cell to indicate the direction of flow and flow accumulation this allowed us to delineate the catchments based on the geographic coordinate of the location of the stream gauge wildfire precipitation pet topography and landcover data were extracted for the areas defined for each catchment we used python 3 7 3 and python packages pandas 0 24 2 package mckinney 2010 to organize the data 2 2 2 wildfires available recorded wildfire data location extent and date for each catchment were extracted from fire history datasets for sea swwa and tas these datasets include wildfires and planned prescribed fires history we extracted wildfires for each study catchment and removed planned prescribed fires delwp department of environment land and water planning has developed a dataset of the spatial extents of fires for the state of victoria in sea since 1903 this layer dataset includes information about both wildfires and delwp planned burn delwp 2020 wildfire dataset for new south wales and queensland other parts of sea was obtained from seed sharing and enabling environmental data in nsw and qpws queensland parks and wildlife service qpws 2020 seed 2020 department of biodiversity conservation and attractions dbca in the government of western australia has provided the spatial extents of fires since 1922 for catchments in swwa dbac 2020 the tasmania government database provided spatial extents of fire history for wildfires in tasmania catchments since 1961 tasmanian government 2020 these fire history datasets were generated using record searches regional fire records and fire history maps and were standardized by their provider to bring them into the usable standard structure delwp 2020 2 2 3 precipitation and pet precipitation and pet data for each catchment was extracted from the daily time series precipitation and pet gridded dataset from the bureau of meteorology bom these datasets are the output of the australian water resource assessment landscape awra l model in netcdf network common data format awra l 2019 netcdf4 1 4 2 phyton library was used to extract precipitation data unidata 2012 precipitation datasets are produced based on precipitation data from 6500 precipitation gauge stations and interpolated to a 0 05 degree grid approximately 5 5 km pet in awra l is calculated on a 0 05 degree national grid using the penman equation penman 1948 using daily gridded minimum and maximum temperature downward solar irradiance and wind speed at 2 m jones et al 2009 mcvicar et al 2008 2 2 4 catchment properties topography and vegetation using the srtm digital elevation model we calculated topographic features elevation slope and a shape parameter of each catchment the shape parameter indicates the gravelius compactness coefficient which is the ratio of the perimeter of the catchment to the circumference of a circle whose area is equal to that of the given drainage basin bendjoudi hubert 2002 landcover vegetation type and distribution data for each catchment was extracted from a continental spatial dataset of forest extent which is compiled by the australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics and sciences abares australia committee 2019 in this dataset the resolution was 100 m and forests were defined as an area dominated by potentially mature trees with a stand height of more than two meters and overstory strata crown cover equal to or greater than 20 percent in this study forests were reclassified into wet forests dry forests woodland and other forests based on forest types classified by abares which represent broad patterns in vegetation composition and structure 2 3 analyses 2 3 1 characterizing wildfire regime in the study catchments two wildfire metrics were derived from fire history records 1 burnt area to drainage area ratio bda and 2 mean time since the last wildfire tsf we used the bda ratio to characterize the extent and frequency of wildfires in each catchment and to define how the wildfire regime varied across the region and what this meant for changes in the precipitation runoff ratio as a result of vegetation loss from wildfire the bda represents the proportion of area burnt for each year in each catchment to calculate the bda ratio we identified all wildfires that occurred each year from 1975 to 2018 in each catchment all wildfires in each year were merged and the total area burnt area burnt within a catchment was calculated then the bda ratio was calculated by dividing the total area burnt in a year by the catchment area eq 1 we defined wildfires with bda 1 in geographic and hydroclimate classes of the australian temperate zone and investigated how the number and extent of wildfires spatially vary among these regions 1 bda i i n aw i s 100 where bda i for year i is the ratio of the whole area burnt by all wildfires in that year to the drainage area aw i a w 1 aw 2 aw n which is the area of each wildfire from iton in each year s is the area of the catchment or drainage area mean tsf quantifies the spatially average of time since the last wildfire in the catchment and is a measure of the wildfire history this metric accounts for the area burned and the timing of past wildfires the mean tsf was used to analyze the spatial and temporal impacts of past wildfire occurrence on streamflow the tsf metric was calculated as the mean time since the last fire for all cells resolution 0 004 degrees within a catchment for each catchment the calculation was initiated in 1900 and includes all available wildfire history of catchments in each region in our datasets for each year in each catchment a grid was generated representing the burnt area pixel value 0 and unburnt area pixel value 1 of the grid the routine for calculating mean tsf was initiated on each grid by setting all cells inside the catchment area to 1 initial unburnt layer u to confine the catchment border from surrounding areas inside the grid and then applying the burnt areas in 1900 and setting fire affected cells to 0 eq 2 in other words tsf in those cells that were fire affected is 0 years while all other cells are tsf from the previous years plus 1 year this process was repeated for each year eq 3 such that each cell in the catchment has a value of tsf which represents the number of years since that cell was burned the process was repeated for all years up to 2018 eq 4 for year 1 2 a 1 u y 1 where u is the initial unburnt layer to confine the catchment area inside the grid layer y 1 is the grid catchment in year 1 a 1 is the catchment grid after applying the initial unburnt layer for subsequent years 3 a i a i 1 y i y i y i is the grid catchment in year i for the years y from 2 to n y 2 y 3 y n a i is the catchment grid after applying a i 1 for a i from 2 to n a 2 a 3 a n 4 tsf i j m c j a i n where tsf i is the mean time since fire for year i and i 1 2 3 n j 0 1 2 m which is the value of each cell in the catchment grid a i j m c j a i is the sum of all cell values c j within the catchment grid and c j a i is the cell values in the grid a i n is the total number of cells within the catchment grid we generated tsf using the whole wildfire history but in our analysis we used tsf values from 1975 to 2018 in accordance with the streamflow record by initiating the routine in 1900 the legacy of fire before 1975 is included in the analysis in cases where all cells were burnt between 1900 and 1975 the tsf metric in each cell from 1975 onwards represents a true value on time since the last fire for cases where cells did not have fire in the preceding period the value is set to the maximum value of 118 2 3 2 defining the contribution of wildfires effects to regional streamflow variation the effects of wildfire on precipitation runoff ratio were investigated using the bda ratio and the contribution of wildfires to streamflow variation was investigated using tsf metrics first we examined the post fire streamflow response for each wildfire in relation to the bda ratio eq 5 for each catchment we calculated the annual precipitation runoff ratio for each year the mean annual precipitation runoff ratio for five years before the fire event was calculated the change to the precipitation runoff ratio for the first second third fourth and fifth years after the fire was calculated by subtracting the precipitation runoff ratio of these years from the mean annual precipitation runoff ratio of five years before the fire this quantifies the magnitude of change in each year after the fire relative to the prefire runoff ratio the 5 year window represented the short term change for long term change we repeated the analyses for the years from the sixteenth to the twentieth after the fire 5 d i q i q where d i is the measure of the change in postfire q i and prefire q runoff ratio for year i after the fire q i is the runoff ratio for year i after the fire q i 5 q m i 5 which is the mean annual runoff ratio for five years before the fire m is the year that the wildfire occurred in the catchment second we used the tsf metric to quantify the contribution of observed wildfire history along with other factors to streamflow variability the absolute and relative influence of wildfires hydroclimate precipitation and pet and catchment information shape parameter mean elevation mean slope and vegetation types and distribution on annual streamflow variation were investigated using a linear regression model a quadratic model random forest rf and gradient boosting models gbms rf is a bagging ensemble learning method that constructs multiple classifiers or regressor trees and aggregates their results breiman 2001 2002 gbm is a boosting ensemble machine learning method that provides a strong predictive model using a sequence of adding models to the ensemble where subsequent models correct the performance of prior models friedman 2001 rf and gbm have been used in hydrological studies such as runoff predictions wildfire effects on water yield soil moisture estimation and debris flow susceptibility assessment di et al 2019 hallema et al 2018 li et al 2016 ni et al 2020 tyralis et al 2019 wei et al 2019 different models were used to test if the influence of wildfires on streamflow were consistent and robust with respect to the model selection data were organized using pandas 0 24 2 python library mckinney 2010 tsf metric streamflow precipitation pet for each catchment vary temporally from year to year but topography and vegetation features are temporally constant and spatially different from catchment to catchment for each catchment the values of the tsf metric streamflow precipitation and pet data were transformed to their z score values z score values were used to develop the linear regression quadratic rf and gbm models using the scikit learn 0 21 2 python library pedregosa et al 2011 a 10 fold cross validation approach was used to develop the models with a 10 fold cross validation approach the dataset is randomly partitioned into 10 equal sized sub datasets nine subsets are randomly chosen and used as training sets and one subset is used to validate the model performance this process was repeated 10 times to fit and test the models for each model we calculated the mean squared error mse and explained variance ev as metrics to evaluate model goodness of fit and assess the influence of wildfires on streamflow the resultant models from the 10 fold cross validation approach were averaged to provide a model averaged estimate for each model type the influence of wildfires hydroclimate and catchment properties on streamflow was investigated in two steps first we modeled the streamflow variability with all factors to define how much variation in streamflow could be explained by these variables second we iteratively removed factors one by one to calculate the absolute and relative influence of each variable in the variation of streamflow the analysis used to determine the influence of wildfire history tsf on streamflow was also used to assess its influence in catchments with bda 20 this second analysis was undertaken to account for potential threshold effects due to the impact of wildfires that impact greater proportions of a catchment stednick 1996 found that forest harvesting needed to impact 20 of the catchment area for a measurable streamflow response to be detected hallema et al 2018 found a similar threshold whereby 19 of the catchment needed to be burned to result in a demonstrable streamflow response 3 results 3 1 fire history and regimes in the study catchments wildfire activity within catchments represented by the proportion of catchment areas burned bda varied both temporally and spatially across hydroclimate classes and geographic regions fig 2 out of the 92 catchments 74 catchments were burnt and 18 remained unburnt throughout the study period across all catchments that experienced wildfire during the study period there were 233 recorded wildfires from 1975 to 2018 with a bda ranging from 1 to 100 in dry sub humid catchments in sea wildfires have occurred almost uniformly from 1975 to 2018 while in humid catchments in this region a higher number of wildfires occurred from 1978 to 1985 and from 2003 to 2009 in swwa wildfires have occurred almost uniformly since 1980 in tas the number of wildfires between 1975 and 2018 was low and skewed towards the end of the period fig s1 to s40 in supplementary information show burnt catchments with bda 20 across all metrics describing the level of fire activity within catchments it appeared that the dry sub humid catchments were subject to more frequent wildfire events than those in humid or semi arid locations table 2 the mean area burnt per wildfire among humid 25 8 wildfire catchments was higher than for dry sub humid 10 9 wildfire and semi arid 8 8 wildfire catchments among geographic regions the frequency of wildfire among catchments in swwa was higher than sea and tas while the extent of wildfires was higher in sea more detail on the spatial variability of wildfires showed a varied distribution of wildfires in each decile of bda fig 3 approximately 77 3 180 out of a total of 233 wildfires of wildfires had a 1 bda 20 and 22 7 53 out of a total of 233 wildfires had bda 20 there were 11 wildfires with bda 100 among humid catchments in sea the maximum bda in tas catchments was 30 in swwa wildfires tend to be frequent and small in extent the bda of 92 of the wildfires is between 1 and 30 this means that more forest is disturbed at any point in time but the size of disturbed areas is typically small the mean tsf for each catchment was examined in relation to the forest cover fig 4 generalized additive models gam were used to investigate these relationships between forest cover with the mean tsf using the gam model we calculated the effective degree of freedom edf r square and p value edf reflects the degree of non linearity of a curve in gam wood 2017 across temperate australia there was a significant relationship between mean tsf and forest cover with edf 4 1 r2 0 63 p 0 001 3 2 wildfires contribution to regional streamflow variation 3 2 1 changes to precipitation runoff ratio as a function of bda analysis of streamflow and bda indicated that following wildfires with 1 bda 25 there was no change in precipitation runoff coefficient fig 5 a following wildfires with 25 bda 50 runoff ratio increased 3 in years 1 6 in year 2 and decreased 1 in year 5 however variation amongst catchment is high relative to the magnitude of change in the mean and these changes were therefore not statistically significant there was no change in the long term 15 to 20 years after the wildfire fig 5b 3 2 2 contribution of wildfire history to streamflow variation across the temperate forests results of the linear regression quadratic rf and gbm models showed that wildfires had a relatively minor influence on streamflow variability fig 6 for the linear regression model the explained variance of streamflow by all factors was 64 and after removing tsf it was 63 this means that the absolute influence of wildfires was 1 and the relative influence was 1 6 results of non linear models quadratic rf and gbm showed that wildfire explained a higher percentage of variation in streamflow for rf and gbm models the relative influence of wildfires on streamflow was 8 8 the models all indicated that streamflow increased with decreasing tsf this suggests that with increasing wildfire activity regional streamflow in the australian temperate zone typically increases precipitation was the main driving factor of temporal streamflow variability followed by the wildfire and then pet the results from rf and gbm models showed that the relative influence of precipitation on temporal streamflow variability was 57 and the relative influence of pet was 4 there was no change in explained variance of streamflow after removing catchment features shape parameter mean elevation mean slope and vegetation types and distribution using a stepwise modeling approach suggesting that at the regional scale their relative influence on streamflow was negligible removing all catchment features and modeling streamflow using only precipitation pet and wildfire resulted in no difference in the explained variance when compared to models containing all factors this means that streamflow variability at the regional scale is largely dependent on the hydroclimate characteristic of the region not the catchment features the maximum effect of wildfire on streamflow was 8 8 in models containing catchment features compared to 6 in models without catchment features this suggests that weak interactions between wildfires and vegetation and or topographic features of catchments are likely occurring 3 2 3 influence of fire history on streamflow within hydroclimate classes and geographic regions the relative influence of wildfires on streamflow based on rf and gbm models among dry sub humid and semi arid catchments was higher than humid catchments and all temperate zone catchments fig 7 this suggests variable effects of wildfires on streamflow across catchments with different hydroclimate conditions the relative influence of precipitation in dry sub humid regions was higher than in humid and semi arid catchments among geographic regions for swwa and tas when precipitation was removed and modeling of streamflow performed using the other features the result was negative values of explained variance this suggests that in swwa and tas all variation in streamflow was explained by precipitation the relative influence of wildfires in sea based on the linear model was 1 5 and based on the quadratic model it was 4 the relative influence of wildfires in sea based on the rf and gbm models was 7 this suggests that the signal in fire across the temperate region is being driven by sea catchments the trained gbm model was used to simulate the impact of tsf on streamflow when all other catchment parameters were held at their mean values fig 8 this simulation reflects the potential of wildfires to influence streamflow variation in any given catchment given its wildfire history only the average explained variance of streamflow from simulation by the model was 8 8 and the standard deviation was 8 2 the average explained variance with a 95 confidence interval was 7 1 10 5 the average explained variance standard deviation for humid catchments were 5 4 5 4 for dry sub humid catchments were 10 7 11 and for semi arid were 14 5 6 the average explained variance standard deviation for sea catchments was 9 3 8 3 for swwa catchments were 7 9 8 3 and for tas were 6 7 1 the analysis found that wildfire could contribute up to a maximum of 25 of the variation in streamflow in some catchments while other catchments exhibited no relationship ev 0 we repeated the analysis with all models to investigate the effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow variability for all temperate catchments there was a weak influence 4 of wildfires on streamflow this was because most 60 of the wildfires with bda 20 were in humid catchments which have a weak 5 influence of wildfires on streamflow fig 7a results from the analysis of the effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow for hydroclimate classes also showed weak effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow among humid catchments for dry sub humid catchments there were near similar results with the bda 1 while for semi arid catchments it increased to 10 of the variance in streamflow one limitation of the analysis of wildfires in sub humid and arid catchments with bda 20 is the sample size there were only 10 dry sub humid catchments and 4 semi arid catchments which had wildfires with bda 20 moreover the majority of wildfires with bda 20 have occurred in the second half of our studied period and predominantly after 2003 moreover the effects of individual wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow in our analysis may be modulated due to calculating the average effects of multiple wildfires across different vegetation types these constraints suggested that understanding the wildfire regime effects on streamflow by splitting the wildfire data to bda 20 and bda 20 is hard to understand 4 discussion wildfires are key disturbance agents in forested catchments in temperate australia with the potential for large impacts on water resources through changes in water quality langhans et al 2016 smith et al 2011 and streamflow feikema et al 2013 lane et al 2006 nolan et al 2015 at the regional scale of our analysis however we found that wildfire had a highly variable influence on streamflow across the australian temperate region catchments vary in hydroclimate vegetation types wildfire regimes and consequently hydrological response to wildfires our analysis of prefire and postfire runoff ratio found that run off ratios increased in some catchments after wildfires while in others it decreased exhibited no change or increased initially and then decreased in others table s4 in supplementary information these contrasting results highlighted the role of heterogeneity in forest composition and structure within and between catchments and the variable impacts that fires can have within and across catchments with a decreasing amount of mean annual precipitation among catchments a higher amount of variability in streamflow was simulated by wildfires this suggests that for catchments in more arid regions there is a greater likelihood that wildfire will contribute more towards interannual variability in streamflow either through larger hydrological effects higher runoff ratio following large individual fires or through the cumulative effects of more frequent fires over time at broader spatial scales our findings highlight that the previously documented decreases of streamflow in mountain ash forests e g brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 langford 1976 vertessy et al 2001 watson et al 1999 and increases in mixed species forests e g lane et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 due to wildfires in individual catchments will be modulated by lower impacts 8 8 at the regional scale particularly where the number of large wildfires and mean area burnt by wildfires within catchments is relatively low see table 2 a majority of the forested catchments in the australian temperate zone are comprised of resprouter dominated forests which are resilient to severe wildfires collins 2020 fairman et al 2019 this resilience leads to resprouting forests often recovering more quickly than montane ash forests in terms of their hydrology gharun et al 2013 nolan et al 2014b 2015 studies from north america wagenbrenner et al 2021 wine et al 2018a have remarked on the variability in system recovery as defined by hydrologic metrics eucalypt forests outside of the ash species are less variable in recovery timeframes and hydrologic equilibrium is generally reached within 5 7 years and frequently less it is noteworthy that on average our analysis on eucalyptus forests suggest a somewhat lower impact of fire than those estimated by hallema et al 2018 14 after wildfires with bda 20 and are consistent with most results of wine et al 2018a 2 14 these studies took a similar approach to this work in terms of a regional approach analyzing large numbers of catchments in the us despite the vast variability in environments forest type vegetation recovery dynamics and fire severity these data suggest there are commonalities in fire streamflow relationships at broad spatial scales our analysis of the prefire and postfire change in runoff ratio as a function of the bda ratio showed that at the regional scale the average short term runoff ratio slightly increased 3 in year 1 and 6 in year 2 post fire after wildfires with bda 25 fig 5a very large fires that impact a large proportion of a catchment may have stronger hydrological impacts due to the potential for widespread change in vegetation structure and in some cases soil hydraulic properties the increase in short term runoff did not exhibit any discernable trends with the increase in the bda ratio however the hydrological effects of wildfires are more complex than simply causing an increase in runoff due to increased area burnt this may be due to the influence of fire severity for example in resprouting eucalyptus forests the direction of early change in et seems to be dependent on fire severity through its impact on plant canopy structure and vegetation structure nolan et al 2014b for example nolan et al 2014a 2014b 2015 found medium severity burns produced higher et and lower streamflow whereas a severe burn crown burn had a lower et this was an essential function of leaf recovery rates wildfires also can enhance soil water repellency chen et al 2020 doerr et al 2004 which is a significant factor in post fire runoff generation during high intensity precipitation chen et al 2020 doerr et al 2004 nyman et al 2011 2014 sheridan et al 2007 for changes in water yield however it is likely to be a lower order factor behind et changes at the catchment scale no fire signal was found for the long term runoff ratio fig 5b some of the catchments might be expected to follow the kuczera response and exhibit longer term changes brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 these are hard to detect possibly due to the kuczera effect not being the general case although at this stage there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions regarding the degree with which the kuczera effect is applicable to streamflow prediction at the scales considered in this paper however we note that the hydrological responses of obligate seeders i e ash forests which comprise a small proportion of australian temperate forests may become insignificant when upscaling the hydrological effects of wildfires to large catchments where there is more heterogeneity in forest types and patterns of fire severity in the fire footprint our results for the relationship between forest cover with mean tsf fig 4 showed that in semi arid and dry sub humid catchments with increasing forest cover the mean tsf decreased this suggests that in this type of hydroclimate catchments increased forest cover likely provides a higher amount of fuel to wildfires while an increase in the mean annual precipitation likely promotes the development of fuel loads among humid catchments there were two groups of catchments in one group mostly located in sea with increasing forest cover the mean tsf decreased while there was no relationship in the other group mostly located in tas this also has been reflected in fig 2 it is worth noting that many catchments in sea with high forest cover have been impacted by large mega fires since 2003 the occurrence of these large fires has homogenized the tsf signal in these catchments leading to a lower mean tsf in sea when compared to tas higher lower mean tsf among humid catchments in tas sea suggests a climate driven fire response in tas and a fuel driven fire response among humid catchments in sea the mean annual precipitation in tas 1717 mm catchments was higher than humid catchments in sea 1159 mm the percentage of mean forested area in tas was 71 and in humid catchments in sea was 80 changes in precipitation will lead to changes in streamflow across temperate australia the increased variability in precipitation and consequently in streamflow and increased occurrence of extreme events such as droughts and wildfires have been linked to climate variability modes cai et al 2011 khaledi et al 2022 king et al 2014 mariani fletcher 2016 mariani et al 2016 murphy timbal 2008 risbey et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 and recent climate change chiew mcmahon 2002a di virgilio et al 2019 mcfarlane et al 2012 murphy timbal 2008 ummenhofer et al 2015 in the sea region large wildfires occurred particularly after droughts suggesting moisture as a key control on wildfire activity nolan et al 2020 for example the largest wildfires in sea from 1975 to 2018 were recorded during the millennium drought which has been defined as the longest uninterrupted period with series of years with below median precipitation since 1900 van dijk et al 2013 further impacts are predicted under future climate change chiew mcmahon 2002a petrone et al 2010 silberstein et al 2012 our results and those of hallema et al 2018 and wine et al 2018a suggest changes in fire frequency could lead to increases in streamflow in the study regions the effect of wildfires on streamflow is small however in comparison to the influence of precipitation e g lane et al 2010 wine et al 2018a wine et al 2018b this suggests that climate change driven changes in streamflow could manifest predominately through changes in precipitation rather than changes in fire regimes however the linkages between fire and drought mean there was added complexity that needs to be considered this highlights the importance of understanding the effects of climate drivers on streamflow directly through precipitation or indirectly through droughts and wildfires 5 conclusions while there are many studies about the effects of individual wildfires on streamflow at the catchment scale extrapolating these results to broader scales is problematic due to the role that environmental and geographic variability play in shaping post fire hydrology the effect of wildfires on catchment streamflow has been influenced by research on the mountain and alpine ash forests of victoria the outcomes of this seminal research have raised large concerns about the security of water resources in the australian temperate zone however the research has focused on one forest type that makes up a small proportion of the region s forests and based on assumptions of homogeneity in wildfire impacts and catchment properties our study has highlighted that extrapolating catchment scale and forest type specific models of post fire stream hydrology is not appropriate and that over time and space the stochastic occurrence of wildfires and their influence on streamflow is muted by annual variability in precipitation quantifying the impact of wildfires on water yield at the appropriate scale is important for determining the risk of water resources to changing fire regimes and climate in temperate australia the risks posed by direct impacts of climate change are likely to outweigh the risks posed by climate change driven shifts in fire regimes at the regional scale credit authorship contribution statement jabbar khaledi conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis visualization

3380,as wildfires become more frequent and severe there are concerns regarding their impacts on water yield from forested catchments while there are many studies in australia about the effects of individual wildfires on streamflow at fine scales 1 km2 in specific geographic settings the effects of wildfire regimes on streamflow at broad spatial scales across temperate forests in australia are not well understood in this paper we combined climate wildfire streamflow records 1975 to 2018 topographic and landcover data from 92 catchments 74 4740 km2 in the australian temperate zone to quantify the contribution of wildfire regimes over time to streamflow variability in different hydroclimatic settings humid dry sub humid and semi arid and geographic regions southeast australia sea southwest western australia swwa and tasmania tas wildfire regimes were represented by two metrics the burnt area to drainage area bda ratio for wildfire events in each year and a spatially averaged metric of time since fire tsf which is a spatial average of time since the last wildfire in the catchment by comparing prefire and postfire runoff ratios our study found that on average there was a short term increase in runoff ratio 3 in year 1 and 6 in year 2 post fire after wildfires with bda 25 no influence of fire was found in the long term 15 20 years after the wildfire runoff ratio we found that wildfire regime measured by tsf explained 8 8 of the variation in annual streamflow across the australian temperate zone and that with decreasing tsf i e increased wildfire impact the average streamflow increased streamflow variation explained by wildfire regimes varied with hydroclimate the explained variance of streamflow by wildfire regimes in semi arid catchments 23 and dry sub humid catchments 13 were higher than humid catchments 5 our results provide a broad scale understanding of how wildfire regimes influence streamflow variability at broad temporal and spatial scales and provided important context and baseline information for determining the implications of changes in climate and fire regimes for regional water availability keywords wildfires streamflow temperate forests water availability 1 introduction wildfires are increasingly altering forest hydrology in fire prone regions bladon et al 2014 hallema et al 2018 krawchuk et al 2009 robinne et al 2018 robinne et al 2021 these alterations appear to be increasing in both frequency and magnitude due to the intensification of wildfire activity driven by more extreme fire weather under climate change canadell et al 2021 dowdy 2018 head et al 2014 in southeast australia sea for example the recent millennium drought from 1997 to 2009 was associated with three mega fire events which impacted over four million hectares of forested catchments cameron et al 2009 mccarthy et al 2012 the unprecedented wildfire events of 2019 2020 were also linked to widespread drought nolan et al 2020 resulting in approximately five million hectares burned in sea filkov et al 2020 these events in sea have been mirrored by an increase in the frequency of large fire events in the western us and parts of europe holden et al 2018 seidl et al 2014 westerling 2016 the links between droughts and fire are of concern as climate change projections for temperate australia predict the region to become drier and hotter in the future and experience a higher number of extreme wildfires canadell et al 2021 clarke evans 2019 hasson et al 2009 hennessy et al 2005 lucas et al 2007 suppiah et al 2007 fire can cause major changes to hydrologic functioning in forested catchments the response of water yield to wildfires is influenced by interconnected hydrological and ecological mechanisms hallema et al 2018 wildfires affect evapotranspiration by changing the complexity and structure of the forests benyon et al 2015 ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2014b streamflow responses have been investigated in australia however studies have typically focused on the impacts of individual wildfires on streamflow in catchments within a specific geographic location and at relatively small scales using paired catchment designs benyon et al 2015 brookhouse et al 2013 buckley et al 2012 feikema et al 2013 gharun et al 2013 kuczera 1987 lane et al 2006 lane et al 2010 loiselle et al 2020 nolan et al 2015 webb jarrett 2013 the impact of fire on streamflow and water availability at larger scales in australia has not been investigated to the same extent however the increasing incidence of fire in many environments has driven research in this area in recent years particularly in the western us hallema et al 2017 hallema et al 2018 niemeyer et al 2020 robinne et al 2021 as large scale fire events often occur during dry or drought conditions they typically coincide with periods when water resources are already under stress understanding how wildfire may exacerbate the effect of drought on water availability is critical for planning and setting long term strategies in forest and fire management to optimize for outcomes around water availability to a significant extent understanding of the impact on streamflow from wildfires in australia has been shaped by the work of kuczera 1987 in a completely burnt montane ash forest mainly eucalyptus regnans and e delegatensis catchment there can be an initial short term increase in streamflow lane et al 2006 watson et al 2001 prior to a flow decrease although this may or may not occur depending on the depth of soil moisture deficits and pre and post fire precipitation feikema et al 2013 kuczera 1987 tan et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 in montane ash forests the long term hydrological responses of catchments burnt in their entirety are believed to follow the kuczera curve which indicates a substantial decrease up to 50 for a period 20 30 years after a stand replacing fire kuczera 1987 this is followed by a recovery of the water yield to the pre fire levels over the next 100 200 years brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 langford 1976 vertessy et al 2001 watson et al 1999 the reason for this response is the fire ecology of the species they are obligate seeders that typically produce a dense single age stand following high severity crown fires that result in widespread tree mortality that then vigorously compete for resources before self thinning is complete ashton 1976 trouv√© et al 2017 more recent work focusing on the post fire hydrology of other eucalypt species that are considered fire tolerant e g gharun et al 2013 heath et al 2014 nolan et al 2014a nolan et al 2014b 2015 have shown a much more subdued streamflow response outside forests that are dominated by obligate seeders varying responses have also been reported for instance nolan et al 2015 found a moderate streamflow decline for 1 4 years and then a return to background levels within 8 to 12 years while heath et al 2014 found no significant change in flow from multiple catchments lane et al 2006 observed a 70 flow increase in the first 2 years post fire some studies however point towards more complex response is dependent on patterns of fire severity in a disturbed catchment for example in three catchments covered with both ash and mixed eucalypt species in southeast australia hydrological models suggested streamflow increased for the first 15 years after wildfire zhou et al 2015 post disturbance streamflow in the yambulla catchments in southeastern new south wales nsw initially showed an increase in streamflow followed by a minor short term reduction in two catchments but not in three others webb jarrett 2013 in contrast a long term reduction in streamflow was modeled to occur after wildfires in the mitta mitta and thomson river catchments which comprise both ash and mixed species forests lane et al 2010 the mixture of responses highlights the role that environmental and geographic variability may play in shaping post fire hydrology most studies investigate this response to a single fire event within specific forest types within a constrained geographic area these settings limit the ability to extrapolate study results to broader scales understanding the impacts of wildfire regimes on water yield across multiple fires and catchments at the regional scale is a critical knowledge gap particularly when concerns about the influence of recent and future wildfires on water resources in the australian temperate zone are largely due to the historical response of whole burnt montane ash forests however only a minority of forested catchments in this region are dominated by ash type eucalyptus forests this lack of a generalized understanding of the impact of fire on streamflow in australia has become acute in the context of the questions speculation around the effects of the unprecedented 2019 2020 fires for planning and management of water resources there is a strong demand for clear guidance and predictive capacity to account for large scale wildfire regimes in streamflow predictions and water availability assessments bladon et al 2014 maina siirila woodburn 2020 in this research we combined data on wildfire climate precipitation and pet and catchment properties to investigate how historical wildfire regimes have contributed to the variation of annual streamflow in comparison with climate across the australian temperate forest regions we sought to understand the comparative influence of wildfire regimes and climate on streamflow variability across hydroclimatic gradients to provide insights into how potential changes in fire regimes and climate may influence future streamflow importantly the study seeks to understand the role of wildfire regimes within different geographic settings thereby taking into account both the amount of fire activity size and frequency of disturbances and the hydrological effect that they cause as such our objectives are different from earlier studies in this region where the focus has been on unpacking the effects of individual fires within a more constrained experimental setting e g paired catchment studies specifically we asked 1 how does wildfire occurrence extent and frequency vary across forested catchments in temperate australia 2 what influence do wildfire regimes have on the variation of streamflow at a regional scale 3 does the influence of wildfire regimes on streamflow variability vary spatially depending on hydroclimate or vegetation 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was set in the australian temperate zone defined based on the koppen geiger climate classification fig 1 encompassing southeast australia sea tasmania tas and some parts of the southwest of western australia swwa khaledi et al 2022 peel et al 2007 this area in australia accommodates the majority of the australian population with most of the population dependent on drinking water from forested catchments temperate zones worldwide are characterized by distinct seasons with wet winters and dry summers cowling et al 2005 murphy timbal 2008 the australian temperate zone experiences a high temporal and spatial variability in precipitation and streamflow some of which can be attributed to climate variability modes cai et al 2009 chiew mcmahon 2002b khaledi et al 2022 risbey et al 2009 the terrain across the study area is highly variable some catchments within the great dividing range located along the east coast have their headwaters in steep dissected uplands in other catchments such as those located in western victoria and swwa the terrain is less rugged catchments are typically dominated by native eucalyptus forests with variable structure due to spatial variability in climate donohue et al 2009 mok et al 2012 fire bradstock 2009 soils and topography bale et al 1998 dignan bren 2003 forest types range from open woodland to tall wet forests these different types of temperate forests have different tolerance to wildfires fairman et al 2016 for example tall open forests in high precipitation zones are often dominated by ash species mean annual precipitation typically 1200 mm which can be subject to widespread mortality after high severity wildfires fairman et al 2016 noble slatyer 1980 mixed eucalypt species forests on the other hand typically occupy the drier parts of the catchments mean annual precipitation typically 1200 mm and can tolerate high severity wildfires bennett et al 2016 mortality rates following severe wildfire in mixed eucalypt species forests are generally low but can range from 10 to 47 collins 2020 etchells et al 2020 fairman et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow streamflow data from 1975 to 2018 for 92 catchments were obtained from hydrologic reference stations hrs and water data online bureau of meteorology 2019a 2019b hrs has 222 sites and is a subset of water data online which provides high quality streamflow data maintained by bom according to strict criteria including the condition that streamflow is not affected by upstream diversions and water related developments like dams and irrigation bureau of meteorology 2019b water years definition by bom for these catchments varied however to ensure standardized analysis of all catchments in this study we summarized the annual streamflow according to the calendar year from january to december availability duration and quality of streamflow data among hrs sites are also different for example for st pauls river in tas and mitchell river in swwa streamflow data were recorded since 1988 while for the lodden river in sea and north esk river in tas the streamflow data go back to 1951 missing data among hrs sites is also different ranging from 0 in catchments such as genoa and tambo river in sea to 5 in blackwood river in swwa bom used hydrological models gr4j to fill missing data in the hrs database for the hrs dataset the median uncertainties in the mean response of the available gauged discharge relationship ranged from 4 5 to 4 2 mcmahon peel 2019 to obtain a representative sample of streamflow across the temperate forests within our domain catchments were selected based on the following criteria 1 longest available common duration of recorded streamflow data from 1975 to 2018 2 catchments that had less than 1 missing data and 3 catchments were well distributed spatially across the studied regions based on these criteria a total of 92 catchments were identified out of these 92 catchments 88 were from hrs sites the remaining four anson rivers sea canning river dombakup brook and shannon river swwa were downloaded from water data online while using geographic regions based on the koppen geiger climate classification is logical in terms of investigating the spatial distribution of hydrologic impacts the climate heterogeneity within these regions warrants an additional stratification based on hydroclimate characteristics of the catchments to this end we classified selected catchments based on the hydroclimate classes defined by koppa et al 2021 based on budyko s water and energy balance constraints and aridity index ai pet p where pet is potential evaporation and p is precipitation koppa et al defined five hydroclimate classes for watersheds 1 humid 0 ai 1 5 2 dry sub humid 1 5 ai 2 0 3 semi arid 2 0 ai 5 0 4 arid 5 0 ai 33 3 and 5 hyper arid ai 33 3 in this paper 48 catchments were classified as humid 22 as dry sub humid and 22 as semi arid table 1 more information about the list of catchments in each geographic region and hydroclimate class is available in supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 a shapefile for each catchment was delineated from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 0 004 degrees usgs 2019 the pysheds 0 2 6 python library bartos 2018 was used to delineate catchments to delineate the catchments first we filled depressions to remove any imperfections or cells that did not have an associated drainage value in the dem and resolved the flats areas in dem second we computed the flow direction by assigning a value to each cell to indicate the direction of flow and flow accumulation this allowed us to delineate the catchments based on the geographic coordinate of the location of the stream gauge wildfire precipitation pet topography and landcover data were extracted for the areas defined for each catchment we used python 3 7 3 and python packages pandas 0 24 2 package mckinney 2010 to organize the data 2 2 2 wildfires available recorded wildfire data location extent and date for each catchment were extracted from fire history datasets for sea swwa and tas these datasets include wildfires and planned prescribed fires history we extracted wildfires for each study catchment and removed planned prescribed fires delwp department of environment land and water planning has developed a dataset of the spatial extents of fires for the state of victoria in sea since 1903 this layer dataset includes information about both wildfires and delwp planned burn delwp 2020 wildfire dataset for new south wales and queensland other parts of sea was obtained from seed sharing and enabling environmental data in nsw and qpws queensland parks and wildlife service qpws 2020 seed 2020 department of biodiversity conservation and attractions dbca in the government of western australia has provided the spatial extents of fires since 1922 for catchments in swwa dbac 2020 the tasmania government database provided spatial extents of fire history for wildfires in tasmania catchments since 1961 tasmanian government 2020 these fire history datasets were generated using record searches regional fire records and fire history maps and were standardized by their provider to bring them into the usable standard structure delwp 2020 2 2 3 precipitation and pet precipitation and pet data for each catchment was extracted from the daily time series precipitation and pet gridded dataset from the bureau of meteorology bom these datasets are the output of the australian water resource assessment landscape awra l model in netcdf network common data format awra l 2019 netcdf4 1 4 2 phyton library was used to extract precipitation data unidata 2012 precipitation datasets are produced based on precipitation data from 6500 precipitation gauge stations and interpolated to a 0 05 degree grid approximately 5 5 km pet in awra l is calculated on a 0 05 degree national grid using the penman equation penman 1948 using daily gridded minimum and maximum temperature downward solar irradiance and wind speed at 2 m jones et al 2009 mcvicar et al 2008 2 2 4 catchment properties topography and vegetation using the srtm digital elevation model we calculated topographic features elevation slope and a shape parameter of each catchment the shape parameter indicates the gravelius compactness coefficient which is the ratio of the perimeter of the catchment to the circumference of a circle whose area is equal to that of the given drainage basin bendjoudi hubert 2002 landcover vegetation type and distribution data for each catchment was extracted from a continental spatial dataset of forest extent which is compiled by the australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics and sciences abares australia committee 2019 in this dataset the resolution was 100 m and forests were defined as an area dominated by potentially mature trees with a stand height of more than two meters and overstory strata crown cover equal to or greater than 20 percent in this study forests were reclassified into wet forests dry forests woodland and other forests based on forest types classified by abares which represent broad patterns in vegetation composition and structure 2 3 analyses 2 3 1 characterizing wildfire regime in the study catchments two wildfire metrics were derived from fire history records 1 burnt area to drainage area ratio bda and 2 mean time since the last wildfire tsf we used the bda ratio to characterize the extent and frequency of wildfires in each catchment and to define how the wildfire regime varied across the region and what this meant for changes in the precipitation runoff ratio as a result of vegetation loss from wildfire the bda represents the proportion of area burnt for each year in each catchment to calculate the bda ratio we identified all wildfires that occurred each year from 1975 to 2018 in each catchment all wildfires in each year were merged and the total area burnt area burnt within a catchment was calculated then the bda ratio was calculated by dividing the total area burnt in a year by the catchment area eq 1 we defined wildfires with bda 1 in geographic and hydroclimate classes of the australian temperate zone and investigated how the number and extent of wildfires spatially vary among these regions 1 bda i i n aw i s 100 where bda i for year i is the ratio of the whole area burnt by all wildfires in that year to the drainage area aw i a w 1 aw 2 aw n which is the area of each wildfire from iton in each year s is the area of the catchment or drainage area mean tsf quantifies the spatially average of time since the last wildfire in the catchment and is a measure of the wildfire history this metric accounts for the area burned and the timing of past wildfires the mean tsf was used to analyze the spatial and temporal impacts of past wildfire occurrence on streamflow the tsf metric was calculated as the mean time since the last fire for all cells resolution 0 004 degrees within a catchment for each catchment the calculation was initiated in 1900 and includes all available wildfire history of catchments in each region in our datasets for each year in each catchment a grid was generated representing the burnt area pixel value 0 and unburnt area pixel value 1 of the grid the routine for calculating mean tsf was initiated on each grid by setting all cells inside the catchment area to 1 initial unburnt layer u to confine the catchment border from surrounding areas inside the grid and then applying the burnt areas in 1900 and setting fire affected cells to 0 eq 2 in other words tsf in those cells that were fire affected is 0 years while all other cells are tsf from the previous years plus 1 year this process was repeated for each year eq 3 such that each cell in the catchment has a value of tsf which represents the number of years since that cell was burned the process was repeated for all years up to 2018 eq 4 for year 1 2 a 1 u y 1 where u is the initial unburnt layer to confine the catchment area inside the grid layer y 1 is the grid catchment in year 1 a 1 is the catchment grid after applying the initial unburnt layer for subsequent years 3 a i a i 1 y i y i y i is the grid catchment in year i for the years y from 2 to n y 2 y 3 y n a i is the catchment grid after applying a i 1 for a i from 2 to n a 2 a 3 a n 4 tsf i j m c j a i n where tsf i is the mean time since fire for year i and i 1 2 3 n j 0 1 2 m which is the value of each cell in the catchment grid a i j m c j a i is the sum of all cell values c j within the catchment grid and c j a i is the cell values in the grid a i n is the total number of cells within the catchment grid we generated tsf using the whole wildfire history but in our analysis we used tsf values from 1975 to 2018 in accordance with the streamflow record by initiating the routine in 1900 the legacy of fire before 1975 is included in the analysis in cases where all cells were burnt between 1900 and 1975 the tsf metric in each cell from 1975 onwards represents a true value on time since the last fire for cases where cells did not have fire in the preceding period the value is set to the maximum value of 118 2 3 2 defining the contribution of wildfires effects to regional streamflow variation the effects of wildfire on precipitation runoff ratio were investigated using the bda ratio and the contribution of wildfires to streamflow variation was investigated using tsf metrics first we examined the post fire streamflow response for each wildfire in relation to the bda ratio eq 5 for each catchment we calculated the annual precipitation runoff ratio for each year the mean annual precipitation runoff ratio for five years before the fire event was calculated the change to the precipitation runoff ratio for the first second third fourth and fifth years after the fire was calculated by subtracting the precipitation runoff ratio of these years from the mean annual precipitation runoff ratio of five years before the fire this quantifies the magnitude of change in each year after the fire relative to the prefire runoff ratio the 5 year window represented the short term change for long term change we repeated the analyses for the years from the sixteenth to the twentieth after the fire 5 d i q i q where d i is the measure of the change in postfire q i and prefire q runoff ratio for year i after the fire q i is the runoff ratio for year i after the fire q i 5 q m i 5 which is the mean annual runoff ratio for five years before the fire m is the year that the wildfire occurred in the catchment second we used the tsf metric to quantify the contribution of observed wildfire history along with other factors to streamflow variability the absolute and relative influence of wildfires hydroclimate precipitation and pet and catchment information shape parameter mean elevation mean slope and vegetation types and distribution on annual streamflow variation were investigated using a linear regression model a quadratic model random forest rf and gradient boosting models gbms rf is a bagging ensemble learning method that constructs multiple classifiers or regressor trees and aggregates their results breiman 2001 2002 gbm is a boosting ensemble machine learning method that provides a strong predictive model using a sequence of adding

water yield soil moisture estimation and debris flow susceptibility assessment di et al 2019 hallema et al 2018 li et al 2016 ni et al 2020 tyralis et al 2019 wei et al 2019 different models were used to test if the influence of wildfires on streamflow were consistent and robust with respect to the model selection data were organized using pandas 0 24 2 python library mckinney 2010 tsf metric streamflow precipitation pet for each catchment vary temporally from year to year but topography and vegetation features are temporally constant and spatially different from catchment to catchment for each catchment the values of the tsf metric streamflow precipitation and pet data were transformed to their z score values z score values were used to develop the linear regression quadratic rf and gbm models using the scikit learn 0 21 2 python library pedregosa et al 2011 a 10 fold cross validation approach was used to develop the models with a 10 fold cross validation approach the dataset is randomly partitioned into 10 equal sized sub datasets nine subsets are randomly chosen and used as training sets and one subset is used to validate the model performance this process was repeated 10 times to fit and test the models for each model we calculated the mean squared error mse and explained variance ev as metrics to evaluate model goodness of fit and assess the influence of wildfires on streamflow the resultant models from the 10 fold cross validation approach were averaged to provide a model averaged estimate for each model type the influence of wildfires hydroclimate and catchment properties on streamflow was investigated in two steps first we modeled the streamflow variability with all factors to define how much variation in streamflow could be explained by these variables second we iteratively removed factors one by one to calculate the absolute and relative influence of each variable in the variation of streamflow the analysis used to determine the influence of wildfire history tsf on streamflow was also used to assess its influence in catchments with bda 20 this second analysis was undertaken to account for potential threshold effects due to the impact of wildfires that impact greater proportions of a catchment stednick 1996 found that forest harvesting needed to impact 20 of the catchment area for a measurable streamflow response to be detected hallema et al 2018 found a similar threshold whereby 19 of the catchment needed to be burned to result in a demonstrable streamflow response 3 results 3 1 fire history and regimes in the study catchments wildfire activity within catchments represented by the proportion of catchment areas burned bda varied both temporally and spatially across hydroclimate classes and geographic regions fig 2 out of the 92 catchments 74 catchments were burnt and 18 remained unburnt throughout the study period across all catchments that experienced wildfire during the study period there were 233 recorded wildfires from 1975 to 2018 with a bda ranging from 1 to 100 in dry sub humid catchments in sea wildfires have occurred almost uniformly from 1975 to 2018 while in humid catchments in this region a higher number of wildfires occurred from 1978 to 1985 and from 2003 to 2009 in swwa wildfires have occurred almost uniformly since 1980 in tas the number of wildfires between 1975 and 2018 was low and skewed towards the end of the period fig s1 to s40 in supplementary information show burnt catchments with bda 20 across all metrics describing the level of fire activity within catchments it appeared that the dry sub humid catchments were subject to more frequent wildfire events than those in humid or semi arid locations table 2 the mean area burnt per wildfire among humid 25 8 wildfire catchments was higher than for dry sub humid 10 9 wildfire and semi arid 8 8 wildfire catchments among geographic regions the frequency of wildfire among catchments in swwa was higher than sea and tas while the extent of wildfires was higher in sea more detail on the spatial variability of wildfires showed a varied distribution of wildfires in each decile of bda fig 3 approximately 77 3 180 out of a total of 233 wildfires of wildfires had a 1 bda 20 and 22 7 53 out of a total of 233 wildfires had bda 20 there were 11 wildfires with bda 100 among humid catchments in sea the maximum bda in tas catchments was 30 in swwa wildfires tend to be frequent and small in extent the bda of 92 of the wildfires is between 1 and 30 this means that more forest is disturbed at any point in time but the size of disturbed areas is typically small the mean tsf for each catchment was examined in relation to the forest cover fig 4 generalized additive models gam were used to investigate these relationships between forest cover with the mean tsf using the gam model we calculated the effective degree of freedom edf r square and p value edf reflects the degree of non linearity of a curve in gam wood 2017 across temperate australia there was a significant relationship between mean tsf and forest cover with edf 4 1 r2 0 63 p 0 001 3 2 wildfires contribution to regional streamflow variation 3 2 1 changes to precipitation runoff ratio as a function of bda analysis of streamflow and bda indicated that following wildfires with 1 bda 25 there was no change in precipitation runoff coefficient fig 5 a following wildfires with 25 bda 50 runoff ratio increased 3 in years 1 6 in year 2 and decreased 1 in year 5 however variation amongst catchment is high relative to the magnitude of change in the mean and these changes were therefore not statistically significant there was no change in the long term 15 to 20 years after the wildfire fig 5b 3 2 2 contribution of wildfire history to streamflow variation across the temperate forests results of the linear regression quadratic rf and gbm models showed that wildfires had a relatively minor influence on streamflow variability fig 6 for the linear regression model the explained variance of streamflow by all factors was 64 and after removing tsf it was 63 this means that the absolute influence of wildfires was 1 and the relative influence was 1 6 results of non linear models quadratic rf and gbm showed that wildfire explained a higher percentage of variation in streamflow for rf and gbm models the relative influence of wildfires on streamflow was 8 8 the models all indicated that streamflow increased with decreasing tsf this suggests that with increasing wildfire activity regional streamflow in the australian temperate zone typically increases precipitation was the main driving factor of temporal streamflow variability followed by the wildfire and then pet the results from rf and gbm models showed that the relative influence of precipitation on temporal streamflow variability was 57 and the relative influence of pet was 4 there was no change in explained variance of streamflow after removing catchment features shape parameter mean elevation mean slope and vegetation types and distribution using a stepwise modeling approach suggesting that at the regional scale their relative influence on streamflow was negligible removing all catchment features and modeling streamflow using only precipitation pet and wildfire resulted in no difference in the explained variance when compared to models containing all factors this means that streamflow variability at the regional scale is largely dependent on the hydroclimate characteristic of the region not the catchment features the maximum effect of wildfire on streamflow was 8 8 in models containing catchment features compared to 6 in models without catchment features this suggests that weak interactions between wildfires and vegetation and or topographic features of catchments are likely occurring 3 2 3 influence of fire history on streamflow within hydroclimate classes and geographic regions the relative influence of wildfires on streamflow based on rf and gbm models among dry sub humid and semi arid catchments was higher than humid catchments and all temperate zone catchments fig 7 this suggests variable effects of wildfires on streamflow across catchments with different hydroclimate conditions the relative influence of precipitation in dry sub humid regions was higher than in humid and semi arid catchments among geographic regions for swwa and tas when precipitation was removed and modeling of streamflow performed using the other features the result was negative values of explained variance this suggests that in swwa and tas all variation in streamflow was explained by precipitation the relative influence of wildfires in sea based on the linear model was 1 5 and based on the quadratic model it was 4 the relative influence of wildfires in sea based on the rf and gbm models was 7 this suggests that the signal in fire across the temperate region is being driven by sea catchments the trained gbm model was used to simulate the impact of tsf on streamflow when all other catchment parameters were held at their mean values fig 8 this simulation reflects the potential of wildfires to influence streamflow variation in any given catchment given its wildfire history only the average explained variance of streamflow from simulation by the model was 8 8 and the standard deviation was 8 2 the average explained variance with a 95 confidence interval was 7 1 10 5 the average explained variance standard deviation for humid catchments were 5 4 5 4 for dry sub humid catchments were 10 7 11 and for semi arid were 14 5 6 the average explained variance standard deviation for sea catchments was 9 3 8 3 for swwa catchments were 7 9 8 3 and for tas were 6 7 1 the analysis found that wildfire could contribute up to a maximum of 25 of the variation in streamflow in some catchments while other catchments exhibited no relationship ev 0 we repeated the analysis with all models to investigate the effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow variability for all temperate catchments there was a weak influence 4 of wildfires on streamflow this was because most 60 of the wildfires with bda 20 were in humid catchments which have a weak 5 influence of wildfires on streamflow fig 7a results from the analysis of the effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow for hydroclimate classes also showed weak effects of wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow among humid catchments for dry sub humid catchments there were near similar results with the bda 1 while for semi arid catchments it increased to 10 of the variance in streamflow one limitation of the analysis of wildfires in sub humid and arid catchments with bda 20 is the sample size there were only 10 dry sub humid catchments and 4 semi arid catchments which had wildfires with bda 20 moreover the majority of wildfires with bda 20 have occurred in the second half of our studied period and predominantly after 2003 moreover the effects of individual wildfires with bda 20 on streamflow in our analysis may be modulated due to calculating the average effects of multiple wildfires across different vegetation types these constraints suggested that understanding the wildfire regime effects on streamflow by splitting the wildfire data to bda 20 and bda 20 is hard to understand 4 discussion wildfires are key disturbance agents in forested catchments in temperate australia with the potential for large impacts on water resources through changes in water quality langhans et al 2016 smith et al 2011 and streamflow feikema et al 2013 lane et al 2006 nolan et al 2015 at the regional scale of our analysis however we found that wildfire had a highly variable influence on streamflow across the australian temperate region catchments vary in hydroclimate vegetation types wildfire regimes and consequently hydrological response to wildfires our analysis of prefire and postfire runoff ratio found that run off ratios increased in some catchments after wildfires while in others it decreased exhibited no change or increased initially and then decreased in others table s4 in supplementary information these contrasting results highlighted the role of heterogeneity in forest composition and structure within and between catchments and the variable impacts that fires can have within and across catchments with a decreasing amount of mean annual precipitation among catchments a higher amount of variability in streamflow was simulated by wildfires this suggests that for catchments in more arid regions there is a greater likelihood that wildfire will contribute more towards interannual variability in streamflow either through larger hydrological effects higher runoff ratio following large individual fires or through the cumulative effects of more frequent fires over time at broader spatial scales our findings highlight that the previously documented decreases of streamflow in mountain ash forests e g brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 langford 1976 vertessy et al 2001 watson et al 1999 and increases in mixed species forests e g lane et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 due to wildfires in individual catchments will be modulated by lower impacts 8 8 at the regional scale particularly where the number of large wildfires and mean area burnt by wildfires within catchments is relatively low see table 2 a majority of the forested catchments in the australian temperate zone are comprised of resprouter dominated forests which are resilient to severe wildfires collins 2020 fairman et al 2019 this resilience leads to resprouting forests often recovering more quickly than montane ash forests in terms of their hydrology gharun et al 2013 nolan et al 2014b 2015 studies from north america wagenbrenner et al 2021 wine et al 2018a have remarked on the variability in system recovery as defined by hydrologic metrics eucalypt forests outside of the ash species are less variable in recovery timeframes and hydrologic equilibrium is generally reached within 5 7 years and frequently less it is noteworthy that on average our analysis on eucalyptus forests suggest a somewhat lower impact of fire than those estimated by hallema et al 2018 14 after wildfires with bda 20 and are consistent with most results of wine et al 2018a 2 14 these studies took a similar approach to this work in terms of a regional approach analyzing large numbers of catchments in the us despite the vast variability in environments forest type vegetation recovery dynamics and fire severity these data suggest there are commonalities in fire streamflow relationships at broad spatial scales our analysis of the prefire and postfire change in runoff ratio as a function of the bda ratio showed that at the regional scale the average short term runoff ratio slightly increased 3 in year 1 and 6 in year 2 post fire after wildfires with bda 25 fig 5a very large fires that impact a large proportion of a catchment may have stronger hydrological impacts due to the potential for widespread change in vegetation structure and in some cases soil hydraulic properties the increase in short term runoff did not exhibit any discernable trends with the increase in the bda ratio however the hydrological effects of wildfires are more complex than simply causing an increase in runoff due to increased area burnt this may be due to the influence of fire severity for example in resprouting eucalyptus forests the direction of early change in et seems to be dependent on fire severity through its impact on plant canopy structure and vegetation structure nolan et al 2014b for example nolan et al 2014a 2014b 2015 found medium severity burns produced higher et and lower streamflow whereas a severe burn crown burn had a lower et this was an essential function of leaf recovery rates wildfires also can enhance soil water repellency chen et al 2020 doerr et al 2004 which is a significant factor in post fire runoff generation during high intensity precipitation chen et al 2020 doerr et al 2004 nyman et al 2011 2014 sheridan et al 2007 for changes in water yield however it is likely to be a lower order factor behind et changes at the catchment scale no fire signal was found for the long term runoff ratio fig 5b some of the catchments might be expected to follow the kuczera response and exhibit longer term changes brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 these are hard to detect possibly due to the kuczera effect not being the general case although at this stage there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions regarding the degree with which the kuczera effect is applicable to streamflow prediction at the scales considered in this paper however we note that the hydrological responses of obligate seeders i e ash forests which comprise a small proportion of australian temperate forests may become insignificant when upscaling the hydrological effects of wildfires to large catchments where there is more heterogeneity in forest types and patterns of fire severity in the fire footprint our results for the relationship between forest cover with mean tsf fig 4 showed that in semi arid and dry sub humid catchments with increasing forest cover the mean tsf decreased this suggests that in this type of hydroclimate catchments increased forest cover likely provides a higher amount of fuel to wildfires while an increase in the mean annual precipitation likely promotes the development of fuel loads among humid catchments there were two groups of catchments in one group mostly located in sea with increasing forest cover the mean tsf decreased while there was no relationship in the other group mostly located in tas this also has been reflected in fig 2 it is worth noting that many catchments in sea with high forest cover have been impacted by large mega fires since 2003 the occurrence of these large fires has homogenized the tsf signal in these catchments leading to a lower mean tsf in sea when compared to tas higher lower mean tsf among humid catchments in tas sea suggests a climate driven fire response in tas and a fuel driven fire response among humid catchments in sea the mean annual precipitation in tas 1717 mm catchments was higher than humid catchments in sea 1159 mm the percentage of mean forested area in tas was 71 and in humid catchments in sea was 80 changes in precipitation will lead to changes in streamflow across temperate australia the increased variability in precipitation and consequently in streamflow and increased occurrence of extreme events such as droughts and wildfires have been linked to climate variability modes cai et al 2011 khaledi et al 2022 king et al 2014 mariani fletcher 2016 mariani et al 2016 murphy timbal 2008 risbey et al 2009 ummenhofer et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 and recent climate change chiew mcmahon 2002a di virgilio et al 2019 mcfarlane et al 2012 murphy timbal 2008 ummenhofer et al 2015 in the sea region large wildfires occurred particularly after droughts suggesting moisture as a key control on wildfire activity nolan et al 2020 for example the largest wildfires in sea from 1975 to 2018 were recorded during the millennium drought which has been defined as the longest uninterrupted period with series of years with below median precipitation since 1900 van dijk et al 2013 further impacts are predicted under future climate change chiew mcmahon 2002a petrone et al 2010 silberstein et al 2012 our results and those of hallema et al 2018 and wine et al 2018a suggest changes in fire frequency could lead to increases in streamflow in the study regions the effect of wildfires on streamflow is small however in comparison to the influence of precipitation e g lane et al 2010 wine et al 2018a wine et al 2018b this suggests that climate change driven changes in streamflow could manifest predominately through changes in precipitation rather than changes in fire regimes however the linkages between fire and drought mean there was added complexity that needs to be considered this highlights the importance of understanding the effects of climate drivers on streamflow directly through precipitation or indirectly through droughts and wildfires 5 conclusions while there are many studies about the effects of individual wildfires on streamflow at the catchment scale extrapolating these results to broader scales is problematic due to the role that environmental and geographic variability play in shaping post fire hydrology the effect of wildfires on catchment streamflow has been influenced by research on the mountain and alpine ash forests of victoria the outcomes of this seminal research have raised large concerns about the security of water resources in the australian temperate zone however the research has focused on one forest type that makes up a small proportion of the region s forests and based on assumptions of homogeneity in wildfire impacts and catchment properties our study has highlighted that extrapolating catchment scale and forest type specific models of post fire stream hydrology is not appropriate and that over time and space the stochastic occurrence of wildfires and their influence on streamflow is muted by annual variability in precipitation quantifying the impact of wildfires on water yield at the appropriate scale is important for determining the risk of water resources to changing fire regimes and climate in temperate australia the risks posed by direct impacts of climate change are likely to outweigh the risks posed by climate change driven shifts in fire regimes at the regional scale credit authorship contribution statement jabbar khaledi conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis visualization

3381,cut off walls have proven to be an effective countermeasure for mitigating seawater intrusion si however construction of cut off walls may lead to upstream accumulation of nitrate contaminants in coastal aquifers while stratified geological heterogeneities are widely present in coastal areas how they may influence nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls remains poorly understood in the present study we employ variable density coupling with reactive transport numerical models to understand and quantify the dynamic changes of salinity and no3 in layered heterogeneous coastal aquifers in the presence of cut off walls our comprehensive simulation results indicate that aquifer heterogeneities are a primary factor in regulating nitrate accumulation for example the presence of a middle low permeability layer between two high permeability layers reduces the influence of cut off wall height on si if the bottom of the wall is placed inside the low permeability layer while the thickness of the middle low permeability layer has a minor impact on si a thicker middle low permeability layer leads significantly aggravated nitrate contamination moreover our simulations reveal that the degree of nitrate accumulation changes non monotonically with changes in the hydraulic conductivity of low permeability layer the total nitrate mass tnm first increases and then decreases as the hydraulic conductivity of the low permeability layer increases we also found that the impact of heterogeneities is a function of the location and depth of the cut off wall with the increases of the distance between wall and the ocean the nitrate enrichment degree of nitrate pollution in the upstream aquifer decreases while seawater intrudes further in layered aquifer i e case hlh tnm increases as the wall depth increases but the growth rates of tnm becomes lower when the bottom of the wall is placed inside the low permeability layer these quantitative analyses have critical implications for

inherent subsurface heterogeneity is inevitable within geological formations layered heterogeneous structures are found to be the most common forms of subsurface heterogeneity in coastal aquifer systems rathore et al 2018 such as stratified coastal aquifers in israel dafny et al 2010 alaska li and boufadel 2010 chongming island china xiao et al 2017 and laizhou bay china chang et al 2018 previous researches have confirmed that heterogeneity of inherent geological structures could induce far ranging changes in groundwater flow fields and further significantly affect contaminant transportation and distribution werner et al 2013 in recent years seawater intrusion si has become a conundrum for global freshwater resources management due to the sea level rise induced by global warming and the over exploitation of groundwater resources in coastal areas achievements in preventing seawater intrusion in coastal regions have promoted progress on diversified practical engineering solutions such as physical barriers including subsurface dam and cut off wall kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 hydraulic barriers e g freshwater injection abarca et al 2006 lu et al 2013b shi et al 2020 saltwater extraction stein et al 2019 stein et al 2020 and combination of injection and extraction ebeling et al 2019 lu et al 2019 among these subsurface physical barriers spbs is the most popular strategy and have been applied widely to control si in china jamali et al 2013 and japan japan green resources agency 2004 spbs can be categorized into two types based on structural characteristics a a subsurface dam that embeds low permeability materials e g concrete grout the lower part of the aquifer with an opening in its upper part for the discharge of residual saltwater and upstream freshwater and b a cut off wall that fills low permeability materials at the upper part of aquifer allowing groundwater discharge to occur beneath the wall a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate the influence of spbs on si control and freshwater storage in coastal aquifers gao et al 2021 luyun et al 2009 chang et al 2019 investigated the effect of subsurface dam height on upstream fresh groundwater discharge and developed the concept of minimum effective height meaning that the height of the subsurface dam should be slightly below the saltwater wedge at the wall location to maximize groundwater discharge furthermore it was found that subsurface dams may truncate the saltwater wedge and large amount of saltwater could be trapped upstream the dam complete desalination of the residual saltwater in field scale may take several decades zheng et al 2021 at present cut off walls are becoming increasing popular in si control which allows inland groundwater discharge to the ocean by the gap between wall and bottom of the aquifer zheng et al 2020 several studies have investigated the effect of the cut off wall on the prevention of si luyun et al 2011 explored that the influence of depth and location of the cut off wall on saltwater repulsion chang et al 2021 found that both the velocity of groundwater below the wall and influx of freshwater from inland could significantly affect the thickness of the freshwater seawater mixing zone wu et al 2020 extended previous work to finite impermeable wall using three dimensional model many previous studies regarding si focused on heterogeneous conditions lu et al 2013a employed both experimental and numerical methods to simulate si in layered aquifers and found that aquifer stratification can strongly influence mixing zone thickness additionally rathore et al 2018 analyzed the effect of aquifer stratification on the toe position of the freshwater seawater interface and groundwater discharge in coastal regions their work further extended the findings of strack and ausk 2015 who presented the theory of comprehensive discharge potential based on a three dimensional numerical model in horizontally stratified coastal aquifers abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 explored the mechanism of stratified heterogeneity on the efficiency of the cut off wall to prevent si their results emphasized that in contrast with homogeneous cases the presence of multi layered coastal aquifers may dramatically increase the cleaning time of saltwater depending on the stratification pattern nitrate is one of the most widespread groundwater contaminants due to extensive agricultural activity e g fertilization in coastal areas jang et al 2017 xin et al 2021 exceedingly high nitrate levels in drinking water can cause serious health problems e g methemoglobinemia fan and steinberg 1996 usepa 2009 meanwhile denitrification process in aquifers can significantly reduce the nitrate concentration in groundwater under anaerobic conditions nitrate together with nitrogen transforms into gaseous products such as n2o and n2 wriedt and rode 2006 developed a three dimensional reactive transport groundwater model including denitrification process and the results of their work showed that about 80 of nitrate disappeared during denitrification almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 evaluated the overall influence of land utilization on nitrate contamination using numerical approaches they found that denitrification has a larger effect on the reduction of nitrate in groundwater than advection and diffusion the cut off wall is becoming a feasible measure to prevent si while the limitation of cut off wall is that it may aggravate nitrate accumulation in upstream aquifers many studies have shown that cut off walls have induced regional nitrate accumulation in coastal groundwater yoshimoto et al 2013 and kang and xu 2017 found that upstream nitrate concentration increased remarkably after wall construction later on sun et al 2019 investigated the mechanism of influence of subsurface dam on nitrate contamination and concluded that wall height and nitrate infiltration rate are the key factors determining the nitrate accumulation area zheng et al 2020 proposed a new type of cut off wall including a short upper low permeable section and a semi permeable part at the bottom of the cut off wall they clarified that this variable permeability cut off wall can reduce nitrate accumulation in landward aquifers and maintain a similar control effectiveness compared with traditional cut off walls however previous studies were always restricted to idealized homogeneous aquifers in fact the heterogeneity of coastal aquifers is ineluctable and more widespread lu et al 2013a rathore et al 2018 especially stratified heterogeneity is widely distributed and may significantly affect groundwater flow saltwater intrusion and nitrate migration it has been confirmed in our previous work that the construction of cut off walls could induce upstream nitrate accumulation sun et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 sun et al 2019 while the influence of stratified heterogeneity on the nitrate enrichment phenomenon remains unclear in this work for the first time we investigate the combined effect of stratified heterogeneity and cut off wall on the groundwater flow si and nitrate enrichment in coastal unconfined aquifers a series of 2d numerical simulations with various wall structures and heterogeneity distributions were applied to explore the transient behavior of si and nitrate accumulation behind cut off walls considering the effects of aquifer stratification the results of this work are expected to provide guidance on the design of cut off wall aimed at controlling si and nitrate enrichment in real stratified coastal aquifers 2 methods 2 1 mathematical model the schematic diagrams of saltwater wedge and nitrate accumulation in multi layered aquifers with the cut off wall are presented in fig 1 the following assumptions were made to simplify the model 1 only the reaction of nitrate and doc in the denitrification process was considered sun et al 2021 zheng et

summarized in table 1 the model domain was 500 50 m2 the aquifer was divided into three horizontal layers with individual hydraulic conductivity k1 k2 and k3 and thickness t1 t2 and t3 from the top to the bottom of the aquifer the bottom boundary of the aquifer was set to be impermeable for flow and solute transport the inland groundwater Œ≥f and the ocean Œ≥s boundaries were treated as fixed water head with the height of 48 m and 46 5 m respectively the setup of these boundary condition was consistent with chang et al 2020 the ocean and inland boundaries were set as dirichlet type mass

longitudinal and transversal dispersivities Œ±l and Œ±t were set to 10 m and 1 m respectively zheng et al 2020 watson et al 2010 the specific denitrification reaction network and kinetic formulations are listed in table 1 bardini et al 2012 kim et al 2017 four species nitrate salt doc and dissolved oxygen do were subjected to transport in the model the initial concentrations of nitrate salt do and

implemented to improve the numerical stability the initial time step is 0 001 d the preconditioned conjugate gradient method was adopted to improve the speed of convergence in solving sparse symmetric positive definite equation systems the domain was discretized into 21 000 triangular cells and the p√©clet number was less than four to ensure numerical stability voss and souza 1987 we designed five different hydraulic conductivity arrangements for three layers to explore the influence of layered heterogeneity on nitrate contamination a homogeneous pattern case h a high k low k high k pattern case hlh a low k high k low k pattern case lhl a k pattern increasing monotonically from top to bottom case l h and a k pattern decreasing from top to bottom case h l the specific stratification modes and corresponding k values are listed in table 3 parameters for reference cases are shown with bold fonts in table 2 furthermore the influence of wall height distance between the wall and saltwater boundary hydraulic conductivity of the low k layer and layer thickness on nitrate pollution and si were analyzed 2 3 quantitative indicators to quantify the influence of different heterogeneities on the groundwater flow field after installation a cut off wall we used the following indicators 5 fdr fdn f d w fdn where fdw is the freshwater discharge at the seawater boundary after the installation of the wall fdn is the initial freshwater discharge of the corresponding aquifer stratification type and fdr is the reduction rate of freshwater discharge at the seawater boundary 6 vr vn v w vn where vw is the mean velocity of the domain after wall installation vn is the mean velocity of the scenarios before wall installation and vr is the reduction rate of the mean velocity of the domain 7 ndr ndn n d w ndn where ndw is no3 discharge at the seawater boundary after wall installation ndn is no3 discharge of the corresponding aquifer stratification type before wall installation and ndr is the reduction rate of no3 discharge at the seawater boundary the control of seawater intrusion was measured using the reduction rate of the saltwater wedge toe length swr in the landward aquifer zheng et al 2020 the saltwater wedge toe length swl corresponded to the distance between the saltwater boundary and the 50 isohaline along the bottom boundary sun et al 2019 the swr was defined as follows 8 swr swln s w l w swln where swlw is swl after wall installation and swln is swl for the same scenario without a wall the accumulation ratio of the specific volume of nitrate pollution area svnr and accumulation ratio of total nitrate mass tnm were used to compare the effects of cut off walls in different layering patterns on nitrate accumulation in the landward aquifer the svnr can be described as below 9 svnr tncaw t n c a n tnvan where tncaw is the specific volume of nitrate pollution area after wall installation and tncan is the specific volume of nitrate pollution area of the corresponding test case without a wall the tnm can be defined as 10 tn m tnmw t n m n tnmn where tnmw is the total nitrate mass after wall installation and tnmn is the total nitrate mass in aquifer before wall installation the structural parameters of wall were transformed in a dimensionless form as follows d d l which is the ratio of the distance between wall and ocean boundary to the aquifer length h h t which is the ratio of the height of wall to the thickness of the aquifer hereafter fdr ndr vr svnr and tnm are used to describe the effect of layered heterogeneity and spbs on groundwater flow and nitrate contamination the tsmr and tnm are used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of salt and nitrate respectively the swr and tnm are used to characterize the influence of stratified aquifer on si and nitrate accumulation 3 results 3 1 dynamics of nitrate pollution 3 1 1 nitrate distribution an aquifer with a lower permeability layer inside two higher permeability layers is one of the most common forms of coastal aquifers capaccioni et al 2005 kim et al 2006 oki et al 1998 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 therefore compared with homogeneous case a representative case i e case hlh was adopted to investigate the transient distribution of salinity and nitrate in layered aquifers in the homogeneous scenario fig 3 a the simulation first reached steady state in which 135 m of the saltwater wedge formed along the bottom of the freshwater aquifer regarding the influence of si groundwater carrying no3 flowed above the saltwater freshwater interface under the combined influence of fluid density and hydraulic gradient and finally merged into the ocean boundary in the landward aquifer after a 40 m deep cut off wall being constructed 50 m from the ocean boundary for 1000 d we observed that groundwater with no3 was forced to flow through the gap between the cut off wall and the bottom of the aquifer closer to the cut off wall the flow rates increased gradually freshwater flowed through the narrow opening and carried salt toward the seaside resulting in a reduction of residual saltwater at the upstream of the cut off wall the saltwater wedge represented by 50 isohaline retreated to the location of the cut off wall after 2000 d owing to the stemming effect of the wall and the increased length of the nitrate discharge paths and travel time the enrichment area of moderate nitrate pollution 40 mg l included impermeable wall and the no3 contamination area increased significantly before reaching steady state at 5000 d unlike the homogenous case the downward transport of the nitrate pollution in hlh was initially limited by the middle low permeability layer fig 3b in this case the nitrate plume mainly stretched horizontally because of the relatively low permeability of the middle layer while part of the nitrate above the middle low k layer exited the aquifer through the upper seawater boundary the rest of the nitrate entered the middle low k layer after the wall was installed the saltwater wedge represented by 50 isohaline also retreated to the location of the cut off wall at 1000 d indicating that a cut off wall can successfully control si despite the existence of a low permeability layer at the same time nitrate pollution trapped in the middle layer spread into the bottom layer unlike the homogenous case the constraint of the middle low permeable layer in hlh led to the slow discharge of the trapped nitrate pollution behind the cut off wall although the nitrate pollution area was smaller than that in the homogeneous scenario the enrichment area for moderate nitrate pollution 40 mg l was extended to include the cut off wall in the top layer at 1000 d groundwater velocity varied greatly from the top to the bottom of the aquifer in the hlh case because of the uneven distribution of permeability consequently higher groundwater velocities accelerated nitrate transport in the top hlh layer once the nitrate contamination plume reached the cut off wall it moved downward along the lower part of the wall in contrast with the homogenous case the residence time of nitrate in middle layer was increased due to combined effect of the wall and the low k layer thus the area of nitrate contamination in the bottom layer of hlh case is much smaller than that of the homogeneous case meanwhile the overall nitrate pollution area was also smaller than that in the homogeneous scenario after 5000 d however for the top and middle layer the degree of nitrate enrichment was always higher than that of the homogeneous scenario 3 1 2 doc and do distribution to better understand how nitrate transport and degradation are affected by spbs in layered aquifers we analyzed the changes in doc and do over time for cases h and hlh fig 4 in case h fig 4a after the construction of spbs the area of do plume gradually decreased as the saltwater wedge retreated to the wall location and reached steady state which was consistent with the results of zheng et al 2020 additionally the doc wedge gradually retreated toward the inland boundary indicating that nitrate leaching into the aquifer was denitrified with doc from upstream groundwater and that the area of the doc distribution decreased accompanied with the expansion of the nitrate pollution plume in case hlh fig 4b the area of doc in the bottom layer was always larger than that in the homogeneous scenario due to the existence of a low permeable layer that slowed the downward flow of the freshwater carrying no3 as a result more nitrate accumulated in the middle and top layers and thus denitrification functions at the same place compared to the homogeneous case the doc wedge in the low k layer was clearly closer to the inland boundary after the wall was installed these observations revealed that different stratified modes can substantially influence the denitrification reaction and thereby strongly affect the nitrate degradation response to various degrees 3 1 3 nitrate discharge and enrichment to quantify the joint effect of layered heterogeneity and cut off walls on the flow fields and solute transport nitrate pollution we used the indicators nd ndr tnm tnm in cases h and hlh as shown in fig 5 the transient behavior of nitrate discharge nd for cases h and hlh are presented in fig 5 a initially the infiltrated nitrate horizontally migrated to the ocean boundary and reached the boundary at 540 d in both cases nd in the homogeneous scenario was the same as case hlh before 1500 d later nitrate gradually migrated to the middle layer nd in the homogeneous scenario gradually became greater than that in case hlh due to the low permeability of the middle layer for case hlh after cut off wall installation i e t 5000 d nd first drops sharply and then began to increase in both cases the nitrate discharge of the homogeneous case was higher than the hlh case regarding a larger discharge area for the homogeneous scenario while ndr of the homogeneous case was approximately 23 lower than the hlh scenario indicating that hlh type layered heterogeneity strongly influence the discharge of nitrate after wall installation fig 5 b shows the transient behavior of tnm and tnm over time in the aquifer for cases h and hlh with the vertical infiltration of nitrate tnm increased gradually before reaching steady state after the installation of the cut off wall t 5000 d tnm increased further until it reached steady state at t 7500 d as nd in case hlh was lower than the homogeneous case tnm for hlh case was higher than that of h case basically tnm of case hlh was about 23 higher than in the homogeneous case indicating that for hlh case the nitrate enrichment is more serious than the homogeneous case after wall installation overall both cases showed similar increasing trends of nitrate contamination while the individual increasing magnitudes were different regarding the different heterogeneities in other words heterogeneity did not alter the general tendency but hlh case may strongly enhance the nitrate accumulation after installation of the cut off wall 3 2 effect of cut off walls depth and location on nitrate pollution the above observations revealed that layered heterogeneity significantly affected groundwater movement solute migration transformation and finally increased nitrate enrichment here we focused on case hlh to further explore the effect of the properties of the cut off wall including wall height and location on nitrate contamination and si control in stratified coastal aquifers if not stated otherwise the reference values from table 2 were used for all the following scenarios 3 2 1 wall height fig 6 displays the effect of the relative cut off wall heights h on si and nitrate accumulation in the stratified hlh case for these cases h varied from 50 to 90 fig 6c1 c3 shows nitrate and saltwater distribution for hlh case with h 50 70 and 90 at 5000 d we can see that the pollution plume 10 mg l for different wall heights are almost identical as shown the change in h significantly altered the no3 discharge nd while did not induce a notable change in the nitrate infiltration rate ni fig 6a the blocking effect of the wall was that freshwater carrying no3 had to move below the cut off wall discharge path and timescale were correspondingly longer with increased h therefore nd decreased with increasing h and tnm increased from 55 to 63 with increment of h it was found that nd dropped slowly at first and then faster indicating that the change in wall height only slightly affected groundwater and nitrate discharge when the tip of the cut off wall was located in the middle low k layer h 70 consequently the growth rate of tnm was also initially slow and then faster when h increased from 50 to 90 swr increased from approximately 56 to 67 fig 6b the increasing rate became slower when the bottom of the wall was located within the low permeable layer 3 2 2 wall location the nitrate infiltration rate ni and nd at different distances from the ocean boundary d are shown in fig 7 a due to the existence of the middle low k layer the infiltrated nitrate preferentially migrated horizontally to the upper layer the nitrate pollution was forced to migrate vertically through the middle low k layer and finally discharged into the sea through the opening at the bottom of the wall we can see that nd increased with an increase in d but did not induce an obvious change in ni which means that for the walls installed closer to the nitrate pollution source the wall was less capable of trapping the nitrate pollution particularly in the top layer therefore the above changes caused tnm to decrease from about 67 to 39 when d increased from 5 to 30 fig 7b fig 7c shows the nitrate and saltwater distributions at different d for case hlh the change in d significantly altered the saltwater contaminated area as d increased the effect of the wall repulsing the saltwater wedge decreased and the saltwater intruded further the swr decreased from approximately 80 to 9 fig 7b furthermore because the wall impeded nitrate pollution in the upper portion and the saltwater wedge impeded nitrate pollution in the lower portion ke et al 2021 the nitrate pollution plume spread to the landward side in the bottom layer as d increased fig 7c nd tended to increase with increasing d thus the degree of nitrate contamination on the seaward side of the wall subsequently increased 3 3 effect of heterogeneity on nitrate accumulation 3 3 1 layering pattern a series of scenarios were simulated to reveal the flow dynamics and nitrate accumulation associated with different layering patterns the nitrate concentration distributions and saltwater salinity isolines of the five different k arrangements for the three layers before and after the installation of a cut off wall are shown in the left and right columns in fig 8 the steady state distribution of nitrate and si was first analyzed within each aquifer before wall installation freshwater mixed with no3 discharged into the sea at the upper left of the aquifer nd n was approximately 71 g d in the homogeneous case however the length of the saltwater wedge toe increased slightly and the shape of the si was distorted in case hlh compared to case h the middle low permeable layer discouraged nitrate transport nd n was approximately 67 g d resulting in a smaller nitrate contamination area than in the homogeneous case and the nitrate pollution plume was located at the upper part of the aquifer compared with the previous two cases the length of the saltwater wedge decreased significantly and the 50 salinity contour line was closer to the ocean boundary in case lhl however the nitrate contamination area and the total nitrate mass increased this is because the streamlines were squeezed by the refraction effect due to the increased groundwater velocity when streamlines passed from the lower permeability layer to the higher permeability layer thus narrowing the saltwater contamination zone in the higher permeability layer lu et al 2013a in case lhl the mean groundwater velocity is the lowest among others the slow velocity prevented the nitrate that infiltrated into the aquifer from being discharged rapidly in a timely manner nd n was approximately 12 g d and a large amount of nitrate became concentrated at the top and middle of the aquifer resulting in higher total nitrate mass in case lhl than the homogeneous case most of the fresh groundwater carrying no3 exited below the bottom boundary of the overlying low permeable layer where the groundwater velocity was the highest and the remaining nitrate was either discharged to the ocean through a more permeable middle layer or degraded by denitrification with doc from inland areas fig 8d and 8e show layered aquifers with monotonic increases and decreases in hydraulic conductivity with aquifer depth respectively before the installation of the wall there were obvious differences in the shape area and thickness of the nitrate contamination plume between these two cases in case l h the overlying low permeability layer slowed nitrate infiltration and migration drove the fresh groundwater flow to the bottom of the aquifer where it encountered the invading saltwater wedge before exiting the aquifer at the top corner of the middle layer at a high velocity in case h l however the overlying layer of high k accelerated the convective dispersion of nitrate allowing most of the nitrate to exit the system rapidly compared with the previous cases tnm and nd were the highest in aquifers however the existence of an underlying low permeability layer reduced the scour effect of inland freshwater on si explaining why the 50 salinity contour line was farther from the ocean boundary than in the preceding case after the installation of the wall si could be effectively mitigated however nitrate contamination in inland aquifers increased fig 8 the computed quantitative indicators for each layering pattern are presented in table 4 in the homogeneous case fig 8f freshwater mixed with no3 moved down through the gap between the wall and the bottom of the aquifer but the cut off wall reduced the flow rate of groundwater throughout the aquifer vr was 20 65 the velocity of groundwater through the gap in case hlh was lower than in case h because the middle low permeable layer retarded the downward groundwater flow to the bottom layer additionally the cut off wall greatly reduced the flow rate of groundwater throughout the aquifer vr was 31 37 the downward groundwater flow imposed by the wall was partly limited by the underlying low permeable layer yielding a massive reduction in groundwater velocity through the gap between the wall and the aquifer base in the lhl case however the wall can hardly influence the average velocity magnitude of regional groundwater vr was only 4 32 only affected the direction of groundwater discharge for the above reasons the nitrate enrichment area was smaller than the first two scenarios two additional layering patterns further demonstrated the significance of layer placement on nitrate contamination after cut off wall construction after the installation of the wall various layering settings showed different nitrate contamination levels in case l h fig 8i the nitrate contamination in the landward aquifer barely changed svnr and tnm were 0 27 and 1 71 respectively because the wall scarcely influenced the groundwater flow field of case l h vr 0 27 and groundwater and nitrate discharge fdr 2 43 in case h l fig 8j although svnr was only 0 56 tnm was approximately 36 the main reason for this difference was that ndr for the l h and h l cases were 6 27 and 93 36 respectively and higher ndr indicated that wall installation greatly hindered the discharge of inland freshwater and nitrate the degree of nitrate enrichment in the inland aquifer was correspondently higher therefore tnm for case h l was much higher than that of case l h 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity of the low k layer a series of numerical experiments with different hydraulic conductivities of the low k layer k l were used to explore the influence of hydraulic conductivity on nitrate contamination and si k l used in each scenario was obtained from the oki et al 1998 and kim et al 2006 models lu et al 2013a illustrated that the flow and concentration fields were strongly influenced by k l in terms of constant head boundary conditions on both landward and seaward sides fig 9 a shows that for case hlh ni and nd increased with the increase in k l from 0 125 to 2 5 m d a high hydraulic conductivity normally generates high seepage velocity zheng et al 2021 and the flow rate is proportional to the nitrate advective transport in the aquifer the cut off wall induced swr decreased from 73 38 to 64 60 as k l increased fig 9b the low k layer delayed freshwater discharge causing more freshwater to stay at the opening of the wall for longer which resulted in a greater repulsion from the saltwater wedge with the magnitude of k l increasing from 0 125 to 2 5 m d the accumulation ratio of tnm showed a trend of first increasing and then slowly decreasing fig 9b the accumulation of total nitrate mass in the phreatic aquifer was determined by nitrate infiltration and discharge when the ni rate greatly exceeded the nd rate nitrate in the upstream inland aquifer was enriched by degrees tnm was increased and vice versa the infiltrated nitrate was also affected by the hydraulic conductivity of the middle low permeability layer when k l was 0 125 m d nitrate infiltration was 35 g d but conversely when k l was 2 5 m d the infiltration of nitrate increased to 63 g d nd and ni both increased with the increase in k l and the gap between them was non monotonic it first increased 0 125 1 m d then decreased with k l from 1 to 2 5 m d consequently tnm first increased 35 33 67 62 and then slowly decreased 67 62 62 19 with the increase in the magnitude of k l from 0 125 to 2 5 m d fig 9b fig 9c further confirms this phenomenon the nitrate contaminated area with a k l of 0 5 m d is clearly larger than that of 1 25 m d fig 9c1 and c2 when k l decreased further fig 9c3 the nitrate contaminated area started to decrease 3 3 3 thickness of the low k layer different middle low k layer thicknesses tls were used to explore the influence of low k layer thickness on nitrate pollution in layered aquifers as shown in fig 10 a nd decreased from 50 to 20 g d with as the middle low k layer went from 5 5 to 25 5 m this was because a thicker middle low k layer induced a greater decrease in regional groundwater flow thus significantly reducing the discharge of solute in the aquifer zhang et al 2021 changes in the t l hardly affected the ni which decreased very slightly with increasing t l therefore tnm in the phreatic aquifer increased from 38 08 to 72 08 for all cases under the joint effects of ni and nd fig 10b the changes in tnm indicated that nitrate enrichment was controlled by t l a thicker low k layer always resulted in a longer nitrate transport time increasing the degree of nitrate enrichment in upstream aquifer the change in the thickness of the middle low k layer had little effect on the swr indicating that a change in the thickness of the low k layer did not influence the effectiveness of the cut off wall fig 10c1 c3 demonstrate nitrate and saltwater distributions at different tls in case hlh at 5000 d we found that si was effectively mitigated by a 40 m height wall in all the simulated cases t l 5 5 m 10 5 m and 25 5 m in addition the inhibition of the downward freshwater flow carrying no3 from the upper part to the lower part of the aquifer by the middle layer was induced by its larger thickness which finally resulted in a reduction of nitrate contamination area in the bottom layer 4 discussion referring to previous studies lu et al 2013a b sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 we assumed constant water head boundary at the inland side to investigate the impact of aquifer stratification on nitrate enrichment induced by cut off wall in coastal aquifers although the inland boundary type head or flux setup is critical for numerical simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers chang et al 2020 systematic comparisons of nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in the field scale models with specified head inland boundary and specified flux inland boundary are beyond the purpose of this study nonetheless the simulations including several layering pattern cases with no cut off wall and with the cut off wall were conducted with a corresponding specified flux inland boundary i e using the parameter values adopted with specified head inland boundary setting of this study the results of which are illustrated and analyzed in text s1 and fig 11 the results obtained in the field scale models with specified head inland boundary and specified flux inland boundary indicate the similar trends in terms of nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in both homogeneous scenario and case hlh as expected in this study the setting of the three layer stratification patterns and the ratio of hydraulic conductivity were based on classical study of layered aquifers lu et al 2013a abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 comparison between the cases with and without cut off walls in the same pattern makes sense to demonstrate the impact of cut off walls however it was ignored that the impact that all the patterns have different total transmissivity only the l h and h l have the same total transmissivity on numerical results to generalize our findings the patterns which have same total transmissivity were designed in table s1 to ensure that the different results only from the layering pattern by excluding all other hydrogeological conditions the results of patterns which have same total k in fig 12 are in general consistent with the findings of section 3 3 1 which proved that layering pattern affected nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in coastal aquifers furthermore this study focused on stratified heterogeneity out of simplicity and there are still some limitations regarding the setup of the numerical experiments in the future we are going to investigate the influence of other types of heterogeneity fractures macropores tomography parameters e g dispersity dimension 2d 3d representation on nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in coastal aquifers 5 summary and conclusions in this study numerical simulations for density dependent flow reactive solute transport were used to explore the influence of layered heterogeneity on nitrate contamination behind cut off walls field scale numerical simulations with three layers with various hydraulic conductivity arrangements were developed to study the effect of layered heterogeneity on the distributions of si and nitrate contamination we compared the dynamic mechanisms of nitrate enrichment and denitrification between homogeneous and layered cases h and hlh under the influence of cut off walls we explored the influence of walls parameters location and depth and various properties of stratified aquifer on nitrate contamination and came to the following conclusions 1 based on the comparison between homogeneous scenario and heterogeneous case hlh the accumulation ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and accumulation ratio of total nitrate mass tnm in case hlh were 8 00 and 22 79 higher than that of homogeneous scenario respectively however the layered heterogeneity did not influence the effectiveness of cut off wall on si control three additional layering patterns further demonstrated that the layer stratification pattern substantially disrupted groundwater movement thus significantly affecting the nitrate accumulation response i e tnm in cases lhl l h and h l were 55 70 1 71 and 35 6 respectively 2 the influence of cut off wall structures height and location on si and nitrate pollution are investigated when wall height h increased from 50 to 90 tnm increased from 55 to 63 and swr increased from 56 to 67 in case hlh the growth rates of tnm and swr became lower when the bottom of the wall was located within the low permeability layer with the increase of the distance between wall and the ocean d the nitrate enrichment degree in the upstream aquifer decreased while seawater intruded further in case hlh tnm decreased from about 67 to 39 and swr decreased from approximately 80 to 9 when d increased from 5 to 30 3 the degree of nitrate enrichment did not exhibit a monotonic change with increasing k l when k l increased from 0 125 to 2 5 m d tnm first increased 35 33 67 62 and then slowly decreased 67 62 62 19 under the joint effects of ni and nd the swr induced by the cut off wall decreased from 73 38 to 64 60 tnm increased from 38 08 to 72 08 as t l changed from 5 5 to 25 5 m the change in t l did not influence the effectiveness of cut off wall on si control our numerical results were based on the concept of a three layered stratified aquifer since heterogeneity in real world can be more complex the analysis of flow dynamics and nitrate accumulation mechanisms may be extended to multi layered aquifers our results demonstrate that layered aquifers with certain hydraulic conductivity configurations can result in various degrees of nitrate accumulation suggesting an alternative explanation for field measurement data being significantly different from nitrate concentration distributions derived from homogeneous closed systems e g a laboratory sandbox experiment and corresponding numerical simulation as layered heterogeneity is rather common in natural environments our results emphasize the necessity of considering aquifer stratification before planning and designing spbs for si control a more realistic evaluation of the impact on the groundwater environment can be achieved in the future we expect to further investigate the influence of chemical heterogeneities e g the distribution of chemical reactive substances and the effect of boundary conditions e g tidal activities on nitrate contamination behind cut off walls which could provide a better understanding of real world

3381,cut off walls have proven to be an effective countermeasure for mitigating seawater intrusion si however construction of cut off walls may lead to upstream accumulation of nitrate contaminants in coastal aquifers while stratified geological heterogeneities are widely present in coastal areas how they may influence nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls remains poorly understood in the present study we employ variable density coupling with reactive transport numerical models to understand and quantify the dynamic changes of salinity and no3 in layered heterogeneous coastal aquifers in the presence of cut off walls our comprehensive simulation results indicate that aquifer heterogeneities are a primary factor in regulating nitrate accumulation for example the presence of a middle low permeability layer between two high permeability layers reduces the influence of cut off wall height on si if the bottom of the wall is placed inside the low permeability layer while the thickness of the middle low permeability layer has a minor impact on si a thicker middle low permeability layer leads significantly aggravated nitrate contamination moreover our simulations reveal that the degree of nitrate accumulation changes non monotonically with changes in the hydraulic conductivity of low permeability layer the total nitrate mass tnm first increases and then decreases as the hydraulic conductivity of the low permeability layer increases we also found that the impact of heterogeneities is a function of the location and depth of the cut off wall with the increases of the distance between wall and the ocean the nitrate enrichment degree of nitrate pollution in the upstream aquifer decreases while seawater intrudes further in layered aquifer i e case hlh tnm increases as the wall depth increases but the growth rates of tnm becomes lower when the bottom of the wall is placed inside the low permeability layer these quantitative analyses have critical implications for the planning and design of cut off walls to effectively control si while at the same mitigating nitrate pollution keywords nitrate contamination seawater intrusion cut off wall aquifer stratification

inherent subsurface heterogeneity is inevitable within geological formations layered heterogeneous structures are found to be the most common forms of subsurface heterogeneity in coastal aquifer systems rathore et al 2018 such as stratified coastal aquifers in israel dafny et al 2010 alaska li and boufadel 2010 chongming island china xiao et al 2017 and laizhou bay china chang et al 2018 previous researches have confirmed that heterogeneity of inherent geological structures could induce far ranging changes in groundwater flow fields and further significantly affect contaminant transportation and distribution werner et al 2013 in recent years seawater intrusion si has become a conundrum for global freshwater resources management due to the sea level rise induced by global warming and the over exploitation of groundwater resources in coastal areas achievements in preventing seawater intrusion in coastal regions have promoted progress on diversified practical engineering solutions such as physical barriers including subsurface dam and cut off wall kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 hydraulic barriers e g freshwater injection abarca et al 2006 lu et al 2013b shi et al 2020 saltwater extraction stein et al 2019 stein et al 2020 and combination of injection and extraction ebeling et al 2019 lu et al 2019 among these subsurface physical barriers spbs is the most popular strategy and have been applied widely to control si in china jamali et al 2013 and japan japan green resources agency 2004 spbs can be categorized into two types based on structural characteristics a a subsurface dam that embeds low permeability materials e g concrete grout the lower part of the aquifer with an opening in its upper part for the discharge of residual saltwater and upstream freshwater and b a cut off wall that fills low permeability materials at the upper part of aquifer allowing groundwater discharge to occur beneath the wall a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate the influence of spbs on si control and freshwater storage in coastal aquifers gao et al 2021 luyun et al 2009 chang et al 2019 investigated the effect of subsurface dam height on upstream fresh groundwater discharge and developed the concept of minimum effective height meaning that the height of the subsurface dam should be slightly below the saltwater wedge at the wall location to maximize groundwater discharge furthermore it was found that subsurface dams may truncate the saltwater wedge and large amount of saltwater could be trapped upstream the dam complete desalination of the residual saltwater in field scale may take several decades zheng et al 2021 at present cut off walls are becoming increasing popular in si control which allows inland groundwater discharge to the ocean by the gap between wall and bottom of the aquifer zheng et al 2020 several studies have investigated the effect of the cut off wall on the prevention of si luyun et al 2011 explored that the influence of depth and location of the cut off wall on saltwater repulsion chang et al 2021 found that both the velocity of groundwater below the wall and influx of freshwater from inland could significantly affect the thickness of the freshwater seawater mixing zone wu et al 2020 extended previous work to finite impermeable wall using three dimensional model many previous studies regarding si focused on heterogeneous conditions lu et al 2013a employed both experimental and numerical methods to simulate si in layered aquifers and found that aquifer stratification can strongly influence mixing zone thickness additionally rathore et al 2018 analyzed the effect of aquifer stratification on the toe position of the freshwater seawater interface and groundwater discharge in coastal regions their work further extended the findings of strack and ausk 2015 who presented the theory of comprehensive discharge potential based on a three dimensional numerical model in horizontally stratified coastal aquifers abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 explored the mechanism of stratified heterogeneity on the efficiency of the cut off wall to prevent si their results emphasized that in contrast with homogeneous cases the presence of multi layered coastal aquifers may dramatically increase the cleaning time of saltwater depending on the stratification pattern nitrate is one of the most widespread groundwater contaminants due to extensive agricultural activity e g fertilization in coastal areas jang et al 2017 xin et al 2021 exceedingly high nitrate levels in drinking water can cause serious health problems e g methemoglobinemia fan and steinberg 1996 usepa 2009 meanwhile denitrification process in aquifers can significantly reduce the nitrate concentration in groundwater under anaerobic conditions nitrate together with nitrogen transforms into gaseous products such as n2o and n2 wriedt and rode 2006 developed a three dimensional reactive transport groundwater model including denitrification process and the results of their work showed that about 80 of nitrate disappeared during denitrification almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 evaluated the overall influence of land utilization on nitrate contamination using numerical approaches they found that denitrification has a larger effect on the reduction of nitrate in groundwater than advection and diffusion the cut off wall is becoming a feasible measure to prevent si while the limitation of cut off wall is that it may aggravate nitrate accumulation in upstream aquifers many studies have shown that cut off walls have induced regional nitrate accumulation in coastal groundwater yoshimoto et al 2013 and kang and xu 2017 found that upstream nitrate concentration increased remarkably after wall construction later on sun et al 2019 investigated the mechanism of influence of subsurface dam on nitrate contamination and concluded that wall height and nitrate infiltration rate are the key factors determining the nitrate accumulation area zheng et al 2020 proposed a new type of cut off wall including a short upper low permeable section and a semi permeable part at the bottom of the cut off wall they clarified that this variable permeability cut off wall can reduce nitrate accumulation in landward aquifers and maintain a similar control effectiveness compared with traditional cut off walls however previous studies were always restricted to idealized homogeneous aquifers in fact the heterogeneity of coastal aquifers is ineluctable and more widespread lu et al 2013a rathore et al 2018 especially stratified heterogeneity is widely distributed and may significantly affect groundwater flow saltwater intrusion and nitrate migration it has been confirmed in our previous work that the construction of cut off walls could induce upstream nitrate accumulation sun et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 sun et al 2019 while the influence of stratified heterogeneity on the nitrate enrichment phenomenon remains unclear in this work for the first time we investigate the combined effect of stratified heterogeneity and cut off wall on the groundwater flow si and nitrate enrichment in coastal unconfined aquifers a series of 2d numerical simulations with various wall structures and heterogeneity distributions were applied to explore the transient behavior of si and nitrate accumulation behind cut off walls considering the effects of aquifer stratification the results of this work are expected to provide guidance on the design of cut off wall aimed at controlling si and nitrate enrichment in real stratified coastal aquifers 2 methods 2 1 mathematical model the schematic diagrams of saltwater wedge and nitrate accumulation in multi layered aquifers with the cut off wall are presented in fig 1 the following assumptions were made to simplify the model 1 only the reaction of nitrate and doc in the denitrification process was considered sun et al 2021 zheng et

summarized in table 1 the model domain was 500 50 m2 the aquifer was divided into three horizontal layers with individual hydraulic conductivity k1 k2 and k3 and thickness t1 t2 and t3 from the top to the bottom of the aquifer the bottom boundary of the aquifer was set to be impermeable for flow and solute transport the inland groundwater Œ≥f and the ocean Œ≥s boundaries were treated as fixed water head with the height of 48 m and 46 5 m respectively the setup of these boundary condition was consistent with chang et al 2020 the ocean and inland boundaries were set as dirichlet type mass boundaries of 35 000 mg l c s and 0 mg l cf respectively based on previous researches ju et al 2006 sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 a contaminant source was set at the top boundary to simulate nitrate infiltration accompanied with rainfall nitrate entered the aquifer with a constant concentration of 100 mg l and a constant rainfall of 1 mm d a vertical cut off wall with the thickness of 1 m was installed perpendicular to the top of the aquifer the height of the wall is h and the distance between the wall and ocean boundary Œ≥s is denoted by d the porosity of each layer was 0 3 the longitudinal and transversal dispersivities Œ±l and Œ±t were set to 10 m and 1 m respectively zheng et al 2020 watson et al 2010 the specific denitrification reaction network and kinetic formulations are listed in table 1 bardini et al 2012 kim et al 2017 four species nitrate salt doc and dissolved oxygen do were subjected to transport in the model the initial concentrations of nitrate salt do and

implemented to improve the numerical stability the initial time step is 0 001 d the preconditioned conjugate gradient method was adopted to improve the speed of convergence in solving sparse symmetric positive definite equation systems the domain was discretized into 21 000 triangular cells and the p√©clet number was less than four to ensure numerical stability voss and souza 1987 we designed five different hydraulic conductivity arrangements for three layers to explore the influence of layered heterogeneity on nitrate contamination a homogeneous pattern case h a high k low k high k pattern case hlh a low k high k low k pattern case lhl a k pattern increasing monotonically from top to bottom case l h and a k pattern decreasing from top to bottom case h l the specific stratification modes and corresponding k values are listed in table 3 parameters for reference cases are shown with bold fonts in table 2 furthermore the influence of wall height distance between the wall and saltwater boundary hydraulic conductivity of the low k layer and layer thickness on nitrate pollution and si were analyzed 2 3 quantitative indicators to quantify the influence of different heterogeneities on the groundwater flow field after installation a cut off wall we used the following indicators 5 fdr fdn f d w fdn where fdw is the freshwater discharge at the seawater boundary after the installation of the wall fdn is the initial freshwater discharge of the corresponding aquifer stratification type and fdr is the reduction rate of freshwater discharge at the seawater boundary 6 vr vn v w vn where vw is the mean velocity of the domain after wall installation vn is the mean velocity of the scenarios before wall installation and vr is the reduction rate of the mean velocity of the domain 7 ndr ndn n d w ndn where ndw is no3 discharge at the seawater boundary after wall installation ndn is no3 discharge of the corresponding aquifer stratification type before wall installation and ndr is the reduction rate of no3 discharge at the seawater boundary the control of seawater intrusion was measured using the reduction rate of the saltwater wedge toe length swr in the landward aquifer zheng et al 2020 the saltwater wedge toe length swl corresponded to the distance between the saltwater boundary and the 50 isohaline along the bottom boundary sun et al 2019 the swr was defined as follows 8 swr swln s w l w swln where swlw is swl after wall installation and swln is swl for the same scenario without a wall the accumulation ratio of the specific volume of nitrate pollution area svnr and accumulation ratio of total nitrate mass tnm were used to compare the effects of cut off walls in different layering patterns on nitrate accumulation in the landward aquifer the svnr can be described as below 9 svnr tncaw t n c a n tnvan where tncaw is the specific volume of nitrate pollution area after wall installation and tncan is the specific volume of nitrate pollution area of the corresponding test case without a wall the tnm can be defined as 10 tn m tnmw t n m n tnmn where tnmw is the total nitrate mass after wall installation and tnmn is the total nitrate mass in aquifer before wall installation the structural parameters of wall were transformed in a dimensionless form as follows d d l which is the ratio of the distance between wall and ocean boundary to the aquifer length h h t which is the ratio of the height of wall to the thickness of the aquifer hereafter fdr ndr vr svnr and tnm are used to describe the effect of layered heterogeneity and spbs on groundwater flow and nitrate contamination the tsmr and tnm are used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of salt and nitrate respectively the swr and tnm are used to characterize the influence of stratified aquifer on si and nitrate accumulation 3 results 3 1 dynamics of nitrate pollution 3 1 1 nitrate distribution an aquifer with a lower permeability layer inside two higher permeability layers is one of the most common forms of coastal aquifers capaccioni et al 2005 kim et al 2006 oki et al 1998 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 therefore compared with homogeneous case a representative case i e case hlh was adopted to investigate the transient distribution of salinity and nitrate in layered aquifers in the homogeneous scenario fig 3 a the simulation first reached steady state in which 135 m of the saltwater wedge formed along the bottom of the freshwater aquifer regarding the influence of si groundwater carrying no3 flowed above the saltwater freshwater interface under the combined influence of fluid density and hydraulic gradient and finally merged into the ocean boundary in the landward aquifer after a 40 m deep cut off wall being constructed 50 m from the ocean boundary for 1000 d we observed that groundwater with no3 was forced to flow through the gap between the cut off wall and the bottom of the aquifer closer to the cut off wall the flow rates increased gradually freshwater flowed through the narrow opening and carried salt toward the seaside resulting in a reduction of residual saltwater at the upstream of the cut off wall the saltwater wedge represented by 50 isohaline retreated to the location of the cut off wall after 2000 d owing to the stemming effect of the wall and the increased length of the nitrate discharge paths and travel time the enrichment area of moderate nitrate pollution 40 mg l included impermeable wall and the no3 contamination area increased significantly before reaching steady state at 5000 d unlike the homogenous case the downward transport of the nitrate pollution in hlh was initially limited by the middle low permeability layer fig 3b in this case the nitrate plume mainly stretched horizontally because of the relatively low permeability of the middle layer while part of the nitrate above the middle low k layer exited the aquifer through the upper seawater boundary the rest of the nitrate entered the middle low k layer after the wall was installed the saltwater wedge represented by 50 isohaline also retreated to the location of the cut off wall at 1000 d indicating that a cut off wall can successfully control si despite the existence of a low permeability layer at the same time nitrate pollution trapped in the middle layer spread into the bottom layer unlike the homogenous case the constraint of the middle low permeable layer in hlh led to the slow discharge of the trapped nitrate pollution behind the cut off wall although the nitrate pollution area was smaller than that in the homogeneous scenario the enrichment area for moderate nitrate pollution 40 mg l was extended to include the cut off wall in the top layer at 1000 d groundwater velocity varied greatly from the top to the bottom of the aquifer in the hlh case because of the uneven distribution of permeability consequently higher groundwater velocities accelerated nitrate transport in the top hlh layer once the nitrate contamination plume reached the cut off wall it moved downward along the lower part of the wall in contrast with the homogenous case the residence time of nitrate in middle layer was increased due to combined effect of the wall and the low k layer thus the area of nitrate contamination in the bottom layer of hlh case is much smaller than that of the homogeneous case meanwhile the overall nitrate pollution area was also smaller than that in the homogeneous scenario after 5000 d however for the top and middle layer the degree of nitrate enrichment was always higher than that of the homogeneous scenario 3 1 2 doc and do distribution to better understand how nitrate transport and degradation are affected by spbs in layered aquifers we analyzed the changes in doc and do over time for cases h and hlh fig 4 in case h fig 4a after the construction of spbs the area of do plume gradually decreased as the saltwater wedge retreated to the wall location and reached steady state which was consistent with the results of zheng et al 2020 additionally the doc wedge gradually retreated toward the inland boundary indicating that nitrate leaching into the aquifer was denitrified with doc from upstream groundwater and that the area of the doc distribution decreased accompanied with the expansion of the nitrate pollution plume in case hlh fig 4b the area of doc in the bottom layer was always larger than that in the homogeneous scenario due to the existence of a low permeable layer that slowed the downward flow of the freshwater carrying no3 as a result more nitrate accumulated in the middle and top layers and thus denitrification functions at the same place compared to the homogeneous case the doc wedge in the low k layer was clearly closer to the inland boundary after the wall was installed these observations revealed that different stratified modes can substantially influence the denitrification reaction and thereby strongly affect the nitrate degradation response to various degrees 3 1 3 nitrate discharge and enrichment to quantify the joint effect of layered heterogeneity and cut off walls on the flow fields and solute transport nitrate pollution we used the indicators nd ndr tnm tnm in cases h and hlh as shown in fig 5 the transient behavior of nitrate discharge nd for cases h and hlh are presented in fig 5 a initially the infiltrated nitrate horizontally migrated to the ocean boundary and reached the boundary at 540 d in both cases nd in the homogeneous scenario was the same as case hlh before 1500 d later nitrate gradually migrated to the middle layer nd in the homogeneous scenario gradually became greater than that in case hlh due to the low permeability of the middle layer for case hlh after cut off wall installation i e t 5000 d nd first drops sharply and then began to increase in both cases the nitrate discharge of the homogeneous case was higher than the hlh case regarding a larger discharge area for the homogeneous scenario while ndr of the homogeneous case was approximately 23 lower than the hlh scenario indicating that hlh type layered heterogeneity strongly influence the discharge of nitrate after wall installation fig 5 b shows the transient behavior of tnm and tnm over time in the aquifer for cases h and hlh with the vertical infiltration of nitrate tnm increased gradually before reaching steady state after the installation of the cut off wall t 5000 d tnm increased further until it reached steady state at t 7500 d as nd in case hlh was lower than the homogeneous case tnm for hlh case was higher than that of h case basically tnm of case hlh was about 23 higher than in the homogeneous case indicating that for hlh case the nitrate enrichment is more serious than the homogeneous case after wall installation overall both cases showed similar increasing trends of nitrate contamination while the individual increasing magnitudes were different regarding the different heterogeneities in other words heterogeneity did not alter the general tendency but hlh case may strongly enhance the nitrate accumulation after installation of the cut off wall 3 2 effect of cut off walls depth and location on nitrate pollution the above observations revealed that layered heterogeneity significantly affected groundwater movement solute migration transformation and finally increased nitrate enrichment here we focused on case hlh to further explore the effect of the properties of the cut off wall including wall height and location on nitrate contamination and si control in stratified coastal aquifers if not stated otherwise the reference values from table 2 were used for all the following scenarios 3 2 1 wall height fig 6 displays the effect of the relative cut off wall heights h on si and nitrate accumulation in the stratified hlh case for these cases h varied from 50 to 90 fig 6c1 c3 shows nitrate and saltwater distribution for hlh case with h 50 70 and 90 at 5000 d we can see that the pollution plume 10 mg l for different wall heights are almost identical as shown the change in h significantly altered the no3 discharge nd while did not induce a notable change in the nitrate infiltration rate ni fig 6a the blocking effect of the wall was that freshwater carrying no3 had to move below the cut off wall discharge path and timescale were correspondingly longer with increased h therefore nd decreased with increasing h and tnm increased from 55 to 63 with increment of h it was found that nd dropped slowly at first and then faster indicating that the change in wall height only slightly affected groundwater and nitrate discharge when the tip of the cut off wall was located in the middle low k layer h 70 consequently the growth rate of tnm was also initially slow and then faster when h increased from 50 to 90 swr increased from approximately 56 to 67 fig 6b the increasing rate became slower when the bottom of the wall was located within the low permeable layer 3 2 2 wall location the nitrate infiltration rate ni and nd at different distances from the ocean boundary d are shown in fig 7 a due to the existence of the middle low k layer the infiltrated nitrate preferentially migrated horizontally to the upper layer the nitrate pollution was forced to migrate vertically through the middle low k layer and finally discharged into the sea through the opening at the bottom of the wall we can see that nd increased with an increase in d but did not induce an obvious change in ni which means that for the walls installed closer to the nitrate pollution source the wall was less capable of trapping the nitrate pollution particularly in the top layer therefore the above changes caused tnm to decrease from about 67 to 39 when d increased from 5 to 30 fig 7b fig 7c shows the nitrate and saltwater distributions at different d for case hlh the change in d significantly altered the saltwater contaminated area as d increased the effect of the wall repulsing the saltwater wedge decreased and the saltwater intruded further the swr decreased from approximately 80 to 9 fig 7b furthermore because the wall impeded nitrate pollution in the upper portion and the saltwater wedge impeded nitrate pollution in the lower portion ke et al 2021 the nitrate pollution plume spread to the landward side in the bottom layer as d increased fig 7c nd tended to increase with increasing d thus the degree of nitrate contamination on the seaward side of the wall subsequently increased 3 3 effect of heterogeneity on nitrate accumulation 3 3 1 layering pattern a series of scenarios were simulated to reveal the flow dynamics and nitrate accumulation associated with different layering patterns the nitrate concentration distributions and saltwater salinity isolines of the five different k arrangements for the three layers before and after the installation of a cut off wall are shown in the left and right columns in fig 8 the steady state distribution of nitrate and si was first analyzed within each aquifer before wall installation freshwater mixed with no3 discharged into the sea at the upper left of the aquifer nd n was approximately 71 g d in the homogeneous case however the length of the saltwater wedge toe increased slightly and the shape of the si was distorted in case hlh compared to case h the middle low permeable layer discouraged nitrate transport nd n was approximately 67 g d resulting in a smaller nitrate contamination area than in the homogeneous case and the nitrate pollution plume was located at the upper part of the aquifer compared with the previous two cases the length of the saltwater wedge decreased significantly and the 50 salinity contour line was closer to the ocean boundary in case lhl however the nitrate contamination area and the total nitrate mass increased this is because the streamlines were squeezed by the refraction effect due to the increased groundwater velocity when streamlines passed from the lower permeability layer to the higher permeability layer thus narrowing the saltwater contamination zone in the higher permeability layer lu et al 2013a in case lhl the mean groundwater velocity is the lowest among others the slow velocity prevented the nitrate that infiltrated into the aquifer from being discharged rapidly in a timely manner nd n was approximately 12 g d and a large amount of nitrate became concentrated at the top and middle of the aquifer resulting in higher total nitrate mass in case lhl than the homogeneous case most of the fresh groundwater carrying no3 exited below the bottom boundary of the overlying low permeable layer where the groundwater velocity was the highest and the remaining nitrate was either discharged to the ocean through a more permeable middle layer or degraded by denitrification with doc from inland areas fig 8d and 8e show layered aquifers with monotonic increases and decreases in hydraulic conductivity with aquifer depth respectively before the installation of the wall there were obvious differences in the shape area and thickness of the nitrate contamination plume between these two cases in case l h the overlying low permeability layer slowed nitrate infiltration and migration drove the fresh groundwater flow to the bottom of the aquifer where it encountered the invading saltwater wedge before exiting the aquifer at the top corner of the middle layer at a high velocity in case h l however the overlying layer of high k accelerated the convective dispersion of nitrate allowing most of the nitrate to exit the system rapidly compared with the previous cases tnm and nd were the highest in aquifers however the existence of an underlying low permeability layer reduced the scour effect of inland freshwater on si explaining why the 50 salinity contour line was farther from the ocean boundary than in the preceding case after the installation of the wall si could be effectively mitigated however nitrate contamination in inland aquifers increased fig 8 the computed quantitative indicators for each layering pattern are presented in table 4 in the homogeneous case fig 8f freshwater mixed with no3 moved down through the gap between the wall and the bottom of the aquifer but the cut off wall reduced the flow rate of groundwater throughout the aquifer vr was 20 65 the velocity of groundwater through the gap in case hlh was lower than in case h because the middle low permeable layer retarded the downward groundwater flow to the bottom layer additionally the cut off wall greatly reduced the flow rate of groundwater throughout the aquifer vr was 31 37 the downward groundwater flow imposed by the wall was partly limited by the underlying low permeable layer yielding a massive reduction in groundwater velocity through the gap between the wall and the aquifer base in the lhl case however the wall can hardly influence the average velocity magnitude of regional groundwater vr was only 4 32 only affected the direction of groundwater discharge for the above reasons the nitrate enrichment area was smaller than the first two scenarios two additional layering patterns further demonstrated the significance of layer placement on nitrate contamination after cut off wall construction after the installation of the wall various layering settings showed different nitrate contamination levels in case l h fig 8i the nitrate contamination in the landward aquifer barely changed svnr and tnm were 0 27 and 1 71 respectively because the wall scarcely influenced the groundwater flow field of case l h vr 0 27 and groundwater and nitrate discharge fdr 2 43 in case h l fig 8j although svnr was only 0 56 tnm was approximately 36 the main reason for this difference was that ndr for the l h and h l cases were 6 27 and 93 36 respectively and higher ndr indicated that wall installation greatly hindered the discharge of inland freshwater and nitrate the degree of nitrate enrichment in the inland aquifer was correspondently higher therefore tnm for case h l was much higher than that of case l h 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity of the low k layer a series of numerical experiments with different hydraulic conductivities of the low k layer k l were used to explore the influence of hydraulic conductivity on nitrate contamination and si k l used in each scenario was obtained from the oki et al 1998 and kim et al 2006 models lu et al 2013a illustrated that the flow and concentration fields were strongly influenced by k l in terms of constant head boundary conditions on both landward and seaward sides fig 9 a shows that for case hlh ni and nd increased with the increase in k l from 0 125 to 2 5 m d a high hydraulic conductivity normally generates high seepage velocity zheng et al 2021 and the flow rate is proportional to the nitrate advective transport in the aquifer the cut off wall induced swr decreased from 73 38 to 64 60 as k l increased fig 9b the low k layer delayed freshwater discharge causing more freshwater to stay at the opening of the wall for longer which resulted in a greater repulsion from the saltwater wedge with the magnitude of k l increasing from 0 125 to 2 5 m d the accumulation ratio of tnm showed a trend of first increasing and then slowly decreasing fig 9b the accumulation of total nitrate mass in the phreatic aquifer was determined by nitrate infiltration and discharge when the ni rate greatly exceeded the nd rate nitrate in the upstream inland aquifer was enriched by degrees tnm was increased and vice versa the infiltrated nitrate was also affected by the hydraulic conductivity of the middle low permeability layer when k l was 0 125 m d nitrate infiltration was 35 g d but conversely when k l was 2 5 m d the infiltration of nitrate increased to 63 g d nd and ni both increased with the increase in k l and the gap between them was non monotonic it first increased 0 125 1 m d then decreased with k l from 1 to 2 5 m d consequently tnm first increased 35 33 67 62 and then slowly decreased 67 62 62 19 with the increase in the magnitude of k l from 0 125 to 2 5 m d fig 9b fig 9c further confirms this phenomenon the nitrate contaminated area with a k l of 0 5 m d is clearly larger than that of 1 25 m d fig 9c1 and c2 when k l decreased further fig 9c3 the nitrate contaminated area started to decrease 3 3 3 thickness of the low k layer different middle low k layer thicknesses tls were used to explore the influence of low k layer thickness on nitrate pollution in layered aquifers as shown in fig 10 a nd decreased from 50 to 20 g d with as the middle low k layer went from 5 5 to 25 5 m this was because a thicker middle low k layer induced a greater decrease in regional groundwater flow thus significantly reducing the discharge of solute in the aquifer zhang et al 2021 changes in the t l hardly affected the ni which decreased very slightly with increasing t l therefore tnm in the phreatic aquifer increased from 38 08 to 72 08 for all cases under the joint effects of ni and nd fig 10b the changes in tnm indicated that nitrate enrichment was controlled by t l a thicker low k layer always resulted in a longer nitrate transport time increasing the degree of nitrate enrichment in upstream aquifer the change in the thickness of the middle low k layer had little effect on the swr indicating that a change in the thickness of the low k layer did not influence the effectiveness of the cut off wall fig 10c1 c3 demonstrate nitrate and saltwater distributions at different tls in case hlh at 5000 d we found that si was effectively mitigated by a 40 m height wall in all the simulated cases t l 5 5 m 10 5 m and 25 5 m in addition the inhibition of the downward freshwater flow carrying no3 from the upper part to the lower part of the aquifer by the middle layer was induced by its larger thickness which finally resulted in a reduction of nitrate contamination area in the bottom layer 4 discussion referring to previous studies lu et al 2013a b sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 we assumed constant water head boundary at the inland side to investigate the impact of aquifer stratification on nitrate enrichment induced by cut off wall in coastal aquifers although the inland boundary type head or flux setup is critical for numerical simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers chang et al 2020 systematic comparisons of nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in the field scale models with specified head inland boundary and specified flux inland boundary are beyond the purpose of this study nonetheless the simulations including several layering pattern cases with no cut off wall and with the cut off wall were conducted with a corresponding specified flux inland boundary i e using the parameter values adopted with specified head inland boundary setting of this study the results of which are illustrated and analyzed in text s1 and fig 11 the results obtained in the field scale models with specified head inland boundary and specified flux inland boundary indicate the similar trends in terms of nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in both homogeneous scenario and case hlh as expected in this study the setting of the three layer stratification patterns and the ratio of hydraulic conductivity were based on classical study of layered aquifers lu et al 2013a abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 comparison between the cases with and without cut off walls in the same pattern makes sense to demonstrate the impact of cut off walls however it was ignored that the impact that all the patterns have different total transmissivity only the l h and h l have the same total transmissivity on numerical results to generalize our findings the patterns which have same total transmissivity were designed in table s1 to ensure that the different results only from the layering pattern by excluding all other hydrogeological conditions the results of patterns which have same total k in fig 12 are in general consistent with the findings of section 3 3 1 which proved that layering pattern affected nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in coastal aquifers furthermore this study focused on stratified heterogeneity out of simplicity and there are still some limitations regarding the setup of the numerical experiments in the future we are going to investigate the influence of other types of heterogeneity fractures macropores tomography parameters e g dispersity dimension 2d 3d representation on nitrate enrichment induced by cut off walls in coastal aquifers 5 summary and conclusions in this study numerical simulations for density dependent flow reactive solute transport were used to explore the influence of layered heterogeneity on nitrate contamination behind cut off walls field scale numerical simulations with three layers with various hydraulic conductivity arrangements were developed to study the effect of layered heterogeneity on the distributions of si and nitrate contamination we compared the dynamic mechanisms of nitrate enrichment and denitrification between homogeneous and layered cases h and hlh under the influence of cut off walls we explored the influence of walls parameters location and depth and various properties of stratified aquifer on nitrate contamination and came to the following conclusions 1 based on the comparison between homogeneous scenario and heterogeneous case hlh the accumulation ratio of the specific volume of nitrate contamination zone svnr and accumulation ratio of total nitrate mass tnm in case hlh were 8 00 and 22 79 higher than that of homogeneous scenario respectively however the layered heterogeneity did not influence the effectiveness of cut off wall on si control three additional layering patterns further demonstrated that the layer stratification pattern substantially disrupted groundwater movement thus significantly affecting the nitrate accumulation response i e tnm in cases lhl l h and h l were 55 70 1 71 and 35 6 respectively 2 the influence of cut off wall structures height and location on si and nitrate pollution are investigated when wall height h increased from 50 to 90 tnm increased from 55 to 63 and swr increased from 56 to 67 in case hlh the growth rates of tnm and swr became lower when the bottom of the wall was located within the low permeability layer with the increase of the distance between wall and the ocean d the nitrate enrichment degree in the upstream aquifer decreased while seawater intruded further in case hlh tnm decreased from about 67 to 39 and swr decreased from approximately 80 to 9 when d increased from 5 to 30 3 the degree of nitrate enrichment did not exhibit a monotonic change with increasing k l when k l increased from 0 125 to 2 5 m d tnm first increased 35 33 67 62 and then slowly decreased 67 62 62 19 under the joint effects of ni and nd the swr induced by the cut off wall decreased from 73 38 to 64 60 tnm increased from 38 08 to 72 08 as t l changed from 5 5 to 25 5 m the change in t l did not influence the effectiveness of cut off wall on si control our numerical results were based on the concept of a three layered stratified aquifer since heterogeneity in real world can be more complex the analysis of flow dynamics and nitrate accumulation mechanisms may be extended to multi layered aquifers our results demonstrate that layered aquifers with certain hydraulic conductivity configurations can result in various degrees of nitrate accumulation suggesting an alternative explanation for field measurement data being significantly different from nitrate concentration distributions derived from homogeneous closed systems e g a laboratory sandbox experiment and corresponding numerical simulation as layered heterogeneity is rather common in natural environments our results emphasize the necessity of considering aquifer stratification before planning and designing spbs for si control a more realistic evaluation of the impact on the groundwater environment can be achieved in the future we expect to further investigate the influence of chemical heterogeneities e g the distribution of chemical reactive substances and the effect of boundary conditions e g tidal activities on nitrate contamination behind cut off walls which could provide a better understanding of real world

3382,data driven and machine learning models have recently received increasing interest to resolve the computational speed challenge faced by various physically based simulations a few studies have explored the application of these models to develop new and fast applications for fluvial and pluvial flood prediction extent mapping and flood susceptibility assessment however most studies have focused on model development for specific catchment areas drainage networks or gauge stations hence their results cannot be directly reused to other contexts unless extra data are available and the models are further trained this study explores the generalizability potential of convolutional neural networks cnns as flood prediction models the study proposes a cnn based model that can be reused in different catchment areas with different topography once the model is trained the study investigates two options patch and resizing based options to process catchment areas of different sizes and different shapes the results showed that the cnn based model predicts accurately on unseen catchment areas with significantly less computational time when compared to physically based models the obtained results also suggest that the patch based option is more effective than the resizing based option in terms of prediction accuracy in addition all experiments have shown that the prediction of flow velocity is more accurate than water depth suggesting that the water accumulation is more sensitive to global elevation information than flow velocity keywords pluvial flood prediction data driven modeling surrogate flood modeling 1 introduction solving flow and flood related problems using data driven and machine learning models has recently become a research field receiving growing attention compared to the conventional physically based models governed by systems of differential equations data driven flood models can be considered as the surrogate which exhibits two major advantages first data driven models can produce relatively accurate predictions without the need of having the full a priori knowledge of the phenomena the accuracy of the model is related to the amount quality and diversity of data available this feature suggests that by learning from the observational data we can bypass the complexity issue of physically based models caused by the increasing number of influential factors e g wang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 second data driven flood models substitute the iterative process i e the numerical integration of differential equations with non iterative operations such as the forward propagation of neural networks therefore data driven models benefit from the parallel computing techniques and significantly accelerate the computational process compared with physically based models this feature is extremely important for applications that require a considerable number of simulations or real time predictions for example simulation driven optimizations e g feng et al 2016 mustafa et al 2018 and animations e g ladick√Ω et al 2015 1 1 current status and challenges of data driven flood modeling a considerable number of studies have been conducted for data driven flood modeling using different methods such as decision trees tehrany et al 2013 logistic regressions e g ladicky el al 2015 tehrany et al 2017 support vector machines e g huang et al 2014 tehrany et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and self organizing maps e g zaghloul 2017 leit√£o et al 2018 these studies have shown that data driven techniques are suitable for a wide range of flow related problems with promising accuracy when sufficient data are available however these learning methods require feature extractions when dealing with raster data such as elevation maps the feature extraction can be computationally expensive and may not be feasible for larger scale problems e g zaghloul 2017 leit√£o et al 2018 recently neural networks nns have become a dominant method for data driven flow and flood modeling due to 1 the ability of nns to approximate strong and non linear correlations 2 the ability to process raw raster data and 3 the variety of nn s architecture to explore many studies have reported that nn based models outperformed other methods in terms of the prediction accuracy for the same task e g gebrehiwot et al 2019 bui et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the studies of nn based models can be further differentiated into two directions the first direction adopts fully connected networks and convolutional neural networks cnns for spatial flood predictions of catchment areas this direction typically predicts one pixel at a time using the surround information of the pixels e g berkhahn et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 bui et al 2020 wang et al 2020 or predict a large area at once using image to image modeling techniques guo et al 2020a l√∂we et al 2021 the second direction typically uses recurrent neural networks rnns to conduct long term predictions for drainage networks or catchment level rainfall runoff relations e g chang et al 2004 chang et al 2014 chen et al 2013 tan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a kratzert et al 2019b gude et al 2020 an exception can be found in kabir et al 2020 who used cnns to process temporal data that were encoded as matrixes the rows of the matrixes represent the time series while the columns represent the features the recent studies have demonstrated the promising potential of data driven flood modeling however most studies have focused on specific catchment areas or drainage systems e g chen et al 2013 chang et al 2014 bui et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 wang et al 2020 and their results cannot be directly extrapolated and transferred to other locations without adding more data and further training to the models data driven flood models that can generalize to different terrain inputs are not fully explored regarding this problem mustafa et al 2018 showed that a neural network trained with artificially generated terrain performed well on other unseen terrains that were produced by the same generator however the neural network was trained with the user defined parameters of the generator rather than the raw elevation data thus the result cannot be easily extended to other applications berkhahn et al 2019 trained different models for each of the catchment areas and showed that the same neural network architecture has the potential to be used in different locations a step further was made by kratzert et al 2019a and kratzert et al 2019b who investigated recurrent neural networks for predicting catchment level rainfall runoff relations the networks were tested on basins that were not included in the training data and outperformed the calibrated traditional hydrology models l√∂we et al 2021 trained a cnn model using raster data sampled from the same city the network was based on the concept of u net which is a network architecture for image to image translation and has showed a promising accuracy on raster samples of the same city that were not used as the training data the lack of data driven models extrapolatable to unseen terrains can be justified by two main reasons first many machine learning algorithms require the input data to have the same dimensionality which means we need to develop a systematic representation for catchment areas of different sizes or drainage networks of different topologies second such models require large amount of flood data to be available as the training data however preparing such dataset is computationally expensive due to the size and the spatial and temporal resolutions of urban scale flood simulations despite these recent works other type of predictions such as surface water depth and flow velocities of different catchment areas have not yet been well studied therefore researchers and urban planners still lack proper models for large scale simulation intensive applications this situation emphasizes the need of exploring data driven flood models capable of accurate flood predictions on different terrain inputs 1 2 objective investigating the terrain generalizability of data driven flood models in this study we propose a data driven pluvial flood prediction model that can generalize to different terrain inputs in other words once the model is trained it can be used to different catchment areas that are not included in the training data the proposed model represents the pluvial flood prediction as an image to image translation task that can be handled by cnns compared to other machine learning algorithms cnns offer two advantages 1 the ability of learning spatial features from the input data and 2 the ability to avoid the explosive growth of model s complexity when handling raster image data as cnns were shown effective to generalize on various rainfall events for urban scale inundation prediction guo et al 2020a we mainly focus on the flood prediction of the same event in different catchment areas compared with other cnns based studies which focus on specific locations e g zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 or process one raster pixel as a time e g zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 our study takes a step further to handle different locations and simplify the prediction process i e raster to raster instead of raster to pixel the main contributions of our study can be summarized as follow 1 a new data driven flood prediction model capable to generalize to different catchment areas i e areas with different topography and to generate flood predictions in a few seconds with a promising accuracy compared to physically based simulation results 2 two different spatial discretization options to handle catchment areas of different sizes which can be used as references for further research and 3 a large pluvial flood dataset generated using a simplified physically based flood model that can contribute to other related flood prediction studies 2 method and materials 2 1 problem statement this study focuses on the development of a data driven flood prediction model capable of terrain generalizability which means once the model is trained it can be used on different catchment areas that were not presented in the training data set as a first step we concentrate on the generalizability to different terrain inputs and simplify the problem by 1 neglecting other contributing factors such as surface types and land uses to reduce the model s complexity and the amount of data required 2 focusing on the maximum water depths and flow velocities as they are the key factors for risk assessment and urban planning and 3 focusing on one rainfall event of approximately 100 year return period to study whether the model successfully transfer the information learnt from some catchments to other catchments our study considers flood prediction as a supervised learning task in which the prediction model is trained using input output pairs the inputs are elevation raster i e spatial maps of terrain elevations and the outputs are flooding raster i e spatial maps of maximum water depth and flow velocity after the training step the model can predict the maximum water depth and flow velocity from the new elevation data that is fed as input we implement such prediction model using cnns to utilize the spatial information of adjacent image pixels raster cells however most existing cnn models have relatively small input sizes e g 256 256 pixels which are significantly smaller than the size of catchment areas e g 3 000 3 000 pixels as it is not feasible to increase the input size of cnns to the size of catchment areas due to the model s complexity and the memory limitation of most graphic cards we propose two options to balance between information loss and model implementation the patch and the resizing based options 2 1 1 patch based option the patch based option discretizes catchment areas to patches and assembles the patch level outputs to the final predictions this option was shown effective for describing large original objects e g masci et al 2015 ronneberger et al 2015 however considering the information loss caused by the patch sampling we chose a relatively large patch size of 1 024 1 024 to preserve as much global information as possible also we over sample the patches to reduce errors using overlapping pixels guo et al 2020a during the experiment we have also tested other patch sizes for comparison purposes 2 1 2 resizing based option the resizing based option down samples large catchment areas and then up samples the outputs to their original sizes the purpose of this option is to study whether cnns can effectively handle resized inputs and make accurate predictions as in other applications such as computer visions e g badrinarayanan et al 2017 the resizing based option preserves global elevation information but destroys local detailed patterns but the lost details can be re generatable by synthetic up sampling methods e g chu and thuerey 2017 we choose a large input size 1 024 1 024 to preserve as much local information as possible and to make the two options comparable 2 2 model design the cnn model is designed based on the structure of u net ronneberger et al 2015 a neural network architecture that is characterized by the skip connections between shallow and deep layers the main reason to use u net rather than other cnn architectures is to preserve the detailed spatial patterns in the outputs while keeping the receptive field as large as possible the receptive field refers to the visible pixels of the input layer for each output pixel luo et al 2016 it corresponds to the hydrological fact that the water accumulation in a small region is the result of water flowing from larger areas i e from upstream to downstream larger receptive field allows the cnn model to learn from the global elevation information rather than only from local terrain patterns geirhos et al 2019 fig 1 shows a diagram explaining the concept of receptive field the receptive field can be increased by 1 adding more network layers and 2 using larger convolutional kernels however these two strategies will smooth out the detailed spatial patterns for most cnn architectures long et al 2015 although small convolutional kernels can improve the output details badrinarayanan et al 2017 using small kernels is in contradiction with the goal to having a global view of the input data this issue is resolved by skip connections as they bring shortcuts between the input and output layers in addition the skip connections reduce the difficulties to train deep cnns and improve the accuracy he et al 2016 the structure of our cnn model is shown in fig 2 where the input is a terrain raster with four image channels elevation slope aspect and curvature and the output is the corresponding flood predictions water depth and flow velocity the model consists of an encoder and a decoder the encoder is a series of convolutional and max pooling layers which compress the input raster to arrays of smaller sizes the decoder is a series of up sampling and convolutional layers which decompress the compressed arrays to the output raster for each up sampling layer of the decoder its output array is concatenated with the array of the same size produced by the encoder the concatenated arrays are fed to the successive layer of the up sampling layers the number of layers of the cnn model depends on the size of the input the goal is to have the receptive field in the latent layer the last layer of the encoder larger than the input size the receptive field rn of the n th hidden layer of the encoder can be calculated using eq 1 1 r n k 1 i f n 1 r n 1 k n 1 i 1 n 1 s i i f n 1 in the equation kn sn are the kernel size the size of the convolutional kernel and the stride of the n th hidden layer respectively for max pooling layers k s therefore the larger the input size the deeper the network based on this formulation a good combination that efficiently increases the receptive field of the encoder part is two convolutional layers with k 7 and s 1 followed by one max pooling layer with k 2 and s 2 for the decoder part we used a symmetrical layer sequence and replace all max pooling layers by up sampling layers with k 2 all convolutional layers of the decoder part have a k 3 in order to better preserve detail spatial patterns the activation functions for all except the last convolutional layers are leaky relu maas et al 2013 the leaky relu function avoids the vanishing gradient problem hochreiter 1998 of the sigmoid functions and the dead neuron problem of the rectified linear function nair and hinton 2010 the output layer has no activation function and produces unbounded values the cnn models were implemented using keras 2 2 2 chollet et al 2015 and tensorflow 1 14 0 abadi et al 2016 and were trained using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 with a learning rate of 5 10 5 the batch size for all training was two we used a small batch size due to the memory limitation of the available graphic card a nvidia gtx 1080 ti with 11 gb memory the loss function for training the models was mean squared loss all no data pixels were excluded from the loss functions for all models we stopped the training process when their test losses converge to stable values 2 3 data source and data processing the elevation data for this study were collected from the geovite geodata service of eth zurich https geovite ethz ch the data were downloaded as 2 m raster tiles and were processed to catchment areas using gis software the collected elevation data consist of two regions the first region is an area of approximately 90 km 65 km around the canton of zurich switzerland containing 649 catchment areas the second region is located at the cities of lausanne and geneva switzerland containing seven catchment areas the catchment areas of the first region were randomly split into two sets that contain 433 and 216 catchment areas respectively the larger set was used as the training dataset and the smaller set was used as the validation datasets all the catchment areas of the second region were used as the test dataset fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the dataset where catchment areas with red boundaries belong to the validation and test datasets fig 4 reports the terrain characteristics of the datasets it is noteworthy that these characteristics show the average conditions of the catchments not representing detailed spatial patterns and that the catchment characteristics were not used as inputs during the training process the ground truth i e maximum water depths and flow velocities of all catchment areas were created by conducting simulations using caddies model guidolin et al 2016 caddies is a cellular automata based flood model capable of relatively fast pluvial flood simulations all simulations were five hours length and were based on a designed 100 year event generated using the alternating block method te chow et al 1988 note that this rainfall event of approximately 100 year return period was used on the entire region without considering the rainfall characteristics of the different locations the purpose for using the same event is to focus on the main factor i e terrain elevations and maintain other numerical inputs constant the rainfall intensity of the event is shown in table 1 the training data for the patch and resizing based options were prepared differently for the patch based option the training data were patches input output pairs randomly sampled from the catchment areas of the training dataset each patch contains three raster maps the terrain elevations the maximum water depth and the maximum flow velocity we oversampled the patches so that the total number of patch pixels is three times larger than the total number of catchment pixels for the resizing based option the training data were raster maps produced by resizing each of the catchment areas in the training dataset the resizing was based on the longer side of the original catchment areas and the shorter side of the results were padded with 0 s to match the input size of the cnns in addition data augmentation techniques that flip and rotate the inputs were used to increase the number of training data during the training process the cnn models were trained using the training set only and were evaluated using both validation and test sets for both options the training data were pre processed before being fed to the cnn models the data pre processing consists of three steps 1 computing terrain features including slope aspect and curvature from the raw elevation data xraw using the approach proposed by de smith et al 2007 2 rescaling the raw elevation xraw to c max xraw xraw where max returns the maximum value and c is a constant and 3 concatenating the terrain features and the rescaled elevation to raster maps of multiple image channels all no data pixels were filled with 0 s during data preprocessing we trained the cnns with and without data preprocessing and found that although the cnns can learn and converge using raw elevation data the learning process was much faster using preprocessed training data the test run also showed that smaller c such as 0 01 performed better than larger values in terms of the learning speed this result is reported in the appendix 2 4 model validation 2 4 1 performance evaluation the performance of the cnn models was evaluated from the aspect of prediction accuracy and computational time the prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing the ground truths and the prediction results using two commonly used performance indicators modified index of agreement d1 and rooted mean squared error rmse both indicators show the deviation of the prediction results from the ground truths and the d1 value emphasizes on the relative errors willmott et al 1985 while the rmse focuses on the absolute errors the calculation of these indicators is reported in table 2 as the output of the cnn models consists of two image channels the maximum water depth and the maximum flow velocity the indicators were computed individually for each of the output channels the computation was conducted using inundated pixels only which means both the no data and the non inundated pixels were excluded the inundated pixels were selected by filtering the pixels where either water depth or flow velocity exceeds the given thresholds these thresholds were set to 0 05 m and 0 05 m s lastly these performance indicators were individually computed for each of the catchments rather than for the entire dataset the computational time was measured by the average prediction time for each catchment area for the resizing based option this time is equivalent to the time for processing one input raster for the patch based option the time depends on the size of the catchment area i e how many patches are sampled in our experiment we sampled the patches by moving a patch size patch size window horizontally and vertically with a step of patch size 2 until the entire catchment area is reached the patch size depends on the input size of the cnn model for example 1 024 1 024 pixels in addition to the prediction time the time for necessary data preprocessing was also measured 2 4 2 validation experiments the evaluation process described above was conducted in multiple validation experiments to compare the performance of different options patch based and resizing based options and different cnn model variants each validation experiment produces a list of d1 and rmse values that show the performance of the corresponding model on all catchments the cnn model variants that were tested in the validation experiments were listed in table 3 these variants were created by changing the key variables of the cnn model the input size and the kernel size due to the long training process of each cnn model we did not exhaustively test all possible values rather we selected three input values and two kernel sizes producing six model variants in total these model variants were named by input size kernel size in addition to reduce the potential information lost we only tested the resizing based option with cnn models that have the largest input size i e 1 024 1 024 pixels 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparing two options and different model designs the performance of the proposed options and different model variants is presented in fig 5 as can be seen the performance of patch based option is significantly higher than the resizing based option the worst performing patch based model shows a higher accuracy than the best performing resizing based model this result indicates that unlike other cnn based image recognitions that work well on images of different sizes learning a flood model from resized rasters is difficult the loss of the detailed terrain information due to image resizing cannot be compensated by having a global view of the terrain for the patch based option it is clear that models with larger receptive field are more accurate for both water depth and flow velocity this trend can be better seen when different input size such as 512 and 256 or different kernel size such as k7 and k3 are compared this result indicates that the availability of terrain information in larger scale is essential for flood predictions without sufficient receptive field the models would tend to memorize the training data rather than make good generalization on the test data also when the receptive field decreases the accuracy drop is less significant for the flow velocity than for the water depth which indicates that the flow velocity is affected more by the local elevation pattern than by the global terrain information thus making flow velocity easier to learn and to predict 3 2 time performance the time comparison between the cellular automata based simulations and cnn models is presented in fig 6 where each point represents one catchment the x axes of the plots represent the simulation time and the y axes show the prediction time the orange points consider both prediction time and the time for necessary data preprocessing whereas the blue points consider only the prediction times the plots clearly show that cnns achieved a significant improvement on computational speed results that take approximately 20 000 s by simulations can be obtained by 3 s using cnn based models for the patch based option the prediction time is linearly correlated with the simulation time this is due to the increasing number of patches sampled from larger catchment areas for the resizing based option the prediction time blue is constant and the data preprocessing time orange slightly increases for catchment areas that cost more simulation time explained by the different size of the catchment areas the baseline experiment shows that the data processing time remains constant if all elevation data have same size 3 3 case studies in addition to the mentioned performance indicators we manually selected four catchment areas from the validation dataset for case studies to assess the model s spatial performance their locations are shown in fig 3 the case studies were selected as 1 they correspond to relatively extreme rmse values that represent the best and worst performing scenarios for the cnn models and 2 they represent different terrain conditions i e sample b and d are urban areas and sample a and c are rural areas fig 7 shows the rmse of all catchments using both options where the four selected cases are highlighted with different symbols figs 8 11 show the spatial rendering of the flood predictions of the four case studies the flood predictions were generated using the patch based option and the non flooded pixels water depth 0 05 m or flow velocity 0 05 m s were excluded from the rendering in the appendix we present more spatial renderings from the test dataset figs 8 and 9 show two low rmse cases sample a and b that correspond to rural sample a and urban sample b conditions respectively a visual examination of the spatial rendering clearly shows that both the water depth and flow velocity predictions are reasonably accurate on the other hand the flood extent prediction colored pixels of the downstream area in fig 9 shows a visual pattern that differs from the simulation result however we would emphasize that this pattern difference can be justified by the nonlinear colormap which gives more color spectrum to smaller values than to larger values as seen in the error map of fig 9 right column despite the pattern difference the accuracy of the downstream area is high figs 10 and 11 show two high rmse cases sample c and d that represent the worst performing scenarios of the cnn model in rural sample c and urban sample d conditions comparing with the previous low rmse cases these high rmse cases have larger elevation span and are characterized by the under predictions in the downstream deep water areas the dark red areas of the water depth simulations although the cnn model was able to recognize a relatively accurate flood extent for these deep water areas the numerical accuracy of these areas is substantially lower when compared with that of other areas on the other hand despite the under predictions of the downstream areas the prediction accuracy of the upper stream areas remains high this suggests that the main challenge for the cnn model is to correctly recognize the effect of water accumulation in large areas despite the comparison of these cases has suggested that the larger the catchment elevation range the lower the prediction accuracy when all catchments are taken into account no clear relationship between this terrain feature and the prediction accuracy is observed right hand side plot of fig 7 in both path and resizing options one can see left and middle plots in fig 7 that the prediction accuracy is variable throughout the catchment area this may indicate that the generalizability of the model and its prediction accuracy can be improved if a larger training dataset is used 4 conclusions limitations and future works this study presented a data driven approach for fast flood prediction using cnns that is able to generalize on different catchment areas and topographies the study consists of two experiments that explored different methods for processing catchment areas larger than the input size of cnns the results have shown that cnns exhibit a promising ability to generalize the information learnt from the training data to other unseen terrains suggesting a potential to serve as the rapid surrogate model for flood predictions of different scenarios the results of the experiments also showed that cnn models with larger receptive field tend to have higher accuracy than models with small receptive field this suggests that water accumulation is sensitive to the global patterns of the catchment area and the prediction accuracy depends on how much global information is available this conclusion was also reported by tsubaki and kawahara 2013 on the other hand several drawbacks and limitations exist and remain as possible future research directions the first drawback is that our experiment performed holdout validations rather than k fold cross validations this can be explained by the limitations on available computational power compared with the holdout validations k fold cross validations smooth out the results and avoid highly misleading results however we considered this drawback acceptable as 1 the goal of this study was not to conduct a benchmark test which compares the performance of our model with other models using a specific dataset 2 we have trained multiple models which help to avoid outliers and 3 we had a relatively large dataset compared with other studies as each catchment area produces multiple training samples which compensates for the lack of cross validations the second drawback is that we have simplified the problem and only focused on the main contributing factor i e the elevation other influential factors such as land cover and spatial distributions of precipitation intensities were neglected this decision was made to reduce the model s complexity and the amount of data required for the investigation therefore future investigations are still required before applying this type of flood models to real applications another limitation of the presented model is that the prediction accuracy can still be further improved the mispredictions in some of the catchments suggest that the major challenge is how to recognize the water accumulations from large regions possible solutions for this issue include considering larger training dataset oversampling the deep water regions and modifying the loss functions to gain more weights for the deep water regions lastly our study was conducted using caddies as the flood data provider and therefore the accuracy was highly depended on the performance of the caddies however we would like to clarify that the goal was to investigate whether data driven models can produce results as good as that of physically based models the reliability issue of data driven predictions will be addressed by training with observational data in future works as of future works the systematically encoding of catchment areas of arbitrary sizes and shapes remains a challenge this issue was handled by the patch and resizing based options in our experiments which showed that the former performed significantly better than the letter on both validation and test dataset however other possible methods that worth to explore include testing new neural network architecture or sampling patches based on flow movement rather than spatial locations e g chu and thuerey 2017 another interesting direction of future research would be to estimate the flow dynamic based on input constraints such as spatial rainfall intensity also the rapid development of sensor networks has made it possible to collect data by crowdsourcing methods zheng et al 2018 or computer vision techniques e g moy de vitry et al 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 opening new possibilities to

et al 2020b hosted by the research collection of eth zurich with doi link 10 3929 ethz b 000453305 appendix figs a1 and a2 show two samples from the test dataset the terrains of the test dataset were not included in the training data and were collected from regions far from where training data were collected as seen despite the unfamiliar terrains the accuracy of the cnn model was promising as mentioned in section 4 2 several tests were made to train cnn models with and without terrain features these tests were made using patches sampled from several catchment areas the results of these tests are presented as loss curves in fig a3 in which the left plot shows the result of different c values and the right plot shows the result of different terrain features it is clear from the left plot that the model converges faster as the c decreases however the improvement on convergence speed becomes less significant when c 0 01 the right plot suggests that models using multiple features converge faster than those using one feature or those without any feature 
3382,data driven and machine learning models have recently received increasing interest to resolve the computational speed challenge faced by various physically based simulations a few studies have explored the application of these models to develop new and fast applications for fluvial and pluvial flood prediction extent mapping and flood susceptibility assessment however most studies have focused on model development for specific catchment areas drainage networks or gauge stations hence their results cannot be directly reused to other contexts unless extra data are available and the models are further trained this study explores the generalizability potential of convolutional neural networks cnns as flood prediction models the study proposes a cnn based model that can be reused in different catchment areas with different topography once the model is trained the study investigates two options patch and resizing based options to process catchment areas of different sizes and different shapes the results showed that the cnn based model predicts accurately on unseen catchment areas with significantly less computational time when compared to physically based models the obtained results also suggest that the patch based option is more effective than the resizing based option in terms of prediction accuracy in addition all experiments have shown that the prediction of flow velocity is more accurate than water depth suggesting that the water accumulation is more sensitive to global elevation information than flow velocity keywords pluvial flood prediction data driven modeling surrogate flood modeling 1 introduction solving flow and flood related problems using data driven and machine learning models has recently become a research field receiving growing attention compared to the conventional physically based models governed by systems of differential equations data driven flood models can be considered as the surrogate which exhibits two major advantages first data driven models can produce relatively accurate predictions without the need of having the full a priori knowledge of the phenomena the accuracy of the model is related to the amount quality and diversity of data available this feature suggests that by learning from the observational data we can bypass the complexity issue of physically based models caused by the increasing number of influential factors e g wang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 second data driven flood models substitute the iterative process i e the numerical integration of differential equations with non iterative operations such as the forward propagation of neural networks therefore data driven models benefit from the parallel computing techniques and significantly accelerate the computational process compared with physically based models this feature is extremely important for applications that require a considerable number of simulations or real time predictions for example simulation

explore many studies have reported that nn based models outperformed other methods in terms of the prediction accuracy for the same task e g gebrehiwot et al 2019 bui et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the studies of nn based models can be further differentiated into two directions the first direction adopts fully connected networks and convolutional neural networks cnns for spatial flood predictions of catchment areas this direction typically predicts one pixel at a time using the surround information of the pixels e g berkhahn et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 bui et al 2020 wang et al 2020 or predict a large area at once using image to image modeling techniques guo et al 2020a l√∂we et al 2021 the second direction typically uses recurrent neural networks rnns to conduct long term predictions for drainage networks or catchment level rainfall runoff relations e g chang et al 2004 chang et al 2014 chen et al 2013 tan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a kratzert et al 2019b gude et al 2020 an exception can be found in kabir et al 2020 who used cnns to process temporal data that were encoded as matrixes the rows of the matrixes represent the time series while the columns represent the features the recent studies have demonstrated the promising potential of data driven flood modeling however most studies have focused on specific catchment areas or drainage systems e g chen et al 2013 chang et al 2014 bui et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 wang et al 2020 and their results cannot be directly extrapolated and transferred to other locations without adding more data and further training to the models data driven flood models that can generalize to different terrain inputs are not fully explored regarding this problem mustafa et al 2018 showed that a neural network trained with artificially generated terrain performed well on other unseen terrains that were produced by the same generator however the neural network was trained with the user defined parameters of the generator rather than the raw elevation data thus the result cannot be easily extended to other applications berkhahn et al 2019 trained different models for each of the catchment areas and showed that the same neural network architecture has the potential to be used in different locations a step further was made by kratzert et al 2019a and kratzert et al 2019b who investigated recurrent neural networks for predicting catchment level rainfall runoff relations the networks were tested on basins that were not included in the training data and outperformed the calibrated traditional hydrology models l√∂we et al 2021 trained a cnn model using raster data sampled from the same city the network was based on the concept of u net which is a network architecture for image to image translation and has showed a promising accuracy on raster samples of the same city that were not used as the training data the lack of data driven models extrapolatable to unseen terrains can be justified by two main reasons first many machine learning algorithms require the input data to have the same dimensionality which means we need to develop a systematic representation for catchment areas of different sizes or drainage networks of different topologies second such models require large amount of flood data to be available as the training data however preparing such dataset is computationally expensive due to the size and the spatial and temporal resolutions of urban scale flood simulations despite these recent works other type of predictions such as surface water depth and flow velocities of different catchment areas have not yet been well studied therefore researchers and urban planners still lack proper models for large scale simulation intensive applications this situation emphasizes the need of exploring data driven flood models capable of accurate flood predictions on different terrain inputs 1 2 objective investigating the terrain generalizability of data driven flood models in this study we propose a data driven pluvial flood prediction model that can generalize to different terrain inputs in other words once the model is trained it can be used to different catchment areas that are not included in the training data the proposed model represents the pluvial flood prediction as an image to image translation task that can be handled by cnns compared to other machine learning algorithms cnns offer two advantages 1 the ability of learning spatial features from the input data and 2 the ability to avoid the explosive growth of model s complexity when handling raster image data as cnns were shown effective to generalize on various rainfall events for urban scale inundation prediction guo et al 2020a we mainly focus on the flood prediction of the same event in different catchment areas compared with other cnns based studies which focus on specific locations e g zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 or process one raster pixel as a time e g zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 our study takes a step further to handle different locations and simplify the prediction process i e raster to raster instead of raster to pixel the main contributions of our study can be summarized as follow 1 a new data driven flood prediction model capable to generalize to different catchment areas i e areas with different topography and to generate flood predictions in a few seconds with a promising accuracy compared to physically based simulation results 2 two different spatial discretization options to handle catchment areas of different sizes which can be used as references for further research and 3 a large pluvial flood dataset generated using a simplified physically based flood model that can contribute to other related flood prediction studies 2 method and materials 2 1 problem statement this study focuses on the development of a data driven flood prediction model capable of terrain generalizability which means once the model is trained it can be used on different catchment areas that were not presented in the training data set as a first step we concentrate on the generalizability to different terrain inputs and simplify the problem by 1 neglecting other contributing factors such as surface types and land uses to reduce the model s complexity and the amount of data required 2 focusing on the maximum water depths and flow velocities as they are the key factors for risk assessment and urban planning and 3 focusing on one rainfall event of approximately 100 year return period to study whether the model successfully transfer the information learnt from some catchments to other catchments our study considers flood prediction as a supervised learning task in which the prediction model is trained using input output pairs the inputs are elevation raster i e spatial maps of terrain elevations and the outputs are flooding raster i e spatial maps of maximum water depth and flow velocity after the training step the model can predict the maximum water depth and flow velocity from the new elevation data that is fed as input we implement such prediction model using cnns to utilize the spatial information of adjacent image pixels raster cells however most existing cnn models have relatively small input sizes e g 256 256 pixels which are significantly smaller than the size of catchment areas e g 3 000 3 000 pixels as it is not feasible to increase the input size of cnns to the size of catchment areas due to the model s complexity and the memory limitation of most graphic cards we propose two options to balance between information loss and model implementation the patch and the resizing based options 2 1 1 patch based option the patch based option discretizes catchment areas to patches and assembles the patch level outputs to the final predictions this option was shown effective for describing large original objects e g masci et al 2015 ronneberger et al 2015 however considering the information loss caused by the patch sampling we chose a relatively large patch size of 1 024 1 024 to preserve as much global information as possible also we over sample the patches to reduce errors using overlapping pixels guo et al 2020a during the experiment we have also tested other patch sizes for comparison purposes 2 1 2 resizing based option the resizing based option down samples large catchment areas and then up samples the outputs to their original sizes the purpose of this option is to study whether cnns can effectively handle resized inputs and make accurate predictions as in other applications such as computer visions e g badrinarayanan et al 2017 the resizing based option preserves global elevation information but destroys local detailed patterns but the lost details can be re generatable by synthetic up sampling methods e g chu and thuerey 2017 we choose a large input size 1 024 1 024 to preserve as much local information as possible and to make the two options comparable 2 2 model design the cnn model is designed based on the structure of u net ronneberger et al 2015 a neural network architecture that is characterized by the skip connections between shallow and deep layers the main reason to use u net rather than other cnn architectures is to preserve the detailed spatial patterns in the outputs while keeping the receptive field as large as possible the receptive field refers to the visible pixels of the input layer for each output pixel luo et al 2016 it corresponds to the hydrological fact that the water accumulation in a small region is the result of water flowing from larger areas i e from upstream to downstream larger receptive field allows the cnn model to learn from the global elevation information rather than only from local terrain patterns geirhos et al 2019 fig 1 shows a diagram explaining the concept of receptive field the receptive field can be increased by 1 adding more network layers and 2 using larger convolutional kernels however these two strategies will smooth out the detailed spatial patterns for most cnn architectures long et al 2015 although small convolutional kernels can improve the output details badrinarayanan et al 2017 using small kernels is in contradiction with the goal to having a global view of the input data this issue is resolved by skip connections as they bring shortcuts between the input and output layers in addition the skip connections reduce the difficulties to train deep cnns and improve the accuracy he et al 2016 the structure of our cnn model is shown in fig 2 where the input is a terrain raster with four image channels elevation slope aspect and curvature and the output is the corresponding flood predictions water depth and flow velocity the model consists of an encoder and a decoder the encoder is a series of convolutional and max pooling layers which compress the input raster to arrays of smaller sizes the decoder is a series of up sampling and convolutional layers which decompress the compressed arrays to the output raster for each up sampling layer of the decoder its output array is concatenated with the array of the same size produced by the encoder the concatenated arrays are fed to the successive layer of the up sampling layers the number of layers of the cnn model depends on the size of the input the goal is to have the receptive field in the latent layer the last layer of the encoder larger than the input size the receptive field rn of the n th hidden layer of the encoder can be calculated using eq 1 1 r n k 1 i f n 1 r n 1 k n 1 i 1 n 1 s i i f n 1 in the equation kn sn are the kernel size the size of the convolutional kernel and the stride of the n th hidden layer respectively for max pooling layers k s therefore the larger the input size the deeper the network based on this formulation a good combination that efficiently increases the receptive field of the encoder part is two convolutional layers with k 7 and s 1 followed by one max pooling layer with k 2 and s 2 for the decoder part we used a symmetrical layer sequence and replace all max pooling layers by up sampling layers with k 2 all convolutional layers of the decoder part have a k 3 in order to better preserve detail spatial patterns the activation functions for all except the last convolutional layers are leaky relu maas et al 2013 the leaky relu function avoids the vanishing gradient problem hochreiter 1998 of the sigmoid functions and the dead neuron problem of the rectified linear function nair and hinton 2010 the output layer has no activation function and produces unbounded values the cnn models were implemented using keras 2 2 2 chollet et al 2015 and tensorflow 1 14 0 abadi et al 2016 and were trained using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 with a learning rate of 5 10 5 the batch size for all training was two we used a small batch size due to the memory limitation of the available graphic card a nvidia gtx 1080 ti with 11 gb memory the loss function for training the models was mean squared loss all no data pixels were excluded from the loss functions for all models we stopped the training process when their test losses converge to stable values 2 3 data source and data processing the elevation data for this study were collected from the geovite geodata service of eth zurich https geovite ethz ch the data were downloaded as 2 m raster tiles and were processed to catchment areas using gis software the collected elevation data consist of two regions the first region is an area of approximately 90 km 65 km around the canton of zurich switzerland containing 649 catchment areas the second region is located at the cities of lausanne and geneva switzerland containing seven catchment areas the catchment areas of the first region were randomly split into two sets that contain 433 and 216 catchment areas respectively the larger set was used as the training dataset and the smaller set was used as the validation datasets all the catchment areas of the second region were used as the test dataset fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the dataset where catchment areas with red boundaries belong to the validation and test datasets fig 4 reports the terrain characteristics of the datasets it is noteworthy that these characteristics show the average conditions of the catchments not representing detailed spatial patterns and that the catchment characteristics were not used as inputs during the training process the ground truth i e maximum water depths and flow velocities of all catchment areas were created by conducting simulations using caddies model guidolin et al 2016 caddies is a cellular automata based flood model capable of relatively fast pluvial flood simulations all simulations were five hours length and were based on a designed 100 year event generated using the alternating block method te chow et al 1988 note that this rainfall event of approximately 100 year return period was used on the entire region without considering the rainfall characteristics of the different locations the purpose for using the same event is to focus on the main factor i e terrain elevations and maintain other numerical inputs constant the rainfall intensity of the event is shown in table 1 the training data for the patch and resizing based options were prepared differently for the patch based option the training data were patches input output pairs randomly sampled from the catchment areas of the training dataset each patch contains three raster maps the terrain elevations the maximum water depth and the maximum flow velocity we oversampled the patches so that the total number of patch pixels is three times larger than the total number of catchment pixels for the resizing based option the training data were raster maps produced by resizing each of the catchment areas in the training dataset the resizing was based on the longer side of the original catchment areas and the shorter side of the results were padded with 0 s to match the input size of the cnns in addition data augmentation techniques that flip and rotate the inputs were used to increase the number of training data during the training process the cnn models were trained using the training set only and were evaluated using both validation and test sets for both options the training data were pre processed before being fed to the cnn models the data pre processing consists of three steps 1 computing terrain features including slope aspect and curvature from the raw elevation data xraw using the approach proposed by de smith et al 2007 2 rescaling the raw elevation xraw to c max xraw xraw where max returns the maximum value and c is a constant and 3 concatenating the terrain features and the rescaled elevation to raster maps of multiple image channels all no data pixels were filled with 0 s during data preprocessing we trained the cnns with and without data preprocessing and found that although the cnns can learn and converge using raw elevation data the learning process was much faster using preprocessed training data the test run also showed that smaller c such as 0 01 performed better than larger values in terms of the learning speed this result is reported in the appendix 2 4 model validation 2 4 1 performance evaluation the performance of the cnn models was evaluated from the aspect of prediction accuracy and computational time the prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing the ground truths and the prediction results using two commonly used performance indicators modified index of agreement d1 and rooted mean squared error rmse both indicators show the deviation of the prediction results from the ground truths and the d1 value emphasizes on the relative errors willmott et al 1985 while the rmse focuses on the absolute errors the calculation of these indicators is reported in table 2 as the output of the cnn models consists of two image channels the maximum water depth and the maximum flow velocity the indicators were computed individually for each of the output channels the computation was conducted using inundated pixels only which means both the no data and the non inundated pixels were excluded the inundated pixels were selected by filtering the pixels where either water depth or flow velocity exceeds the given thresholds these thresholds were set to 0 05 m and 0 05 m s lastly these performance indicators were individually computed for each of the catchments rather than for the entire dataset the computational time was measured by the average prediction time for each catchment area for the resizing based option this time is equivalent to the time for processing one input raster for the patch based option the time depends on the size of the catchment area i e how many patches are sampled in our experiment we sampled the patches by moving a patch size patch size window horizontally and vertically with a step of patch size 2 until the entire catchment area is reached the patch size depends on the input size of the cnn model for example 1 024 1 024 pixels in addition to the prediction time the time for necessary data preprocessing was also measured 2 4 2 validation experiments the evaluation process described above was conducted in multiple validation experiments to compare the performance of different options patch based and resizing based options and different cnn model variants each validation experiment produces a list of d1 and rmse values that show the performance of the corresponding model on all catchments the cnn model variants that were tested in the validation experiments were listed in table 3 these variants were created by changing the key variables of the cnn model the input size and the kernel size due to the long training process of each cnn model we did not exhaustively test all possible values rather we selected three input values and two kernel sizes producing six model variants in total these model variants were named by input size kernel size in addition to reduce the potential information lost we only tested the resizing based option with cnn models that have the largest input size i e 1 024 1 024 pixels 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparing two options and different model designs the performance of the proposed options and different model variants is presented in fig 5 as can be seen the performance of patch based option is significantly higher than the resizing based option the worst performing patch based model shows a higher accuracy than the best performing resizing based model this result indicates that unlike other cnn based image recognitions that work well on images of different sizes learning a flood model from resized rasters is difficult the loss of the detailed terrain information due to image resizing cannot be compensated by having a global view of the terrain for the patch based option it is clear that models with larger receptive field are more accurate for both water depth and flow velocity this trend can be better seen when different input size such as 512 and 256 or different kernel size such as k7 and k3 are compared this result indicates that the availability of terrain information in larger scale is essential for flood predictions without sufficient receptive field the models would tend to memorize the training data rather than make good generalization on the test data also when the receptive field decreases the accuracy drop is less significant for the flow velocity than for the water depth which indicates that the flow velocity is affected more by the local elevation pattern than by the global terrain information thus making flow velocity easier to learn and to predict 3 2 time performance the time comparison between the cellular automata based simulations and cnn models is presented in fig 6 where each point represents one catchment the x axes of the plots represent the simulation time and the y axes show the prediction time the orange points consider both prediction time and the time for necessary data preprocessing whereas the blue points consider only the prediction times the plots clearly show that cnns achieved a significant improvement on computational speed results that take approximately 20 000 s by simulations can be obtained by 3 s using cnn based models for the patch based option the prediction time is linearly correlated with the simulation time this is due to the increasing number of patches sampled from larger catchment areas for the resizing based option the prediction time blue is constant and the data preprocessing time orange slightly increases for catchment areas that cost more simulation time explained by the different size of the catchment areas the baseline experiment shows that the data processing time remains constant if all elevation data have same size 3 3 case studies in addition to the mentioned performance indicators we manually selected four catchment areas from the validation dataset for case studies to assess the model s spatial performance their locations are shown in fig 3 the case studies were selected as 1 they correspond to relatively extreme rmse values that represent the best and worst performing scenarios for the cnn models and 2 they represent different terrain conditions i e sample b and d are urban areas and sample a and c are rural areas fig 7 shows the rmse of all catchments using both options where the four selected cases are highlighted with different symbols figs 8 11 show the spatial rendering of the flood predictions of the four case studies the flood predictions were generated using the patch based option and the non flooded pixels water depth 0 05 m or flow velocity 0 05 m s were excluded from the rendering in the appendix we present more spatial renderings from the test dataset figs 8 and 9 show two low rmse cases sample a and b that correspond to rural sample a and urban sample b conditions respectively a visual examination of the spatial rendering clearly shows that both the water depth and flow velocity predictions are reasonably accurate on the other hand the flood extent prediction colored pixels of the downstream area in fig 9 shows a visual pattern that differs from the simulation result however we would emphasize that this pattern difference can be justified by the nonlinear colormap which gives more color spectrum to smaller values than to larger values as seen in the error map of fig 9 right column despite the pattern difference the accuracy of the downstream area is high figs 10 and 11 show two high rmse cases sample c and d that represent the worst performing scenarios of the cnn model in rural sample c and urban sample d conditions comparing with the previous low rmse cases these high rmse cases have larger elevation span and are characterized by the under predictions in the downstream deep water areas the dark red areas of the water depth simulations although the cnn model was able to recognize a relatively accurate flood extent for these deep water areas the numerical accuracy of these areas is substantially lower when compared with that of other areas on the other hand despite the under predictions of the downstream areas the prediction accuracy of the upper stream areas remains high this suggests that the main challenge for the cnn model is to correctly recognize the effect of water accumulation in large areas despite the comparison of these cases has suggested that the larger the catchment elevation range the lower the prediction accuracy when all catchments are taken into account no clear relationship between this terrain feature and the prediction accuracy is observed right hand side plot of fig 7 in both path and resizing options one can see left and middle plots in fig 7 that the prediction accuracy is variable throughout the catchment area this may indicate that the generalizability of the model and its prediction accuracy can be improved if a larger training dataset is used 4 conclusions limitations and future works this study presented a data driven approach for fast flood prediction using cnns that is able to generalize on different catchment areas and topographies the study consists of two experiments that explored different methods for processing catchment areas larger than the input size of cnns the results have shown that cnns exhibit a promising ability to generalize the information learnt from the training data to other unseen terrains suggesting a potential to serve as the rapid surrogate model for flood predictions of different scenarios the results of the experiments also showed that cnn models with larger receptive field tend to have higher accuracy than models with small receptive field this suggests that water accumulation is sensitive to the global patterns of the catchment area and the prediction accuracy depends on how much global information is available this conclusion was also reported by tsubaki and kawahara 2013 on the other hand several drawbacks and limitations exist and remain as possible future research directions the first drawback is that our experiment performed holdout validations rather than k fold cross validations this can be explained by the limitations on available computational power compared with the holdout validations k fold cross validations smooth out the results and avoid highly misleading results however we considered this drawback acceptable as 1 the goal of this study was not to conduct a benchmark test which compares the performance of our model with other models using a specific dataset 2 we have trained multiple models which help to avoid outliers and 3 we had a relatively large dataset compared with other studies as each catchment area produces multiple training samples which compensates for the lack of cross validations the second drawback is that we have simplified the problem and only focused on the main contributing factor i e the elevation other influential factors such as land cover and spatial distributions of precipitation intensities were neglected this decision was made to reduce the model s complexity and the amount of data required for the investigation therefore future investigations are still required before applying this type of flood models to real applications another limitation of the presented model is that the prediction accuracy can still be further improved the mispredictions in some of the catchments suggest that the major challenge is how to recognize the water accumulations from large regions possible solutions for this issue include considering larger training dataset oversampling the deep water regions and modifying the loss functions to gain more weights for the deep water regions lastly our study was conducted using caddies as the flood data provider and therefore the accuracy was highly depended on the performance of the caddies however we would like to clarify that the goal was to investigate whether data driven models can produce results as good as that of physically based models the reliability issue of data driven predictions will be addressed by training with observational data in future works as of future works the systematically encoding of catchment areas of arbitrary sizes and shapes remains a challenge this issue was handled by the patch and resizing based options in our experiments which showed that the former performed significantly better than the letter on both validation and test dataset however other possible methods that worth to explore include testing new neural network architecture or sampling patches based on flow movement rather than spatial locations e g chu and thuerey 2017 another interesting direction of future research would be to estimate the flow dynamic based on input constraints such as spatial rainfall intensity also the rapid development of sensor networks has made it possible to collect data by crowdsourcing methods zheng et al 2018 or computer vision techniques e g moy de vitry et al 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 opening new possibilities to produce observational flood data to be used in the training step of data driven flood prediction models credit authorship contribution statement zifeng guo data curation writing original draft

et al 2020b hosted by the research collection of eth zurich with doi link 10 3929 ethz b 000453305 appendix figs a1 and a2 show two samples from the test dataset the terrains of the test dataset were not included in the training data and were collected from regions far from where training data were collected as seen despite the unfamiliar terrains the accuracy of the cnn model was promising as mentioned in section 4 2 several tests were made to train cnn models with and without terrain features these tests were made using patches sampled from several catchment areas the results of these tests are presented as loss curves in fig a3 in which the left plot shows the result of different c values and the right plot shows the result of different terrain features it is clear from the left plot that the model converges faster as the c decreases however the improvement on convergence speed becomes less significant when c 0 01 the right plot suggests that models using multiple features converge faster than those using one feature or those without any feature 
3383,strong earthquakes can induce large amounts of loose solid materials forming landslide dams and blocking narrow flow channels under extreme rainfall conditions instability can lead to an outburst of debris flow once the landslide dam has formed it on july 10 2013 a volume of 4 5 104 m3 of debris flow occurred in the yangling gully wenchuan county china this event can be categorized as an outburst of the debris flow that might seriously threaten valley residents existing sediment transport countermeasure works and road infrastructures this paper describes a typical outburst of debris flow calculates its obstructive coefficient simulates the process under various recurrence intervals and analyzes the efficacy of a new mitigation project related research results have laid the foundation for further study of the risk assessment and early warning of debris flow due to landslide dam failure in this paper an accurate computational model for the obstructive coefficient closely related to the flow amplification effect is established based on a dam break s physical experiments combined with the numerical calculation method the movement process of the yangling gully was

flow numerical simulation flow amplification effect obstructive coefficient 1 introduction debris flow triggered by the landslide dam break is a peculiar occurrence in the mountain and ravine regions of the active earthquake areas fig 1 landslide dams are widely distributed worldwide especially in high seismic mountain regions ermini and casagli 2003 korup 2004 unlike artificial dams with reinforced concrete materials a landslide dam is formed by a mixture of loose rock and soil materials in an unstable state once the landslide dam breaks in a gully or a river the debris or flood s peak flow can significantly threaten large areas downstream huang and fan 2013 lee 2014 chang et al 2017 huang and zhang 2020 if the landslide dam blocked the river and formed the barrier lake it is urgent to calculate its instantaneous flow discharge and estimate the flood range as far as possible davies et al 2007 chen et al 2018 fan et al 2019 a survey of 390 landslide dams worldwide found that half blocked rivers and the others had broken among them 25 led to the outburst of debris flows schuster 1993 earthquakes rainstorms and snowmelts trigger more than 80 of landslide dams and a few landslide dams are caused by volcanoes and human activity peng and zhang 2012 failure landslide dams may last from a few minutes to several thousand years depending on the dam material properties location geometry and the upstream flow into the barrier lake the age of 204 landslide dam cases at the time of failure in the databases covers an extensive range from 6 min to 20 000 years it was found that 87 of the landslide dam was unstable less than one year and 34 were unstable within one day peng and zhang 2012 zhao et al 2019 if a landslide dam is formed in the debris flow channel it will be unstable in a relatively short time after heavy rainfall iverson et al 2011 the coseismic landslides significantly increased the volume of unconsolidated material which was prone to be transformed into landslide dams in the debris flow channel three earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 7 0 have all occurred in southwest china since 2000 yu et al 2021 after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake in southwest china more than 56 000 landslides were triggered in the steep mountainous terrain dai et al 2010 xu et al 2014 on april 20 2013 the lushan earthquake produced more than 1031 coseismic landslides in southwest china chang et al 2016 on august 8 2017 a total of 821 coseismic landslides were identified through the jiuzhaigou earthquake in southwest china chang et al 2021 three seismic events in southwest china have resulted in many coseismic landslides in debris flow channels therefore many landslide dams are located in active earthquake areas in southwest china after the wenchuan earthquake the risk assessment of some vital landslide dammed lakes was carried out cui et al 2009 based on the dam s component materials and the barrier lake s maximum capacity a hazard zonation map of 32 dams was provided xu et al 2009 tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the wenchuan earthquake formed a vast barrier lake based on the breach mechanism and model tests the surface erosion accompanied by intermittent mass failure was found in the tangjiashan landslide dam breach case liu et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 to make detailed statistics on the distribution characteristics of landslide dams in the wenchuan earthquake area the complete geomorphic parameters database of 828 landslide dams was built fan et al 2012 catastrophic debris flows in zhouqu china on august 8 2010 were caused by the upstream cascading failure of landslide dams the effect on the scale amplification of debris flow was explained by studying the peak flow discharges at different locations and cascading landslide dam failure modes cui et al 2013 a method of estimating the sediment volume is used to assess the effects of constructed check dams for debris flow in the tajrish watershed iran banihabib and forghani 2017 a three dimensional coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach was used to research the corresponding response of the dynamic impact force and debris flow behavior on a check dam jeong and lee 2019 to sum up many scholars have analyzed the vast disaster brought by the dam breach however few studies on the flow amplification effect after the outburst show no obstructive coefficient characteristics the dam breach is a coupling process of solid liquid phase flow and landslide deposits in debris flow movement the obstructive coefficient parameter directly determines the flow amplification effect and dynamical process of debris flow after the landslide dam instability in recent decades many types of research have focused on the natural dam s predicted breach parameters on the one hand an array of parametric models have been established by analyzing historical data xu and zhang 2009 sattar 2014 froehlich 2016 on the other hand some mature numerical calculation based breach models for embankment and landslides dams are developed such as nws and hr breach fread 1988 morris et al 2009 windam hanson et al 2005 and 3d sph rezaldy et al 2019 however some simulation software fails to consider the relationship between the outburst formation mechanism and its subsequent movement chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the accurate calculation of the obstructive coefficient becomes the critical link the higher the obstructive coefficient is the higher the debris flow discharge formed after the landslide dam failure the flo 2d numerical model was used to simulate the movement process of the outburst debris flow based on the obstructive coefficient the influence of outburst debris flow under different recurrence intervals on the new control project is further discussed this research s main objective is to establish an accurate obstructive coefficient computational model to simulate the movement process of outburst debris flow triggered by the landslide dam failure simultaneously considering various prevention engineering conditions the movement process of debris flow in the yangling gully under various recurrence intervals 50 100 and 200 years respectively was simulated to analyze the effect of mitigation projects 2 study site the study area is the upper part of the min river located in wenchuan county the southwest sichuan

lithology belongs to layered gray phyllite and porphyritic medium coarse granite some sandstone is also present in the study area whereas the quaternary strata are alluvium materials landslide deposits and debris flow accumulations indicated as gravel soil fig 3 the climate is semi arid continental monsoon with cold winters and hot summers a significant annual temperature difference and concentrated precipitation the mean annual rainfall is concentrated from july to september with the yearly average rainfall of 526 3 mm the wenchuan earthquake triggered massive landslides inducing three landslides dames in the yangling gully fig 4 besides a considerable amount of loose materials was present on the canyon and slope which can serve as the source of yangling debris flow substances in the years since the earthquake heavy rainfall may trigger the outburst of debris flow after the wenchuan earthquake which seriously threatens and destroys local economic and social development 3 data and methods 3 1 the july 10 2013 debris flow event and historical events after the wenchuan earthquake continuous field surveillance and prevention measures were undertaken in the study area without considering the landslide dam s blockage hazard in the yangling gully the discharge channel and check dam were built in 2009 fig 3 on july 10 2013 the catastrophic debris flow was triggered by a rainstorm in the study area based on rainfall data from the department of land and resources of sichuan province the recorded cumulative rainfall amount of the yangling gully was 148 1 mm from 00 00 on july 8 to 4 00 was on july 10 2013 fig 5 this debris flow s formation mechanism and characteristics were analyzed based on field investigations and remotely sensed imagery interpretation it was found that abundant loose deposits and intense rainfall led to debris flow many coseismic materials on hillslopes and in the channels provided sufficient kinetic energy large materials for the debris flow are characterized by the massive volume of transported debris the long travel distance and destructive power the yangling catchment is a channelized debris flow indicated by the initiation of landslide dam failure the amplified debris flow destroyed the old artificial dams and drainage channels in the yangling gully fig 6 a and c although no yangling village victims were registered more than 100 buildings were damaged to varying degrees due to the debris flow simultaneously the national highway linking the yangling village to wenchuan county was closed fig 7 after the landslide dam failure in the yangling gully we analyzed the morphological characteristics from post event topography 1 5000 scale and made a systematic field survey history records two debris flows that occurred in the study area the first record on debris flow in the yangling gully dates back to the 20th century in a particular event registered in 1958 the road was destroyed and 15 lives were lost more recently in 1973 a debris flow in the yangling gully produced high economic losses after the july 10 2013 debris flow event a new artificial dam and drainage channels were built in the yangling gully in 2014 fig 6b and d therefore based on fully considering the landslide dam s obstructive coefficient it is necessary to study the effect of outburst debris flow on disaster mitigation projects 3 2 obstructive coefficient and characterization parameters of debris flow the obstructive coefficient of a debris flow can reflect the level of gully congestion by the solid material before the july 10 2013 debris flow event the blockage level of the yangling gully was determined only by some empirical coefficients table 1 which from the specification of geological investigation for debris flow stabilization in china geology and mineral industry standard 2006 yangling gully is relatively straight and has a small amount of steep slope the intersection angle of the main tributary is less than 40 the material composition of the gully is not too viscous under natural conditions besides the gully is partially blocked according to the standard table 1 the obstructive coefficient has been set as 1 5 in the mitigation engineering construction after the outburst of debris flow in the yangling gully the movement scale is beyond the old engineering prevention scale resulting in damage to mitigation projects landslides also occur when dams break due to internal erosion and piping based on field investigation it is found that an overtopping dam break causes the debris flow in yangling gully so this model is adopted in the laboratory tests after the field sampling in yangling gully some experiments of landslide dam failure were performed this experiment tries to maintain the field s state and keep the boundary s consistency fig 8 shows the flume consisting of a water tank a channel with an adjustable slope and a deposition section comprised of a steel plate the indoor flume model carried out the experiments with an overall length of 4 m a channel depth of 1 5 m and a width of 0 6 m meanwhile the artificial landslide dam is modeled as 0 4 m high 0 21 m top length and 0 8 m bottom length the typical gradation curve of the landslide dam in the yangling gully is selected to prepare the dam material as shown in fig 9 to keep the dam model s basic shape we add the appropriate amount of water into the materials to maintain its moisture content at approximately 8 the diagram of the landslide dam failure process is shown in fig 10 first of all the dam s upstream water level gradually rises and then the water begins to overtop and overflow erosion occurs in the second stage when the water overflows the dam the dam s upstream direction occurs to headward erosion and the downstream carries on downward erosion once the traceable erosion reaches the crest of the dam there will be a breach the third stage dam break phenomenon appears gradually the dam break expands rapidly in both directions simultaneously the lateral widening and the vertical cutting after the flow discharge reaches the peak the section flow at the dam break decreases rapidly and the extension of the breach slows down until it tends to be stable the change of dam overflow deep cutting erosion and dam collapsing was described in the three stages of the initial phase metaphase

the sichuan center of basic geographic information a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 2 5 m was established after the debris flow occurred in the yangling gully some samples were taken in the field to determine the bulk density and porosity the simulation parameters of the quadratic rheological model for the debris flow in the yangling gully were shown table 3 according to the old mitigation project parameters records before debris flow in the yangling gully the old check dam and drainage channel were set up in the model based on the discharge calculation manual for debris flow in the sichuan province china shen et al 1984 the july 10 2013 rainfall event has a recurrence period of 50 years we used the actual debris flow on july 10 2013 to simulate and verify the numerical simulation result for a 50 year recurrence interval since the flow amplification effect was not considered in the design and construction of the old mitigation projects 50 years of debris flow discharge from fig 12a was simulated the simulation results in fig 13 a show that the old mitigation projects could effectively prevent the hazards caused by debris flow under normal flow discharge however the simulation results in fig 12b revealed that the flow amplification effect plays a role after the landslide dam failure in the gully the old mitigation projects cannot withstand the damage brought by the debris flow combined with the importance of the flow amplification effect caused by the obstructive coefficient we adopt the area and volume of predicted and observed accumulation zone

formula is shown in table 4 based on the overlay area map between the observed accumulation zone and the predicted accumulation zone fig 14 the accuracy evaluation index œâ under the different obstructive coefficient conditions was calculated table 5 the calculation and analysis showed that the simulation s correct judgment accumulation zone has a higher value after considering the flow amplification effect without considering the flow amplification effect the incorrect judgment accumulation zone of the simulation will account for a large proportion which directly affects the final accuracy evaluation value the results of verification show that the accuracy values of the simulation were 0 7 and 1 72 respectively on the one hand the model can reflect the movement process of outburst debris flow on the other hand it indicates that the simulation results are more consistent with the actual situation of the july 10 2013 outburst debris flow event when considering the obstructive coefficient 4 2 analysis of the new mitigation projects effect under different recurrence interval after the july 10 2013 debris flow event occurred in yangling gully the original prevention and control projects were destroyed and the new mitigation projects were rebuilt in 2014 fig 6b and d this paper carried out numerical simulation analysis to fully consider the obstructive coefficient to explore new prevention and control engineering effects on debris flow protection under different recurrence periods the new mitigation projects have different effects under different recurrence periods fig 15 based on the simulation parameters statistics table 6 this paper analyzes the influence of the debris flow in the yangling gully with different recurrence periods on the new mitigation projects under the 50 year recurrence interval the new mitigation projects can still play an active role even if the landslide dam break in the yangling gully fig 15a under the 100 year recurrence interval one part of the outburst debris flow is blocked by the check dam while the other accumulates along the drainage channel only a few loose materials have piled up in residential areas to facilitate post disaster clearance fig 15b under the 200 year recurrence interval a large amount of sand and stone trapped in outburst debris flow caused severe damage to the check dam and drainage channel lots of solid materials rushed out of the drainage channel and flooded many houses the debris flow accumulation range of the yangling gully spreads to the min river which has the risk of blocking the river fig 14c 5 discussion and conclusion taking yangling gully as the typical outburst of debris flow this paper investigates the real cause of the old prevention engineering failure constructs the formula of obstructive coefficient and analyzes the effect of the new mitigation projects under different recurrence periods by analyzing the july 10 2013 debris flow event in the yangling gully this paper constructs the obstructive coefficient formula and calculates debris flow discharge with flow amplification effect the obstructive coefficient was calculated using the landslide dam failure experiments using the mass and momentum conservation equation the flo 2d model was selected to simulate the outburst debris flow movement reflecting the flow amplification process caused by the obstructive coefficient after simulation of the july 10 2013 debris flow event in the yangling gully the verification results show that the œâ value is 1 72 indicating the new obstructive coefficient formula can better reflect the outburst s movement process debris flow the results calculated by the formula are in agreement with those calculated by numerical simulation the formula is applicable in a certain area although the accuracy is already very high the constitutive equation needs to be further considered because the model does not consider erosion characteristics we will carry out field outburst debris flow in situ experiments to further verify the blocking coefficient s reliability if the flow amplification effect under the obstructive coefficient s influence is fully considered it can better design debris flow prevention based on the obstructive coefficient computational formula and new mitigation projects this research also estimated the outburst debris flow discharge for various recurrence intervals 50 100 and 200 years respectively to perform scenario simulations of the yangling gully the results prove that the new mitigation projects can effectively prevent the outburst of debris flow under the 50 year recurrence interval under the 100 year recurrence interval the check dam and drainage channel can effectively prevent most stony debris flow only a tiny amount of sediment has accumulated into residential areas for the 200 years of recurrence many loose solid particles and debris flow into the min river resulting in a river s complete blockage after the wenchuan earthquake many outburst of debris flows prevention projects have been built to better evaluate the disaster reduction effect of the prevention and control project we will focus on the destruction process and subsequent dynamic movement process of the dam in the future combined with physical experiments the outburst parameters are determined to achieve quantitative risk assessment of the mitigation effect of existing prevention and control projects the research results can provide a new computing formula of the obstructive coefficient for the landslide dam and facilitate the scientific guidance of disaster prevention and reduction planning credit authorship contribution statement ming chang conceptualization methodology chaopeng luo data

3383,strong earthquakes can induce large amounts of loose solid materials forming landslide dams and blocking narrow flow channels under extreme rainfall conditions instability can lead to an outburst of debris flow once the landslide dam has formed it on july 10 2013 a volume of 4 5 104 m3 of debris flow occurred in the yangling gully wenchuan county china this event can be categorized as an outburst of the debris flow that might seriously threaten valley residents existing sediment transport countermeasure works and road infrastructures this paper describes a typical outburst of debris flow calculates its obstructive coefficient simulates the process under various recurrence intervals and analyzes the efficacy of a new mitigation project related research results have laid the foundation for further study of the risk assessment and early warning of debris flow due to landslide dam failure in this paper an accurate computational model for the obstructive coefficient closely related to the flow amplification effect is established based on a dam break s physical experiments combined with the numerical calculation method the movement process of the yangling gully was simulated under the old artificial dam and the flow channel engineering conditions by comparing the measured and the simulated accumulation area the verification results illustrate that the accumulation area considering the obstructive coefficient model is closer to the measured value based on the obstructive coefficient computational model the results illustrate the outburst of debris flow discharge for various recurrence intervals 50 100 and 200 years respectively to perform scenario simulations of yangling gully under the new mitigation project conditions keywords outburst debris flow numerical simulation flow amplification effect obstructive coefficient 1 introduction debris flow triggered by the landslide dam break is a peculiar occurrence in the mountain and ravine regions of the active earthquake areas fig 1 landslide dams are widely distributed worldwide especially in high seismic mountain regions ermini and casagli 2003 korup 2004 unlike artificial dams with reinforced concrete materials a landslide dam is formed by a mixture of loose rock and soil materials in an unstable state once the landslide dam breaks in a gully or a river the debris or flood s peak flow can significantly threaten large areas downstream huang and fan 2013 lee 2014 chang et al 2017 huang and zhang 2020 if the landslide dam blocked the river and formed the barrier lake it is urgent to calculate its instantaneous flow discharge and estimate the flood range as far as possible davies et al 2007 chen et al 2018 fan et al 2019 a survey of 390 landslide dams worldwide found that half blocked rivers and the others had broken among them 25 led to the outburst of debris flows schuster 1993 earthquakes rainstorms and snowmelts trigger more than 80 of landslide dams and a few landslide dams are caused by volcanoes and human activity peng and zhang 2012 failure landslide dams may last from a few minutes to several thousand years depending on the dam material properties location geometry and the upstream flow into the barrier lake the age of 204 landslide dam cases at the time of failure in the databases covers an extensive range from 6 min to 20 000 years it was found that 87 of the landslide dam was unstable less than one year and 34 were unstable within one day peng and zhang 2012 zhao et al 2019 if a landslide dam is formed in the debris flow channel it will be unstable in a relatively short time after heavy rainfall iverson et al 2011 the coseismic landslides significantly increased the volume of unconsolidated material which was prone to be transformed into landslide dams in the debris flow channel three earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 7 0 have all occurred in southwest china since 2000 yu et al 2021 after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake in southwest china more than 56 000 landslides were triggered in the steep mountainous terrain dai et al 2010 xu et al 2014 on april 20 2013 the lushan earthquake produced more than 1031 coseismic landslides in southwest china chang et al 2016 on august 8 2017 a total of 821 coseismic landslides were identified through the jiuzhaigou earthquake in southwest china chang et al 2021 three seismic events in southwest china have resulted in many coseismic landslides in debris flow channels therefore many landslide dams are located in active earthquake areas in southwest china after the wenchuan earthquake the risk assessment of some vital landslide dammed lakes was carried out cui et al 2009 based on the dam s component materials and the barrier lake s maximum capacity a hazard zonation map of 32 dams was provided xu et al 2009 tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the wenchuan earthquake formed a vast barrier lake based on the breach mechanism and model tests the surface erosion accompanied by intermittent mass failure was found in the tangjiashan landslide dam breach case liu et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 to make detailed statistics on the distribution characteristics of landslide dams in the wenchuan earthquake area the complete geomorphic parameters database of 828 landslide dams was built fan et al 2012 catastrophic debris flows in zhouqu china on august 8 2010 were caused by the upstream cascading failure of landslide dams the effect on the scale amplification of debris flow was explained by studying the peak flow discharges at different locations and cascading landslide dam failure modes cui et al 2013 a method of estimating the sediment volume is used to assess the effects of constructed check dams for debris flow in the tajrish watershed iran banihabib and forghani 2017 a three dimensional coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach was used to research the corresponding response of the dynamic impact force and debris flow behavior on a check dam jeong and lee 2019 to sum up many scholars have analyzed the vast disaster brought by the dam breach however few studies on the flow amplification effect after the outburst show no obstructive coefficient characteristics the dam breach is a coupling process of solid liquid phase flow and landslide deposits in debris flow movement the obstructive coefficient parameter directly determines the flow amplification effect and dynamical process of debris flow after the landslide dam instability in recent decades many types of research have focused on the natural dam s predicted breach parameters on the one hand an array of parametric models have been established by analyzing historical data xu and zhang 2009 sattar 2014 froehlich 2016 on the other hand some mature numerical calculation based breach models for embankment and landslides dams are developed such as nws and hr breach fread 1988 morris et al 2009 windam hanson et al 2005 and 3d sph rezaldy et al 2019 however some simulation software fails to consider the relationship between the outburst formation mechanism and its subsequent movement chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the accurate calculation of the obstructive coefficient becomes the critical link the higher the obstructive coefficient is the higher the debris flow discharge formed after the landslide dam failure the flo 2d numerical model was used to simulate the movement process of the outburst debris flow based on the obstructive coefficient the influence of outburst debris flow under different recurrence intervals on the new control project is further discussed this research s main objective is to establish an accurate obstructive coefficient computational model to simulate the movement process of outburst debris flow triggered by the landslide dam failure simultaneously considering various prevention engineering conditions the movement process of debris flow in the yangling gully under various recurrence intervals 50 100 and 200 years respectively was simulated to analyze the effect of mitigation projects 2 study site the study area is the upper part of the min river located in wenchuan county the southwest sichuan

the sichuan center of basic geographic information a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 2 5 m was established after the debris flow occurred in the yangling gully some samples were taken in the field to determine the bulk density and porosity the simulation parameters of the quadratic rheological model for the debris flow in the yangling gully were shown table 3 according to the old mitigation project parameters records before debris flow in the yangling gully the old check dam and drainage channel were set up in the model based on the discharge calculation manual for debris flow in the sichuan province china shen et al 1984 the july 10 2013 rainfall event has a recurrence period of 50 years we used the actual debris flow on july 10 2013 to simulate and verify the numerical simulation result for a 50 year recurrence interval since the flow amplification effect was not considered in the design and construction of the old mitigation projects 50 years of debris flow discharge from fig 12a was simulated the simulation results in fig 13 a show that the old mitigation projects could effectively prevent the hazards caused by debris flow under normal flow discharge however the simulation results in fig 12b revealed that the flow amplification effect plays a role after the landslide dam failure in the gully the old mitigation projects cannot withstand the damage brought by the debris flow combined with the importance of the flow amplification effect caused by the obstructive coefficient we adopt the area and volume of predicted and observed accumulation zone

formula is shown in table 4 based on the overlay area map between the observed accumulation zone and the predicted accumulation zone fig 14 the accuracy evaluation index œâ under the different obstructive coefficient conditions was calculated table 5 the calculation and analysis showed that the simulation s correct judgment accumulation zone has a higher value after considering the flow amplification effect without considering the flow amplification effect the incorrect judgment accumulation zone of the simulation will account for a large proportion which directly affects the final accuracy evaluation value the results of verification show that the accuracy values of the simulation were 0 7 and 1 72 respectively on the one hand the model can reflect the movement process of outburst debris flow on the other hand it indicates that the simulation results are more consistent with the actual situation of the july 10 2013 outburst debris flow event when considering the obstructive coefficient 4 2 analysis of the new mitigation projects effect under different recurrence interval after the july 10 2013 debris flow event occurred in yangling gully the original prevention and control projects were destroyed and the new mitigation projects were rebuilt in 2014 fig 6b and d this paper carried out numerical simulation analysis to fully consider the obstructive coefficient to explore new prevention and control engineering effects on debris flow protection under different recurrence periods the new mitigation projects have different effects under different recurrence periods fig 15 based on the simulation parameters statistics table 6 this paper analyzes the influence of the debris flow in the yangling gully with different recurrence periods on the new mitigation projects under the 50 year recurrence interval the new mitigation projects can still play an active role even if the landslide dam break in the yangling gully fig 15a under the 100 year recurrence interval one part of the outburst debris flow is blocked by the check dam while the other accumulates along the drainage channel only a few loose materials have piled up in residential areas to facilitate post disaster clearance fig 15b under the 200 year recurrence interval a large amount of sand and stone trapped in outburst debris flow caused severe damage to the check dam and drainage channel lots of solid materials rushed out of the drainage channel and flooded many houses the debris flow accumulation range of the yangling gully spreads to the min river which has the risk of blocking the river fig 14c 5 discussion and conclusion taking yangling gully as the typical outburst of debris flow this paper investigates the real cause of the old prevention engineering failure constructs the formula of obstructive coefficient and analyzes the effect of the new mitigation projects under different recurrence periods by analyzing the july 10 2013 debris flow event in the yangling gully this paper constructs the obstructive coefficient formula and calculates debris flow discharge with flow amplification effect the obstructive coefficient was calculated using the landslide dam failure experiments using the mass and momentum conservation equation the flo 2d model was selected to simulate the outburst debris flow movement reflecting the flow amplification process caused by the obstructive coefficient after simulation of the july 10 2013 debris flow event in the yangling gully the verification results show that the œâ value is 1 72 indicating the new obstructive coefficient formula can better reflect the outburst s movement process debris flow the results calculated by the formula are in agreement with those calculated by numerical simulation the formula is applicable in a certain area although the accuracy is already very high the constitutive equation needs to be further considered because the model does not consider erosion characteristics we will carry out field outburst debris flow in situ experiments to further verify the blocking coefficient s reliability if the flow amplification effect under the obstructive coefficient s influence is fully considered it can better design debris flow prevention based on the obstructive coefficient computational formula and new mitigation projects this research also estimated the outburst debris flow discharge for various recurrence intervals 50 100 and 200 years respectively to perform scenario simulations of the yangling gully the results prove that the new mitigation projects can effectively prevent the outburst of debris flow under the 50 year recurrence interval under the 100 year recurrence interval the check dam and drainage channel can effectively prevent most stony debris flow only a tiny amount of sediment has accumulated into residential areas for the 200 years of recurrence many loose solid particles and debris flow into the min river resulting in a river s complete blockage after the wenchuan earthquake many outburst of debris flows prevention projects have been built to better evaluate the disaster reduction effect of the prevention and control project we will focus on the destruction process and subsequent dynamic movement process of the dam in the future combined with physical experiments the outburst parameters are determined to achieve quantitative risk assessment of the mitigation effect of existing prevention and control projects the research results can provide a new computing formula of the obstructive coefficient for the landslide dam and facilitate the scientific guidance of disaster prevention and reduction planning credit authorship contribution statement ming chang conceptualization methodology chaopeng luo data

3384,silica enriched mineral groundwater has important commercial and health value and is most common in volcanic areas and high temperature geothermal areas but we found abundant silica enriched mineral groundwater dissolved sio2 up to 51 57 mg l exposed from the granite fracture network in suining south china where is no volcanoes and high temperature hydrothermal system pumping test and hydrogeochemistry were employed to investigate the formation mechanism of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network it is hco3 ca type and high content of dissolved silica formed warm groundwater on the f86 1 fault and recharged by meteoric water with a close distance of 3 90 km pumping test results indicate that the hydraulic conductivity decreases from top to bottom in the granite fracture network in order of 2 27 10 1 m d 5 42 10 2 m d 7 04 10 4 m d and they are much smaller than that of the f86 1 fault zone 0 751 m d the flow framework constructed by water chemistry suggest the groundwater has experienced the maximum temperature of 68 75 c and reached the maximum depth of 1 93 km and the average seepage velocity is about 2 8 10 3 m d and 1 5 10 3 m d in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively water rock interaction confirms that the granite fracture network provides long term and sufficient water rock interaction and dominantly contributes the formation of silica enriched mineral groundwater because of the weatherability of granite but the temperature of sio2 geothermometer will be slightly underestimated for the deep warm groundwater continuously mixing with the shallow groundwater in the granite fracture network keywords pumping test hydrogeochemistry sio2 geothermometer silica enriched groundwater granite fracture network 1 introduction groundwater with high dissolved silica content is mostly formed in active volcano areas or high temperature geothermal systems sorey et al 1991 mutlu and gulec 1998 ahmad et al 2002 shakeri et al 2008 silica concentrations in 200 350 c aquifer waters of geothermal systems are about 300 700 mg kg sio2 gunnarsson and arn√≥rsson 2005 for example the content of dissolved sio2 is as high as 500 mg l in the geothermal water of yellowstone park king et al 2016 the content of dissolved sio2 in the high temperature geothermal water in tibet is 100 300 mg l and the highest is up to 581 5 mg l found in the borehole zk4001 wang et al 2018 these silica enriched thermal groundwaters usually contains higher concentrations of total dissolved solids and heavy metal elements cabassi et al 2019 and it is difficult to drink directly as high quality mineral water cruz and fran√ßa 2006 han et al 2010 but silica enriched groundwater can soften the cardiovascular system and is increasingly concerned and favored as a healthy drinking water petraccia et al 2006 high dissolved sio2 groundwater with low tds and heavy metal elements in low temperature hydrothermal systems has become an ideal source of silica enriched mineral water the dissolution of silicate minerals is related to temperature and the ph value of geothermal system sanjuan et al 2016 and co2 dissolved in groundwater can also increase the content of cation and promote the dissolution of silicate hunt et al 2017 morales arredondo et al 2020 the content of dissolved silica in groundwater is generally less than 15 mg l at temperatures lower than 25 c mao et al 2018a the granite fracture network delays the flow of groundwater and increases the weathering of granite which can promote the dissolution of granite minerals jgamadze et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the granite fracture network appears to have the effect of increasing silica content of geothermal water asta et al 2012 the granite fracture network is a fractured aqueous medium which can provide a place for adequate water rock interaction and can expand the groundwater flow path guih√©neuf et al 2014 the granite fracture network is also a weatherable rock surface which can provide sufficient erodible minerals resulting in the formation of water chemical components cartwright 2010 pumping tests combined with numerical simulation are commonly applied to identify the hydrodynamics characteristics of granite fracture network robineau et al 2018 water chemistry and stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of groundwater and the formation of water chemistry in the granite fracture network georg et al 2009 especially the water chemistry geothermometers can be used to evaluate the circulation temperature and depth of the low temperature hydrothermal system yang et al 2017 abundant silica enriched mineral groundwater exists in the granite fracture network in suining county of hunan province south china the content of dissolved sio2 in warm groundwater is as high as 51 57 mg l in the low temperature geothermal system controlled by the local deep fault f86 1 we have carried out several hydrogeologic investigations and pumping experiments to understand the formation mechanism of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network before the commercial mining in this paper hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical results are used to define the flow framework of silica enriched groundwater and pumping test results are used to reveal the flow process of silica enriched groundwater which can provide some information of silica mineral dissolution based on the temperature comparison of silica geothermometer and cation geothermometers we hope to understand the influence of the flow characteristics of silica enriched groundwater in granite fracture network of the medium low temperature hydrothermal system on the estimation of sio2 geothermometer 2 hydrogeological and geothermal settings suining county is located in southwestern hunan province southern china fig 1 the terrain is low hills and relatively flat it is a typical subtropical monsoon climate which has a high temperature and abundant rain in summer but cold and dry in winter the average annual temperature of suining is 16 7 c the highest temperature in july is 27 2 c the lowest temperature usually occurs in january which is 4 c the average annual rainfall is 1356 2 mm of which 857 mm is from april to august almost all the exposed strata in the study area are granite the magma intrusion occurred in the three geological historical periods of triassic jurassic and cretaceous indosinian and yanshanian magma movements and tectonic activities were formed resulting in the faults of f86 and f86 1 zhao et al 2017 medium coarse granodiorite is the dominated stratum in the study area and the coarse sands of quaternary alluvial deposits are distributed on both sides of the stream fig 1 different development of granite weathering can be observed from half a meter to several meters thick on the ground three groups of joints are developed in the granite resulting from the effect of regional tectonic stress which form a network of fractures in the granite we measure their information on the spot as follows 1 strike 330 inclination of sw inclination angle of 70 2 3 fractures per meter 2 strike 280 inclination of sw inclination angle of 80 2 fractures per meter 3 strike 80 inclination of se inclination angle of 55 2 fractures per meter these three groups of joints combine each other to form fracture network in granite area in suining a large regional fault was formed in the indosinian period and was named f86 and it continued to be active until the yanshanian period it is a high compression deep fracture with strike n inclination of west and inclination angle of 55 at the southern end of f86 a secondary fault is developed and marked as f86 1 in the studied area of this paper the f86 1 fault is similar to the f86 fault compressed from the indosinian to the yanshanian but stretched in the late yanshanian zhao et al 2017 three aquifers can be hydrogeologically distinguished as shallow pore water shallow weathering fracture water and deep tectonic fracture water according to the difference of the aqueous medium in the study area the widely development fracture network that can provide channels for groundwater store and flow become the main aquifer in local hydrogeological settings different hydrogeological characteristics appear in the f86 1 fault zone due to compression and extension during geological historical activities fig 1 the western part of f86 1 fault zone is groundwater bearing and conducting in densely developed fault fissures and connect with the granite fracture network but the eastern part of the f86 1 fault zone has low permeability for underdeveloped fissures and has minor hydraulic connection with the granite fracture network on the west side of the f86 1 fault zone atmospheric precipitation infiltrates into the weathered granite fracture network and finally gathers in the western part of the fault zone the remaining heat in the granite body may be the heat source of the geothermal system li et al 2019a b at the same time the radioactive decay of u and th in the granite also provides additional heat the activity of the fault can not only convert kinetic energy into heat but also provide a short cut for deep heat flow tang et al 2017 the temperature of the thermal spring exposed on the f86 fault is 39 c and the temperature of the warm spring exposed on the f86 1 fault is about 20 c the f86 1 fault is a convergent channel for groundwater and a fast channel for geothermal flow 3 hydrogeological materials and analysis

w4 were drilled in the granite fracture network on the west side of the f86 1 fault one deep water well w1 was drilled in the granite fracture network on the east side of the f86 1 fault and two seasonal springs s1 s2 are exposed in the lowland on both sides of the f86 1 fault groundwater samples were taken from these 7 wells and 2 springs fig 1 the physical chemistry parameters e g temperature ph electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by the multi parameter water quality analyzer thermo orion star 520 m 01 model the alkalinity was determined by titration technique in situ and the precision was generally around 0 5 mg l the warm well and well water samples were collected by pump after half an hour pumping and the spring samples were gathered from the floating spring water all water samples for anion and cation analysis were first filtered with a 0 45 Œºm membrane and then filled in a polyethylene container rinsed with filtered water 3 times in addition cationic water samples bottles were full of filtered water with no bubble and the anionic water samples added ultrapure nitric acid for ph 2 dionex ion chromatograph model ics1100 and inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes model icap6300 were used to determine the concentrations of main anions and main cations respectively and the repeated detection errors were below 2 with 0 001 mg l of detected accuracy mao et al 2015 adding the saturated bacl2 solution into the groundwater samples we got baco3 sediments for the precipitation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic these baco3 sediments were freeze dried into powder under vacuum and the temperature of 50 c for 14c analysis the 14c samples were converted to benzene and were determined radiometrically by a liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 the analytical error is less than 0 5 percentage of modern carbon pmc all the analytical work was conducted in the laboratory of environmental school china university of geosciences wuhan the results of water chemistry and radiocarbon ages are listed in table 1 3 2 pumping test a multi well pumping test was performed with the well ww2 as pumping well and the other wells as observation wells but w1 is located on the east side of f86 1 and has weak hydraulic connection with ww2 then no observation was carried out in the well w1 deep well submersible pump was used to extract groundwater from ww2 and the automatic groundwater level gauge was used to automatically record groundwater level and temperature in all the wells the water level measurement accuracy is 1 mm and suitable for long term continuous groundwater monitoring during the pumping test the on site preparation of the diagram includes water level and time curve s t curve discharge

schlumberger aquifertest helps to process all the observed data 3 3 groundwater flow simulation the study area is a relatively closed hydrogeological unit it can be hydrogeologically divided into two layers in the vertical direction and two zones in the horizontal direction the two layers are simplified as 1 surface granite weathering layer 2 underlying granite fracture network layer the two zones are simplified as 1 granite fracture network zone 2 f86 1 fault zone the simulation area of groundwater flow is about 4 566 km2 the boundary can be generalized as the west boundary is the groundwater divide in the recharge area of zishui yuanshui mountain the east boundary is the impermeable zone on the east side of the f86 1 fault the south and north boundaries are groundwater ridges on both

hydrogeological characteristics of f86 1 based on hydrogeological conditions f86 1 is an anisotropic fracture that collects and conducts water in the west part and is connected to the granite fracture network the groundwater taken from the sampling points can be hydrogeologically distinguished as follows 1 deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 taken from the west part of f86 1 2 deep groundwater w1 w2 w3 w4 taken from the granite fracture network w2 w3 w4 are on the west side of f86 1 but w1 on the east side of f86 1 3 shallow groundwater s1 s2 exposed from the surface weathered granite under the same stratum lithology conditions groundwater chemistry is influenced by position in fracture network and so is related to residence time and flow history raynaud and vasseur 2014 there may also be differences in water chemical composition for groundwater in faults and granite fracture networks leray et al 2012 hamed and dhahri 2013 the water chemical compositions of groundwater samples are dominated by hco3 ca2 na and they are rich in soluble silica however w1 has the highest na content but the lowest sio2 content fig 2 ca2 and sio2 contents are higher in the deep warm groundwater na and ca2 contents are lower in the shallow groundwater fig 2 according to the piper diagram the chemical type of groundwater can be identified piper 1944 rezaei et al 2019 the deep warm groundwater is hco3 ca type and other groundwater deep groundwater and shallow groundwater is hco3 na ca type except that w1 is hco3 na type fig 3 it indicates that the chemical types of groundwater on the east and west sides of f86 1 are different and that there are also differences in the chemical type of groundwater on the west side of f86 1 and that of the granite fracture network the groundwater is recharged by meteoric water which dissolves atmospheric co2 and has the ability to dissolve calcite the dissolution of granite silicate minerals is accompanied by the dissolution of carbonate minerals √∂zen et al 2012 resulting in the increase of sio2 and ca2 in groundwater pumping test can provide information for the parameters of groundwater flow system bense et al 2013 due to the anisotropy of the fault zone pumping tests can verify its hydrogeological information bense and van balen 2003 loveless et al 2011 a pumping test was conducted on the west side of f86 1 to determine the permeability and transmissivity of the fractured aquifer ww2 serves as the main pumping well and the others as observation wells the amount of pumped water the water level in the observation well and the atmospheric precipitation with time are recorded in fig 4 due to the influence of weather at the test site there was a short power outage during the pumping test which caused the pump to stop working and no water was discharged the discharge becoming 0 in fig 4 the multi well pumping test with ww2 as the pumping well began on 2019 1 18 16 00 00 the water level and drawdown data of the pumping test were recorded in table 2 according to the pumping test records ww2 dropped rapidly from the beginning of pumping ww1 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 00 10 the water level of ww3 was observed to drop significantly at 2019 1 18 16 00 01 the water level drawdown of w2 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 30 the water level drawdown of w3 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 20 we selected two periods to observe groundwater regime of each wells the one was average pumping volume was 850 m3 d 2019 01 18 16 10 00 to 2019 01 20 8 40 00 and the other one was average pumping flow of 500 m3 d 2019 01 20 8 40 00 2019 01 23 8 30 00 during the pumping test the response time of the water level of each well to pumping is inconsistent the response of water level changes in wells ww1 ww2 and ww3 is almost consistent the water level in ww1 and ww3 responds almost instantaneously to the pumping in ww2 but significant water level changes in wells w2 w3 w4 appear to be delayed when the water level in ww2 changes additionally the difference of water level decrease between ww1 and ww2 is about 6 m and that between ww3 and ww2 is about 1 m during the whole pumping test period all these suggest that ww2 has closely hydraulic connection with ww1 and ww3 and significantly hydraulic connection with w2 w3 w4 f86 1 provides the closely hydraulic connection for ww1 ww2 and ww3 and granite fracture network provides significantly hydraulic connection for f86 1 with w2 w3 w4 the measured water level and discharge data of ww2 was inputted in the software aquifer test selecting the theis method the double logarithmic coordinate system and the w u 1 u standard curve were automatically generated refer to analyzing pumping tests in a sub vertical and anisotropic fault zone draining shallow aquifers dewandel et al 2014 fault f86 1 is treated as approximately isotropic and then kept the corresponding coordinate axes parallel to each other translated the measured curve until the two curves coincide fischer et al 2018 the hydraulic conductivity in each well was calculated which was regarded as the appropriate result table 3 three warm wells have uniformly higher transmissivity ww1 19 5 m2 d ww2 24 3 m2 d ww3 14 9 m2 d and hydraulic conductivity ww1 0 89 m d ww2 0 94 m d ww3 0 75 m d while the results are much lower in the three wells for transmissivity w2 1 90 10 2 m2 d w3 7 15 m2 d w4 1 46 m2 d and hydraulic conductivity w2 7 04 10 4 m d w3 2 27 10 1 m d w4 5 42 10 2 m d these results indicate the water content and water permeability of f86 1 are much better than those of the granite fracture network 4 2 groundwater flow in granite fracture network the hydrogeological characteristics of the granite fracture network are different from that of the fracture f86 1 and it is also different with depths rong et al 2020 the hydrogeological parameter values are differently assigned in the simulated model arlai et al 2012 li et al 2017 the value of the transmissivity above 100 m in the f86 1 fault zone is 0 75 m d according to pumping test result of ww3 and that from 100 m to deep depth is assigned as 0 91 m d based on the average transmissivity of ww1 and ww2 the transmissivity of weathered granite layer 0 10 m is selected as 2 27 10 1 m d according to pumping test result of w3 the transmissivity of upper granite fracture network 10 200 m is selected as 5 42 10 2 m d according to pumping test result of w4 the transmissivity of lower granite fracture network is selected as 7 04 10 4 m d according to pumping test result of w2 initial flow nets of the study area can be acquired by numerical analog we set the steady flow model in feflow fitting the measured water level of four wells ww1 ww3 w2 and w3 to the simulated water level for model calibration the simulated results present the natural flow nets in the study area at the beginning of pumping test the measured water level of four wells ww1 ww3 w2 and w3 are also restricted to fit with the simulated water level during the pumping test fig 5 since w2 is affected by the recharge of f86 1 and the granite fracture network at the same time the simulated water level and the observed water level are quite different in the first 45 min then the two are gradually consistent it indicates that f86 1 has good water permeability and its rapid recharge to w2 results in the rapid decrease of the groundwater level the average flow rate of 850 m3 d 2019 01 20 00 00 and 500 m3 d 2019 01 23 00 00 was selected and the pumping time lasted for 70 days according to the simulated flowing lines fig 6 the groundwater flow is almost uniform with the pumping volume of 850 m3 d and 500 m3 d the shallow groundwater in the weathered layer of granite fracture network first layer continuously flows into the f86 1 fault zone the deep groundwater in the underlying layer of granite fracture network second layer flow down to a certain depth no more than 1 93 km and gather into f86 1 from top to bottom in the granite fracture network the flow of groundwater gradually becomes slow after groundwater gathers from the granite fracture network to f86 1 the flow becomes rapid the granite fracture network is connected with the faults and the faults provide the gathering space and migration channel for groundwater song et al 2016 regional deep faults can connect shallow and deep groundwater and can also provide convenient channels for geothermal flow marbun et al 2020 from the characteristics of groundwater flow in granite fracture network the shallow groundwater flows faster and the deep groundwater flows slowly this can lead to a sufficient chemical reaction between deep groundwater and granite minerals the water chemistry obtained from the warm wells ww1 ww2 ww3 is the result of mixing of deep groundwater and shallow groundwater the mixing of shallow groundwater will dilute the dissolved silica in the warm wells leading to underestimation of the sio2 geothermometer 4 3 influence of granite fracture network on water rock interaction the granite in the study area was mainly composed of quartz feldspar hornblende and biotite among which albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 account for 45 quartz about 40 and biotite about 10 compared with the sandstone the granite is more susceptible to weathering the weathering and hydrolysis of these minerals can produce soluble sio2 and which dissolved in groundwater to form h4sio4 the dissolution of albite and amphibole minerals is the main source of na in warm groundwater samples hydrolysis reaction of albite 5 2naalsi3o8 2co2 11h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 hydrolysis reaction of amphibole 6 2naca2fe5 si7alo22 oh 2 3co2 39h2o al2sio5 oh 4 2na 4ca2 10fe2 12h4sio4 30hco3 from the formulas 5 and 6 it can be seen that through the action of co2 and h2o the dissolution of albite and hornblende not only releases na but also produces hco3 and h2sio3 decomposed from h4sio4 the aluminum ion content in the groundwater samples was lower than the detection limit of the instrument 0 0001 mg l given that the solubility of aluminosilicate minerals is very low at ph values close to 7 0 7 25 and at low temperatures there are two main sources of ca2 in warm well water 1 the hydrolysis reaction of anorthite 2 the hydrolysis reaction of amphibole the hydrolysis equation of anorthite is as follows 7 caal2si2o8 2co2 6h2o al2o3 3h2o ca2 2hco3 2h2sio3 the formulas 6 and 7 show that the dissolution of anorthite and hornblende not only does ca2 enter the groundwater but also the sources of hco3 and h2sio3 in the groundwater the equilibrium process of dissolution and precipitation of silicate minerals in groundwater is dominated by the source of solid amorphous sio2 and the solubility of secondary minerals formed during weathering the main factors controlling the equilibrium process of metasilicate dissolution and precipitation in groundwater are the supply source of solid amorphous sio2 and the solubility of secondary minerals formed during weathering according to water chemical compositions in the equilibrium system of silicate dissolution and precipitation the relative saturation of amorphous sio2 solid phase minerals can be determined and the source of groundwater soluble sio2 can be identified kopylova et al 2018 according to the mineral balance system diagram of groundwater system in the study area in fig 7 the soluble sio2 in groundwater mainly comes from the dissolution of muscovite illite albite calcium montmorillonite and magnesium montmorillonite based on the water chemistry of groundwater the mineral saturation indexes si calculated by the phreeqc hydrogeochemical modeling software are shown in table 4 which can be used to describe the degree of supersaturation or undersaturation of different minerals in groundwater systems qin et al 2005 almost all the estimated minerals in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater have the similar si values which suggest that similar water rock interactions possibly occurred in the process of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater formation the si values equal to 0 indicates complete saturation greater than 0 meaning supersaturation and less than 0 corresponding to undersaturation therefore except for silica minerals chalcedony coesite quartz and tridymite the other estimated minerals saturation index less than 0 indicates inadequate equilibrium between water and rock interaction in groundwater system at the measured temperature weathered and broken granite hydrogeologically dominate the formation of water chemistry the dissolution of granite minerals anhydrite calcite dolomite gypsum monohydrocalcite okenite wollastonite etc may be the main water rock interactions occurring in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater however the dissolution of minerals has not reached equilibrium except for dissolved silica in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the na k mg diagram is proposed to identify the water rock equilibrium and mixing of waters in different origins giggenbach 1988 shakeri et al 2008 yang et al 2017 as shown in fig 8 all the warm groundwater samples are distributed in immature water area which indicates insufficient water rock interactions and mixing of warm groundwater with cold shallow groundwater have occurred as the warm water rises to the surface and all the shallow groundwater samples except w1 sample locating at mature water area suggests that the groundwater rarely achieve at water rock equilibrium however the w1 groundwater is the partially equilibrated water and it shows that the formation of chemical components in w1 groundwater is mainly determined by the interaction of water and rock but it has not reached a complete chemical equilibrium state this also indicates that the dissolution of minerals has not reached equilibrium in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the gibbs diagrams are widely employed to assess the sources of chemical compositions such as precipitation water rock interaction and evaporation gibbs 1970 al barakah et al 2017 all the data of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater is shown in fig 9 which suggests that water rock interaction and precipitation are possibly the sources of dissolved ions to control the groundwater chemistry the water rock interactions include the chemical weathering of rocks dissolution precipitation of secondary carbonates minerals and ion exchange al barakah et al 2017 the decrease in ca2 and mg2 but the increase in na in the w1 waters can be explained by cation exchange which confirms the water rock interaction is the main sources of chemical components in w1 groundwater according to chemical characteristics and mineral saturation index of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the precipitation of silica minerals chalcedony coesite quartz and tridymite can also control the chemical evolution for groundwater besides water rock interactions the precipitated silica in shallow groundwater may come from the groundwater in which the soluble silica was supersaturated in the weathered granite fractures during the migration of shallow groundwater to the deep granite fracture network the increase in water temperature re promote the increase in dissolved silica content therefore the supersaturation of dissolved silica in shallow groundwater may be the main contribution to silica enrichment in warm groundwater the dissolved silica is supersaturated in shallow groundwater in weathered granite it will precipitate during the migration of shallow groundwater to the fracture network of deep granite however as the ground temperature rises the ability of warm groundwater to dissolve silica continues to increase and water minerals are in a state of dissolution imbalance then the temperatures estimated with sio2 geothermometers or mme based on aluminosilicate equilibrium dissolution for evaluating warm groundwater may be underestimated 4 4 warm groundwater circulation in granite fracture network most of the chemical geothermometers existing in the literature are based on chemical equilibrium reactions between the water and the rocks in the reservoir conditions consequently the reservoir temperature estimated using these geothermometers will be reliable only if the corresponding equilibrium reactions exist in the reservoir and continue to control the dissolved species of the reservoir waters after their ascent to the surface the dissolved sio2 in groundwater can be used to estimate the reservoir temperature in hydrothermal system the dissolution of quartz and chalcedony is positively correlated with temperature known as sio2 geothermometer quartz geothermometers and chalcedony geothermometers fournier and truesdell 1970 fournier 1977 fournier et al 1979 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 p√ºrschel et al 2013 in addition the na k geothermometer the k mg geothermometer the na k ca geothermometer and other cationic thermometers are also used in geothermal systems under different conditions to evaluate the temperature of water rock interaction the na k geothermometer is considered to be applied in the best conditions for long cycling time and high temperature geothermal system in the situations of low ca2 low so4 2 or high co2 thermal groundwater fournier and truesdell 1973 fournier et al 1979 giggenbach 1988 can 2002 the k mg geothermometer shows quick reflection to reacted temperature and is suitable for low to high temperature geothermal system giggenbach et al 1983 giggenbach 1988 the na k ca geothermometer is used to evaluate the temperature of high temperature geothermal system with high calcium content fournier and truesdell 1973 d amore and panichi 1980 kharaka and mariner 1989 sio2 geothermometers and cation geothermometers provide the possibility of reacted temperature estimation for silica enriched mineral groundwater in weathered granite with fracture network in the study area the heat source is mainly derived from the residual heat of granite and the geothermal field belongs to the middle low temperature geothermal field the silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss is probably more suitable for the ww1 and ww3 samples the temperatures estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss are 65 c fournier 1977 and 66 67 c arn√≥rsson et al 1983 using the quartz silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss fournier 1977 the estimated temperature is 95 c for the ww2 sample the corresponding temperatures are 73 c and 75 c respectively using the chalcedony silica geothermometer and 103 c using the quartz silica geothermometer as we will see later the temperatures estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer are very close to the mme temperatures and were considered to be the most representative given that the use of chalcedony silica geothermometer is recommended for low geothermal systems in the literature fournier 1977 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 giggenbach et al 1983 the reservoir temperatures of the sampled warm well water have been estimated using several major different cation geothermometers and the calculated results are as follows 1 temperature calculated by na k mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 ranges from 220 9 c to 217 9 c 2 calculated temperature with na k ca mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 is between 76 2 c and 82 3 c 3 temperature calculated by na k geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 varies from 222 3 c to 292 9 c 4 k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 provides reservoir temperature from 42 9 c to 49 2 c 5 the calculated temperature by na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 ranges from 328 3 c to 373 8 c if the cation geothermometers give scattered and not reliable temperature estimations in this study it is mainly because the vast majority of water samples are in the immature fluid zone li et al 2019b as shown by the giggenbach s triangular na k mg diagram fig 8 multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme temperature for three warm well samples ww1 ww2 and ww3 are inferred using phreeqc geochemical software by entering the chemical and isotope data of the warm well samples the phreeqc can simulate the precipitation and dissolution equilibrium reaction of multiple minerals in the same temperature range so the equilibrium temperature can be ensured in fig 10 the minerals including calcite celadonite chalcedony quartz k feldspar and tridymite can reach precipitation dissolution equilibrium in the same time in a certain temperature the mme temperatures for the three warm well samples ww1 ww2 and ww3 are 68 c 75 c and 69 c respectively as already mentioned the mme temperatures are very close to those estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer for the three warm well samples and can be considered as the most representative of the reservoir conditions the temperatures estimated using the cation geothermometers are not reliable because these warm waters have only attained partial chemical equilibrium at low temperature close to 70 c with respect to very few minerals chalcedony k feldspar celadonite see fig 10 and are not in chemical equilibrium with respect to other minerals such as albite muscovite which are also involved in the cation thermometric relationships the water chemistry of thermal groundwater can provide information on the experienced temperature and depth in the circulation based on chemical geothermometer estimations mao et al 2015 ndikubwimana et al 2020 and the circulation depth of warm groundwater can be estimated yang et al 2017 mao et al 2021 the average annual temperature in the study area is 16 7 c the geothermal gradient is 3 c 100 m it is estimated that the maximum circulation depth of the warm groundwater is about 1 93 km the deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 have a stable temperature above 17 c slightly higher than the local multi year average temperature of 16 c the f86 1 deep fault may communicate deep geothermal flow and provide the possibility for groundwater heating on the west side of f86 1 there has a regional watershed zishui yuanshui watershed regarded as the groundwater recharge zone the lateral distance from the watershed to f86 1 is about 3 90 km combined with groundwater dating results hasegawa et al 2016 mao et al 2018b wang and zheng 2019 the circulation speed and renewal capacity of groundwater can be evaluated ndikubwimana et al 2020 mao et al 2021 the recharged distance is about 3 90 km and the circulation depth of groundwater is about 1 93 km the radiocarbon ages of deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 range from 3 64 to 3 98 ka listed in table 1 then the horizontal average seepage velocity of warm groundwater is about 2 8 10 3 m d and the vertical average seepage velocity is about 1 5 10 3 m d a circulation model of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network is proposed fig 11 the atmospheric precipitation infiltrated through the fissures by gravity force and the recharge distance is about 3 90 km most of shallow groundwater is gathered to the f86 1 fault zone through the surface granite weathering layer 0 10 m a part of the groundwater is continuously flow into the f86 1 fault zone by middle weathering granite fracture network layer 10 200 m a few of deep groundwater continuously infiltrated to the deep granite fracture network layer 200 1930 m the water rock interaction temperature is approximately 68 75 c and the maximum circulation depth is approximately 1 93 km the deep warm groundwater flows up through the deep fault zones by thermodynamic driven forces 5 conclusions pumping test and hydrogeochemistry were employed to investigate the circulation of silica enriched mineral groundwater exposed from granite fracture network in suining south china the influence of the flow characteristics of silica enriched groundwater in granite fracture network on the estimation of sio2 geothermometer is discussed in this paper the pumping test results suggest that the hydraulic conductivity of the granite fracture network is much smaller than that of the f86 1 fracture the granite fracture network is the main runoff channel for groundwater and the f86 1 fracture is the accumulation channel for groundwater the groundwater flow framework is evaluated with hydrogeochemistry the silica enriched mineral groundwater had experienced the maximum temperature of 68 75 c estimated with multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme and reached the maximum depth of 1 93 km the recharge distance is about 3 90 km and the radiocarbon ages of deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 range from 3 64 to 3 98 ka resulting in about 2 8 10 3 m d of the horizontal average seepage velocity and about 1 5 10 3 m d of the vertical average seepage velocity the pumping test confirmed that this average flow rate is reasonable moreover the simulation results reveal that the flow rate of groundwater from top to bottom gradually slowed down and eventually all groundwater gathered from the granite fracture network to the f86 1 fault based on these results a conceptual model of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network is proposed the long term and sufficient water rock interaction suggest that it is not f86 1 fault but the granite fracture network plays the most important role in the formation of silica enriched mineral groundwater because granite is easily weathered the reasonable temperature estimated using silica chalcedony geothermometer is 66 5 74 6 c which are very close to the multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme temperatures 68 75 c however possible mixing processes between deep geothermal water and shallow groundwater in the granite fracture network resulting in a decrease in the content of chemical components in the geothermal water can make the deep temperatures

3384,silica enriched mineral groundwater has important commercial and health value and is most common in volcanic areas and high temperature geothermal areas but we found abundant silica enriched mineral groundwater dissolved sio2 up to 51 57 mg l exposed from the granite fracture network in suining south china where is no volcanoes and high temperature hydrothermal system pumping test and hydrogeochemistry were employed to investigate the formation mechanism of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network it is hco3 ca type and high content of dissolved silica formed warm groundwater on the f86 1 fault and recharged by meteoric water with a close distance of 3 90 km pumping test results indicate that the hydraulic conductivity decreases from top to bottom in the granite fracture network in order of 2 27 10 1 m d 5 42 10 2 m d 7 04 10 4 m d and they are much smaller than that of the f86 1 fault zone 0 751 m d the flow framework constructed by water chemistry suggest the groundwater has experienced the maximum temperature of 68 75 c and reached the maximum depth of 1 93 km and the average seepage velocity is about 2 8 10 3 m d and 1 5 10 3 m d in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively water rock interaction confirms that the granite fracture network provides long term and sufficient water rock interaction and dominantly contributes the formation of silica enriched mineral groundwater because of the weatherability of granite but the temperature of sio2 geothermometer will be slightly underestimated for the deep warm groundwater continuously mixing with the shallow groundwater in the granite fracture network keywords pumping test hydrogeochemistry sio2 geothermometer silica enriched groundwater granite fracture network 1 introduction groundwater with high dissolved silica content is mostly formed in active volcano areas or high temperature geothermal systems sorey et al 1991 mutlu and gulec 1998 ahmad et al 2002 shakeri et al 2008 silica concentrations in 200 350 c aquifer waters of geothermal systems are about 300 700 mg kg sio2 gunnarsson and arn√≥rsson 2005 for example the content of dissolved sio2 is as high as 500 mg l in the geothermal water of yellowstone park king et al 2016 the content of dissolved sio2 in the high temperature geothermal water in tibet is 100 300 mg l and the highest is up to 581 5 mg l found in the borehole zk4001 wang et al 2018 these silica enriched thermal groundwaters usually contains higher concentrations of total dissolved solids and heavy metal elements cabassi et al 2019 and it is difficult to drink directly as high quality mineral water cruz and fran√ßa 2006 han et al 2010 but silica enriched groundwater can soften the cardiovascular system and is increasingly concerned and favored as a healthy drinking water petraccia et al 2006 high dissolved sio2 groundwater with low tds and heavy metal elements in low temperature hydrothermal systems has become an ideal source of silica enriched mineral water the dissolution of silicate minerals is related to temperature and the ph value of geothermal system sanjuan et al 2016 and co2 dissolved in groundwater can also increase the content of cation and promote the dissolution of silicate hunt et al 2017 morales arredondo et al 2020 the content of dissolved silica in groundwater is generally less than 15 mg l at temperatures lower than 25 c mao et al 2018a the granite fracture network delays the flow of groundwater and increases the weathering of granite which can promote the dissolution of granite minerals jgamadze et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the granite fracture network appears to have the effect of increasing silica content of geothermal water asta et al 2012 the granite fracture network is a fractured aqueous medium which can provide a place for adequate water rock interaction and can expand the groundwater flow path guih√©neuf et al 2014 the granite fracture network is also a weatherable rock surface which can provide sufficient erodible minerals resulting in the formation of water chemical components cartwright 2010 pumping tests combined with numerical simulation are commonly applied to identify the hydrodynamics characteristics of granite fracture network robineau et al 2018 water chemistry and stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of groundwater and the formation of water chemistry in the granite fracture network georg et al 2009 especially the water chemistry geothermometers can be used to evaluate the circulation temperature and depth of the low temperature hydrothermal system yang et al 2017 abundant silica enriched mineral groundwater exists in the granite fracture network in suining county of hunan province south china the content of dissolved sio2 in warm groundwater is as high as 51 57 mg l in the low temperature geothermal system controlled by the local deep fault f86 1 we have carried out several hydrogeologic investigations and pumping experiments to understand the formation mechanism of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network before the commercial mining in this paper hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical results are used to define the flow framework of silica enriched groundwater and pumping test results are used to reveal the flow process of silica enriched groundwater which can provide some information of silica mineral dissolution based on the temperature comparison of silica geothermometer and cation geothermometers we hope to understand the influence of the flow characteristics of silica enriched groundwater in granite fracture network of the medium low temperature hydrothermal system on the estimation of sio2 geothermometer 2 hydrogeological and geothermal settings suining county is located in southwestern hunan province southern china fig 1 the terrain is low hills and relatively flat it is a typical subtropical monsoon climate which has a high temperature and abundant rain in summer but cold and dry in winter the average annual temperature of suining is 16 7 c the highest temperature in july is 27 2 c the lowest temperature usually occurs in january which is 4 c the average annual rainfall is 1356 2 mm of which 857 mm is from april to august almost all the exposed strata in the study area are granite the magma intrusion occurred in the three geological historical periods of triassic jurassic and cretaceous indosinian and yanshanian magma movements and tectonic activities were formed resulting in the faults of f86 and f86 1 zhao et al 2017 medium coarse granodiorite is the dominated stratum in the study area and the coarse sands of quaternary alluvial deposits are distributed on both sides of the stream fig 1 different development of granite weathering can be observed from half a meter to several meters thick on the ground three groups of joints are developed in the granite resulting from the effect of regional tectonic stress which form a network of fractures in the granite we measure their information on the spot as follows 1 strike 330 inclination of sw inclination angle of 70 2 3 fractures per meter 2 strike 280 inclination of sw inclination angle of 80 2 fractures per meter 3 strike 80 inclination of se inclination angle of 55 2 fractures per meter these three groups of joints combine each other to form fracture network in granite area in suining a large regional fault was formed in the indosinian period and was named f86 and it continued to be active until the yanshanian period it is a high compression deep fracture with strike n inclination of west and inclination angle of 55 at the southern end of f86 a secondary fault is developed and marked as f86 1 in the studied area of this paper the f86 1 fault is similar to the f86 fault compressed from the indosinian to the yanshanian but stretched in the late yanshanian zhao et al 2017 three aquifers can be hydrogeologically distinguished as shallow pore water shallow weathering fracture water and deep tectonic fracture water according to the difference of the aqueous medium in the study area the widely development fracture network that can provide channels for groundwater store and flow become the main aquifer in local hydrogeological settings different hydrogeological characteristics appear in the f86 1 fault zone due to compression and extension during geological historical activities fig 1 the western part of f86 1 fault zone is groundwater bearing and conducting in densely developed fault fissures and connect with the granite fracture network but the eastern part of the f86 1 fault zone has low permeability for underdeveloped fissures and has minor hydraulic connection with the granite fracture network on the west side of the f86 1 fault zone atmospheric precipitation infiltrates into the weathered granite fracture network and finally gathers in the western part of the fault zone the remaining heat in the granite body may be the heat source of the geothermal system li et al 2019a b at the same time the radioactive decay of u and th in the granite also provides additional heat the activity of the fault can not only convert kinetic energy into heat but also provide a short cut for deep heat flow tang et al 2017 the temperature of the thermal spring exposed on the f86 fault is 39 c and the temperature of the warm spring exposed on the f86 1 fault is about 20 c the f86 1 fault is a convergent channel for groundwater and a fast channel for geothermal flow 3 hydrogeological materials and analysis methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and analysis in the study area three warm water wells ww1 ww2 ww3 were drilled in the western part of the f86 1 fault zone three normal temperature water wells w2 w3 w4 were drilled in the granite fracture network on the west side of the f86 1 fault one deep water well w1 was drilled in the granite fracture network on the east side of the f86 1 fault and two seasonal springs s1 s2 are exposed in the lowland on both sides of the f86 1 fault groundwater samples were taken from these 7 wells and 2 springs fig 1 the physical chemistry parameters e g temperature ph electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by the multi parameter water quality analyzer thermo orion star 520 m 01 model the alkalinity was determined by titration technique in situ and the precision was generally around 0 5 mg l the warm well and well water samples were collected by pump after half an hour pumping and the spring samples were gathered from the floating spring water all water samples for anion and cation analysis were first filtered with a 0 45 Œºm membrane and then filled in a polyethylene container rinsed with filtered water 3 times in addition cationic water samples bottles were full of filtered water with no bubble and the anionic water samples added ultrapure nitric acid for ph 2 dionex ion chromatograph model ics1100 and inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes model icap6300 were used to determine the concentrations of main anions and main cations respectively and the repeated detection errors were below 2 with 0 001 mg l of detected accuracy mao et al 2015 adding the saturated bacl2 solution into the groundwater samples we got baco3 sediments for the precipitation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic these baco3 sediments were freeze dried into powder under vacuum and the temperature of 50 c for 14c analysis the 14c samples were converted to benzene and were determined radiometrically by a liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 the analytical error is less than 0 5 percentage of modern carbon pmc all the analytical work was conducted in the laboratory of environmental school china university of geosciences wuhan the results of water chemistry and radiocarbon ages are listed in table 1 3 2 pumping test a multi well pumping test was performed with the well ww2 as pumping well and the other wells as observation wells but w1 is located on the east side of f86 1 and has weak hydraulic connection with ww2 then no observation was carried out in the well w1 deep well submersible pump was used to extract groundwater from ww2 and the automatic groundwater level gauge was used to automatically record groundwater level and temperature in all the wells the water level measurement accuracy is 1 mm and suitable for long term continuous groundwater monitoring during the pumping test the on site preparation of the diagram includes water level and time curve s t curve discharge

recovery and time relationship curve s t curve theis fitting curve method is used to calculate the hydrogeological parameters based on the calculation formula of unsteady flow the software of schlumberger aquifertest helps to process all the observed data 3 3 groundwater flow simulation the study area is a relatively closed hydrogeological unit it can be hydrogeologically divided into two layers in the vertical direction and two zones in the horizontal direction the two layers are simplified as 1 surface granite weathering layer 2 underlying granite fracture network layer the two zones are simplified as 1 granite fracture network zone 2 f86 1 fault zone the simulation area of groundwater flow is about 4 566 km2 the boundary can be generalized as the west boundary is the groundwater divide in the recharge area of zishui yuanshui mountain the east boundary is the impermeable zone on the east side of the f86 1 fault the south and north boundaries are groundwater ridges on both sides of the river the upper boundary receives atmospheric precipitation and evaporation the lower boundary is the maximum depth to which the atmospheric precipitation recharging groundwater can be

hydrogeological characteristics of f86 1 based on hydrogeological conditions f86 1 is an anisotropic fracture that collects and conducts water in the west part and is connected to the granite fracture network the groundwater taken from the sampling points can be hydrogeologically distinguished as follows 1 deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 taken from the west part of f86 1 2 deep groundwater w1 w2 w3 w4 taken from the granite fracture network w2 w3 w4 are on the west side of f86 1 but w1 on the east side of f86 1 3 shallow groundwater s1 s2 exposed from the surface weathered granite under the same stratum lithology conditions groundwater chemistry is influenced by position in fracture network and so is related to residence time and flow history raynaud and vasseur 2014 there may also be differences in water chemical composition for groundwater in faults and granite fracture networks leray et al 2012 hamed and dhahri 2013 the water chemical compositions of groundwater samples are dominated by hco3 ca2 na and they are rich in soluble silica however w1 has the highest na content but the lowest sio2 content fig 2 ca2 and sio2 contents are higher in the deep warm groundwater na and ca2 contents are lower in the shallow groundwater fig 2 according to the piper diagram the chemical type of groundwater can be identified piper 1944 rezaei et al 2019 the deep warm groundwater is hco3 ca type and other groundwater deep groundwater and shallow groundwater is hco3 na ca type except that w1 is hco3 na type fig 3 it indicates that the chemical types of groundwater on the east and west sides of f86 1 are different and that there are also differences in the chemical type of groundwater on the west side of f86 1 and that of the granite fracture network the groundwater is recharged by meteoric water which dissolves atmospheric co2 and has the ability to dissolve calcite the dissolution of granite silicate minerals is accompanied by the dissolution of carbonate minerals √∂zen et al 2012 resulting in the increase of sio2 and ca2 in groundwater pumping test can provide information for the parameters of groundwater flow system bense et al 2013 due to the anisotropy of the fault zone pumping tests can verify its hydrogeological information bense and van balen 2003 loveless et al 2011 a pumping test was conducted on the west side of f86 1 to determine the permeability and transmissivity of the fractured aquifer ww2 serves as the main pumping well and the others as observation wells the amount of pumped water the water level in the observation well and the atmospheric precipitation with time are recorded in fig 4 due to the influence of weather at the test site there was a short power outage during the pumping test which caused the pump to stop working and no water was discharged the discharge becoming 0 in fig 4 the multi well pumping test with ww2 as the pumping well began on 2019 1 18 16 00 00 the water level and drawdown data of the pumping test were recorded in table 2 according to the pumping test records ww2 dropped rapidly from the beginning of pumping ww1 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 00 10 the water level of ww3 was observed to drop significantly at 2019 1 18 16 00 01 the water level drawdown of w2 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 30 the water level drawdown of w3 was observed significantly at 2019 1 18 16 20 we selected two periods to observe groundwater regime of each wells the one was average pumping volume was 850 m3 d 2019 01 18 16 10 00 to 2019 01 20 8 40 00 and the other one was average pumping flow of 500 m3 d 2019 01 20 8 40 00 2019 01 23 8 30 00 during the pumping test the response time of the water level of each well to pumping is inconsistent the response of water level changes in wells ww1 ww2 and ww3 is almost consistent the water level in ww1 and ww3 responds almost instantaneously to the pumping in ww2 but significant water level changes in wells w2 w3 w4 appear to be delayed when the water level in ww2 changes additionally the difference of water level decrease between ww1 and ww2 is about 6 m and that between ww3 and ww2 is about 1 m during the whole pumping test period all these suggest that ww2 has closely hydraulic connection with ww1 and ww3 and significantly hydraulic connection with w2 w3 w4 f86 1 provides the closely hydraulic connection for ww1 ww2 and ww3 and granite fracture network provides significantly hydraulic connection for f86 1 with w2 w3 w4 the measured water level and discharge data of ww2 was inputted in the software aquifer test selecting the theis method the double logarithmic coordinate system and the w u 1 u standard curve were automatically generated refer to analyzing pumping tests in a sub vertical and anisotropic fault zone draining shallow aquifers dewandel et al 2014 fault f86 1 is treated as approximately isotropic and then kept the corresponding coordinate axes parallel to each other translated the measured curve until the two curves coincide fischer et al 2018 the hydraulic conductivity in each well was calculated which was regarded as the appropriate result table 3 three warm wells have uniformly higher transmissivity ww1 19 5 m2 d ww2 24 3 m2 d ww3 14 9 m2 d and hydraulic conductivity ww1 0 89 m d ww2 0 94 m d ww3 0 75 m d while the results are much lower in the three wells for transmissivity w2 1 90 10 2 m2 d w3 7 15 m2 d w4 1 46 m2 d and hydraulic conductivity w2 7 04 10 4 m d w3 2 27 10 1 m d w4 5 42 10 2 m d these results indicate the water content and water permeability of f86 1 are much better than those of the granite fracture network 4 2 groundwater flow in granite fracture network the hydrogeological characteristics of the granite fracture network are different from that of the fracture f86 1 and it is also different with depths rong et al 2020 the hydrogeological parameter values are differently assigned in the simulated model arlai et al 2012 li et al 2017 the value of the transmissivity above 100 m in the f86 1 fault zone is 0 75 m d according to pumping test result of ww3 and that from 100 m to deep depth is assigned as 0 91 m d based on the average transmissivity of ww1 and ww2 the transmissivity of weathered granite layer 0 10 m is selected as 2 27 10 1 m d according to pumping test result of w3 the transmissivity of upper granite fracture network 10 200 m is selected as 5 42 10 2 m d according to pumping test result of w4 the transmissivity of lower granite fracture network is selected as 7 04 10 4 m d according to pumping test result of w2 initial flow nets of the study area can be acquired by numerical analog we set the steady flow model in feflow fitting the measured water level of four wells ww1 ww3 w2 and w3 to the simulated water level for model calibration the simulated results present the natural flow nets in the study area at the beginning of pumping test the measured water level of four wells ww1 ww3 w2 and w3 are also restricted to fit with the simulated water level during the pumping test fig 5 since w2 is affected by the recharge of f86 1 and the granite fracture network at the same time the simulated water level and the observed water level are quite different in the first 45 min then the two are gradually consistent it indicates that f86 1 has good water permeability and its rapid recharge to w2 results in the rapid decrease of the groundwater level the average flow rate of 850 m3 d 2019 01 20 00 00 and 500 m3 d 2019 01 23 00 00 was selected and the pumping time lasted for 70 days according to the simulated flowing lines fig 6 the groundwater flow is almost uniform with the pumping volume of 850 m3 d and 500 m3 d the shallow groundwater in the weathered layer of granite fracture network first layer continuously flows into the f86 1 fault zone the deep groundwater in the underlying layer of granite fracture network second layer flow down to a certain depth no more than 1 93 km and gather into f86 1 from top to bottom in the granite fracture network the flow of groundwater gradually becomes slow after groundwater gathers from the granite fracture network to f86 1 the flow becomes rapid the granite fracture network is connected with the faults and the faults provide the gathering space and migration channel for groundwater song et al 2016 regional deep faults can connect shallow and deep groundwater and can also provide convenient channels for geothermal flow marbun et al 2020 from the characteristics of groundwater flow in granite fracture network the shallow groundwater flows faster and the deep groundwater flows slowly this can lead to a sufficient chemical reaction between deep groundwater and granite minerals the water chemistry obtained from the warm wells ww1 ww2 ww3 is the result of mixing of deep groundwater and shallow groundwater the mixing of shallow groundwater will dilute the dissolved silica in the warm wells leading to underestimation of the sio2 geothermometer 4 3 influence of granite fracture network on water rock interaction the granite in the study area was mainly composed of quartz feldspar hornblende and biotite among which albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 account for 45 quartz about 40 and biotite about 10 compared with the sandstone the granite is more susceptible to weathering the weathering and hydrolysis of these minerals can produce soluble sio2 and which dissolved in groundwater to form h4sio4 the dissolution of albite and amphibole minerals is the main source of na in warm groundwater samples hydrolysis reaction of albite 5 2naalsi3o8 2co2 11h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 hydrolysis reaction of amphibole 6 2naca2fe5 si7alo22 oh 2 3co2 39h2o al2sio5 oh 4 2na 4ca2 10fe2 12h4sio4 30hco3 from the formulas 5 and 6 it can be seen that through the action of co2 and h2o the dissolution of albite and hornblende not only releases na but also produces hco3 and h2sio3 decomposed from h4sio4 the aluminum ion content in the groundwater samples was lower than the detection limit of the instrument 0 0001 mg l given that the solubility of aluminosilicate minerals is very low at ph values close to 7 0 7 25 and at low temperatures there are two main sources of ca2 in warm well water 1 the hydrolysis reaction of anorthite 2 the hydrolysis reaction of amphibole the hydrolysis equation of anorthite is as follows 7 caal2si2o8 2co2 6h2o al2o3 3h2o ca2 2hco3 2h2sio3 the formulas 6 and 7 show that the dissolution of anorthite and hornblende not only does ca2 enter the groundwater but also the sources of hco3 and h2sio3 in the groundwater the equilibrium process of dissolution and precipitation of silicate minerals in groundwater is dominated by the source of solid amorphous sio2 and the solubility of secondary minerals formed during weathering the main factors controlling the equilibrium process of metasilicate dissolution and precipitation in groundwater are the supply source of solid amorphous sio2 and the solubility of secondary minerals formed during weathering according to water chemical compositions in the equilibrium system of silicate dissolution and precipitation the relative saturation of amorphous sio2 solid phase minerals can be determined and the source of groundwater soluble sio2 can be identified kopylova et al 2018 according to the mineral balance system diagram of groundwater system in the study area in fig 7 the soluble sio2 in groundwater mainly comes from the dissolution of muscovite illite albite calcium montmorillonite and magnesium montmorillonite based on the water chemistry of groundwater the mineral saturation indexes si calculated by the phreeqc hydrogeochemical modeling software are shown in table 4 which can be used to describe the degree of supersaturation or undersaturation of different minerals in groundwater systems qin et al 2005 almost all the estimated minerals in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater have the similar si values which suggest that similar water rock interactions possibly occurred in the process of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater formation the si values equal to 0 indicates complete saturation greater than 0 meaning supersaturation and less than 0 corresponding to undersaturation therefore except for silica minerals chalcedony coesite quartz and tridymite the other estimated minerals saturation index less than 0 indicates inadequate equilibrium between water and rock interaction in groundwater system at the measured temperature weathered and broken granite hydrogeologically dominate the formation of water chemistry the dissolution of granite minerals anhydrite calcite dolomite gypsum monohydrocalcite okenite wollastonite etc may be the main water rock interactions occurring in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater however the dissolution of minerals has not reached equilibrium except for dissolved silica in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the na k mg diagram is proposed to identify the water rock equilibrium and mixing of waters in different origins giggenbach 1988 shakeri et al 2008 yang et al 2017 as shown in fig 8 all the warm groundwater samples are distributed in immature water area which indicates insufficient water rock interactions and mixing of warm groundwater with cold shallow groundwater have occurred as the warm water rises to the surface and all the shallow groundwater samples except w1 sample locating at mature water area suggests that the groundwater rarely achieve at water rock equilibrium however the w1 groundwater is the partially equilibrated water and it shows that the formation of chemical components in w1 groundwater is mainly determined by the interaction of water and rock but it has not reached a complete chemical equilibrium state this also indicates that the dissolution of minerals has not reached equilibrium in warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the gibbs diagrams are widely employed to assess the sources of chemical compositions such as precipitation water rock interaction and evaporation gibbs 1970 al barakah et al 2017 all the data of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater is shown in fig 9 which suggests that water rock interaction and precipitation are possibly the sources of dissolved ions to control the groundwater chemistry the water rock interactions include the chemical weathering of rocks dissolution precipitation of secondary carbonates minerals and ion exchange al barakah et al 2017 the decrease in ca2 and mg2 but the increase in na in the w1 waters can be explained by cation exchange which confirms the water rock interaction is the main sources of chemical components in w1 groundwater according to chemical characteristics and mineral saturation index of warm groundwater and shallow groundwater the precipitation of silica minerals chalcedony coesite quartz and tridymite can also control the chemical evolution for groundwater besides water rock interactions the precipitated silica in shallow groundwater may come from the groundwater in which the soluble silica was supersaturated in the weathered granite fractures during the migration of shallow groundwater to the deep granite fracture network the increase in water temperature re promote the increase in dissolved silica content therefore the supersaturation of dissolved silica in shallow groundwater may be the main contribution to silica enrichment in warm groundwater the dissolved silica is supersaturated in shallow groundwater in weathered granite it will precipitate during the migration of shallow groundwater to the fracture network of deep granite however as the ground temperature rises the ability of warm groundwater to dissolve silica continues to increase and water minerals are in a state of dissolution imbalance then the temperatures estimated with sio2 geothermometers or mme based on aluminosilicate equilibrium dissolution for evaluating warm groundwater may be underestimated 4 4 warm groundwater circulation in granite fracture network most of the chemical geothermometers existing in the literature are based on chemical equilibrium reactions between the water and the rocks in the reservoir conditions consequently the reservoir temperature estimated using these geothermometers will be reliable only if the corresponding equilibrium reactions exist in the reservoir and continue to control the dissolved species of the reservoir waters after their ascent to the surface the dissolved sio2 in groundwater can be used to estimate the reservoir temperature in hydrothermal system the dissolution of quartz and chalcedony is positively correlated with temperature known as sio2 geothermometer quartz geothermometers and chalcedony geothermometers fournier and truesdell 1970 fournier 1977 fournier et al 1979 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 p√ºrschel et al 2013 in addition the na k geothermometer the k mg geothermometer the na k ca geothermometer and other cationic thermometers are also used in geothermal systems under different conditions to evaluate the temperature of water rock interaction the na k geothermometer is considered to be applied in the best conditions for long cycling time and high temperature geothermal system in the situations of low ca2 low so4 2 or high co2 thermal groundwater fournier and truesdell 1973 fournier et al 1979 giggenbach 1988 can 2002 the k mg geothermometer shows quick reflection to reacted temperature and is suitable for low to high temperature geothermal system giggenbach et al 1983 giggenbach 1988 the na k ca geothermometer is used to evaluate the temperature of high temperature geothermal system with high calcium content fournier and truesdell 1973 d amore and panichi 1980 kharaka and mariner 1989 sio2 geothermometers and cation geothermometers provide the possibility of reacted temperature estimation for silica enriched mineral groundwater in weathered granite with fracture network in the study area the heat source is mainly derived from the residual heat of granite and the geothermal field belongs to the middle low temperature geothermal field the silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss is probably more suitable for the ww1 and ww3 samples the temperatures estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss are 65 c fournier 1977 and 66 67 c arn√≥rsson et al 1983 using the quartz silica geothermometer without maximum steam loss fournier 1977 the estimated temperature is 95 c for the ww2 sample the corresponding temperatures are 73 c and 75 c respectively using the chalcedony silica geothermometer and 103 c using the quartz silica geothermometer as we will see later the temperatures estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer are very close to the mme temperatures and were considered to be the most representative given that the use of chalcedony silica geothermometer is recommended for low geothermal systems in the literature fournier 1977 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 giggenbach et al 1983 the reservoir temperatures of the sampled warm well water have been estimated using several major different cation geothermometers and the calculated results are as follows 1 temperature calculated by na k mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 ranges from 220 9 c to 217 9 c 2 calculated temperature with na k ca mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 is between 76 2 c and 82 3 c 3 temperature calculated by na k geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 varies from 222 3 c to 292 9 c 4 k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 provides reservoir temperature from 42 9 c to 49 2 c 5 the calculated temperature by na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 ranges from 328 3 c to 373 8 c if the cation geothermometers give scattered and not reliable temperature estimations in this study it is mainly because the vast majority of water samples are in the immature fluid zone li et al 2019b as shown by the giggenbach s triangular na k mg diagram fig 8 multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme temperature for three warm well samples ww1 ww2 and ww3 are inferred using phreeqc geochemical software by entering the chemical and isotope data of the warm well samples the phreeqc can simulate the precipitation and dissolution equilibrium reaction of multiple minerals in the same temperature range so the equilibrium temperature can be ensured in fig 10 the minerals including calcite celadonite chalcedony quartz k feldspar and tridymite can reach precipitation dissolution equilibrium in the same time in a certain temperature the mme temperatures for the three warm well samples ww1 ww2 and ww3 are 68 c 75 c and 69 c respectively as already mentioned the mme temperatures are very close to those estimated using the chalcedony silica geothermometer for the three warm well samples and can be considered as the most representative of the reservoir conditions the temperatures estimated using the cation geothermometers are not reliable because these warm waters have only attained partial chemical equilibrium at low temperature close to 70 c with respect to very few minerals chalcedony k feldspar celadonite see fig 10 and are not in chemical equilibrium with respect to other minerals such as albite muscovite which are also involved in the cation thermometric relationships the water chemistry of thermal groundwater can provide information on the experienced temperature and depth in the circulation based on chemical geothermometer estimations mao et al 2015 ndikubwimana et al 2020 and the circulation depth of warm groundwater can be estimated yang et al 2017 mao et al 2021 the average annual temperature in the study area is 16 7 c the geothermal gradient is 3 c 100 m it is estimated that the maximum circulation depth of the warm groundwater is about 1 93 km the deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 have a stable temperature above 17 c slightly higher than the local multi year average temperature of 16 c the f86 1 deep fault may communicate deep geothermal flow and provide the possibility for groundwater heating on the west side of f86 1 there has a regional watershed zishui yuanshui watershed regarded as the groundwater recharge zone the lateral distance from the watershed to f86 1 is about 3 90 km combined with groundwater dating results hasegawa et al 2016 mao et al 2018b wang and zheng 2019 the circulation speed and renewal capacity of groundwater can be evaluated ndikubwimana et al 2020 mao et al 2021 the recharged distance is about 3 90 km and the circulation depth of groundwater is about 1 93 km the radiocarbon ages of deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 range from 3 64 to 3 98 ka listed in table 1 then the horizontal average seepage velocity of warm groundwater is about 2 8 10 3 m d and the vertical average seepage velocity is about 1 5 10 3 m d a circulation model of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network is proposed fig 11 the atmospheric precipitation infiltrated through the fissures by gravity force and the recharge distance is about 3 90 km most of shallow groundwater is gathered to the f86 1 fault zone through the surface granite weathering layer 0 10 m a part of the groundwater is continuously flow into the f86 1 fault zone by middle weathering granite fracture network layer 10 200 m a few of deep groundwater continuously infiltrated to the deep granite fracture network layer 200 1930 m the water rock interaction temperature is approximately 68 75 c and the maximum circulation depth is approximately 1 93 km the deep warm groundwater flows up through the deep fault zones by thermodynamic driven forces 5 conclusions pumping test and hydrogeochemistry were employed to investigate the circulation of silica enriched mineral groundwater exposed from granite fracture network in suining south china the influence of the flow characteristics of silica enriched groundwater in granite fracture network on the estimation of sio2 geothermometer is discussed in this paper the pumping test results suggest that the hydraulic conductivity of the granite fracture network is much smaller than that of the f86 1 fracture the granite fracture network is the main runoff channel for groundwater and the f86 1 fracture is the accumulation channel for groundwater the groundwater flow framework is evaluated with hydrogeochemistry the silica enriched mineral groundwater had experienced the maximum temperature of 68 75 c estimated with multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme and reached the maximum depth of 1 93 km the recharge distance is about 3 90 km and the radiocarbon ages of deep warm groundwater ww1 ww2 ww3 range from 3 64 to 3 98 ka resulting in about 2 8 10 3 m d of the horizontal average seepage velocity and about 1 5 10 3 m d of the vertical average seepage velocity the pumping test confirmed that this average flow rate is reasonable moreover the simulation results reveal that the flow rate of groundwater from top to bottom gradually slowed down and eventually all groundwater gathered from the granite fracture network to the f86 1 fault based on these results a conceptual model of silica enriched mineral groundwater in granite fracture network is proposed the long term and sufficient water rock interaction suggest that it is not f86 1 fault but the granite fracture network plays the most important role in the formation of silica enriched mineral groundwater because granite is easily weathered the reasonable temperature estimated using silica chalcedony geothermometer is 66 5 74 6 c which are very close to the multicomponent mineral equilibrium mme temperatures 68 75 c however possible mixing processes between deep geothermal water and shallow groundwater in the granite fracture network resulting in a decrease in the content of chemical components in the geothermal water can make the deep temperatures
