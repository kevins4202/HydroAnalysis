18505,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have increasing applications in the inactivation of microorganisms in water air food and on surfaces system designers currently have metrics for comparison of the microbial and energy efficiency of uv leds but these have not included a time component without including the time efficiency of a uv led neither the fluence basis nor the electrical basis of comparison clarifies which uv led wavelength and operating condition is optimal for a design space this research explores microbial inactivation of uv leds at various wavelengths under continuous and pulsing operating conditions planktonic microorganisms of relevance to public water supplies and uv system design are included e coli and ms 2 for benchmarking against previous studies and p aeruginosa which has not been studied in pulsed systems or for continuous and combined uv led wavelengths pulsing uv leds at various duty rates percent of cycle spent on and frequencies number of cycles per second does not result in a statistically significant disinfection performance difference over the continuous light operation at that respective wavelength uv leds emitting at peak wavelengths corresponding to the peak action spectrum of a microorganism are optimal on a fluence basis but these are typically less electrically efficient uv leds system designers can compare the normalized microbial inactivation electrical and time efficiencies eneto of various uv leds eneto 1 for a pulsing condition ensures equal or improved efficiency compared to the continuous light condition while expanding the lifetime of the uv led and decreasing the size or cost of associated power supplies graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection bacteria bacteriophage uv led wavelengths drinking water 1 introduction the recent emergence of deep uv light emitting diodes leds has increased the potential application of uv inactivation by offering tailored wavelengths and wavelength combinations low power requirements flexible design configurations pulsing and improved robustness over uv lp lamps without the mercury song et al 2016 malley 2004 beck et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 bowker et al 2011 rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 uv is particularly effective against chlorine resistant pathogens including bacterial biofilm species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and protozoan parasites such as cryptosporidium clancy et al 2004 malayeri et al 2016 because microorganisms are differentially susceptible to disinfectants and there are myriad applications of disinfection i e point of entry public water systems hospital water tanks industrial applications residential point of use etc demand for new technologies and approaches for targeting specific microorganisms is high hijnen et al 2006 a growing number of studies have explored the application of uv leds in drinking water disinfection comparing uv leds to lp lamps can be done two different ways 1 on a fluence basis and 2 on an electrical basis a comparison on a fluence basis simply allows for the direct comparison of a microorganism s response to various applied fluences without incorporating any energy use into the comparison however an electrical basis comparison incorporates the amount of energy required for one order of magnitude response decrease in concentration in the log linear response region of a log reduction curve in general even if uv leds are more efficacious than lp lamps on a fluence basis uv leds will require improvements in their efficiencies to near 25 39 in order to achieve similar performance to uv lp lamps on an electrical basis beck et al 2017 while one uv led manufacturer has produced a 280 nm uv led with a reported external quantum efficiency eqe of approximately 20 and three manufacturers have achieved 10 12 eqe at approximately 280 nm current efficiencies typically range from 0 01 to 7 eqe between 220 and 285 nm kneissl et al 2019 the eqe is simply a ratio of the number of electrons applied to the uv led and the number of photons escaping this does not take into account the electrical efficiency of a device or any thermal management systems it is simply a tool used to discuss the efficiency of a uv led chip germicidal effectiveness on a fluence basis favors wavelengths which correspond closely to the peak absorbance of both nucleic acids and cellular proteins near 260 280 nm and below 230 nm respectively however effectiveness on an electrical basis favors higher intensity output uv leds würtele et al 2011 aoyagi et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 chatterley and linden 2009 on a fluence basis studies have shown that nominal 255 285 nm uv leds induce inactivation rate constants for e coli ranging from 0 15 to 0 81 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 malayeri et al 2016 oguma et al 2016 oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 with the highest values corresponding to wavelengths closest to the peak of the e coli action spectrum 266 nm beck et al 2016 the unique response of each microorganism to various uv wavelengths is due to each microbe s distinctive composition of proteins and nucleic acids this concept is referred to as the action spectrum of a microorganism sinsheimer 1954 sinha and häder 2002 minton and friedberg 1974 smith 1962 across this wavelength range the rate constants are comparable to those induced by uv lp lamps at 254 nm 0 20 0 81 cm2 mj malayeri et al 2016 rattanakul and oguma 2018 p aeruginosa inactivation by 265 285 nm uv leds induce inactivation rate constants ranging from 0 51 to 0 74 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 the wavelength range explored in previous studies does not correspond to the peak action spectrum sensitivity for p aeruginosa which peaks near 258 nm lakretz et al 2010 similar to e coli p aeruginosa uv led rate constants are comparable to those induced by uv lp lamps 0 45 0 77 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 ms 2 inactivation by 255 285 nm uv leds induce inactivation rate constants ranging from 0 029 to 0 076 cm2 mj bowker et al 2011 aoyagi et al 2011 sholtes et al 2016 jenny et al 2014 simons et al 2014 oguma et al 2016 with higher rate constants nearer 262 nm this trend corresponds to the peak action spectrum sensitivity for ms 2 beck et al 2015 ms 2 rate constants associated with uv lp lamps emitting at 254 nm span the higher range of the uv led inactivation rate constants due to the relatively close proximity to the action spectrum peak 0 052 0 094 cm2 mj beck et al 2015 2017 malayeri et al 2016 the lowest inactivation rate constants for all microorganisms occurred at the tail end of the germicidal spectrum near 285 nm because different wavelengths can target differing critical cellular components i e proteins vs nucleic acids malley 2004 rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 falkinham et al 2015 hijnen et al 2006 applying various uv wavelengths is considered a more effective strategy than applying uv light at only one wavelength hijnen et al 2006 linden et al 2007 this concept is demonstrated in the increased efficacy of polychromatic uv medium pressure mp lamps when compared to monochromatic uv lp lamps hijnen et al 2006 malley 2004 to mimic this enhanced polychromatic effect researchers combine multiple uv led wavelengths researchers have hypothesized a synergistic effect for such wavelength combinations however no synergistic effect for microbial inactivation for any uv led wavelength combination or sequencing scenario in the uv c and uv b ranges has been documented li et al 2017 beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 song et al 2019 nyangaresi et al 2018 oguma et al 2013 however synergy was noted in two studies which include 365 nm uv a uv led exposure in addition to uv c wavelengths chevremont et al 2012 song et al 2019 combined wavelength studies have featured microorganisms such as e coli ms 2 adenovirus bacillus pumilus fecal coliforms and various indictor bacteria an additional hypothetical strategy for improved electrical efficiency of uv leds has been to pulse the radiation studies exploring pulsed uv light have been inconsistent and have relied on uv sources xenon lamps incomparable to uv leds due to the higher energy released per pulse or theoretical methods for calculating the applied fluence xenon lamps emit at approximately nine orders of magnitude higher output than uv leds resulting in enhanced inactivation due to possible multiphoton absorption by a molecule and photothermal effects on the target cell song et al 2018 one study employing pulsing uv leds calculated irradiance from a theoretical basis using the total input power and dividing it by the cross sectional area of the apparatus tran et al 2014 this approach negates the electrical efficiency of the system which is substantial and the impact of the cross sectional area normalization method is unknown but also likely substantial additional pulsed uv led studies measured irradiance with a radiometer wengraitis et al 2013 nyangaresi et al 2019 this is not an accurate method and results in unstable readings under pulsed light conditions bohrerova et al 2008 song et al 2018 in light of these issues studies regarding pulsed uv light in both food and water generally conclude that pulsed uv light is up to four to six times more effective than continuous uv light in dried food powers fine and gervais 2004 takeshita et al 2003 and 1 3 to 3 8 times more effective in water for a variety of pathogenic and surrogate viruses and bacteria bohrerova et al 2008 lamont et al 2007 j li et al 2010 wengraitis et al 2013 tran et al 2014 p aeruginosa biofilms have also been studied under pulsed xenon lamps with promising results but these results are even harder to interpret due to the compounded factors of the high intensity xenon source lack of information about the irradiance calculations and the harboring and protecting of microorganisms inside the biofilm matrix garvey et al 2015 the one study exploring e coli and ms 2 which accurately measured irradiance with chemical actinometry applied a varied duty rate percent of one cycle that the light is on and frequency number of cycles per second of pulsed uv led light the authors concluded that there was no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis song et al 2018 confirming these results for e coli a recent study employed much tighter electrical and thermal controls but still calculated the theoretical irradiance instead of measuring it with actinometery nyangaresi et al 2019 the design space for uv led drinking water reactors is large and increasing as uv led manufacturing technology and science improves light intensity is increasing across all wavelengths and of particular interest at highly germicidal wavelengths as a result environmental engineers researchers and system designers are in need of operation specific microbial inactivation data capable of informing system and research design this research addresses current needs in comparing wavelength efficacy and operational conditions of uv leds pulsing and continuous light across the uv c and lower uv b germicidal spectrum 255 285 nm of microorganisms of relevance to public water systems the objectives of this study include comparing the efficacies of the following 1 uv mercury arc lamps to various uv leds 2 various combinations and sequencing of wavelengths of uv leds and 3 various pulsing strategies for the inactivation of vegetative bacteria and virus surrogates in drinking water using three representative indicator microorganisms e coli p aeruginosa and bacteriophage ms 2 these comparisons are explored both through a fluence basis and an electrical basis 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism propagation and assay 2 1 1 bacterial preparation for uv disinfection experiments exponential phase cultures of e coli k 12 atcc r 29425 were grown in sterile nutrient broth 3 nb bd difco and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442 were grown in sterile luria bertani broth lb bd difco each bacterium were grown from frozen stocks stored in 20 by volume glycerol exponential phase bacterial cultures were pelletized by centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min the supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet was re suspended by vortexing in phosphate buffered saline pbs this was repeated three times to wash the growth media from the cells after the pellet was resuspended the third time the sample was sonicated for 30 s at 82 watts to disaggregate the cells örmeci and linden 2005 this bacterial suspension was 10 fold serially diluted in pbs to achieve a uvt at 254 of 93 95 bolton and linden 2003 and bacteria concentration of 5 106 cfu ml the absorbance of the 10 fold diluted suspension at 254 nm was measured to estimate the initial bacteria concentration and to determine the required times of irradiation to achieve a predetermined range of uv doses to achieve target levels as log10 of inactivation for the low pressure lamps while an absorbance scan of 200 400 nm was taken to inform the required times of irradiation for the uv leds 2 1 2 ms 2 sample preparation for disinfection experiments bacteriophage ms 2 atcc 15597 b1 were propagated and enumerated using the epa 1602 single layer agar method epa 2001 with e coli famp host atcc 700891 ms 2 stock was thawed and 10 fold serially diluted in pbs to achieve a uvt at 254 of 95 97 the absorbance at 254 nm of the pbs diluted sample was measured to determine the required times of irradiation to achieve a predetermined range of uv doses for the low pressure lamps while an absorbance scan of 200 400 nm was taken to determine the required times of irradiation for the uv leds 2 2 collimated beam set up 2 2 1 uv low pressure mercury arc lamp the collimated beam experimental apparatus consisted of two 15 watt low pressure mercury arc lamps sankyo denki co ltd japan which emitted nearly monochromatic uv radiation at 253 7 nm the lamp was suspended horizontally directly above a metal box with two equal circular holes vertically aligned and separated by 30 cm bolton and linden 2003 bolton et al 2015 lawal et al 2017 a stir plate was positioned directly under the openings for continuous stirring of samples the uv irradiance before and after each trial was measured with a calibrated radiometer il 1700 photodetector sed 240 and w diffuser international light newburyport mass by placing the detector at the sample centerline and the detector s calibrated plane at the same level as the water surface of the irradiated samples 2 2 2 uv led device the pearlbeam triple wavelength ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led research device purchased from aquisense erlanger kentucky contains the following features uv leds of three different nominal wavelengths 255 nm 265 nm and 285 nm power control thermal management and a housing assemblage kheyrandish et al 2018a each wavelength can be operated independently and or simultaneously and pulsing can be applied at five duty rates 10 25 50 75 and 90 and three frequencies 1 10 and 100 hz for each wavelength three uv leds of each wavelength are oriented spatially to distribute light on a target surface such as the water in an exposure vessel kheyrandish et al 2018a b the led spectra measured by aquisense with their in house integrating sphere and verified with a calibrated maya 2000 pro spectrometer ocean optics dunedin fl exhibited peak wavelength emissions at 258 267 5 and 281 5 nm for the 255 265 and 285 nm leds respectively when the 265 and 285 nm leds are operated simultaneously the 265 nm uv leds comprise 33 of the total irradiance and the 285 nm leds comprise the remaining 67 beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 pulsing studies were conducted for 265 and 285 nm uv leds only the 255 nm uv led was omitted due to the low relative irradiance resulting in excessively long exposure time all uv equipment were allowed to warm up for 15 min prior to each experiment the led module was configured to be oriented directly above an irradiation vessel on a stir plate for continuous stirring of samples kheyrandish et al 2017 2018a b the uv irradiance before and after each trial was measured with a calibrated radiometer in order to ensure that the average irradiance over the course of the experiment was within 5 of the initial irradiance epa 2006 ilt5000 photodetector sed 240 w diffuser international light newburyport mass the detector was placed at the sample centerline with the detector s calibrated plane at the same height as the water surface of the irradiated samples because uv leds are a polychromatic light source the sensitivity of the radiometer calibration data supplied by international light must be adjusted to the relative lamp emission rle of the leds for each uv source the radiometer sensitivity was adjusted to the actual weighted average peak wavelength bolton et al 2015 2 3 disinfection for each uv source at each wavelength and for the simultaneous 265 285 nm uv leds four or five unique uv dose levels were evaluated in triplicate to generate dose response curves for each microorganism e coli and p aeruginosa experiments terminated at 16 mj cm2 due to the rapid inactivation of these microorganisms and the achievement of 4 log10 reduction by this point additionally since nsf standard 55 nsf 2012 requires 16 mj cm2 for secondary disinfection this represents the target dose for these experiments ms 2 experiments terminated at a dose of 60 mj cm2 due to the relatively slower inactivation kinetics and the desire to best define those kinetics furthermore 40 mj cm2 represents the nsf standard 55 dose required for primary disinfection stirred suspensions of 4 ml 0 5 cm sample depth were irradiated in 3 5 cm diameter dishes at distances of 39 7 49 7 cm from the lp uv source irradiance was measured at the water surface with a calibrated radiometer incident lp irradiance varied from 0 05 mw cm2 at the farthest distance with only one lamp on to 0 638 mw cm2 at the nearest distance with both lamps on for the uv led experiments incident irradiance ranged from 0 045 to 0 568 mw cm2 due to the order of magnitude variability in intensity of the light emitted between the different uv leds stirred suspensions of 19 ml 0 9 cm sample depth were irradiated in 5 4 cm diameter dishes at distances of 4 6 cm from the uv led source average uv doses were determined as described previously by bolton and linden 2003 by adjusting the applicable variables in the spreadsheet germicidal fluence uv dose calculations for a low pressure uv lamp obtained from bolton photosciences inc edmonton alberta canada the petri factor which represents the uniformity of irradiance across the surface of the sample were consistently 0 99 for uv lp exposures and they ranged from 0 9 to 0 95 for uv led exposures incident irradiance was calculated utilizing the iodide iodate ki actinometry song et al 2018 protocol detailed by bolton et at 2011 bolton et al 2011 with quantum yield data from literature goldstein and joseph 2008 rahn et al 2003 because the uv fluence is the product of the average uv irradiance and time the pre determined fluence was achieved by adjusting the exposure time for each sample using a manual shutter post exposure all bacterial samples were processed 10 fold serially diluted and plated immediately to prevent potential photorepair because p aeruginosa is highly photoreactive the sample is 10 fold serially diluted and plated as quickly as possible in the dark with only a red light source for visibility 700 1000 nm fluences were applied in random order and repeated in triplicate 2 4 enumeration and statistical analysis microorganisms were assayed using spot or drop plate methods beck et al 2009 for each dilution in spot plating 10 spots of 10 μl each were applied to nb agar e coli plates lb agar p aeruginosa plates or typtic soy agar plates with host e coli famp with streptomycin ampicillin ms 2 after drying of spots plates were inverted and incubated for 18 h at 37 c colonies and plaques were counted and bacterial and bacteriophage concentrations respectively expressed as colony forming units cfu ml and plaque forming units pfu ml at least three replicate samples were assayed at each uv dose undergoing statistical analysis microbial reduction at each dose was expressed as log10 n0 nx where n0 is the initial concentration in cfu ml or pfu ml in the control sample without uv exposure and nx is the concentration in cfu ml or pfu ml after exposure to dose x linear region data are presented with error bars representing one standard deviation for statistical analysis of the dose response curves linear regression analysis using least squares fitting technique in graphpad graphpad prism 7 01 la jolla ca was performed comparing the slopes and intercepts of the linear region of the microbial dose response curves using the parameters log10 nx n0 as a function of uv dose mj cm2 fitted lines were compared both line slopes and intercepts using a two tailed independent paired t test where significance was defined as α 0 05 this strategy compares efficacy on a fluence basis additionally log inactivation curves were weighted with the action spectrum of each microorganisms and compared beck et al 2015 2017 synergy for combined wavelengths was tested by first determining the relative contribution of each led to the total emission spectrum of the combined leds for example the 265 nm led contributed 33 3 of the emission spectrum while the 285 nm led contributed 66 7 of the emission spectrum of the two leds combined once the relative contribution was determined the dose contribution of each uv led was weighted to the relative contribution of the combined emission spectrum beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 for example for a target dose of 30 mj cm2 10 mj cm2 would be contributed by the 265 nm uv led and 20 mj cm2 would be contributed by the 285 nm uv led the results were summed together and compared directly to the dose response results of the combined 265 285 nm leds 2 5 electrical energy efficiency in order to compare the electrical efficiency of the pulsing conditions relative to uv lp lamps or each other the electrical energy per order e eo is calculated for each condition e eo represents the amount of electrical energy required to reduce by one order of magnitude the concentration of a microorganism and can be seen in equation 1 sharpless and linden 2005 beck et al 2017 1 e eo a 3 6 10 3 v k c w f where e eo is the electrical energy per order of magnitude kwh m3 order a is the surface area cm2 of the target volume 3 6 103 is the unit conversion constant v is the volume of target sample ml k is the fluence based inactivation rate constant cm2 mj from the linear region of the log reduction curve wf is the water factor and c is the wall plug efficiency the wall plug efficiency is calculated by dividing the radiant flux mw calculated through actinometry by the input power to the device mw measured with an electricity usage meter p3 international corporation kill a watt p4400 meter new york ny ratios were calculated of the lowest eeo values to the eeo of each pulsing scenario eeo ledcont eeo ledpulsed however this does not take into account the amount of time required for the exposures uv led pulsing requires longer exposure times to produce the equivalent fluence of a continuous light source because the light pulses do not emit at a higher intensity than the continuous source pulsed exposure time is increased inversely relative to the duty rate for example if a light source was pulsed at a 10 duty rate then by definition it was only on 10 of each cycle and therefore the exposure time required was approximately 10x longer than the constant light condition to account for the time efficiency the ratio of eeo ledcont eeo ledpulsed was normalized to the relative ratio of the pulsed exposure time to the constant exposure time tpulsed tcont because theoretically the products of the electrical energy and time of each condition would be equal under all conditions if there were no benefit of pulsing i e eeo ledcont tcont eeo ledpulsed tpulsed this variable represents the efficiency of both energy and time per order and of each pulsed condition relative to the relevant uv led continuous light condition this variable will be called eneto for normalized energy and time efficiency per order as shown in equation 2 2 e neto e eo l e d c o n t e eo l e d p u l s e d t pulsed t cont e neto facilitates an improved comparison of the energy efficiency per order per time of exposure when normalized against the constant light conditions for each wavelength 3 results and discussion results are presented by microorganism class and compare log reduction curves of the uv sources lp lamps and uv leds graphically and statistically dose response curves represent the data as log reduction log10 n0 nx as a function of uv dose mj cm2 fig 1 all data are compiled in two graphs 1 all uv led wavelengths and pulsing scenarios with a non linear four parameter curve fit to the data and 2 the linear region of all uv led wavelengths and pulsing scenarios with linear regression lines fit to the data the first hypothesis tested whether or not the frequencies within each duty rate resulted in different microbial inactivation for each microorganism the electronics of the system were designed to hold equal the integrated optical output power of an led driven at any frequency 1 10 and 100 hz for each duty rate and wavelength because of the theoretical equality of the irradiance of all frequencies within each duty rate for each wavelength and due to some testing conditions duty rate and frequency combinations were omitted when exposure time was greater than 45 min or less than 20 s the equal irradiance per duty rate hypothesis was tested with paired t tests α 0 05 all tests under all conditions indicated that the frequency data within each duty rate for each microorganism and wavelength were not statistically significantly different and therefore could be treated as replicates this reduces the number of variables and simplifies the analysis for the remaining analysis only duty rates will be addressed as all frequency data are simply treated as more replicates within each duty rate and wavelength this was further verified by decreasing the frequency of the 10 duty rate 265 and 285 nm uv leds to 0 33 and 0 5 hz for e coli there was no difference found between the e coli inactivation at all frequencies for comparable duty rates and wavelengths 3 1 continuous and pulsed uv led inactivation of microorganisms 3 1 1 e coli k 12 the results for e coli k 12 inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are summarized in fig 1 as curves fit from log10 reduction data as a function of uv dose continuous and pulsed light four parameter curves for the entire fluence range tested 0 16 mj cm2 are included in fig 1 for both bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa curve fitting parameters and the associated r2 values can all be found in the supplemental information data points are not included in these figures due to the high number of data points present ms 2 data and curves are present in fig 2 illustrating the first order inactivation kinetics region for all microorganisms data points illustrating the mean and standard deviation are included for all microorganisms in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 1 at a dose of 16 mj cm2 e coli k 12 achieves log reduction values lrv ranging from 4 to 6 with the 265 nm uv led performing best with a 5 5 6 lrv and uv lp underperforming at a 4 lrv these results correspond well to e coli inactivation results for various uv sources reported by previous investigators sommer et al 2000 hijnen et al 2006 oguma et al 2013 e coli k 12 results demonstrated first order inactivation over the dose range of 0 8 mj cm2 for the 255 and 265 nm uv leds while first order inactivation kinetics were experienced from 8 to 12 mj cm2 for the 285 nm uv leds departures from first order reaction kinetics in uv disinfection of e coli have been previously reported at low fluences for various e coli strains sommer et al 2000 dose response curves for e coli k 12 experiments demonstrated tailing at doses above approximately 10 mj cm2 for the 255 and 265 nm uv leds and uv lp sources as the limits of detection were near the slopes of the first order inactivation range are shown in fig 2 and indicate that for e coli all uv leds 255 265 and 285 nm vary significantly from the uv lp lamp p 0 0001 0 0001 and 0 0026 respectively with the 255 and 265 nm uv led preforming significantly better and the 285 nm uv led significantly underperforming this corresponds to the findings of other researchers bowker et al 2011 the constant light inactivation rate constants found in this study are 0 58 0 77 and 0 40 cm2 mj for 255 265 and 285 nm respectively and 0 50 cm2 mj for the uv lp lamp table 1 these data corresponded well to previously published literature in which e coli uv led rate constants ranged from 0 15 to 0 81 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 malayeri et al 2016 oguma et al 2016 oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 and when inactivated by uv lp lamps at 254 nm ranged from 0 20 to 0 81 cm2 mj malayeri et al 2016 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the differing response to variable wavelengths is expected for all microorganisms the highest rate constants correspond to the uv led wavelength nearest the relative peak of each microorganisms action spectrum e coli peaks near 266 nm beck et al 2016 p aeruginosa peaks near 258 nm lakretz et al 2010 and ms 2 peaks near 262 nm beck et al 2015 when the fluence is weighted by the action spectrum of each respective microorganism there is no statistically significant difference in the linear dose response curve between all wavelengths of uv leds pulsing studies were conducted for the 265 and 285 nm uv leds paralleling the constant light results all 265 nm uv led pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly better than the uv lp lamp all p values 0 0001 when comparing the first order inactivation region as shown in fig 2 all 285 nm uv led pulsing scenarios underperformed the uv lp lamp with statistical significance all p values 0 0001 none of the pulsing conditions within each wavelength source were significantly different from the continuous light source for each wavelength this applied to all microorganisms for example the inactivation due to the most efficacious pulsing condition for the 265 nm uv led 90 duty rate was not significantly different from that of the continuous 265 nm uv led this applied to the least efficacious pulsing condition for the 265 nm uv led 10 duty rate when compared to the continuous 265 nm light as well these data confirm the results of a previous pulsed uv led study with actinometry measured irradiance which concluded no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis song et al 2018 however while the inactivation rate constants did not vary statistically significantly the 75 and 90 duty rate pulsing conditions did result in a higher lrv after 10 mj cm2 than the continuous light 265 nm uv led for the 285 nm uv led the 50 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv after a fluence of approximately 10 mj cm2 as well these data mirror the pulsed uv led results found by nyangaresi nyangaresi et al 2019 the similar response of microorganisms to pulsing and continuous light is likely due to dose reciprocity which states that biological impacts of a specific uv dose are directly proportional to the total dose delivered irrespective of the regime in which it is applied sommer et al 1998 additionally cellular inactivation and repair mechanisms take place over time horizons defined by nanoseconds as opposed to the centisecond time scale of reliable uv led pulsing harm 1980 salcedo et al 2007 3 1 2 p aeruginosa the results for p aeruginosa inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are summarized in fig 1 as log10 reduction as a function of uv dose at a dose of 16 mj cm2 p aeruginosa achieves log10 reduction values ranging from 4 5 to 6 lrv with the 255 nm uv led performing best and the 285 nm uv led underperforming as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the slopes of the linear region indicate that neither 255 nor 265 nm uv led sources are significantly different from each other the 265 nm uv led does not perform significantly differently from the uv lp lamp however the 255 nm and the 285 nm uv leds do vary significantly from the lp lamp p 0 0019 and 0 0002 respectively with the 255 nm uv led performing better than the lp lamp and the 285 nm uv led underperforming through the linear region however this difference only persists through the linear region the 285 nm uv led results in approximately equivalent log10 inactivation to other uv leds by16 mj cm2 fluence in this study a 3 5 6 log reduction of p aeruginosa was achieved by a dose of approximately 10 mj cm2 for all continuous light uv sources p aeruginosa results demonstrated first order inactivation over the dose range of 0 8 mj cm2 dose response curves for p aeruginosa experiments demonstrated tailing at doses above approximately 10 mj cm2 the constant light inactivation rate constants found in this study are 0 66 0 56 and 0 48 cm2 mj for 255 265 and 285 nm respectively and 0 54 cm2 mj for uv lp see table 1 these corresponded well to the one previously published study of p aeruginosa uv led rate constants which ranged from 0 51 to 0 74 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 when induced by 265 285 nm uv leds the uv lp lamp p aeruginosa rate constant corresponds to published values of 0 45 0 77 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 mirroring the continuous light studies none of the 265 nm pulsing scenarios performed significantly differently from the uv lp source all 285 nm pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly worse than the lp lamp p 0 0001 these data align with additional gram positive bacterial responses and confirm that there is no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis similarly to the e coli pulsed light response for the 285 nm uv led the 50 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv than the continuous light condition the continuous 265 nm uv led outperformed all pulsing conditions for the highest measured fluences 3 1 3 ms 2 the results for ms 2 inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are shown in fig 2 as log10 reduction as a function of uv dose ms 2 exhibited first order inactivation kinetics over the entire uv dose range tested at a dose of 40 mj cm2 ms 2 achieves log reduction values ranged from 1 to 3 lrv with 255 and 265 nm uv leds performing best and the 285 nm uv led underperforming the log linear slopes indicate that 255 and 285 nm uv leds vary significantly from the lp lamp both p values 0 0001 with the 255 nm uv led performing significantly better and the 285 nm uv led significantly underperforming the 265 nm uv led does not vary significantly from the lp lamp the significant differences between the lp uv source which emits at 254 nm and the 255 nm uv led which emits at a peak average wavelength of 258 nm can be attributed to the differences in peak emission and the band width the continuous light inactivation rate constants found in table 1 are 0 079 0 065 and 0 038 cm2 mj as induced by 255 265 and 285 nm uv leds respectively and 0 062 cm2 mj for uv lp lamp the ms 2 inactivation rate constants corresponded well to published values which ranged from 0 029 to 0 076 cm2 mj bowker et al 2011 aoyagi et al 2011 sholtes et al 2016 jenny et al 2014 simons et al 2014 oguma et al 2016 uv lp lamp ms 2 rate constant also agree well with published values which range from 0 052 to 0 094 cm2 mj beck et al 2015 2017 malayeri et al 2016 bacteriophage ms 2 pulsing results confirm the results from the bacterial microorganism none of the pulsing conditions within each wavelength source were significantly different from the relevant continuous light source for each wavelength the 265 nm pulsing scenarios did not perform significantly differently from the uv lp source and the 285 nm pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly worse than the lp lamp p 0 0001 the 10 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv than the continuous light condition for the 265 nm uv led for the highest measured fluences while the 75 duty rate resulted in the highest lrv for the 285 nm uv led 3 2 combination and sequencing of uv leds in continuous light operation mode combination and sequencing synergy experiments were also performed and their respective inactivation rate constants are summarized in table 1 no synergy was found for any microorganism nor any uv led combination the combination and sequencing experiments yielded the same dose response curves as the summation of the relative dose of each individual wavelength there was no significant difference between any of the combination or sequencing slopes when compared to the calculated equivalent contribution of the 265 and 285 nm uv leds in combination or sequence e coli p values ranged from 0 20 to 0 65 p aeruginosa from 0 49 to 0 78 and ms 2 from 0 17 to 0 62 the p aeruginosa data align with additional gram positive bacterial responses and confirm that no enhanced effect of combination or sequencing uv leds on a fluence basis these results support the findings of previous researchers who explored combined uv leds in the germicidal spectrum beck et al 2017 song et al 2019 oguma et al 2013 hull and linden 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 3 3 electrical energy per order comparison in order to better compare the uv leds and pulsing scenarios eeo was compared with various normalizations illustrated in table 2 while the 255 and 265 nm uv leds are the most efficacious uv sources on a fluence basis for e coli p aeruginosa and ms 2 the 285 nm uv led outperformed the others on an electrical basis for both the e coli and ms 2 however the electrical efficiency of the 285 nm uv led did not overcome the relative proximity of the 265 nm uv led to the peak of the action spectrum for p aeruginosa 42 the 265 nm uv led was the most efficient on an electrical basis for this bacterium this analysis does not account for the exposure time eneto normalized both the energy and time efficiency per order for each continuous light wavelength eneto λ additionally eneto 285 nm was calculated in order to compare the pulsing and continuous light conditions for both wavelengths against one standard which was the continuous 285 nm uv led due to the high output of the 285 nm uv led this was considered the basis of design in this analysis the results demonstrate that a system can be optimized to adjust for time and electrical efficiency requirements for example if optimizing electrical efficiency can be de coupled from time i e reactors with long residence times then the lowest electrical consumption conditions i e 10 duty rate can be optimal over time as identified by the lowest eeo or ratio of eeo relative to the eeo of the constant light condition for a wavelength in conditions of a distributed power supply or limited power capacity the power sub system design can be minimized with the lower power consumption conditions for example the battery or solar array can be smaller for the pulsed systems because the energy required at a constant rate power is lower over time the system will require more time for inactivation however if the electrical efficiency cannot be de coupled from time and or if the maximum power capacity is not limited identifying conditions in which eneto λ 1 can ensure the same electrical and microbial efficiency while expanding the lifetime of the uv led for example as seen in table 2 both the 90 duty rates for the e coli for the 285 nm uv leds and p aeruginosa for the 265 nm uv leds can provide an enhanced time and energy efficiency compared to the constant light condition for each wavelength eneto λ 1 while expanding the lifetime of the uv leds and decreasing the size of any associated distributed power supply or reducing energy costs this is due to the high relative inactivation efficiency of the uv led pulsing condition compared to the constant light condition however when comparing all the pulsed conditions to the constant light conditions for the 285 nm uv led additional optimization can occur the e coli and ms 2 265 nm uv led 75 duty rate condition can provide an enhanced time and energy efficiency compared to the 285 nm uv led constant light condition eneto 285 1 further extending the lifetime of the uv leds and decreasing the size of any associated distributed power supply or reducing energy costs one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that while not statistically significantly different this research and nyangaresi et al 2019 identified pulsing conditions which resulted in higher inactivation rate constants than the constant light conditions for their respective wavelengths see table 1 this slight inactivation rate constant difference combined with the device specific electrical efficiencies i e fan on constantly during pulsing resulting in improved thermal management results in enhanced electrical and time efficiencies of specific microorganisms relative to different uv led wavelengths when comparing various wavelengths together the eneto can be calculated relative to the uv led wavelength with the lowest eeo when the eneto 285 nm is calculated the relative impact of the electrical and time efficiencies of the 265 vs 285 nm uv leds are obvious the 265 nm uv led outperforms the 285 nm uv leds for e coli and ms 2 but not p aeruginosa due to the high susceptibility of this bacterium across all wavelengths 4 conclusion even with clear data illustrating the most effective uv led wavelengths and operating conditions for various microorganisms comparing such results with standardized electrical energy per order calculations can limit design engineers in optimizing their uv led devices and associated power systems while pulsing does not provide a statistically significant benefit over continuous light conditions at a specific wavelength calculating the normalized microbial inactivation electrical and time efficiency eneto can illustrate optimum pulsing conditions when eneto λ 1 this approach provides a new tool for system designers to optimize their systems for various target microorganisms over diverse wavelengths while maximizing uv led lifetime and minimizing dispersed power system

18505,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have increasing applications in the inactivation of microorganisms in water air food and on surfaces system designers currently have metrics for comparison of the microbial and energy efficiency of uv leds but these have not included a time component without including the time efficiency of a uv led neither the fluence basis nor the electrical basis of comparison clarifies which uv led wavelength and operating condition is optimal for a design space this research explores microbial inactivation of uv leds at various wavelengths under continuous and pulsing operating conditions planktonic microorganisms of relevance to public water supplies and uv system design are included e coli and ms 2 for benchmarking against previous studies and p aeruginosa which has not been studied in pulsed systems or for continuous and combined uv led wavelengths pulsing uv leds at various duty rates percent of cycle spent on and frequencies number of cycles per second does not result in a statistically significant disinfection performance difference over the continuous light operation at that respective wavelength uv leds emitting at peak

wavelength combinations low power requirements flexible design configurations pulsing and improved robustness over uv lp lamps without the mercury song et al 2016 malley 2004 beck et al 2017 aoyagi et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 bowker et al 2011 rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 uv is particularly effective against chlorine resistant pathogens including bacterial biofilm species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and protozoan parasites such as cryptosporidium clancy et al 2004 malayeri et al 2016 because microorganisms are differentially susceptible to disinfectants and there are myriad applications of disinfection i e point of entry public water systems hospital water tanks industrial applications residential point of use etc demand for new technologies and approaches for targeting specific microorganisms is high hijnen et al 2006 a growing number of studies have explored the application of uv leds in drinking water disinfection comparing uv leds to lp lamps can be done two different ways 1 on a fluence basis and 2 on an electrical basis a comparison on a fluence basis simply allows for the direct comparison of a microorganism s response to various applied fluences without incorporating any energy use into the comparison however an electrical basis comparison incorporates the amount of energy required for one order of magnitude response decrease in concentration in the log linear response region of a log reduction curve in general even if uv leds are more efficacious than lp lamps on a fluence basis uv leds will require improvements in their efficiencies to near 25 39 in order to achieve similar performance to uv lp lamps on an electrical basis beck et al 2017 while one uv led manufacturer has produced a 280 nm uv led with a reported external quantum efficiency eqe of approximately 20 and three manufacturers have achieved 10 12 eqe at approximately 280 nm current efficiencies typically range from 0 01 to 7 eqe between 220 and 285 nm kneissl et al 2019 the eqe is simply a ratio of the number of electrons applied to the uv led and the number of photons escaping this does not take into account the electrical efficiency of a device or any thermal management systems it is simply a tool used to discuss the efficiency of a uv led chip germicidal effectiveness on a fluence basis favors wavelengths which correspond closely to the peak absorbance of both nucleic acids and cellular proteins near 260 280 nm and below 230 nm respectively however effectiveness on an electrical basis favors higher intensity output uv leds würtele et al 2011 aoyagi et al 2011 oguma et al 2013 chatterley and linden 2009 on a fluence basis studies have shown that nominal 255 285 nm uv leds induce inactivation rate constants for e coli ranging from 0 15 to 0 81 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 malayeri et al 2016 oguma et al 2016 oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 with the highest values corresponding to wavelengths closest to the peak of the e coli action spectrum 266 nm beck et al 2016 the unique response of each microorganism to various uv wavelengths is due to each microbe s distinctive composition of proteins and nucleic acids this concept is referred to as the action spectrum of a microorganism sinsheimer 1954 sinha and häder 2002 minton and friedberg 1974 smith 1962 across this wavelength range the rate constants are comparable to those induced by uv lp lamps at 254 nm 0 20 0 81 cm2 mj malayeri et al 2016 rattanakul and oguma 2018 p aeruginosa inactivation by 265 285 nm uv leds induce inactivation rate constants ranging from 0 51 to 0 74 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 the wavelength range explored in previous studies does not correspond to the peak action spectrum sensitivity for p aeruginosa which peaks near 258 nm lakretz et al 2010 similar to e coli p aeruginosa uv led rate constants are comparable to those induced by uv lp lamps 0 45 0 77 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018

2014 simons et al 2014 oguma et al 2016 with higher rate constants nearer 262 nm this trend corresponds to the peak action spectrum sensitivity for ms 2 beck et al 2015 ms 2 rate constants associated with uv lp lamps emitting at 254 nm span the higher range of the uv led inactivation rate constants due to the relatively close proximity to the action spectrum peak 0 052 0 094 cm2 mj beck et al 2015 2017 malayeri et al 2016 the lowest inactivation rate constants for all microorganisms occurred at the tail end of the germicidal spectrum near 285 nm because different wavelengths can target differing critical cellular components i e proteins vs nucleic acids malley 2004 rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 falkinham et al 2015 hijnen et al 2006 applying various uv wavelengths is considered a more effective strategy than applying uv light at only one wavelength hijnen et al 2006 linden et al 2007 this concept is demonstrated in the increased efficacy of polychromatic uv medium pressure mp lamps when compared to monochromatic uv lp lamps hijnen et al 2006 malley 2004 to mimic this enhanced polychromatic effect researchers combine multiple uv led wavelengths researchers have hypothesized a synergistic effect for such wavelength combinations however no synergistic effect for microbial inactivation for any uv led wavelength combination or sequencing scenario in the uv c and uv b ranges has been documented li et al 2017 beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 song et al 2019 nyangaresi et al 2018 oguma et al 2013 however synergy was noted in two studies which include 365 nm uv a uv led exposure in addition to uv c wavelengths chevremont et al 2012 song et al 2019 combined wavelength studies have featured microorganisms such as e coli ms 2 adenovirus bacillus pumilus fecal coliforms and various indictor bacteria an additional hypothetical strategy for improved electrical efficiency of uv leds has been to pulse the radiation studies exploring pulsed uv light have been inconsistent and have relied on uv sources xenon lamps incomparable to uv leds due to the higher energy released per pulse or theoretical methods for calculating the applied fluence xenon lamps emit at approximately nine orders of magnitude higher output than uv leds resulting in enhanced inactivation due to possible multiphoton absorption by a molecule and photothermal effects on the target cell song et al 2018 one study employing pulsing uv leds calculated irradiance from a theoretical basis using the total input power and dividing it by the cross sectional area of the apparatus tran et al 2014 this approach negates the electrical efficiency of the system which is substantial and the impact of the cross sectional area normalization method is unknown but also likely substantial additional pulsed uv led studies measured irradiance with a radiometer wengraitis et al 2013 nyangaresi et al 2019 this is not an accurate method and results in unstable readings under pulsed light conditions bohrerova et al 2008 song et al 2018 in light of these issues studies regarding pulsed uv light in both food and water generally conclude that pulsed uv light is up to four to six times more effective than continuous uv light in dried food powers fine and gervais 2004 takeshita et al 2003 and 1 3 to 3 8 times more effective in water for a variety of pathogenic and surrogate viruses and bacteria bohrerova et al 2008 lamont et al 2007 j li et al 2010 wengraitis et al 2013 tran et al 2014 p aeruginosa biofilms have also been studied under pulsed xenon lamps with promising results but these results are even harder to interpret due to the compounded factors of the high intensity xenon source lack of information about the irradiance calculations and the harboring and protecting of microorganisms inside the biofilm matrix garvey et al 2015 the one study exploring e coli and ms 2 which accurately measured irradiance with chemical actinometry applied a varied duty rate percent of one cycle that the light is on and frequency number of cycles per second of pulsed uv led light the authors concluded that there was no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis song et al 2018 confirming these results for e coli a recent study employed much tighter electrical and thermal controls but still calculated the theoretical irradiance instead of measuring it with actinometery nyangaresi et al 2019 the design space for uv led drinking water reactors is large and increasing as uv led manufacturing technology and science improves light intensity is increasing across all wavelengths and of particular interest at highly germicidal wavelengths as a result environmental engineers researchers and system designers are in need of operation specific microbial inactivation data capable of informing system and research design this research addresses current needs in comparing wavelength efficacy and operational conditions

inactivation of vegetative bacteria and virus surrogates in drinking water using three representative indicator microorganisms e coli p aeruginosa and bacteriophage ms 2 these comparisons are explored both through a fluence basis and an electrical basis 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism propagation and assay 2 1 1 bacterial preparation for uv disinfection experiments exponential phase cultures of e coli k 12 atcc r 29425 were grown in sterile nutrient broth 3 nb bd difco and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442 were grown in sterile luria bertani broth lb bd difco each bacterium were grown from frozen stocks stored in 20 by volume glycerol exponential phase bacterial cultures were pelletized by centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min the supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet was re suspended by vortexing in phosphate buffered saline pbs this was repeated three times to wash the growth media from the cells after the pellet was resuspended the third time the sample was sonicated for 30 s at 82 watts to disaggregate the cells örmeci and linden 2005 this bacterial suspension was 10 fold serially diluted in pbs to achieve a uvt at 254 of 93 95 bolton and linden 2003 and bacteria concentration of 5 106 cfu ml the absorbance of the 10 fold diluted suspension at 254 nm was measured to estimate the initial bacteria concentration and to determine the required times of irradiation to achieve a predetermined range of uv doses to achieve target levels as log10 of inactivation for the low pressure lamps while an absorbance scan of 200 400 nm was taken to inform the required times of irradiation for the uv leds 2 1 2 ms 2 sample preparation for disinfection experiments bacteriophage ms 2 atcc 15597 b1 were propagated and enumerated using the epa 1602 single layer agar method epa 2001 with e coli famp host atcc 700891 ms 2 stock was thawed and 10 fold serially diluted in pbs to achieve a uvt at 254 of 95 97 the absorbance at 254 nm of the pbs diluted sample was measured to determine the required times of irradiation to achieve a predetermined range of uv doses for the low pressure lamps while an absorbance scan of 200 400 nm was taken to determine the required times of irradiation for the uv leds 2 2 collimated beam set up 2 2 1 uv low pressure mercury arc lamp the collimated beam experimental apparatus consisted of two 15 watt low pressure mercury arc lamps sankyo denki co ltd japan which emitted nearly monochromatic uv radiation at 253 7 nm the lamp was suspended horizontally directly above a metal box with two equal circular holes vertically aligned and separated by 30 cm bolton and linden 2003 bolton et al 2015 lawal et al 2017 a stir plate was positioned directly under the openings for continuous stirring of samples the uv irradiance before and after each trial was measured with a calibrated radiometer il 1700 photodetector sed 240 and w diffuser international light newburyport mass by placing the detector at the sample centerline and the detector s calibrated plane at the same level as the water surface of the irradiated samples 2 2 2 uv led device the pearlbeam triple wavelength ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led research device purchased from aquisense erlanger kentucky contains the following features uv leds of three different nominal wavelengths 255 nm 265 nm and 285 nm power control thermal management and a housing assemblage kheyrandish et al 2018a each wavelength can be operated independently and or simultaneously and pulsing can be applied at five duty rates 10 25 50 75 and 90 and three frequencies 1 10 and 100 hz for each wavelength three uv leds of each wavelength are oriented spatially to distribute light on a target surface such as the water in an exposure vessel kheyrandish et al 2018a b the led spectra measured by aquisense with their in house integrating sphere and verified with a calibrated maya 2000 pro spectrometer ocean optics dunedin fl exhibited peak wavelength emissions at 258 267 5 and 281 5 nm for the 255 265 and 285 nm leds respectively when the 265 and 285 nm leds are operated simultaneously the 265 nm uv leds comprise 33 of the total irradiance and the 285 nm leds comprise the remaining 67 beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 pulsing studies were conducted for 265 and 285 nm uv leds only the 255 nm uv led was omitted due to the low relative irradiance resulting in excessively long exposure time all uv equipment were allowed to warm up for 15 min prior to each experiment the led module was configured to be oriented directly above an irradiation vessel on a stir plate for continuous stirring of samples kheyrandish et al 2017 2018a b the uv irradiance before and after each trial was measured with a calibrated radiometer in order to ensure that the average irradiance over the course of the experiment was within 5 of the initial irradiance epa 2006 ilt5000 photodetector sed 240 w diffuser international light newburyport mass the detector was placed at the sample centerline with the detector s calibrated plane at the same height as the water surface of the irradiated samples because uv leds are a polychromatic light source the sensitivity of the radiometer calibration data supplied by international light must be adjusted to the relative lamp emission rle of the leds for each uv source the radiometer sensitivity was adjusted to the actual weighted average peak wavelength bolton et al 2015 2 3 disinfection for each uv source at each wavelength and for the simultaneous 265 285 nm uv leds four or five unique uv dose levels were evaluated in triplicate to generate dose response curves for each microorganism e coli and p aeruginosa experiments terminated at 16 mj cm2 due to the rapid inactivation of these microorganisms and the achievement of 4 log10 reduction by this point additionally since nsf standard 55 nsf 2012 requires 16 mj cm2 for secondary disinfection this represents the target dose for these experiments ms 2 experiments terminated at a dose of 60 mj cm2 due to the relatively slower inactivation kinetics and the desire to best define those kinetics furthermore 40 mj cm2 represents the nsf standard 55 dose required for primary disinfection stirred suspensions of 4 ml 0 5 cm sample depth were irradiated in 3 5 cm diameter dishes at distances of 39 7 49 7 cm from the lp uv source irradiance was measured at the water surface with a calibrated radiometer incident lp irradiance varied from 0 05 mw cm2 at the farthest distance with only one lamp on to 0 638 mw cm2 at the nearest distance with both lamps on for the uv led experiments incident irradiance ranged from 0 045 to 0 568 mw cm2 due to the order of magnitude variability in intensity of the light emitted between the different uv leds stirred suspensions of 19 ml 0 9 cm sample depth were irradiated in 5 4 cm diameter dishes at distances of 4 6 cm from the uv led source average uv doses were determined as described previously by bolton and linden 2003 by adjusting the applicable variables in the spreadsheet germicidal fluence uv dose calculations for a low pressure uv lamp obtained from bolton photosciences inc edmonton alberta canada the petri factor which represents the uniformity of irradiance across the surface of the sample were consistently 0 99 for uv lp exposures and they ranged from 0 9 to 0 95 for uv led exposures incident irradiance was calculated utilizing the iodide iodate ki actinometry song et al 2018 protocol detailed by bolton et at 2011 bolton et al 2011 with quantum yield data from literature goldstein and joseph 2008 rahn et al 2003 because the uv fluence is the product of the average uv irradiance and time the pre determined fluence was achieved by adjusting the exposure time for each sample using a manual shutter post exposure all bacterial samples were processed 10 fold serially diluted and plated immediately to prevent potential photorepair because p aeruginosa is highly photoreactive the sample is 10 fold serially diluted and plated as quickly as possible in the dark with only a red light source for visibility 700 1000 nm fluences were applied in random order and repeated in triplicate 2 4 enumeration and statistical analysis microorganisms were assayed using spot or drop plate methods beck et al 2009 for each dilution in spot plating 10 spots of 10 μl each were applied to nb agar e coli plates lb agar p aeruginosa plates or typtic soy agar plates with host e coli famp with streptomycin ampicillin ms 2 after drying of spots plates were inverted and incubated for 18 h at 37 c colonies and plaques were counted and bacterial and bacteriophage concentrations respectively expressed as colony forming units cfu ml and plaque forming units pfu ml at least three replicate samples were assayed at each uv dose undergoing statistical analysis microbial reduction at each dose was expressed as log10 n0 nx where n0 is the initial concentration in cfu ml or pfu ml in the control sample without uv exposure and nx is the concentration in cfu ml or pfu ml after exposure to dose x linear region data are presented with error bars representing one standard deviation for statistical analysis of the dose response curves linear regression analysis using least squares fitting technique in graphpad graphpad prism 7 01 la jolla ca was performed comparing the slopes and intercepts of the linear region of the microbial dose response curves using the parameters log10 nx n0 as a function of uv dose mj cm2 fitted lines were compared both line slopes and intercepts using a two tailed independent paired t test where significance was defined as α 0 05 this strategy compares efficacy on a fluence basis additionally log inactivation curves were weighted with the action spectrum of each microorganisms and compared beck et al 2015 2017 synergy for combined wavelengths was tested by first determining the relative contribution of each led to the total emission spectrum of the combined leds for example the 265 nm led contributed 33 3 of the emission spectrum while the 285 nm led contributed 66 7 of the emission spectrum of the two leds combined once the relative contribution was determined the dose contribution of each uv led was weighted to the relative contribution of the combined emission spectrum beck et al 2017 hull and linden 2018 for example for a target dose of 30 mj cm2 10 mj cm2 would be contributed by the 265 nm uv led and 20 mj cm2 would be contributed by the 285 nm uv led the results were summed together and compared directly to the dose response results of the combined 265 285 nm leds 2 5 electrical energy efficiency in order to compare the electrical efficiency of the pulsing conditions relative to uv lp lamps or each other the electrical energy per order e eo is calculated for each condition e eo represents the amount of electrical energy required to reduce by one order of magnitude the concentration of a microorganism and can be seen in equation 1 sharpless and linden 2005 beck et al 2017 1 e eo a 3 6 10 3 v k c w f where e eo is the electrical energy per order of magnitude kwh m3 order a is the surface area cm2 of the target volume 3 6 103 is the unit conversion constant v is the volume of target sample ml k is the fluence based inactivation rate constant cm2 mj from the linear region of the log reduction curve wf is the water factor and c is the wall plug efficiency the wall plug efficiency is calculated by dividing the radiant flux mw calculated through actinometry by the input power to the device mw measured with an electricity usage meter p3 international corporation kill a watt p4400 meter new york ny ratios were calculated of the lowest eeo values to the eeo of each pulsing scenario eeo ledcont eeo ledpulsed however this does not take into account the amount of time required for the exposures uv led pulsing requires longer exposure times to produce the equivalent fluence of a continuous light source because the light pulses do not emit at a higher intensity than the continuous source pulsed exposure time is increased inversely relative to the duty rate for example if a light source was pulsed at a 10 duty rate then by definition it was only on 10 of each cycle and therefore the exposure time required was approximately 10x longer than the constant light condition to account for the time efficiency the ratio of eeo ledcont eeo ledpulsed was normalized to the relative ratio of the pulsed exposure time to the constant exposure time tpulsed tcont because theoretically the products of the electrical energy and time of each condition would be equal under all conditions if there were no benefit of pulsing i e eeo ledcont tcont eeo ledpulsed tpulsed this variable represents the efficiency of both energy and time per order and of each pulsed condition relative to the relevant uv led continuous light condition this variable will be called eneto for normalized energy and time efficiency per order as shown in equation 2 2 e neto e eo l e d c o n t e eo l e d p u l s e d t pulsed t cont e neto facilitates an improved comparison of the energy efficiency per order per time of exposure when normalized against the constant light conditions for each wavelength 3 results and discussion results are presented by microorganism class and compare log reduction curves of the uv sources lp lamps and uv leds graphically and statistically dose response curves represent the data as log reduction log10 n0 nx as a function of uv dose mj cm2 fig 1 all data are compiled in two graphs 1 all uv led wavelengths and pulsing scenarios with a non linear four parameter curve fit to the data and 2 the linear region of all uv led wavelengths and pulsing scenarios with linear regression lines fit to the data the first hypothesis tested whether or not the frequencies within each duty rate resulted in different microbial inactivation for each microorganism the electronics of the system were designed to hold equal the integrated optical output power of an led driven at any frequency 1 10 and 100 hz for each duty rate and wavelength because of the theoretical equality of the irradiance of all frequencies within each duty rate for each wavelength and due to some testing conditions duty rate and frequency combinations were omitted when exposure time was greater than 45 min or less than 20 s the equal irradiance per duty rate hypothesis was tested with paired t tests α 0 05 all tests under all conditions indicated that the frequency data within each duty rate for each microorganism and wavelength were not statistically significantly different and therefore could be treated as replicates this reduces the number of variables and simplifies the analysis for the remaining analysis only duty rates will be addressed as all frequency data are simply treated as more replicates within each duty rate and wavelength this was further verified by decreasing the frequency of the 10 duty rate 265 and 285 nm uv leds to 0 33 and 0 5 hz for e coli there was no difference found between the e coli inactivation at all frequencies for comparable duty rates and wavelengths 3 1 continuous and pulsed uv led inactivation of microorganisms 3 1 1 e coli k 12 the results for e coli k 12 inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are summarized in fig 1 as curves fit from log10 reduction data as a function of uv dose continuous and pulsed light four parameter curves for the entire fluence range tested 0 16 mj cm2 are included in fig 1 for both bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa curve fitting parameters and the associated r2 values can all be found in the supplemental information data points are not included in these figures due to the high number of data points present ms 2 data and curves are present in fig 2 illustrating the first order inactivation kinetics region for all microorganisms data points illustrating the mean and standard deviation are included for all microorganisms in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 1 at a dose of 16 mj cm2 e coli k 12 achieves log reduction values lrv ranging from 4 to 6 with the 265 nm uv led performing best with a 5 5 6 lrv and uv lp underperforming at a 4 lrv these results correspond well to e coli inactivation results for various uv sources reported by previous investigators sommer et al 2000 hijnen et al 2006 oguma et al 2013 e coli k 12 results demonstrated first order inactivation over the dose range of 0 8 mj cm2 for the 255 and 265 nm uv leds while first order inactivation kinetics were experienced from 8 to 12 mj cm2 for the 285 nm uv leds departures from first order reaction kinetics in uv disinfection of e coli have been previously reported at low fluences for various e coli strains sommer et al 2000 dose response curves for e coli k 12 experiments demonstrated tailing at doses above approximately 10 mj cm2 for the 255 and 265 nm uv leds and uv lp sources as the limits of detection were near the slopes of the first order inactivation range are shown in fig 2 and indicate that for e coli all uv leds 255 265 and 285 nm vary significantly from the uv lp lamp p 0 0001 0 0001 and 0 0026 respectively with the 255 and 265 nm uv led preforming significantly better and the 285 nm uv led significantly underperforming this corresponds to the findings of other researchers bowker et al 2011 the constant light inactivation rate constants found in this study are 0 58 0 77 and 0 40 cm2 mj for 255 265 and 285 nm respectively and 0 50 cm2 mj for the uv lp lamp table 1 these data corresponded well to previously published literature in which e coli uv led rate constants ranged from 0 15 to 0 81 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 malayeri et al 2016 oguma et al 2016 oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 and when inactivated by uv lp lamps at 254 nm ranged from 0 20 to 0 81 cm2 mj malayeri et al 2016 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the differing response to variable wavelengths is expected for all microorganisms the highest rate constants correspond to the uv led wavelength nearest the relative peak of each microorganisms action spectrum e coli peaks near 266 nm beck et al 2016 p aeruginosa peaks near 258 nm lakretz et al 2010 and ms 2 peaks near 262 nm beck et al 2015 when the fluence is weighted by the action spectrum of each respective microorganism there is no statistically significant difference in the linear dose response curve between all wavelengths of uv leds pulsing studies were conducted for the 265 and 285 nm uv leds paralleling the constant light results all 265 nm uv led pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly better than the uv lp lamp all p values 0 0001 when comparing the first order inactivation region as shown in fig 2 all 285 nm uv led pulsing scenarios underperformed the uv lp lamp with statistical significance all p values 0 0001 none of the pulsing conditions within each wavelength source were significantly different from the continuous light source for each wavelength this applied to all microorganisms for example the inactivation due to the most efficacious pulsing condition for the 265 nm uv led 90 duty rate was not significantly different from that of the continuous 265 nm uv led this applied to the least efficacious pulsing condition for the 265 nm uv led 10 duty rate when compared to the continuous 265 nm light as well these data confirm the results of a previous pulsed uv led study with actinometry measured irradiance which concluded no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis song et al 2018 however while the inactivation rate constants did not vary statistically significantly the 75 and 90 duty rate pulsing conditions did result in a higher lrv after 10 mj cm2 than the continuous light 265 nm uv led for the 285 nm uv led the 50 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv after a fluence of approximately 10 mj cm2 as well these data mirror the pulsed uv led results found by nyangaresi nyangaresi et al 2019 the similar response of microorganisms to pulsing and continuous light is likely due to dose reciprocity which states that biological impacts of a specific uv dose are directly proportional to the total dose delivered irrespective of the regime in which it is applied sommer et al 1998 additionally cellular inactivation and repair mechanisms take place over time horizons defined by nanoseconds as opposed to the centisecond time scale of reliable uv led pulsing harm 1980 salcedo et al 2007 3 1 2 p aeruginosa the results for p aeruginosa inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are summarized in fig 1 as log10 reduction as a function of uv dose at a dose of 16 mj cm2 p aeruginosa achieves log10 reduction values ranging from 4 5 to 6 lrv with the 255 nm uv led performing best and the 285 nm uv led underperforming as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the slopes of the linear region indicate that neither 255 nor 265 nm uv led sources are significantly different from each other the 265 nm uv led does not perform significantly differently from the uv lp lamp however the 255 nm and the 285 nm uv leds do vary significantly from the lp lamp p 0 0019 and 0 0002 respectively with the 255 nm uv led performing better than the lp lamp and the 285 nm uv led underperforming through the linear region however this difference only persists through the linear region the 285 nm uv led results in approximately equivalent log10 inactivation to other uv leds by16 mj cm2 fluence in this study a 3 5 6 log reduction of p aeruginosa was achieved by a dose of approximately 10 mj cm2 for all continuous light uv sources p aeruginosa results demonstrated first order inactivation over the dose range of 0 8 mj cm2 dose response curves for p aeruginosa experiments demonstrated tailing at doses above approximately 10 mj cm2 the constant light inactivation rate constants found in this study are 0 66 0 56 and 0 48 cm2 mj for 255 265 and 285 nm respectively and 0 54 cm2 mj for uv lp see table 1 these corresponded well to the one previously published study of p aeruginosa uv led rate constants which ranged from 0 51 to 0 74 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 when induced by 265 285 nm uv leds the uv lp lamp p aeruginosa rate constant corresponds to published values of 0 45 0 77 cm2 mj rattanakul and oguma 2018 malayeri et al 2016 mirroring the continuous light studies none of the 265 nm pulsing scenarios performed significantly differently from the uv lp source all 285 nm pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly worse than the lp lamp p 0 0001 these data align with additional gram positive bacterial responses and confirm that there is no enhanced effect of pulsed irradiation when compared to continuous light on a fluence basis similarly to the e coli pulsed light response for the 285 nm uv led the 50 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv than the continuous light condition the continuous 265 nm uv led outperformed all pulsing conditions for the highest measured fluences 3 1 3 ms 2 the results for ms 2 inactivation by both uv lp lamps and uv leds are shown in fig 2 as log10 reduction as a function of uv dose ms 2 exhibited first order inactivation kinetics over the entire uv dose range tested at a dose of 40 mj cm2 ms 2 achieves log reduction values ranged from 1 to 3 lrv with 255 and 265 nm uv leds performing best and the 285 nm uv led underperforming the log linear slopes indicate that 255 and 285 nm uv leds vary significantly from the lp lamp both p values 0 0001 with the 255 nm uv led performing significantly better and the 285 nm uv led significantly underperforming the 265 nm uv led does not vary significantly from the lp lamp the significant differences between the lp uv source which emits at 254 nm and the 255 nm uv led which emits at a peak average wavelength of 258 nm can be attributed to the differences in peak emission and the band width the continuous light inactivation rate constants found in table 1 are 0 079 0 065 and 0 038 cm2 mj as induced by 255 265 and 285 nm uv leds respectively and 0 062 cm2 mj for uv lp lamp the ms 2 inactivation rate constants corresponded well to published values which ranged from 0 029 to 0 076 cm2 mj bowker et al 2011 aoyagi et al 2011 sholtes et al 2016 jenny et al 2014 simons et al 2014 oguma et al 2016 uv lp lamp ms 2 rate constant also agree well with published values which range from 0 052 to 0 094 cm2 mj beck et al 2015 2017 malayeri et al 2016 bacteriophage ms 2 pulsing results confirm the results from the bacterial microorganism none of the pulsing conditions within each wavelength source were significantly different from the relevant continuous light source for each wavelength the 265 nm pulsing scenarios did not perform significantly differently from the uv lp source and the 285 nm pulsing scenarios performed statistically significantly worse than the lp lamp p 0 0001 the 10 and 75 duty rate conditions resulted in a higher lrv than the continuous light condition for the 265 nm uv led for the highest measured fluences while the 75 duty rate resulted in the highest lrv for the 285 nm uv led 3 2 combination and sequencing of uv leds in continuous light operation mode combination and sequencing synergy experiments were also performed and their respective inactivation rate constants are summarized in table 1 no synergy was found for any microorganism nor any uv led combination the combination and sequencing experiments yielded the same dose response curves as the summation of the relative dose of each individual wavelength there was no significant difference between any of the combination or sequencing slopes when compared to the calculated equivalent contribution of the 265 and 285 nm uv leds in combination or sequence e coli p values ranged from 0 20 to 0 65 p aeruginosa from 0 49 to 0 78 and ms 2 from 0 17 to 0 62 the p aeruginosa data align with additional gram positive bacterial responses and confirm that no enhanced effect of combination or sequencing uv leds on a fluence basis these results support the findings of previous researchers who explored combined uv leds in the germicidal spectrum beck et al 2017 song et al 2019 oguma et al 2013 hull and linden 2018 nyangaresi et al 2018 3 3 electrical energy per order comparison in order to better compare the uv leds and pulsing scenarios eeo was compared with various normalizations illustrated in table 2 while the 255 and 265 nm uv leds are the most efficacious uv sources on a fluence basis for e coli p aeruginosa and ms 2 the 285 nm uv led outperformed the others on an electrical basis for both the e coli and ms 2 however the electrical efficiency of the 285 nm uv led did not overcome the relative proximity of the 265 nm uv led to the peak of the action spectrum for p aeruginosa 42 the 265 nm uv led was the most efficient on an electrical basis for this bacterium this analysis does not account for the exposure time eneto normalized both the energy and time efficiency per order for each continuous light wavelength eneto λ additionally eneto 285 nm was calculated in order to compare the pulsing and continuous light conditions for both wavelengths against one standard which was the continuous 285 nm uv led due to the high output of the 285 nm uv led this was considered the basis of design in this analysis the results demonstrate that a system can be optimized to adjust for time and electrical efficiency requirements for example if optimizing electrical efficiency can be de coupled from time i e reactors with long residence times then the lowest electrical consumption conditions i e 10 duty rate can be optimal over time as identified by the lowest eeo or ratio of eeo relative to the eeo of the constant light condition for a wavelength in conditions of a distributed power supply or limited power capacity the power sub system design can be minimized with the lower power consumption conditions for example the battery or solar array can be smaller for the pulsed systems because the energy required at a constant rate power is lower over time the system will require more time for inactivation however if the electrical efficiency cannot be de coupled from time and or if the maximum power capacity is not limited identifying conditions in which eneto λ 1 can ensure the same electrical and microbial efficiency while expanding the lifetime of the uv led for example as seen in table 2 both the 90 duty rates for the e coli for the 285 nm uv leds and p aeruginosa for the 265 nm uv leds can provide an enhanced time and energy efficiency compared to the constant light condition for each wavelength eneto λ 1 while expanding the lifetime of the uv leds and decreasing the size of any associated distributed power supply or reducing energy costs this is due to the high relative inactivation efficiency of the uv led pulsing condition compared to the constant light condition however when comparing all the pulsed conditions to the constant light conditions for the 285 nm uv led additional optimization can occur the e coli and ms 2 265 nm uv led 75 duty rate condition can provide an enhanced time and energy efficiency compared to the 285 nm uv led constant light condition eneto 285 1 further extending the lifetime of the uv leds and decreasing the size of any associated distributed power supply or reducing energy costs one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that while not statistically significantly different this research and nyangaresi et al 2019 identified pulsing conditions which resulted in higher inactivation rate constants than the constant light conditions for their respective wavelengths see table 1 this slight inactivation rate constant difference combined with the device specific electrical efficiencies i e fan on constantly during pulsing resulting in improved thermal management results in enhanced electrical and time efficiencies of specific microorganisms relative to different uv led wavelengths when comparing various wavelengths together the eneto can be calculated relative to the uv led wavelength with the lowest eeo when the eneto 285 nm is calculated the relative impact of the electrical and time efficiencies of the 265 vs 285 nm uv leds are obvious the 265 nm uv led outperforms the 285 nm uv leds for e coli and ms 2 but not p aeruginosa due to the high susceptibility of this bacterium across all wavelengths 4 conclusion even with clear data illustrating the most effective uv led wavelengths and operating conditions for various microorganisms comparing such results with standardized electrical energy per order calculations can limit design engineers in optimizing their uv led devices and associated power systems while pulsing does not provide a statistically significant benefit over continuous light conditions at a specific wavelength calculating the normalized microbial inactivation electrical and time efficiency eneto can illustrate optimum pulsing conditions when eneto λ 1 this approach provides a new tool for system designers to optimize their systems for various target microorganisms over diverse wavelengths while maximizing uv led lifetime and minimizing dispersed power system

18506,piped water supply in guwahati covers less than 30 of the city s population for which the government of india proposes four new water supply projects but astonishingly they faced vehement public protest the reason for the protest was attributed to lack of trust and need of public representation in the governing body besides public participation is not a mandatory clause in water supply projects and hence was not carried out a priori to the project implementation in an effort to address this the present study aims to develop a framework incorporating public participation as a mandatory clause in water supply projects in doing so secondary data was collected from studies worldwide on public participation in water supply projects and analyzed to identify critical success factors csfs south west guwahati water supply project was taken up as a study area and a semi structured questionnaire was designed to generate primary data on public participation thematic analysis was employed to identify the csfs from primary data influencing public participation in the project finally a framework was formulated following the identified csfs from primary and secondary data and the review of various theories on public participation the framework is developed to achieve effective public participation in six levels viz inform educate consult involve collaborate and capacity building each level satisfies a set of csfs and ultimately all csfs addresses to deemphasize the effects of disincentives in water supply projects further the framework was validated by 16 experts and received an exceptionally copacetic rating for all six validation aspects copacetic expert ratings demonstrated appropriateness objectivity replicability practicality reliability and suitability of framework for water supply projects graphical abstract image 1 keywords water supply scheme groundwater quality awareness public participation framework thematic analysis critical success factor 1 introduction the urban water infrastructure facilities and services are dwindling worldwide under rapid population growth rural urban migration and unplanned spatial expansion ahmed et al 2008 the stringent environmental regulations inadequacy of technical knowledge on project differences of opinion political interventions perception of risk among stakeholders and social conflicts aroused on the grounds of dissimilarities in values beliefs and motivations are preventing convergence of water supply projects such scenarios public and authority attitudes cause irreversible project damage through stakeholder secondary protests lawsuits project relocation indefinite postponement and even cancellation huang et al 2015 the secondary stakeholders individuals community and its advocates without any formal official relation with the company i e public possess little power and are mostly underestimated or neglected in commonplace cleland and ireland 2007 however recent changes in the governmental policies on delegation and decentralization in the service sector and increased non governmental organizations have rightly pointed the need of public inclusion as an important stakeholder in regulating decision making process jami and walsh 2014 until the end of the 19th century decision making through public participation process was more of a unilateral regulatory verdict coining the term public participation theory arnstein 1969 stated that public participation activities are at the rungs of informing consultation and tokenism levels the citizens at these levels may indeed hear and be heard but under these conditions they lack the power to ensure that the authorities will note their views the top level of citizen power is the most powerful in the ladder ensuring consideration of public views in response to the limitations of arnstein s ladder for dispute resolution connor 1988 proposed dispute solving and flexible seven staged ladder having two stages of mediation and litigation in later years however public involvement principles based on the democratic social mobilization and social exchange theories achieved some success howell et al 1987 the focus thus has been on building a close public issue relationship for improved public participation and healthy administrative system citizens acquaintanceship king et al 1998 further research concentrated on the rationalization of public conflicts beierle 1999 and exploring mitigation measures leeuwis 2000 in his study believed that participatory approaches are rarely conflict free and often suffers from the inability to handle conflicts it was suggested to be solved by informing educating the public and incorporating public values and or choices in decision making to promote trust in the institutions iap2 2014 all these efforts to engage public were for higher public acceptance of infrastructure projects and were monotonous non comparable and scattered hence international association for public participation iap2 developed spectrum focusing public engagement in decisions where the government retains final authority but may inform consult involve collaborate in the decision making process iap2 2014 apart from theories on public participation studies from various parts of the world also believed and suggested a crucial role of public secondary stakeholders as a potential menace for disruption to an infrastructure project development olander and landin 2008 di maddaloni and davis 2017 public opposition due to various factor concerns and or considerations has been one of the leading reasons for the failure of infrastructure projects belout and gauvreau 2004 as a result of inefficient public participation evidences of the failure of water supply projects with massive public opposition are copious davis 2005 although there are ample efforts to develop theories enhancing public participation for timely completion of infrastructure projects and avoid public opposition but the studies on development of a framework to achieve the same are in a nascent stage and are particularly lacking in the water sector in this study unpleasant past experiences and their anecdotal evidences are studied to gather identify principles critical success factors csfs for better and easy implementation of decisions attempts are made to come with a decision that reflects public interests requirements values and can include the apprehensible public suggestion in the view of the need of water supply sector the study aims to develop a framework built on theories of public involvement and guidance of professional water experts for integration analysis and public deliberation in decision making the framework also ensures long term sustainability of the project through the incorporation of public participation in operation and maintenance o m phase of the project in order to achieve this a qualitative research approach has been adopted to study an upcoming water treatment plant wtp in guwahati the csfs from secondary and primary data were identified and the framework was developed considering identified csfs and theories on public participation finally the quality of the research outcomes was assessed by validating framework through experts interview the validation was performed based on validation aspects such as degree of appropriateness objectivity replicability and overall reliability 2 materials and methods the case of an upcoming water treatment plant wtp was considered in an attempt to achieve the above mentioned objective the existing wtps in guwahati india serves only 30 population with compromised quality of treated water however the area has brimming groundwater resource at a shallow depth of 2 4 m thereby encouraging its utilization das and goswami 2013 despite contaminated groundwater reports and benevolent efforts from the government in the institution of such wtp for drinking water supply the project has been facing wide public opposition protests since the start of construction works joy et al 2017 publications reported that the rationale for public opposition were relating to issues on public participation tariff disclosure and information sharing on ownership of the project government or private the assam tribune 2013 the telegraph 2013 this underscored the lack of guidelines from the government over conduct of public participation in water supply projects and highlighted the need for framework development framework is descriptive in nature and essentially include multiple realities formed by personal views context and meaning the qualitative research methodology was adopted to provide a detailed description of the views beliefs and meanings for this study primary and secondary data were collected and used as the source for research inquiry in three steps in step 1 secondary data was collected from existing studies on public participation in water supply projects and analyzed to identify csfs for efficient public involvement timely completion and increased public acceptance of projects in step 2 a semi structured questionnaire interview was designed to gather primary data in south west guwahati water supply project and thematic analysis was employed the sample size the number of experts to be interviewed was determined using the tool of saturation in qualitative research there is no hard and fast rule for getting a right sample size saunders et al 2018 in the present study saturation level was achieved in 10 interviews the expert selection was based on a combination of referral and chain or snowball technique the experts and policymakers decision holders were reached through proper channel in order to incorporate their views in the framework the list of the selected experts who had participated in the study is shown in table 1 the expert s interview questionnaire comprised of two parts part a focused on gathering information relating to the expert s demographic data background and area of expertise the part b was so designed such that all 9 numbers csf identified from the secondary data were included in the questionnaire along with the various aspects of public participation in the present study area the aspects were legislations laws related to public participation in water supply projects actual practice of public participation analysis processing of public views obstacles for public participation with reference to study area relevance of groundwater quality and identified csfs in the study area the thematic analysis of the primary data was undertaken as suggested by braun and clarke 2006 in the first phase familiarizing with data was achieved by multiple readings and listening of the interview transcripts and original interview audio recordings the primary recorded data were transcribed and imported into nvivo 11 software a computer assisted qualitative data analysis software caqdas the transcribed data were scrutinized read through and segments of interest were highlighted and noted in the second phase the data items were again reviewed to generate initial codes with features of interest across the complete data set gathering relevant data to each code in the third phase codes were given taken under various potential themes gathering all data relevant to each potential theme the fourth phase commenced with an iterative process of changing eliminating adding and re categorizing the data set to capture the essence of the phenomenon under investigation to prepare the pre final list of codes and finally merged into a single theme to study patterns amongst them in the fifth phase the themes were further defined and refined for the analysis the sixth phase began with the set of fully worked out themes and involved the final analysis the final task of thematic analysis was achieved with the writing up of the report with the data in a way to convince the reader of the analysis braun and clarke 2006 in step 3 the framework was formulated following the identified csfs from primary and secondary data and the review of various theories on public participation in order to ensure that the framework is in line with the designed objective and professional uses retrospection on various validation aspects such as degree of appropriateness degree of objectivity degree of replicability and overall reliability were performed this was followed by a face to face questionnaire survey the relevant validation aspects were also selected in a similar validation process by ibrahim et al 2015 the questionnaire template for framework validation comprised of three sections the first section explained the purpose of the survey highlighting the motive of the interview background information about the research and instructions for completing the surveys in the second section a brief description of the developed framework was provided and the third section focused on the framework validation scoring sheet along with the guideline for validation the extent to which the framework has fulfilled the six validation aspects has been recorded on a scale of 1 5 table 2 shows the responses concerning the extent of satisfaction for every validation aspect based on a scoring scale of 1 5 where one represented poor and five represented excellent 3 results and discussion 3 1 csfs for public participation analysis of secondary data collection of secondary data was aimed at identifying csfs of public participation to ensure successful implementation of water supply projects the analysis of secondary data identified transparency communication public involvement effective public participation contract design the certainty of water pricing and tariff review as significant csfs for successful implementation of water supply projects it also manifested ways of enhancing public participation such as multiparty planning mediation and negotiation with the public chen and wikstrom 2010 in many projects the causes for dissatisfaction and public conflict resistance were found to be grounded on issues of ineffective public participation involvement and fear of the increase in tariff due to private sector involvement ameyaw and chan 2015 easter and hearne 1995 it has been observed from a public participation program for a primary health care project in cisne dos ecuador that the project was terminated after six years of its execution due to non involvement of the public leaders in the design stage of the project the cause for this was attributed to ambiguity complex nature in setting up the responsibilities of the public leaders further the leaders were not paid for their aid in the community services and later they demanded payment thereby creating unrest and dispute moser and sollis 1991 other reasons for the failure of the projects include weak regulatory and monitoring regime tariff uncertainty and delayed or non payment of bills ameyaw and chan 2015 review of many failed projects indicated that projects faced local opposition in its initial stages and later based on input from the public the authority made commitments to redesigned the project such step helped to change public perception active public engagement the embodiment of public views suggestions in decision making upsurging public acceptance and success of the project garfì and ferrer 2011 whereas public involvement in decision making was found to be dependent on household satisfaction and acceptance of the project prokopy 2005 it has been concluded from this study that in order to enhance public acceptance organizing public gathering hearing for namesake will not enhance public participation it was further concluded that higher levels of participation are associated with good governance measured by having a local organization and transparency in addition necessary institutional arrangements for participation will be required to ensure effective public participation watson and jagannathan 1995 it was also noticed that public acceptance could be improved by information disclosure resident supervision and residents participation in decision making zhenhua 2013 a study from india revealed that reforms in public participation process are being carried out in india based on four cardinal principles viz awareness generation transparency community participation and social auditing naidu 2002 however the cases of failed water projects highlighted that these principles are either not effective enough or not being followed effectively for example a water supply project in india latur aurangabad mysore had faced massive public protest and was eventually terminated world bank 2014 table 3 summarizes the csf for the water supply project public involvement was found to be an important csf coded by the highest number of sources i e 12 times other csfs were viz transparency communication timeliness information on the project regulatory governance public influence tariff certainty and privatization table 4 provides a brief description of these csfs these nine csfs were found to have a significant bearing on public participation in most of the water supply projects thereby indicating that these factors need to be considered to reduce public disapproval of the water supply project 3 2 experts interview analysis of primary data the responses from the experts were coded through thematic analysis of qualitative data the analysis evolved eleven thematic codes themes the themes identified from interviews were concurrent or closely matched with the csfs identified from the secondary data out of these eleven themes eight themes were found to be common with csfs obtained from secondary data namely communication information on the project public involvement public influence privatization regulatory governance timeliness transparency whereas availability of water awareness on household groundwater and rewards incentives were the additional themes obtained from the primary data expert interview there were multiple individual and commonly occurring themes pointed out by one or more interviewees and referred by various researchers table 5 table 5 summarizes the themes along with the frequency of occurrence number of times an expert refers to the particular theme each of the csfs is discussed in detail for its relevance in the case of south west guwahati project 3 2 1 availability of water according to r03 one of the many reasons for lack of participation in south west guwahati is an abundance of groundwater in many regions the public seldom faces water shortage in order to opt for an alternate source of water most of the places in guwahati people do not face water shortage that s why i think at times they become reluctant towards water supply projects as referred by r03 since water is available here people are not that serious unlike other states where people protest for water quoted r15 however r06 presented enhanced public sincerity towards water in some areas of guwahati by virtue of depleting groundwater table similar views were being shared by r10 and r16 and are in line with the literature megdal et al 2017 it was pointed out that engaging public in discussions on alternative approaches to address water scarcity is an important factor to improve water governance megdal et al 2017 the experts views on groundwater availability were dissimilar few of them have suggested high spatial variations in groundwater in terms of quality as well as quantity in the study area in south west guwahati as it has areas where water table remains high and sometimes in some areas it goes very deep as expressed by r05 3 2 2 awareness on household groundwater quality r06 r12 and r15 believed that since groundwater is abundant in guwahati people are less worried about water quality they lack the knowledge to do so people are not at all aware about what water they are drinking either it is good or bad whether it has arsenic fluoride r08 they are using water for their domestic purposes so they are not concern about the water quality as quoted by r12 further according to r12 in a study conducted in guwahati high levels of fluoride have been observed besides these r11 has stated that most of the people are not aware of bacteriological contamination r01 r02 r03 r10 and r13 felt that the people in the region were ignorant about the groundwater quality earlier but with time they have become much more concerned a common man is worried about two things in the water one is the water quality and the other is tariff as expressed by r01 the most important role for this transformation goes to the media tv and radio for broadcasting about groundwater contamination li 2016 tv channels broadcast information about how arsenic and fluoride are affecting people as said by r03 the public health engineering department phed had recently circulated that the groundwater contains a high concentration of lead as expressed by r07 r03 and r05 have also observed people complaining about their groundwater contamination i find people complaining about the occurrence of iron in their groundwater as informed by r03 the public of south west guwahati area are well aware of their household groundwater quality as such so many households approach our state referral laboratory to get their drinking water sample tested as expressed by r14 r07 and r03 believed that increasing concern about the quality of household groundwater among the public has led to the installation of water filters at home including candle filter and water purifiers the expert s opinion on this theme ultimately means that as people can start using filters after becoming aware of groundwater quality they can also be made to participate in public meetings for such projects 3 2 3 regulatory governance for public participation in water supply projects r01 r03 and r06 believed that government is now looking at public participation as an important aspect for the success of a project r03 referred that the government is working out plans laws and steps to make public participation as mandatory regulatory governance legislation for public participation has not been implemented till now but it is in the process as quoted by r03 however r07 and r11 admitted lack of regulatory governance for the public participation process in water supply projects moreover experts r08 r09 r12 and r13 have never came across such laws or legislations related to public participation in water supply project i don t know any laws related to public participation in water supply projects so they have not followed in real context but some ngos or some individuals are working as a pressure group as specified by r09 similar views have been shared by r16 mansuri and rao 2004 in their study also believed that public participation initiatives depend crucially on enabling regulatory governance 3 2 4 inform public about the water supply project benefits r03 and r07 expressed that the public lacks knowledge about the pros and cons of the project similar observation was also by beierle 1999 in case of environmental decision making in general people in the area are unaware of the pros and cons of the project so that they don t even know how water would be supplied or whether to every household it would be supplied or to what quantity it will be supplied as told by r03 the experts r01 r02 r10 r13 r14 r15 and r16 suggested the institution of special social awareness wing institutional capacity development consultant icdc to work on the social aspect of the project they use to go to each and every corner of the city and elaborate the things quoted by r04 the experts did mention the use of jal board website r05 and print and electronic media r12 r07 in awareness creation r07 pointed out a busy public schedule as the reason for lesser participation in public meetings organized by the water supply project authority due to busy schedule the face to face interaction between the concerned authority and the public is not working or happen as believed by r07 3 2 5 public involvement most importantly r03 r08 and r09 expressed concerns over inclusion role of public in decision making process public were not consulted at any stage government goes for some other agencies for the fund and after getting funds they just started construction as stated by r08 r09 believed that there are some pressure groups who force the government to include public in a project the project is not inviting the community to participate instead some very small group of people who are aware of the situation are trying to pressurize the government on involving the public as informed by r09 r01 further stated that public is not involved but some representatives either one or two were invited from unions and welfare association in the meetings the public is totally ignorant about the things like they do not know about the management part as how the government is going to do the water supply as referred by r03 he also highlighted the fact that sometimes people show arrogance and ignorance to participate as probably they are unaware of its importance some people are very much ignorant about importance of public participation even if they have been educated towards working in this field but they show some degree of ignorance quoted by r03 the lack of public involvement was referred as departmental failure r03 that resulted in public complaints about the project r10 r10 and r13 appreciated efforts of icdc in disseminating project benefits but admitted about its marginal success 3 2 6 rewards incentives for public to participate according to r03 one of the obstacles for public participation is lack of reward for public participation programs and allocation of incentives for public to participate research suggests that rewards incentives can attract as well as motivate public to participate actively despite their earlier unwilling mindset davis et al 2009 specifically rewarding public enhances public attendance axelsson et al 2010 and involvement programs may promote participation of individuals that would not ordinarily take part in such exercise lowndes et al 2001 3 2 7 public influence opinion views on the decision making process r03 and r05 stated that public suggestion opinion views are considered for decision making process in reality however such views opinions suggestions have been ignored many a times while making decision the reason for this has been quoted by r03 as usually only part of the feedback is taken into consideration because of unrealistic suggestions and demands from public 3 2 8 privatization r07 raised concern on fear of water privatization among public which is in line with views presented by mahalingam 2009 and deliberated as one of the prime reasons for protest for south west guwahati water supply project after protesting against privatization of water supply project the authorities of concerned departments called on public to talk about the water supply project quoted r07 the theme identified from the interviews has been found to be analogous to the csfs identified from the secondary data 3 2 9 timeliness according to r07 public participation was never a timely organized event for the south west guwahati project the concerned expert has emphasized that lack of planning to involve and inform public led to disappointment against the project furthermore appropriate timings for scheduling the public meetings often conincide with the working hours of general public ameyaw and chan 2013 3 2 10 communication r07 believed that there has been lack of communication amongst authority and public right from the beginning r08 shared wobbling communication policy with an example of reservoir construction at hilltop without informing public or institutions at foothills we were not able to understand from where all the mud and sand have come they have not consulted or informed our administration all of a sudden the mud and sand from the hilltop has spread all over the hostel premises and roads as a result our hosteller students suffered we came to know that flooding of the premises with mud and sand has been due to cutting of earth at hilltop for the reservoir of the water supply project quoted r08 according to r04 r05 r06 r10 r13 r15 and r16 public meetings on awareness were arranged by icdc only after protest and were inadequate in serving the purpose moreover according to r09 some of the social groups including retired engineer s forum senior citizen s forum and certain ngos pressurized government in organizing meetings government is not inviting these groups but these group are putting pressure on them they have arranged the meetings invited the mayor and jal board authority they are being asked questions and they are defending that these are all technical questions so it has not been shared with the common people quoted r09 3 2 11 transparency transparency has been referred as an important theme by r07 r08 and r09 lack of transparency no information document sharing and or no public feedback in decision making were observed in the present water supply project r07 creating awareness and sharing water quality details would definitely increase transparency and build public trust on the project r08 r09 so many areas are being identified to have contaminations in guwahati by academic institutions like iitg and aec but the data have been shared with the public as observed by r08 things are not transparent awareness on water quality among the public is very poor quoted r09 transparency of a project has been acknowledged as a key factor that hinders public support if not upheld it has been suggested that adequate opportunities should be given to the public and other stakeholders to make an effort during the decision making process henjewele et al 2013 3 3 recommended participatory model for water supply project after reviewing csfs for water supply projects worldwide collecting primary data from experts in south west guwahati and reviewing the theories of public participation a conceptual framework has been formulated as a guideline to improve public participation in water supply projects encircling the lifecycle of a water supply project fig 1 the fig 1 shows a typical water supply project life cycle wherein project objectives are identified with a feasibility study in first phase steps to be taken are planned in second phase executiong in the third phase emphasis is given on releasing deliverables handing over project documentation and charge in the fourth phase and in last phase operation and maintenance of the facility is placed cleland and ireland 2007 the frameworks includes public participation in all phases considering their vital role in project acceptance and well functioning and efficient planning through participation and contribution creighton 2005 the public participation part of framework has been inspired by conner and iap2 theories which have pormulgated the mandate of spreading awareness among public educating and capacity building training them in addition an unaddressed critical parameter of information sharing for effective public participation is addressed herein the presented framework not only mandates information sharing but also authority public collaboration in final decision making phase for greater acceptability of the projects it is significant to highlight that different levels of participation are incorporated in the framework and multiple csfs are addressed at various levels also one csf might be addressed at two different levels of the framework the beauty of flexibility in framework is that it is not mandatory that particular csf is addressed at particular level but it might be involved addressed at different levels of the framework the developed framework has been designed to achieve effective public participation through six levels namely inform educate consult involve collaborate and capacity building it is important to note that these are the levels of participation and not steps to be followed in sequence and any of the levels could be accomplished earlier or later according to the ground conditions goals and promises of public participation the selection of executive medium or tool among available ones is also not hard and fast but case specific and need to be followed based on ground condition s feasibility further the public engagement process commences with the competent authority such as urban local bodies ulb exploring existing conflicts if any and identifying an initial list of workable solutions alternate options this may begin by informing the public on the benefits of the project and showing preferred project details and alternatives it should be carried out through public meetings public affairs and media programs ulbs may explore additional options next step is to identify the public stakeholders determined through the initial involvement of interested public and carry out public stakeholder analysis identify problems and the preferences of public stakeholder analysis is identifying the most influential stakeholders and their potential threats and cooperation to the project it allows decision maker to discover the problem and resolve it in cooperation with all interested parties stakeholders to create an information exchange correlation early involvement of the public may be considered as preliminary contentment of the requirements of the water supply project development in rapports of public participation this process is followed by suitable actions to inform the public about the entire decision process and its outcomes it also helps to create an intent for change in the final decision and explore alternatives if required this represents the next level of the public participation process and is to be followed by educating the public on existing groundwater quality and its health impacts collection of a sufficient number of groundwater samples and its laboratory testing is advised at this level in case no record on groundwater quality is available the public feedback and queries raised during education awareness program are to be evaluated and investigated it is of utmost importance that information circulation and public consultation should continue until the implementation of the final decision however the decision makers may also choose to get the public participation to the level of active involvement and collaboration on each aspect of the decision including the development of alternatives and the identification of the ideal solution at this level of the proposed framework the public acceptance of the project is increased through participation however the primary motivation for increasing participation is public centric i e not by removal of opposition but through consultative resolutions being a democratic society public participation in decision making has to be made morally justified in its own right which is well protected through the proposed public participation framework henceforth the proposed framework will help guide authority to undertake an effective and morally justified approval process for water supply projects through effective public participation the different levels of effective public participation are further elaborated as follows 3 3 1 inform this level informs the public on project objectives needs and its benefits it also helps the public in identifying botherations questions doubts and disagreements regarding the project along with feasible alternatives and possible solutions iap2 2014 information is to be shared in more of a one way channel to resolve possible conflicts in future and provisions of incentives or rewards for participation if any will be informed in order to maintain transparency basic project information such as ownership tariff benefits and losses from the project will be disclosed bruns 2003 this whole exercise at this level will address a total of four csfs namely information on the project tariff certainty incentives and transparency the tools or mediums that could be used are fact sheets websites open houses media campaigns through newsletters newspapers radio and television training programs and mailings bruns 2003 3 3 2 educate at first place in this level the framework mandates ulb to collect and test a sufficient number of groundwater samples in the project service area followed by mandatory awareness programs on groundwater contamination and health hazards secondly if there exist any public controversy dispute ambiguity misconception about the project it has to be considered with the highest priority at this level the public is to be well informed and given fair knowledge over the issue before it gets aggravated bruns 2003 this is designed to eradicate the possibility provoking misleding the public by political vested interest driven elements the top priority is given to resolve the issue at this level because once worry and anger reach high levels educating those affected becomes almost impossible in this level two csfs such as information on project and awareness on groundwater quality will be addressed using tools or mediums viz fact sheets websites media campaigns through newsletters newspapers radio and television door to door awareness campaign and mailings 3 3 3 consult this level of public participation starts after the decision has been made with public consent and after educating them about the project as well as the groundwater quality this level has been designed to obtain public feedbacks on ulb decisions analysis and alternatives adopted from earlier levels iap2 2014 it includes the procurement of public feedback about plans thoughts alternatives and or issues but with little communication the main objective of consult is to listen and acknowledge the concerns being raised but not inevitably take action on them iap2 2014 responding to all concerns is not made mandatory at this level as the decisions made earlier were taken with public consent this level of the public participation framework addresses three csfs namely full public participation public influence and communication listening and acknowledging public concerns issues and collecting their feedback will help to promote full public participation the information on how public inputs influenced the decision makes them feel that they are influential this exercise of the two way channel at this level in fact builds better communication between the ulb authority and public the tools or medium recommended for consultations at this level include public comments focus groups surveys public meetings public hearings and public comment devices nabatchi 2012 the public hearing is the most commonly used way to gather public input on governmental decisions written comments and interviews are also recommended for the same bruns 2003 3 3 4 involve in this level of participation the authorities are to be working with the public i e the public groups are invited to the workshops and or deliberate polling and their views have to be incorporated in decision making this level of participation is more than a consultation that just witnesses decisions taken in the project but ensures alternative arrangements on the public demand the public influence in this level could be so high that the decision of the government ulb can also be revised considering possible suggested alternatives the public involvement is promoted through interactive discussion e g workshops and encouraged to undertake express concerns grievances and finally welcoming new ideas however sometimes technical complexity and legislative mandate may limit agencies to share information and make decisions without involving the public csfs such as full public participation public influence and communication will be taken care of through this level of public participation using recommended involvement tools mediums such as workshops and deliberate polling 3 3 5 collaborate this level ensures public partnering for direct advice in decision making developing alternatives and identifying preferred solutions iap2 2014 it is framed as an enhanced two way channel between citizens and government where representatives have a seat at the table tambouris et al 2007 however this will require an active citizen partnering in regards to csfs this level would further enhance public influence on the project and its participation in decision making the recommended execution tools or mediums are citizen advisory committees consensus building and participatory decision making 3 3 6 capacity building capacity building of staff public through their training education on o m activities could help in improvement of their technical managerial and institutional knowledge pool this will result in better service delivery training is supposed to cover specific problems implies shorter contact times and attempts to offer directly applicable skills education will be aimed with a broader responsibility covering accurate knowledge insight applicable methodologies and professional attitude training and education could be delivered on water quality testing deciding and recording chemical dose to be applied and other operational activities hamdy et al 1998 csfs such as full public participation public influence and communication will be taken care of by this level and recommended tools mediums are workshops and training educational programs the unaddressed csfs i e timeliness and regulatory governance are already being addressed in the planning stage of the project life cycle the public participation is mandated through regulatory governance in a project with specification on how and when to conduct organize participation furthermore timings for participation is to be maintained and scheduled beforehand i e at the beginning of the project to avoid mess and chaos in participation 3 3 7 public stakeholder identification and analysis procedure public stakeholder identification is suggested to be carried out iteratively the influential people amongst individuals groups negotiators and representatives are chosen as public representatives or stakeholders through various approaches some of the commonly used approaches are focus group interviews expert opinion structured or semi structured questionnaire interview snow ball sampling brain storming brain writing and crawford slip sessions reed et al 2009 furthermore the importance of the influential stakeholders to the project should also be assessed by ulbs henjewele et al 2013 they will have to identify categorize and rank these groups according to the usefulness of the issues in the context of project success henjewele et al 2013 the prioritization and public stakeholder issue identification is to be worked out by asking the groups to submit position statements looking at previous public engagement reviewing the press releases and scrutiny of public statements this can also be achieved by taking opinions of public stakeholders around typical major issues direct public interviews organizing single or multi public stakeholder workshop and by going through on line forums or moderated blogs prieto 2011 3 3 8 identify solution and implement it to action information and public notification regarding the project are to be released to involve and collaborate with public helping identification of visions and desires from the project they should be made aware of the factors that may have an impact on the infrastructure feasible design layout alternatives are to be presented to the interested groups or the public each design alternative is to be discussed exclusively against the design criteria integrating the input from the public once the design group has established details of the favoured design alternative additional public involvement meeting is to be held for detailed discussion and modification for maximum convenience and aesthetic appeal ng et al 2013 the traditional tools adopted are brainstorming session direct discussion public hearings district forums and written responses roving exhibitions and surveys 3 3 9 contextual policy reform the framework includes contextual policy reform with an intention to include the rich understanding of situational changes in the context of the local attitudes within this framework contextual policy is defined as the assortment of influences or potential influences affecting public participation approach in water supply projects such influences may or may not exist for a particular situation region but is subjected to local approach like mistrust among people elite capture role of gate keepers or local politics issue contextual policy reform remains as a stationary unit for the whole project life cycle and this will address the context issue situation arising in project area this unit will serve to tackle important issues that leads to project failure e g mistrust in the implementing authority it arises when participation is not worth the effort and that the decisions were already made and public input is merely a formality to oust mistrust the process has to be open and transparent this unit will work on such issues and will ensure the authority to make financial information and audits available for public review giering 2011 a different barrier to public participation is elite capture that leads to corrupt planning and governance dasgupta and beard 2007 in the case of elite capture the individuals in society that exercise disproportionate and unacceptable access to social political or economic power manipulate the processes to secure undue benefits for themselves government administrators tend to endorse this bond and avoid public stakeholder s participation an example from the indian state of kerala stands as a strategy to overcome this issue wherein a citizen campaign for decentralized planning was undertaken to provide opportunities for citizen groups and stakeholders to participate in local development projects by including processes like capacity building of training and mentoring similarly in thailand citizen hearing has been made compulsory through legal provision during the implementation of local development programs waheduzzaman et al 2018 this strategy will encourage involvement inclusion of local non government organizations ngos in spreading awareness and monitoring public participation in government programs it is being reported that the government representatives and officials tend to support these elites to keep their control safe and minimize disapprovals or moves by their political opponents waheduzzaman et al 2018 waheduzzaman et al 2018 in their study believed that government bureaucrats elected representatives influential business people and social elites including public leaders is largely responsible for jeopardizing the participatory governance process in development projects it is further argued that the increasing number of local representatives may not be enough to diminish the effect of elite capture the contextual policy reform unit presented here will address the concern of elite capture through legal governance thereby making public participation compulsory including training for public officials and community leaders an awareness program for local citizens and inclusion of ngos in local development programs waheduzzaman et al 2018 moreover many researchers are of the concern that local politics influences public and their participation in such process has been done with the objective to build their reputation in their constituencies and increase political support ongoya and lumallas 2005 damoah et al 2018 continued centralized control over the projects and or the often hidden role of political representatives pose as a hurdle for effective institutional mechanism project committees have been used as instruments of benefaction distribution leading to corruption neglecting poor and disadvantaged in the project stages damoah et al 2018 in the study by ongoya and lumallas 2005 it was identified that political pressure was encountered in projects undertaken in their locality and that political influence was present in both implementation and selection of crucial committees for the management of these projects management of the projects needs to be detached completely from politics so that the public can make appropriate decisions on the management of these projects without political interference we speculate that these issues will be taken care by constitution of strong contextual policy reform unit 4 framework validation the descriptive statistics derived from the statistical analysis of the responses provided by the experts who had participated in the validation study for each validation aspect are shown in table 6 the experts were requested to rate six aspects of the framework using a likert scale of 1 5 a mean score above 3 would signify satisfactory performance for that particular aspect the results showed that all the aspects were rated significantly high i e above 3 by the experts the aspect rated highest was 4 13 for degree of practicality and the aspect with the lowest mean score was 3 38 for degree of replicability therefore it can be interpreted that the newly developed framework was validated to be appropriate objective replicable practicable reliable and suitability for water supply in south west guwahati 5 lessons learnt from failed water supply projects studies from various parts of the world suggested the need to accord more attention to secondary stakeholders as they pose an important and influential link to disrupt an infrastructure project di maddaloni and davis 2017 olander and landin 2008 integrating public through a guideline or a governance structure or a framework would ensure better and easy implementation of decisions a framework can serve as an early warning system for public concerns a means through which accurate and timely information can be distributed and can contribute to acceptable decision making iap2 2014 however it should ensure early public involvement for better decisions and greater public acceptance ozerol and newig 2008 public deeply value service consistency and compliance of contractual agreement from their service providers hence it is crucial to not only deliver good public service at first but to keep on delivering service at the level thereby ensuring public satisfaction it is needed to focus on making sure that interactions communication with the public is consistent and quality based it is only logical that a consumer s confidence in the organization will increase if a consistent level of quality is delivered zeithaml et al 1993 if the scope of the participatory process involves the whole public it should be ensured that every member of the public has equal opportunities to reach the information supply and to give feedback ozerol and newig 2008 there should be no priorities or differences among the public members moreover the process of inducing tariff water quality awareness and decision making is to be transparent by being transparent public suspicions about the sponsors and their motives may likely be allayed transparency might involve releasing information on aspects of the procedure varying from the manner of the selection of the public participants to how a decision is reached to the minutes of meetings if any information needs to be withheld from the public or are not educated on a particular event for reasons of sensitivity or security it would seem important to admit the nature of what is being withheld and why rather than risking the discovery of such secrecy with subsequent adverse reactions rowe and frewer 2000 6 conclusions the current study focusses on the primary and secondary data for public participation in water supply projects the study identifies csfs for public participation and studies the relevancy of these csfs in the study area of south west guwahati a public participation framework has been developed to deemphasize the effects of disincentives in water supply projects this framework is grounded on primary secondary data and theories of public participation qualitative primary interview data were collected through a semi structured questionnaire for the study area of public participation in the south west guwahati water supply project analysis of data using nvivo revealed 11 eleven themes for public participation moreover 9 csfs identified from secondary data analysis were found to be quite relevant for the study area of the water supply project the framework is envisaged to enhance public acceptance timely completion and successful comprehensive management of a project through various levels of public participation moreover satisfactory ratings for all aspects of framework validation demonstrated that the newly developed public participation framework is appropriate objective replicable practical reliable and suitable for water supply projects 6 1 limitations and future research directions g practical limitations do exist adopting this framework in a real case scenario the public may panic with non availability of alternative water sources when informed about household groundwater quality this should be taken into consideration while adopting this framework h the expert panel for the development of a framework and its validation was the same this might have created biasness in the validation of the framework i intricacies of public participation in the water sector especially in india through many gatekeepers at the local level would present further insightful aspects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

18506,piped water supply in guwahati covers less than 30 of the city s population for which the government of india proposes four new water supply projects but astonishingly they faced vehement public protest the reason for the protest was attributed to lack of trust and need of public representation in the governing body besides public participation is not a mandatory clause in water supply projects and hence was not carried out a priori to the project implementation in an effort to address this the present study aims to develop a framework incorporating public participation as a mandatory clause in water supply projects in doing so secondary data was collected from studies worldwide on public participation in water supply projects and analyzed to identify critical success factors csfs south west guwahati water supply project was taken up as a study area and a semi structured questionnaire was designed to generate primary data on public participation thematic analysis was employed to identify the csfs from primary data influencing public participation in the project finally a framework was formulated following the identified csfs from primary and secondary data and the review of various theories on public participation the framework is developed to achieve effective public participation in six levels viz inform educate consult involve collaborate and capacity building each level satisfies a set of csfs and ultimately all csfs addresses to deemphasize the effects of disincentives in water supply projects further the framework was validated by 16 experts and received an exceptionally copacetic rating for all six validation aspects copacetic expert ratings demonstrated appropriateness objectivity replicability practicality reliability and suitability of framework for water supply projects graphical abstract image 1 keywords water supply scheme groundwater quality awareness public participation framework thematic analysis critical success factor 1 introduction the urban water infrastructure facilities and services are dwindling worldwide under rapid population growth rural urban migration and unplanned spatial expansion ahmed et al 2008 the stringent environmental regulations inadequacy of technical knowledge on project differences of opinion political interventions perception of risk among stakeholders and social conflicts aroused on the grounds of dissimilarities in values beliefs and motivations are preventing convergence of water supply projects such scenarios public and authority attitudes cause irreversible project damage through stakeholder secondary protests lawsuits project relocation indefinite postponement and even cancellation huang et al 2015 the secondary stakeholders individuals community and its advocates without any formal official relation with the company i e public possess little power and are mostly underestimated or neglected in commonplace cleland and ireland 2007 however recent changes in the governmental policies on delegation and decentralization in the service sector and increased non governmental organizations have rightly pointed the need of public inclusion as an important stakeholder in regulating decision making process jami and walsh 2014 until the end of the 19th century decision making through public participation process was more of a unilateral regulatory verdict coining the term public participation theory arnstein 1969 stated that public participation activities are at the rungs of informing consultation and tokenism levels the citizens at these levels may indeed hear and be heard but under these conditions they lack the power to ensure that the authorities will note their views the top level of citizen power is the most powerful in the ladder ensuring consideration of public views in response to the limitations of arnstein s ladder for dispute resolution connor 1988 proposed dispute solving and flexible seven staged ladder having two stages of mediation and litigation in later years however public involvement principles based on the democratic social mobilization and social exchange theories achieved some success howell et al 1987 the focus thus has been on building a close public issue relationship for improved public participation and healthy administrative system citizens acquaintanceship king et al 1998 further research concentrated on the rationalization of public conflicts beierle 1999 and exploring mitigation measures leeuwis 2000 in his study believed that participatory approaches are rarely conflict free and often suffers from the inability to handle conflicts it was suggested to be solved by informing educating the public and incorporating public values and or choices in decision making to promote trust in the institutions iap2 2014 all these efforts to engage public were for higher public acceptance of infrastructure projects and were monotonous non comparable and scattered hence international association for public participation iap2 developed spectrum focusing public engagement in decisions where the government retains final authority but may inform consult involve collaborate in the decision making process iap2 2014 apart from theories on public participation studies from various parts of the world also believed and suggested a crucial role of public secondary stakeholders as a potential menace for disruption to an infrastructure project development olander and landin 2008 di maddaloni and davis 2017 public opposition due to various factor concerns and or considerations has been one of the leading reasons for the failure of infrastructure projects belout and gauvreau 2004 as a result of inefficient public participation evidences of the failure of water supply projects with massive public opposition are copious davis 2005 although there are ample efforts to develop theories enhancing public participation for timely completion of infrastructure projects and avoid public opposition but the studies on development of a framework to achieve the same are in a nascent stage and are particularly lacking in the water sector in this study unpleasant past experiences and their anecdotal evidences are studied to gather identify principles critical success factors csfs for better and easy implementation of decisions attempts are made to come with a decision that reflects public interests requirements values and can include the apprehensible public suggestion in the view of the need of water supply sector the study aims to develop a framework built on theories of public involvement and guidance of professional water experts for integration analysis and public deliberation in decision making the framework also ensures long term sustainability of the project through the incorporation of public participation in operation and maintenance o m phase of the project in order to achieve this a qualitative research approach has been adopted to study an upcoming water treatment plant wtp in guwahati the csfs from secondary and primary data were identified and the framework was developed considering identified csfs and theories on public participation finally the quality of the research outcomes was assessed by validating framework through experts interview the validation was performed based on validation aspects such as degree of appropriateness objectivity replicability and overall reliability 2 materials and methods the case of an upcoming water treatment plant wtp was considered in an attempt to achieve the above mentioned objective the existing wtps in guwahati india serves only 30 population with compromised quality of treated water however the area has brimming groundwater resource at a shallow depth of 2 4 m thereby encouraging its utilization das and goswami 2013 despite contaminated groundwater reports and benevolent efforts from the government in the institution of such wtp for drinking water supply the project has been facing wide public opposition protests since the start of construction works joy et al 2017 publications reported that the rationale for public opposition were relating to issues on public participation tariff disclosure and information sharing on ownership of the project government or private the assam tribune 2013 the telegraph 2013 this underscored the lack of guidelines from the government over conduct of public participation in water supply projects and highlighted the need for framework development framework is descriptive in nature and essentially include multiple realities formed by personal views context and meaning the qualitative research methodology was adopted to provide a detailed description of the views beliefs and meanings for this study primary and secondary data were collected and used as the source for research inquiry in three steps in step 1 secondary data was collected from existing studies on public participation in water supply projects and analyzed to identify csfs for efficient public involvement timely completion and increased public acceptance of projects in step 2 a semi structured questionnaire interview was designed to gather primary data in south west guwahati water supply project and thematic analysis was employed the sample size the number of experts to be interviewed was determined using the tool of saturation in qualitative research there is no hard and fast rule for getting a right sample size saunders et al 2018 in the present study saturation level was achieved in 10 interviews the expert selection was based on a combination of referral and chain or snowball technique the experts and policymakers decision holders were reached through proper channel in order to incorporate their views in the framework the list of the selected experts who had participated in the study is shown in table 1 the expert s interview questionnaire comprised of two parts part a focused on gathering information relating to the expert s demographic data background and area of expertise the part b was so designed such that all 9 numbers csf identified from the secondary data were included in the questionnaire along with the various aspects of public participation in the present study area the aspects were legislations laws related to public participation in water supply projects actual practice of public participation analysis processing of public views obstacles for public participation with reference to study area relevance of groundwater quality and identified csfs in the study area the thematic analysis of the primary data was undertaken as suggested by braun and clarke 2006 in the first phase familiarizing with data was achieved by multiple readings and listening of the interview transcripts and original interview audio recordings the primary recorded data were transcribed and imported into nvivo 11 software a computer assisted qualitative data analysis software caqdas the transcribed data were scrutinized read through and segments of interest were highlighted and noted in the second phase the data items were again reviewed to generate initial codes with features of interest across the complete data set gathering relevant data to each code in the third phase codes were given taken under various potential themes gathering all data relevant to each potential theme the fourth phase commenced with an iterative process of changing eliminating adding and re categorizing the data set to capture the essence of the phenomenon under investigation to prepare the pre final list of codes and finally merged into a single theme to study patterns amongst them in the fifth phase the themes were further defined and refined for the analysis the sixth phase began with the set of fully worked out themes and involved the final analysis the final task of thematic analysis was achieved with the writing up of the report with the data in a way to convince the reader of the analysis braun and clarke 2006 in step 3 the framework was formulated following the identified csfs from primary and secondary data and the review of various theories on public participation in order to ensure that the framework is in line with the designed objective and professional uses retrospection on various validation aspects such as degree of appropriateness degree of objectivity degree of replicability and overall reliability were performed this was followed by a face to face questionnaire survey the relevant validation aspects were also selected in a similar validation process by ibrahim et al 2015 the questionnaire template for framework validation comprised of three sections the first section explained the purpose of the survey highlighting the motive of the interview background information about the research and instructions for completing the surveys in the second section a brief description of the developed framework was provided and the third section focused on the framework validation scoring sheet along with the guideline for validation the extent to which the framework has fulfilled the six validation aspects has been recorded on a scale of 1 5 table 2 shows the responses concerning the extent of satisfaction for every validation aspect based on a scoring scale of 1 5 where one represented poor and five represented excellent 3 results and discussion 3 1 csfs for public participation analysis of secondary data collection of secondary data was aimed at identifying csfs of public participation to ensure successful implementation of water supply projects the analysis of secondary data identified transparency communication public involvement effective public participation contract design the certainty of water pricing and tariff review as significant csfs for successful implementation of water supply projects it also manifested ways of enhancing public participation such as multiparty planning mediation and negotiation with the public chen and wikstrom 2010 in many projects the causes for dissatisfaction and public conflict resistance were found to be grounded on issues of ineffective public participation involvement and fear of the increase in tariff due to private sector involvement ameyaw and chan 2015 easter and hearne 1995 it has been observed from a public participation program for a primary health care project in cisne dos ecuador that the project was terminated after six years of its execution due to non involvement of the public leaders in the design stage of the project the cause for this was attributed to ambiguity complex nature in setting up the responsibilities of the public leaders further the leaders were not paid for their aid in the community services and later they demanded payment thereby creating unrest and dispute moser and sollis 1991 other reasons for the failure of the projects include weak regulatory and monitoring regime tariff uncertainty and delayed or non payment of bills ameyaw and chan 2015 review of many failed projects indicated that projects faced local opposition in its initial stages and later based on input from the public the authority made commitments to redesigned the project such step helped to change public perception active public engagement the embodiment of public views suggestions in decision making upsurging public acceptance and success of the project garfì and ferrer 2011 whereas public involvement in decision making was found to be dependent on household satisfaction and acceptance of the project prokopy 2005 it has been concluded from this study that in order to enhance public acceptance organizing public gathering hearing for namesake will not enhance public participation it was further concluded that higher levels of participation are associated with good governance measured by having a local organization and transparency in addition necessary institutional arrangements for participation will be required to ensure effective public participation watson and jagannathan 1995 it was also noticed that public acceptance could be improved by information disclosure resident supervision and residents participation in decision making zhenhua 2013 a study from india revealed that reforms in public participation process are being carried out in india based on four cardinal principles viz awareness generation transparency community participation and social auditing naidu 2002 however the cases of failed water projects highlighted that these principles are either not effective enough or not being followed effectively for example a water supply project in india latur aurangabad mysore had faced massive public protest and was eventually terminated world bank 2014 table 3 summarizes the csf for the water supply project public involvement was found to be an important csf coded by the highest number of sources i e 12 times other csfs were viz transparency communication timeliness information on the project regulatory governance public influence tariff certainty and privatization table 4 provides a brief description of these csfs these nine csfs were found to have a significant bearing on public participation in most of the water supply projects thereby indicating that these factors need to be considered to reduce public disapproval of the water supply project 3 2 experts interview analysis of primary data the responses from the experts were coded through thematic analysis of qualitative data the analysis evolved eleven thematic codes themes the themes identified from interviews were concurrent or closely matched with the csfs identified from the secondary data out of these eleven themes eight themes were found to be common with csfs obtained from secondary data namely communication information on the project public involvement public influence privatization regulatory governance timeliness transparency whereas availability of water awareness on household groundwater and rewards incentives were the additional themes obtained from the primary data expert interview there were multiple individual and commonly occurring themes pointed out by one or more interviewees and referred by various researchers table 5 table 5 summarizes the themes along with the frequency of occurrence number of times an expert refers to the particular theme each of the csfs is discussed in detail for its relevance in the case of south west guwahati project 3 2 1 availability of water according to r03 one of the many reasons for lack of participation in south west guwahati is an abundance of groundwater in many regions the public seldom faces water shortage in order to opt for an alternate source of water most of the places in guwahati people do not face water shortage that s why i think at times they become reluctant towards water supply projects as referred by r03 since water is available here people are not that serious unlike other states where people protest for water quoted r15 however r06 presented enhanced public sincerity towards water in some areas of guwahati by virtue of depleting groundwater table similar views were being shared by r10 and r16 and are in line with the literature megdal et al 2017 it was pointed out that engaging public in discussions on alternative approaches to address water scarcity is an important factor to improve water governance megdal et al 2017 the experts views on groundwater availability were dissimilar few of them have suggested high spatial variations in groundwater in terms of quality as well as quantity in the study area in south west guwahati as it has areas where water table remains high and sometimes in some areas it goes very deep as expressed by r05 3 2 2 awareness on household groundwater quality r06 r12 and r15 believed that since groundwater is abundant in guwahati people are less worried about water quality they lack the knowledge to do so people are not at all aware about what water they are drinking either it is good or bad whether it has arsenic fluoride r08 they are using water for their domestic purposes so they are not concern about the water quality as quoted by r12 further according to r12 in a study conducted in guwahati high levels of fluoride have been observed besides these r11 has stated that most of the people are not aware of bacteriological contamination r01 r02 r03 r10 and r13 felt that the people in the region were ignorant about the groundwater quality earlier but with time they have become much more concerned a common man is worried about two things in the water one is the water quality and the other is tariff as expressed by r01 the most important role for this transformation goes to the media tv and radio for broadcasting about groundwater contamination li 2016 tv channels broadcast information about how arsenic and fluoride are affecting people as said by r03 the public health engineering department phed had recently circulated that the groundwater contains a high concentration of lead as expressed by r07 r03 and r05 have also observed people complaining about their groundwater contamination i find people complaining about the occurrence of iron in their groundwater as informed by r03 the public of south west guwahati area are well aware of their household groundwater quality as such so many households approach our state referral laboratory to get their drinking water sample tested as expressed by r14 r07 and r03 believed that increasing concern about the quality of household groundwater among the public has led to the installation of water filters at home including candle filter and water purifiers the expert s opinion on this theme ultimately means that as people can start using filters after becoming aware of groundwater quality they can also be made to participate in public meetings for such projects 3 2 3 regulatory governance for public participation in water supply projects r01 r03 and r06 believed that government is now looking at public participation as an important aspect for the success of a project r03 referred that the government is working out plans laws and steps to make public participation as mandatory regulatory governance legislation for public participation has not been implemented till now but it is in the process as quoted by r03 however r07 and r11 admitted lack of regulatory governance for the public participation process in water supply projects moreover experts r08 r09 r12 and r13 have never came across such laws or legislations related to public participation in water supply project i don t know any laws related to public participation in water supply projects so they have not followed in real context but some ngos or some individuals are working as a pressure group as specified by r09 similar views have been shared by r16 mansuri and rao 2004 in their study also believed that public participation initiatives depend crucially on enabling regulatory governance 3 2 4 inform public about the water supply project benefits r03 and r07 expressed that the public lacks knowledge about the pros and cons of the project similar observation was also by beierle 1999 in case of environmental decision making in general people in the area are unaware of the pros and cons of the project so that they don t even know how water would be supplied or whether to every household it would be supplied or to what quantity it will be supplied as told by r03 the experts r01 r02 r10 r13 r14 r15 and r16 suggested the institution of special social awareness wing institutional capacity development consultant icdc to work on the social aspect of the project they use to go to each and every corner of the city and elaborate the things quoted by r04 the experts did mention the use of jal board website r05 and print and electronic media r12 r07 in awareness creation r07 pointed out a busy public schedule as the reason for lesser participation in public meetings organized by the water supply project authority due to busy schedule the face to face interaction between the concerned authority and the public is not working or happen as believed by r07 3 2 5 public involvement most importantly r03 r08 and r09 expressed concerns over inclusion role of public in decision making process public were not consulted at any stage government goes for some other agencies for the fund and after getting funds they just started construction as stated by r08 r09 believed that there are some pressure groups who force the government to include public in a project the project is not inviting the community to participate instead some very small group of people who are aware of the situation are trying to pressurize the government on involving the public as informed by r09 r01 further stated that public is not involved but some representatives either one or two were invited from unions and welfare association in the meetings the public is totally ignorant about the things like they do not know about the management part as how the government is going to do the water supply as referred by r03 he also highlighted the fact that sometimes people show arrogance and ignorance to participate as probably they are unaware of its importance some people are very much ignorant about importance of public participation even if they have been educated towards working in this field but they show some degree of ignorance quoted by r03 the lack of public involvement was referred as departmental failure r03 that resulted in public complaints about the project r10 r10 and r13 appreciated efforts of icdc in disseminating project benefits but admitted about its marginal success 3 2 6 rewards incentives for public to participate according to r03 one of the obstacles for public participation is lack of reward for public participation programs and allocation of incentives for public to participate research suggests that rewards incentives can attract as well as motivate public to participate actively despite their earlier unwilling mindset davis et al 2009 specifically rewarding public enhances public attendance axelsson et al 2010 and involvement programs may promote participation of individuals that would not ordinarily take part in such exercise lowndes et al 2001 3 2 7 public influence opinion views on the decision making process r03 and r05 stated that public suggestion opinion views are considered for decision making process in reality however such views opinions suggestions have been ignored many a times while making decision the reason for this has been quoted by r03 as usually only part of the feedback is taken into consideration because of unrealistic suggestions and demands from public 3 2 8 privatization r07 raised concern on fear of water privatization among public which is in line with views presented by mahalingam 2009 and deliberated as one of the prime reasons for protest for south west guwahati water supply project after protesting against privatization of water supply project the authorities of concerned departments called on public to talk about the water supply project quoted r07 the theme identified from the interviews has been found to be analogous to the csfs identified from the secondary data 3 2 9 timeliness according to r07 public participation was never a timely organized event for the south west guwahati project the concerned expert has emphasized that lack of planning to involve and inform public led to disappointment against the project furthermore appropriate timings for scheduling the public meetings often conincide with the working hours of general public ameyaw and chan 2013 3 2 10 communication r07 believed that there has been lack of communication amongst authority and public right from the beginning r08 shared wobbling communication policy with an example of reservoir construction at hilltop without informing public or institutions at foothills we were not able to understand from where all the mud and sand have come they have not consulted or informed our administration all of a sudden the mud and sand from the hilltop has spread all over the hostel premises and roads as a result our hosteller students suffered we came to know that flooding of the premises with mud and sand has been due to cutting of earth at hilltop for the reservoir of the water supply project quoted r08 according to r04 r05 r06 r10 r13 r15 and r16 public meetings on awareness were arranged by icdc only after protest and were inadequate in serving the purpose moreover according to r09 some of the social groups including retired engineer s forum senior citizen s forum and certain ngos pressurized government in organizing meetings government is not inviting these groups but these group are putting pressure on them they have arranged the meetings invited the mayor and jal board authority they are being asked questions and they are defending that these are all technical questions so it has not been shared with the common people quoted r09 3 2 11 transparency transparency has been referred as an important theme by r07 r08 and r09 lack of transparency no information document sharing and or no public feedback in decision making were observed in the present water supply project r07 creating awareness and sharing water quality details would definitely increase transparency and build public trust on the project r08 r09 so many areas are being identified to have contaminations in guwahati by academic institutions like iitg and aec but the data have been shared with the public as observed by r08 things are not transparent awareness on water quality among the public is very poor quoted r09 transparency of a project has been acknowledged as a key factor that hinders public support if not upheld it has been suggested that adequate opportunities should be given to the public and other stakeholders to make an effort during the decision making process henjewele et al 2013 3 3 recommended participatory model for water supply project after reviewing csfs for water supply projects worldwide collecting primary data from experts in south west guwahati and reviewing the theories of public participation a conceptual framework has been formulated as a guideline to improve public participation in water supply projects encircling the lifecycle of a water supply project fig 1 the fig 1 shows a typical water supply project life cycle wherein project objectives are identified with a feasibility study in first phase steps to be taken are planned in second phase executiong in the third phase emphasis is given on releasing deliverables handing over project documentation and charge in the fourth phase and in last phase operation and maintenance of the facility is placed cleland and ireland 2007 the frameworks includes public participation in all phases considering their vital role in project acceptance and well functioning and efficient planning through participation and contribution creighton 2005 the public participation part of framework has been inspired by conner and iap2 theories which have pormulgated the mandate of spreading awareness among public educating and capacity building training them in addition an unaddressed critical parameter of information sharing for effective public participation is addressed herein the presented framework not only mandates information sharing but also authority public collaboration in final decision making phase for greater acceptability of the projects it is significant to highlight that different levels of participation are incorporated in the framework and multiple csfs are addressed at various levels also one csf might be addressed at two different levels of the framework the beauty of flexibility in framework is that it is not mandatory that particular csf is addressed at particular level but it might be involved addressed at different levels of the framework the developed framework has been designed to achieve effective public participation through six levels namely inform educate consult involve collaborate and capacity building it is important to note that these are the levels of participation and not steps to be followed in sequence and any of the levels could be accomplished earlier or later according to the ground conditions goals and promises of public participation the selection of executive medium or tool among available ones is also not hard and fast but case specific and need to be followed based on ground condition s feasibility further the public engagement process commences with the competent authority such as urban local bodies ulb exploring existing conflicts if any and identifying an initial list of workable solutions alternate options this may begin by informing the public on the benefits of the project and showing preferred project details and alternatives it should be carried out through public meetings public affairs and media programs ulbs may explore additional options next step is to identify the public stakeholders determined through the initial involvement of interested public and carry out public stakeholder analysis identify problems and the preferences of public stakeholder analysis is identifying the most influential stakeholders and their potential threats and cooperation to the project it allows decision maker to discover the problem and resolve it in cooperation with all interested parties stakeholders to create an information exchange correlation early involvement of the public may be considered as preliminary contentment of the requirements of the water supply project development in rapports of public participation this process is followed by suitable actions to inform the public about the entire decision process and its outcomes it also helps to create an intent for change in the final decision and explore alternatives if required this represents the next level of the public participation process and is to be followed by educating the public on existing groundwater quality and its health impacts collection of a sufficient number of groundwater samples and its laboratory testing is advised at this level in case no record on groundwater quality is available the public feedback and queries raised during education awareness program are to be evaluated and investigated it is of utmost importance that information circulation and public consultation should continue until the implementation of the final decision however the decision makers may also choose to get the public participation to the level of active involvement and collaboration on each aspect of the decision including the development of alternatives and the identification of the ideal solution at this level of the proposed framework the public acceptance of the project is increased through participation however the primary motivation for increasing participation is public centric i e not by removal of opposition but through consultative resolutions being a democratic society public participation in decision making has to be made morally justified in its own right which is well protected through the proposed public participation framework henceforth the proposed framework will help guide authority to undertake an effective and morally justified approval process for water supply projects through effective public participation the different levels of effective public participation are further elaborated as follows 3 3 1 inform this level informs the public on project objectives needs and its benefits it also helps the public in identifying botherations questions doubts and disagreements regarding the project along with feasible alternatives and possible solutions iap2 2014 information is to be shared in more of a one way channel to resolve possible conflicts in future and provisions of incentives or rewards for participation if any will be informed in order to maintain transparency basic project information such as ownership tariff benefits and losses from the project will be disclosed bruns 2003 this whole exercise at this level will address a total of four csfs namely information on the project tariff certainty incentives and transparency the tools or mediums that could be used are fact sheets websites open houses media campaigns through newsletters newspapers radio and television training programs and mailings bruns 2003 3 3 2 educate at first place in this level the framework mandates ulb to collect and test a sufficient number of groundwater samples in the project service area followed by mandatory awareness programs on groundwater contamination and health hazards secondly if there exist any public controversy dispute ambiguity misconception about the project it has to be considered with the highest priority at this level the public is to be well informed and given fair knowledge over the issue before it gets aggravated bruns 2003 this is designed to eradicate the possibility provoking misleding the public by political vested interest driven elements the top priority is given to resolve the issue at this level because once worry and anger reach high levels educating those affected becomes almost impossible in this level two csfs such as information on project and awareness on groundwater quality will be addressed using tools or mediums viz fact sheets websites media campaigns through newsletters newspapers radio and television door to door awareness campaign and mailings 3 3 3 consult this level of public participation starts after the decision has been made with public consent and after educating them about the project as well as the groundwater quality this level has been designed to obtain public feedbacks on ulb decisions analysis and alternatives adopted from earlier levels iap2 2014 it includes the procurement of public feedback about plans thoughts alternatives and or issues but with little communication the main objective of consult is to listen and acknowledge the concerns being raised but not inevitably take action on them iap2 2014 responding to all concerns is not made mandatory at this level as the decisions made earlier were taken with public consent this level of the public participation framework addresses three csfs namely full public participation public influence and communication listening and acknowledging public concerns issues and collecting their feedback will help to promote full public participation the information on how public inputs influenced the decision makes them feel that they are influential this exercise of the two way channel at this level in fact builds better communication between the ulb authority and public the tools or medium recommended for consultations at this level include public comments focus groups surveys public meetings public hearings and public comment devices nabatchi 2012 the public hearing is the most commonly used way to gather public input on governmental decisions written comments and interviews are also recommended for the same bruns 2003 3 3 4 involve in this level of participation the authorities are to be working with the public i e the public groups are invited to the workshops and or deliberate polling and their views have to be incorporated in decision making this level of participation is more than a consultation that just witnesses decisions taken in the project but ensures alternative arrangements on the public demand the public influence in this level could be so high that the decision of the government ulb can also be revised considering possible suggested alternatives the public involvement is promoted through interactive discussion e g workshops and encouraged to undertake express concerns grievances and finally welcoming new ideas however sometimes technical complexity and legislative mandate may limit agencies to share information and make decisions without involving the public csfs such as full public participation public influence and communication will be taken care of through this level of public participation using recommended involvement tools mediums such as workshops and deliberate polling 3 3 5 collaborate this level ensures public partnering for direct advice in decision making developing alternatives and identifying preferred solutions iap2 2014 it is framed as an enhanced two way channel between citizens and government where representatives have a seat at the table tambouris et al 2007 however this will require an active citizen partnering in regards to csfs this level would further enhance public influence on the project and its participation in decision making the recommended execution tools or mediums are citizen advisory committees consensus building and participatory decision making 3 3 6 capacity building capacity building of staff public through their training education on o m activities could help in improvement of their technical managerial and institutional knowledge pool this will result in better service delivery training is supposed to cover specific problems implies shorter contact times and attempts to offer directly applicable skills education will be aimed with a broader responsibility covering accurate knowledge insight applicable methodologies and professional attitude training and education could be delivered on water quality testing deciding and recording chemical dose to be applied and other operational activities hamdy et al 1998 csfs such as full public participation public influence and communication will be taken care of by this level and recommended tools mediums are workshops and training educational programs the unaddressed csfs i e timeliness and regulatory governance are already being addressed in the planning stage of the project life cycle the public participation is mandated through regulatory governance in a project with specification on how and when to conduct organize participation furthermore timings for participation is to be maintained and scheduled beforehand i e at the beginning of the project to avoid mess and chaos in participation 3 3 7 public stakeholder identification and analysis procedure public stakeholder identification is suggested to be carried out iteratively the influential people amongst individuals groups negotiators and representatives are chosen as public representatives or stakeholders through various approaches some of the commonly used approaches are focus group interviews expert opinion structured or semi structured questionnaire interview snow ball sampling brain storming brain writing and crawford slip sessions reed et al 2009 furthermore the importance of the influential stakeholders to the project should also be assessed by ulbs henjewele et al 2013 they will have to identify categorize and rank these groups according to the usefulness of the issues in the context of project success henjewele et al 2013 the prioritization and public stakeholder issue identification is to be worked out by asking the groups to submit position statements looking at previous public engagement reviewing the press releases and scrutiny of public statements this can also be achieved by taking opinions of public stakeholders around typical major issues direct public interviews organizing single or multi public stakeholder workshop and by going through on line forums or moderated blogs prieto 2011 3 3 8 identify solution and implement it to action information and public notification regarding the project are to be released to involve and collaborate with public helping identification of visions and desires from the project they should be made aware of the factors that may have an impact on the infrastructure feasible design layout alternatives are to be presented to the interested groups or the public each design alternative is to be discussed exclusively against the design criteria integrating the input from the public once the design group has established details of the favoured design alternative additional public involvement meeting is to be held for detailed discussion and modification for maximum convenience and aesthetic appeal ng et al 2013 the traditional tools adopted are brainstorming session direct discussion public hearings district forums and written responses roving exhibitions and surveys 3 3 9 contextual policy reform the framework includes contextual policy reform with an intention to include the rich understanding of situational changes in the context of the local attitudes within this framework contextual policy is defined as the assortment of influences or potential influences affecting public participation approach in water supply projects such influences may or may not exist for a particular situation region but is subjected to local approach like mistrust among people elite capture role of gate keepers or local politics issue contextual policy reform remains as a stationary unit for the whole project life cycle and this will address the context issue situation arising in project area this unit will serve to tackle important issues that leads to project failure e g mistrust in the implementing authority it arises when participation is not worth the effort and that the decisions were already made and public input is merely a formality to oust mistrust the process has to be open and transparent this unit will work on such issues and will ensure the authority to make financial information and audits available for public review giering 2011 a different barrier to public participation is elite capture that leads to corrupt planning and governance dasgupta and beard 2007 in the case of elite capture the individuals in society that exercise disproportionate and unacceptable access to social political or economic power manipulate the processes to secure undue benefits for themselves government administrators tend to endorse this bond and avoid public stakeholder s participation an example from the indian state of kerala stands as a strategy to overcome this issue wherein a citizen campaign for decentralized planning was undertaken to provide opportunities for citizen groups and stakeholders to participate in local development projects by including processes like capacity building of training and mentoring similarly in thailand citizen hearing has been made compulsory through legal provision during the implementation of local development programs waheduzzaman et al 2018 this strategy will encourage involvement inclusion of local non government organizations ngos in spreading awareness and monitoring public participation in government programs it is being reported that the government representatives and officials tend to support these elites to keep their control safe and minimize disapprovals or moves by their political opponents waheduzzaman et al 2018 waheduzzaman et al 2018 in their study believed that government bureaucrats elected representatives influential business people and social elites including public leaders is largely responsible for jeopardizing the participatory governance process in development projects it is further argued that the increasing number of local representatives may not be enough to diminish the effect of elite capture the contextual policy reform unit presented here will address the concern of elite capture through legal governance thereby making public participation compulsory including training for public officials and community leaders an awareness program for local citizens and inclusion of ngos in local development programs waheduzzaman et al 2018 moreover many researchers are of the concern that local politics influences public and their participation in such process has been done with the objective to build their reputation in their constituencies and increase political support ongoya and lumallas 2005 damoah et al 2018 continued centralized control over the projects and or the often hidden role of political representatives pose as a hurdle for effective institutional mechanism project committees have been used as instruments of benefaction distribution leading to corruption neglecting poor and disadvantaged in the project stages damoah et al 2018 in the study by ongoya and lumallas 2005 it was identified that political pressure was encountered in projects undertaken in their locality and that political influence was present in both implementation and selection of crucial committees for the management of these projects management of the projects needs to be detached completely from politics so that the public can make appropriate decisions on the management of these projects without political interference we speculate that these issues will be taken care by constitution of strong contextual policy reform unit 4 framework validation the descriptive statistics derived from the statistical analysis of the responses provided by the experts who had participated in the validation study for each validation aspect are shown in table 6 the experts were requested to rate six aspects of the framework using a likert scale of 1 5 a mean score above 3 would signify satisfactory performance for that particular aspect the results showed that all the aspects were rated significantly high i e above 3 by the experts the aspect rated highest was 4 13 for degree of practicality and the aspect with the lowest mean score was 3 38 for degree of replicability therefore it can be interpreted that the newly developed framework was validated to be appropriate objective replicable practicable reliable and suitability for water supply in south west guwahati 5 lessons learnt from failed water supply projects studies from various parts of the world suggested the need to accord more attention to secondary stakeholders as they pose an important and influential link to disrupt an infrastructure project di maddaloni and davis 2017 olander and landin 2008 integrating public through a guideline or a governance structure or a framework would ensure better and easy implementation of decisions a framework can serve as an early warning system for public concerns a means through which accurate and timely information can be distributed and can contribute to acceptable decision making iap2 2014 however it should ensure early public involvement for better decisions and greater public acceptance ozerol and newig 2008 public deeply value service consistency and compliance of contractual agreement from their service providers hence it is crucial to not only deliver good public service at first but to keep on delivering service at the level thereby ensuring public satisfaction it is needed to focus on making sure that interactions communication with the public is consistent and quality based it is only logical that a consumer s confidence in the organization will increase if a consistent level of quality is delivered zeithaml et al 1993 if the scope of the participatory process involves the whole public it should be ensured that every member of the public has equal opportunities to reach the information supply and to give feedback ozerol and newig 2008 there should be no priorities or differences among the public members moreover the process of inducing tariff water quality awareness and decision making is to be transparent by being transparent public suspicions about the sponsors and their motives may likely be allayed transparency might involve releasing information on aspects of the procedure varying from the manner of the selection of the public participants to how a decision is reached to the minutes of meetings if any information needs to be withheld from the public or are not educated on a particular event for reasons of sensitivity or security it would seem important to admit the nature of what is being withheld and why rather than risking the discovery of such secrecy with subsequent adverse reactions rowe and frewer 2000 6 conclusions the current study focusses on the primary and secondary data for public participation in water supply projects the study identifies csfs for public participation and studies the relevancy of these csfs in the study area of south west guwahati a public participation framework has been developed to deemphasize the effects of disincentives in water supply projects this framework is grounded on primary secondary data and theories of public participation qualitative primary interview data were collected through a semi structured questionnaire for the study area of public participation in the south west guwahati water supply project analysis of data using nvivo revealed 11 eleven themes for public participation moreover 9 csfs identified from secondary data analysis were found to be quite relevant for the study area of the water supply project the framework is envisaged to enhance public acceptance timely completion and successful comprehensive management of a project through various levels of public participation moreover satisfactory ratings for all aspects of framework validation demonstrated that the newly developed public participation framework is appropriate objective replicable practical reliable and suitable for water supply projects 6 1 limitations and future research directions g practical limitations do exist adopting this framework in a real case scenario the public may panic with non availability of alternative water sources when informed about household groundwater quality this should be taken into consideration while adopting this framework h the expert panel for the development of a framework and its validation was the same this might have created biasness in the validation of the framework i intricacies of public participation in the water sector especially in india through many gatekeepers at the local level would present further insightful aspects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

18507,high energy consumption is a critical problem for wastewater treatment systems currently monitored using conventional single point probes and operated with manual or automatic open loop control strategies exhibiting significant time lag this challenge is addressed in this study by profiling the variation of three critical water quality parameters conductivity temperature and ph along the depth of a reactor at high spatiotemporal resolution in a real time mode using flat thin milli electrode array mea sensors the profiling accurately captured the heterogeneous status of the reactor under transient shocks conductivity and ph and slow lingering shock temperature providing an effective dataset to optimize the chemical dosage and energy requirement of wastewater treatment systems transient shock models were developed to validate the mea profiles and calculate mass transfer coefficients monte carlo simulation revealed high resolution mea profiling combined with fast closed loop control strategies can save 59 50 of energy consumption temperature and oxygen consumption controls and 45 29 of chemical dosage and reach 16 28 performance improvement over the benchmark defined with ideal conditions compared with traditional single point sensors that could only monitor the entire system through a single process state this study demonstrated the capability of mea sensors to profile reactor heterogeneity visualize the variation of water quality at high resolution provide complete datasets for accurate control and ultimately lead to energy saving operation with high

real time decoding of the black box of wastewater systems multiparameter meters e g hach ysi integrating multiple probes into a single cartridge have been widely used however these types of sensors not only occupy a large space diameter 0 4 m length 1 1 5 m but they are costly 25 000 50 000 per meter due to complicated sensor materials waterproof layers anti biofouling layers data transfer and electronic units and development and commercialization related costs linsenmeier and yancey 1987 such a high cost and large space requirement make mass deployment of such sensors along the depth and length of wastewater systems infeasible furthermore current monitoring technologies only utilize single point probes to monitor only one point of the entire systems dewettinck et al 2001 beltrá et al 2003 nowack 2003 jin et al 2004 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 yu et al 2009 therefore cost beneficial easy to deploy sensor arrays should be developed for profiling multiple parameters at multiple points for capturing the dynamic heterogeneous states of the system microelectrodes have been developed in last two decades especially the micro scale glass pipette electrodes bishop and yu 1999 lee et al 2007 korostynska et al 2012 however the fragile glass pipette structure time consuming fabrication and the need for bulky micromanipulators to position microelectrodes have posed severe problems for field application jensen et al 2011 krause et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2017 recently developed milli electrodes fabricated by photolithography with chemical vapor deposition pcvd have been

addition these miniature sized electrodes possess distinct advantages over traditional large electrodes including compact structure addressable multiple types of sensors and minimal intrusion to biochemical systems finite element simulations have become a powerful tool to elucidate the heterogeneous state of wastewater systems grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa has been widely used for finite element simulation and has the capability to simulate the incorporation and coupling of diverse physical phenomena within one model grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 the desired phenomena often originate from traditionally separate fields of applied physics and engineering to investigate the heterogeneous states of wastewater systems a study involving fluid dynamics mass transport heat transfer and charge transfer is necessary grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 multiphysics simulations can provide physical insight and predict concentration or temperature profiles by capturing accurately the relevant phenomena the breakthrough of this study lies in high fidelity profiling of the heterogeneity in a reactor using a series of mea sensors and validated by numerical finite element simulations in comsol multiphysics through which the fluctuation of water quality can be readily visualized in a spatiotemporal fashion there are three major tasks in this study first the variation of three water quality parameters conductivity temperature and ph along the depth of a reactor was profiled using mea sensors under steady state and transient shocks second the heterogeneity of two physical parameters conductivity and temperature in the reactor was validated by comsol multiphysics simulations of multiple physical phenomena finally energy savings chemical savings and treatment performance as the result of high resolution mea profiling were estimated using monte carlo simulation and compared side by side with traditional single point sensing technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 three types of mea sensors three important water quality parameters conductivity levlin 2010 temperature ahsan et al 2005 and ph systems were targeted in this study all types of mea sensors each size 2 cm 0 5 cm were precisely printed on a kapton fpc polyimide film thickness 127 μm american durafilm by a dimatix materials printer modeldmp 2800 fujifilm dimatix inc as previously described fig 1 a xu et al 2016 2017 the signal output of the conductivity and temperature meas is electrical resistance in units of milliohm while the signal output of the ph meas is electrical potential in units of millivolts 2 2 experiment setup the batch mode reactor was a plastic cylinder with a diameter of 62 mm and a height of 180 mm the reactor s heterogeneous state was profiled in real time using three of each type of mea sensors clipped by 3d printed holders on three locations along the depth of the reactor fig 1b and 1c top location 40 mm below the water surface middle location 85 mm below the water surface and deep location 130 mm below the water surface since the location of the shock injection could affect mass transfer and chemical profiles along the reactor depth the injection points were positioned at the same depth as the three holders fig 1 to assure the accurate injection point of shock solutions conductivity and ph while temperature shock was introduced only through heating the bottom surface of the reactor fig 1c before the shock tests the solution in the reactor was well mixed and the readings of each mea sensor were recorded using a multi channel potentiostat 1040c 8 channel potentiostat ch instruments inc every 2 s for over 10 min for each shock test the transient shock was injected individually into one of the three locations top middle and deep using a syringe located at the same height of the mea sensors the water solution in the reactor was continuously stirred using a cubic stirring bar size 38 6 5 6 5 mm on the bottom of the reactor with a rotation rate of 50 rpm for conductivity temperature and ph shock experiments and at 200 rpm for additional conductivity and temperature shock experiments 2 3 mea profiling along the depth of a reactor under shocks for conductivity shocks 200 μl 100 g l sodium chloride nacl fisher science co was injected into the reactor with the initial solution of 380 ml sodium chloride 2 mg l nacl the initial conductivity of the solution was measured as 4 42 0 22 μs cm using a commercial conductivity sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter for ph shock 200 μl of 1 m potassium hydroxide solution koh fisher science co mixed in 2 mg l nacl solution ph 14 was injected into the reactor with the initial ph of 7 22 380 ml nacl 2 mg l solution the ph of the water solution was validated using a commercial ph sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star ph meter for temperature shock the heating source was a heating plate located at the bottom of the reactor with the initial temperature of the water solution of 18 5 0 12 c room temperature the temperature of the water solution was measured using a commercial temperature sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter the heating plate surface temperature increased from room temperature to 200 c within 30 s and then dropped gradually to room temperature over 12 min fig s1 all shock tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 model development and validation numerical finite element models were developed in comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa to validate the aforementioned mea profiles flow in the reactor was modeled by the navier stokes equations using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 eq 1 and eq 2 1 ρ t x t ρ ρ u 0 2 ρ u t x t u ρ u u p i τ f here ρ is density u v r t where v is the velocity vector in the rotating coordinate system and r is the position vector t is the mesh reference time x is a function of angular velocity and time p is pressure τ is shear stress and f is the external force vector to simulate the flow in the reactor a fixed domain and a rotating domain were defined and coupled using a continuity boundary condition on the common interior walls no slip boundary conditions were imposed at the exterior walls of the reactor representing no fluid velocity at the solid walls of the reactor additionally a zero shear stress condition was assumed on the top boundary the flow field was modeled by the frozen rotor assumption a special case of steady state to avoid computationally expensive simulations 2 5 monte carlo simulation of energy saving and treatment performance improvement in treatment systems using high resolution mea profiling monte carlo simulation was used to simulate energy savings chemical dose savings and treatment performance improvement with high resolution mea profiling and accurate feedback control mooney 1997 williams and ebel 2014 three targeted parameters temperature conductivity and ph were assumed to vary steadily throughout the length of a plug flow reactor pfr with an aerobic nitrification tank as the example in this study in contrast the homogeneity of ideal completely stirred tank reactors cstr would lead to the identical readings of all mea sensors deployed along the reactors existing single point sensors can only monitor the worst case scenario in order to meet the requirement of effluent water quality and consequently cause energy overconsumption chemical overuse and low treatment performance for the areas without monitoring thereby monte carlo simulation was used to predict the heterogeneity of these three parameters measured by multiple units of mea sensors along pfr in the monte carlo simulation the single point sensor would be positioned at the beginning section or the end section of the plug flow reactor while multiple mea sensors eight mea units of each type were assumed in this study would be positioned uniformly along the length of the tank and connected to the air supply for aeration and chemical pump for dosage controlled in a real time mode two assumptions were made to simplify monte carlo simulation first biochemical reactions e g cod removal nitrification progress uniformly along the length of the pfr so that these three parameters temperature conductivity and ph would change linearly along the reactor second these three parameters would be sampled from a uniform distribution in each zone monitored by meas the energy savings was calculated from the monte carlo simulation of temperature and conductivity the chemical dosage savings was calculated from the monte carlo simulation of ph and treatment performance was calculated by simplifying the relationship between temperature and biologic reactions the optimum temperature for biochemical reactions in wastewater is 30 c at which treatment performance is defined as 100 and declines with both higher and lower operating temperatures than the optimum the monte carlo simulation was performed with 10 000 iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 mea profiling of conductivity under transient shocks the initial conductivity of the solution 2 mg l nacl in the reactor was 4 42 0 22 μs cm with the shock solution 2 μl nacl solution 100 g l being injected at the top location 40 mm below the water surface on the 60th second after reaching steady state the conductivity increased rapidly in the first 35 s after the shock table 1 the peak value of the conductivities at the top middle and deep positions of the reactor were 318 33 8 19 μs cm 68 82 1 45 μs cm and 88 52 2 03 μs cm respectively indicating that the top mea increased fastest as it was the closest to the shock injection fig 2 a the peak value of the middle mea being lower than that of the deep mea can be explained by the slow mass transfer in the possible dead zone within the middle section the stirring bar on the bottom of the reactor caused more vigorous mixing within the deep section than in the middle section huang et al 2018 leading to the shortcut of mass transfer from the top section to the deep section and the lower mass transfer to the middle section the conductivity of the top mea dropped gradually over 190 s to the steady state conductivity of 106 11 2 55 μs cm while the conductivity readings of the middle and deep mea dropped gradually in 20 s and then slowly increased to the steady state conductivity of 106 11 2 55 μs cm with the shock solution 2 μl nacl solution 100 g l being injected at the middle location 85 mm below the water surface the conductivity peak value of the middle mea was highest among the three meas fig 2b demonstrating that the injection location influences the diffusion pattern of na and cl ions in the reactor it should be noted that the conductivity reading of the deep mea was slightly higher than that of the top mea in the first 170 s post injection which was caused by faster mass transfer from more vigorous mixing in the deep section than in the top section since the stirring bar was located on the bottom of the reactor the results of the shock injection at the deep location fig 2c confirmed that the shock location and the stirring bar location are two key factors for the observed transient conductivity profiles fig s2a the conductivity readings of the top mea under top shock the middle mea under middle shock and the deep mea under deep shock reached the maximum value of 318 μs cm and then dropped sharply to the final value of 106 μs cm fig 2d indicating that nacl diffusion occurred similarly near the shock injection location even at the slow mixing rate 50 rpm it should be noted that the peak for the middle mea was much wider than the top and deep meas fig 2d which corresponded well with its relatively slow response time after the peak table 1 and supports the claim that the middle section had the lowest rate of mass transfer in contrast the response time of mea sensors was similar for all three shocks at the high mixing rate 200 rpm fig s3 demonstrating that the difference of diffusion rate among these three position shocks declined with mixing intensity as the result of faster mass transfer under a higher mixing rate with the initial concentration of nacl solution as 2 mg l and the shock concentration of nacl solution as 100 g l the final concentration of the bulk nacl solution should be 54 60 mg l and the theoretical conductivity should be around 105 μs cm which matched well with the bulk solution conductivity 106 μs cm measured by the commercial conductivity sensor and the stable readings of three conductivity meas 220 s after the shock tests fig 2 the heterogeneous conductivities measured by meas were validated using an electrical conductivity ec model simulation that mainly includes two partial differential equations pdes consisting of mass transport and fluid dynamics fig s4 according to the fluid dynamics simulation the particle movement water molecule with na and cl ions 0 04 0 08 m s within the deep location was much faster than 0 01 m s within the top location fig s4 examples of the streamlines and nacl concentration iso surfaces for one snapshot in time t 2 5s are shown in fig s4 furthermore the comparison between experimental and simulation results for ec heterogeneity was conducted in dimensionless form fig 3 a c since the release volume and the rate of release of the nacl shock was difficult to be standardized and thus impossible to be faithfully reproduced in the simulation the simulation and experimental results followed the same trend for the conductivity mea closest to the shock location e g top mea under top shock middle mea under middle shock and deep mea under deep shock fig 3a c however there was a large discrepancy between the cfd simulated result and the sensor profiles of middle mea under the middle shock fig 3b which had the lowest mass transfer effectiveness the possible reason was that cfd simulation only considered the ideal condition e g smoothness of the reactor well mixing and neglected the slow mass transfer in the middle location when the mixing rate was accelerated to 200 rpm the mass transfer became much faster than that at 50 rpm based on the response time figs 4a 1 4b 1 4c 1 and table 1 which was clearly visualized using the mea profiling high resolution mea profiling provided sufficient datasets to determine the volumetric mass transfer coefficient in the reactor de figueiredo and calderbank 1979 johnson et al 1990 the profiling results and numerical data were fitted to the solution of the differential equation using linear regression on the semi log transformed data assuming that the exponential decay starts at the peak concentration garcia ochoa and gomez 1998 3 c l c 1 α e k l t where c l is the liquid phase concentration at a given point in time c is the fully mixed concentration k l is the mass transfer coefficient and α is an adjustable parameter for better fitting in the rising or falling limbs of the curves by fitting the solution of the differential equation eq 3 to the data obtained from three shock locations the mass transfer coefficient was estimated figs 4a 2 b 2 c 2 the fitted k l ranges from 0 02 to 0 23 s 1 for the experimental and numerical results discussed herein which is in reasonable agreement with the results mass transfer coefficients range between 0 015 and 0 04 s 1 and 0 3 to 0 7 s 1 previously reported ogut and hatch 1988 valverde et al 2016 and thus validate the cfd model 3 2 heterogeneity mea profiling of ph under transient shocks ph adjustment in water and wastewater treatment systems has been normally conducted by adding acidic basic chemicals and monitoring using single point ph sensors ai ghusain et al 1994 choi and park 2001 wunderlin et al 2012 this approach fails at capturing the transient sharp change along spatial dimensions of systems in this study the initial ph of the solution 0 2 mg l nacl in the reactor was 7 22 and the ph of the shock solution 1 m koh solution was 14 0 so that the final ph of the mixed solution should be 10 based on static models the final ph of the mixed solution measured by the ph meas was 10 24 0 19 which was similar to the values 10 22 0 02 measured by the commercial ph sensor the behavior of ph and related phenomena are considered as the functions of time during the dynamic process ylén 2001 the flow dynamics in the continuous flow process is described with partial material balances as 4 d a d t 1 v f a 0 f a where a is the concentration of ion a t is the time v is the volume of the reactor 378 ml and f is flow rate of the ion and a 0 is the ion a concentration of the influent due to the small volume of the ph shock solution 2 μl the change in v can be neglected when 2 μl of koh solution 1 m ph 14 was injected at the top of the reactor the ph reading of the top mea increased promptly in the first 8 s and then dropped gradually within 32 s to the steady state ph of 10 24 0 19 the maximum ph readings oat the top middle and deep locations of the reactor were 13 80 0 24 11 51 0 33 and 10 85 0 34 respectively indicating that ph decreased along the depth as the shock injection was near the top fig 5 a this fits jean s ph dynamic model of the strong base strong acid ylén 2001 the response of the middle mea and deep mea started on the 64th and 66th second respectively which was slower than that of the top mea 60th second this disparity is demonstrated by the flow dynamic equation eq 4 in which the distance between the sensors and the shock caused different response times table 1 in contrast the response time of the middle and deep conductivity meas were not delayed in the conductivity profiles fig 2a which could be explained by different mass transfer patterns in the water solution fig s1b the mass transfer under conductivity shocks was mainly ion diffusion na and cl driven by the mixing effect located on the bottom of the reactor leading to the slowest mass transfer in the middle section fig s2a however the mass transfer under ph shocks was correlated with ion diffusion as well as the bond of proton h with hydroxide ions oh ylén 2001 which caused continuous mass transport between adjacent sections fig s2b leading to fast mass transfer and fast response of meas to the ph shock table 1 for the ph shock on the middle location the ph reading of the middle mea jumped to 13 80 0 11 within the first 8 s and then gradually dropped to the ph of 10 24 0 09 fig 5b at 74 s after the shock during the whole shock test period the ph of the middle mea was always higher than that of the deep mea while the top mea had the lowest ph value the ph of the middle position increased faster than that on the top and deep locations due to short distance to the shock the middle position for the ph shock at the deep location the deep mea promptly captured the ph increase and the reading jumped faster than that at the top position due to the mixing effect fig 5c the readings of the top mea under top shock the middle mea under middle shock and the deep mea under deep shock jumped promptly to the maximum ph around 13 8 and then dropped gradually to the final ph of 10 22 fig 5d corresponding to the longest duration from the peak ph to the final ph table 1 the middle mea after middle shock exhibited the largest width of the peak fig 5d indicating that the middle section of the reactor had the slowest mixing effectiveness additionally although the pattern of the ph profiles was similar to that of the conductivity profiles figs 2a and 5a the mea sensors had much faster response to ph shocks than to conductivity shocks 30s vs 220s figs 2d and 5d table 1 which was caused by the strong acid ionization reaction in the ph shock besides promptly capturing the system heterogeneity under transient shocks both conductivity and ph profiles revealed that mea sensors could monitor the system homogeneity of uniform mixing in this batch mode cstr reactor before shock introduction 0 60 s figs 2a and 5a and after the reactor recovered to equilibrium after 250 s under conductivity shock fig 2a and after 140 s under ph shock fig 5a this well demonstrated the capability of high resolution mea profiling to validate the homogeneity of uniform complete mixing under steady status as well as capture the heterogeneity under transient shocks 3 3 heterogeneity mea profiling of temperature under slow lingering shock temperature shock normally occurs when a spike of industrial wastewater e g dairy farm slaughterhouse flows into municipal wastewater treatment plants borja and banks 1995 massé and masse 2001 ahsan et al 2005 in this study the initial steady state temperature of the solution was 18 5 0 12 c throughout the well mixed reactor the temperature shock was introduced only at the bottom surface of the reactor through an external heating plate that gradually raised the temperature of the water solution for 30 s fig 6 a and fig s1 which was slower and lasted much longer than the conductivity shock and ph shock the response pattern at fast mixing rate 200 rpm was not substantially different from that at slow mixing rate 50 rpm table 1 and fig 6a and 6d however during the initial heating period 60s 300s the temperature increase rate 0 017 c s at 200 rpm was faster than that 0 014 c s at 50 rpm demonstrating that mixing intensity indeed affected heat transfer in the water solution to compare the temperature heterogeneity profiling under this slow lingering temperature shock a heat transfer simulation was performed with the initial temperature of 18 5 c in the reactor the flow profile used in this model was the same as the one used for the solute transport model showing an excellent agreement between simulation and experimental results for all the three locations of temperature meas fig 6b and 6c the temperature readings of three meas on the top middle and deep locations of the reactor increased gradually to the final temperature 24 90 0 18 c fig 6b which matched well the readings of the commercial temperature sensor unlike the transient shocks of conductivity and ph instantaneously injected to a specific location along the depth of the reactor the temperature shock was introduced steadily using the heating plate at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 through which the heat transferred slowly from the bottom to the top of the whole reactor and the temperature profiles did not exhibit sharp peaks at any moment because the temperature of the external heater was always higher than that of the water solution in the reactor during the entire heating shock experiment the temperature readings of three temperature meas increased monotonically with time until the water solution reached thermal equilibrium with the external heater after 540 s fig 6b and heat transfer stopped additionally the axial and tangential velocities were the highest at the deep location of the reactor due to the stirrer location aho and karvinen 2007 leading to the fastest rate of heat transfer along with this fast heat transfer the heater directly contacted with the reactor bottom and the length of the reactor was only 180 mm all of which resulted in the similar temperature readings of three meas along the reactor depth fig 6b 3 4 estimation of energy chemical dosage saving and treatment performance enhancement using monte carlo simulation based on the experimental results obtained from the mea profiles of three parameters energy saving operation through high fidelity mea profiling along the length of a plug flow aerobic nitrification tank was simulated using the monte carlo method fig 7 a the assumptions for the parameter variation through the tank are described below the temperature of wastewater increases along the length of the tank due to exothermic reactions carried out by microorganisms in wastewater hellinga et al 1998 with the normal range of 20 ºc 30 c and the optimal temperature of 30 c kim et al 2017 the ph decreases due to nitrification reactions with the normal range of 6 5 7 and the optimal ph of 7 0 ripley et al 1986 the conductivity can be used to indicate the nh4 concentration levlin 2010 through which the oxygen demand can be determined ruiz et al 2003 for treatment performance estimation it was directly related with microbial activities rajeshwari et al 2000 which was assumed to be 100 at water temperature of 30 c wijtes et al 1993 and drop to 15 when the temperature was down to 10 c and drop to 20 when the temperature up to 45 c in monte carlo simulation each parameter would vary linearly in the aforementioned range through the length of the plug flow system monitored by either single point sensor in a zone or multi mea sensors deployed in multiple zones along the system 8 zones in total in this simulation fig 7a the feedback control strategy can be executed based on the mea profiles to make the system operate at the optimal set point values in each zone which is expected to enhance the system performance and save energy for example temperature is assumed to increase from 20 c to 30 c along the length of the system and follow the uniform distribution in each zone so that the temperature would be a random number t between 20 and 21 25 in zone 1 fig 7a for the existing single point sensor e g located in the zone 1 the worst case scenario with the lowest temperature the temperature of the entire system would be increased by the value δ 30 t to reach the optimal set point temperature 30 c in contrast the high fidelity mea profiling in 8 zones along the system will enable more accurate control and temperature adjustment based on the specific need in each zone rather than the whole system fig 7b the consequent energy saving was estimated to be 46 58 compared with the single point sensor located in zone 1 table s1 the chemical dosage for ph adjustment based on the single point sensor was estimated based on the sensor location in zone 8 the worst case scenario with the lowest ph while the chemical dosage based on the mea sensors was calculated along the length of the system fig 7c which was observed to save 54 71 of chemical dosage compared with the single point sensor table s1 the conductivity can be used as the indicator for nh4 concentration in wastewater which can indirectly reflect oxygen requirement levlin 2010 the oxygen requirement controlled by the single point conductivity sensor located in zone 1 the worst case scenario with the highest nh4 concentration could lead to unnecessary over aeration while the conductivity mea sensors located along the system can reflect the variation of oxygen requirement fig 7d which was observed to save 34 40 of energy consumption compared with single point sensor table s1 treatment performance of the plug flow system was estimated at different temperatures along the system with the assumption that bacterial activity was optimal at the temperature of 30 c and led to the highest treatment performance while bacterial activity dropped at low or high temperatures and lowered the treatment performance for single point sensor monitoring it either missed the optimal temperature in the plug flow system or overestimated the system performance by taking the measured single point temperature as the optimal temperature in contrast multiple mea sensors captured the variation of temperature along the system and could execute a customized control in each zone so that the optimal temperature for bacterial activity can be adjusted individually fig 7e overall the energy consumption and chemical dosage in a plug flow system using multi mea profiling in 8 zones were 59 53 and 45 27 of the system with single point sensing respectively while the performance was 116 28 compared with those with single point sensing fig 7f table s1 however the monte carlo simulation predicted that the enhancement extent of energy saving and treatment performance was expected to steadily drop with more mea sensors being deployed fig s5 for example the rate of performance enhancement would drop to 0 1 when the sensor number was increased from 19 to 20 the optimized sensor deployment including sensor numbers and sensor distance should be considered in terms of monitoring performance and deployment economics in this study the parameters such as temperature were assumed to vary linearly along the plug flow reactor due to biochemical reactions the optimized sensor number can be calculated by the initial and the final concentrations supplementary material calculation s1 1 while the sensor deployment economics should balance the trade off between the sensor cost e g capital cost and maintenance and the system enhancement e g energy saving chemical saving and treatment performance supplementary material calculation s1 2 3 5 distinct advantages of multiple mea over traditional single point sensors the flat thin mm sized mea sensors developed possess distinct advantages over single point sensors including compact structure integration of

utilizing high resolution mea profiling in physiochemical and biochemical systems heterogeneous status e g ph and temperature variation along systems and abnormity e g influent shocks deficient aeration dead mixing zone could be promptly captured based on which efficient decision making strategies can be execute without time delay for enhanced stability and resilience in the meantime high resolution mea profiling can also validate the homogeneity incurred by complete mixing in cstr systems which clearly visualize systems and provide the real time information to ensure mixing effectiveness in contrast traditional single point sensors could not detect heterogeneity within the reactor under steady state and shocks nor validate homogeneity uniformity under complete mixing 3 6 significance of high fidelity mea profiling for energy saving wastewater treatment high resolution heterogeneity homogeneity profiling is essential for system visualization real time feedback control process analysis and energy consumption estimation in wastewater treatment systems such as aerobic tanks anaerobic digesters fermenters and disinfection contact tanks optimizing the performance and economics of wastewater treatment process operation relies on the ability to observe the states of the system accurately predict transient behavior and effectively manipulate its behavior in real time due to the scale and biochemical complexity of wastewater treatment operations there exists substantial solution heterogeneity throughout the process posing significant challenges to the operations

three typical operational parameters conductivity temperature and ph this study clearly demonstrates the heterogeneity of transient shocks in systems and the enhancement of energy savings and treatment performance using high resolution mea profiling 4 conclusions the high resolution sensors discussed herein enable fully characterizing the heterogeneous solution characteristics and subsequently validate predictive models e g the computational fluid dynamic model in turn these models and data can be used to generate and validate highly predictive reduced order models for nonlinear control of wastewater treatment processes mea profiling well captured the heterogeneity under transient shocks conductivity and ph and slow lingering shocks temperature along the reactor

18507,high energy consumption is a critical problem for wastewater treatment systems currently monitored using conventional single point probes and operated with manual or automatic open loop control strategies exhibiting significant time lag this challenge is addressed in this study by profiling the variation of three critical water quality parameters conductivity temperature and ph along the depth of a reactor at high spatiotemporal resolution in a real time mode using flat thin milli electrode array mea sensors the profiling accurately captured the heterogeneous status of the reactor under transient shocks conductivity and ph and slow lingering shock temperature providing an effective dataset to optimize the chemical dosage and energy requirement of wastewater treatment systems transient shock models were developed to validate the mea profiles and calculate mass transfer coefficients monte carlo simulation revealed high resolution mea profiling combined with fast closed loop control strategies can save 59 50 of energy consumption temperature and oxygen consumption controls and 45 29 of chemical dosage and reach 16 28 performance improvement over the benchmark defined with ideal conditions compared with traditional single point sensors that could only monitor the entire system through a single process state this study demonstrated the capability of mea sensors to profile reactor heterogeneity visualize the variation of water quality at high resolution provide complete datasets for accurate control and ultimately lead to energy saving operation with high

enhancement 1 introduction high energy consumption and low treatment performance are two critical problems for wastewater treatment systems currently monitored using conventional single point probes and operated with manual or automatic open loop control approaches vigorous mixing of oxygen and biomass within wastewater generates a heterogeneous environment where contaminant concentration varies along the depth and length of treatment systems chang et al 2002 le clech et al 2006 xu et al 2012 schaider et al 2017 however existing single point probes can only measure single process parameters or states e g ph redox potential and oxygen without capturing a complete picture of the heterogeneity within systems determining wastewater quality parameters e g chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen phosphonate and free chlorine has historically required tedious sampling and off site analysis dewettinck et al 2001 beltrá et al 2003 nowack 2003 jin et al 2004 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 yu

real time decoding of the black box of wastewater systems multiparameter meters e g hach ysi integrating multiple probes into a single cartridge have been widely used however these types of sensors not only occupy a large space diameter 0 4 m length 1 1 5 m but they are costly 25 000 50 000 per meter due to complicated sensor materials waterproof layers anti biofouling layers data transfer and electronic units and development and commercialization related costs linsenmeier and yancey 1987 such a high cost and large space requirement make mass deployment of such sensors along the depth and length of wastewater systems infeasible furthermore current monitoring technologies only utilize single point probes to monitor only one point of the entire systems dewettinck et al 2001 beltrá et al 2003 nowack 2003 jin et al 2004 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 yu et al 2009 therefore cost beneficial easy to deploy sensor arrays should be developed for profiling multiple parameters at multiple points for capturing the dynamic heterogeneous states of the system microelectrodes have been developed in last two decades especially the micro scale glass pipette electrodes bishop and yu 1999 lee et al 2007 korostynska et al 2012 however the fragile glass pipette structure time consuming fabrication and the need for bulky micromanipulators to position microelectrodes have posed severe problems for field application jensen et al 2011 krause et al 2013 xu et al 2016 2017 recently developed milli electrodes fabricated by photolithography with chemical vapor deposition pcvd have been limited by the strict fabrication conditions deployment difficulty in wastewater treatment systems and high cost photomask and metal deposition in pcvd protocols lee and lee 2003 lee et al 2008 yan et al 2011 flat thin mm sized electrochemical sensors are expected to tackle this challenge kinlen et al 1994 hahn et al 1995 marzouk et al 1998 ges et al 2007 ibanez and zamborini 2008 milli electrode

high spatiotemporal resolution which can capture heterogeneity throughout the entire reactor it could fundamentally transform the state of the art real time wastewater monitoring methodology in addition these miniature sized electrodes possess distinct advantages over traditional large electrodes including compact structure addressable multiple types of sensors and minimal intrusion to biochemical systems finite element simulations have become a powerful tool to elucidate the heterogeneous state of wastewater systems grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa has been widely used for finite element simulation and has the capability to simulate the incorporation and coupling of diverse physical phenomena within one model grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 the desired phenomena often originate from traditionally separate fields of applied physics and engineering to investigate the heterogeneous states of wastewater systems a study involving fluid dynamics mass transport heat transfer and charge transfer is necessary grilli et al 2013 dickinson et al 2014 odu et al 2016 adadevoh et al 2017 huang et al 2018 multiphysics simulations can provide physical insight and predict concentration or temperature profiles by capturing accurately the relevant phenomena the breakthrough of this study lies in high fidelity profiling of the heterogeneity in a reactor using a series of mea sensors and validated by numerical finite element simulations in comsol multiphysics through which the fluctuation of water quality can be readily visualized in a spatiotemporal fashion there are three major tasks in this study first the variation of three water quality parameters conductivity temperature and ph along the depth of a reactor was profiled using mea sensors under steady state and transient shocks second the heterogeneity of two physical parameters conductivity and temperature in the reactor was validated by comsol multiphysics simulations of multiple physical phenomena finally energy savings chemical savings and treatment performance as the result of high resolution mea profiling were estimated using monte carlo simulation and compared side by side with traditional single point sensing technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 three types of mea sensors three important water quality parameters conductivity levlin 2010 temperature ahsan et al 2005 and ph systems were targeted in this study all types of mea sensors each size 2 cm 0 5 cm were precisely printed on a kapton fpc polyimide film thickness 127 μm american durafilm by a dimatix materials printer modeldmp 2800 fujifilm dimatix inc as previously described fig 1 a xu et al 2016 2017 the signal output of the conductivity and temperature meas is electrical resistance in units of milliohm while the signal output of the ph meas is electrical potential in units of millivolts 2 2 experiment setup the batch mode reactor was a plastic cylinder with a diameter of 62 mm and a height of 180 mm the reactor s heterogeneous state was profiled in real time using three of each type of mea sensors clipped by 3d printed holders on three locations along the depth of the reactor fig 1b and 1c top location 40 mm below the water surface middle location 85 mm below the water surface and deep location 130 mm below the water surface since the location of the shock injection could affect mass transfer and chemical profiles along the reactor depth the injection points were positioned at the same depth as the three holders fig 1 to assure the accurate injection point of shock solutions conductivity and ph while temperature shock was introduced only through heating the bottom surface of the reactor fig 1c before the shock tests the solution in the reactor was well mixed and the readings of each mea sensor were recorded using a multi channel potentiostat 1040c 8 channel potentiostat ch instruments inc every 2 s for over 10 min for each shock test the transient shock was injected individually into one of the three locations top middle and deep using a syringe located at the same height of the mea sensors the water solution in the reactor was continuously stirred using a cubic stirring bar size 38 6 5 6 5 mm on the bottom of the reactor with a rotation rate of 50 rpm for conductivity temperature and ph shock experiments and at 200 rpm for additional conductivity and temperature shock experiments 2 3 mea profiling along the depth of a reactor under shocks for conductivity shocks 200 μl 100 g l sodium chloride nacl fisher science co was injected into the reactor with the initial solution of 380 ml sodium chloride 2 mg l nacl the initial conductivity of the solution was measured as 4 42 0 22 μs cm using a commercial conductivity sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter for ph shock 200 μl of 1 m potassium hydroxide solution koh fisher science co mixed in 2 mg l nacl solution ph 14 was injected into the reactor with the initial ph of 7 22 380 ml nacl 2 mg l solution the ph of the water solution was validated using a commercial ph sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star ph meter for temperature shock the heating source was a heating plate located at the bottom of the reactor with the initial temperature of the water solution of 18 5 0 12 c room temperature the temperature of the water solution was measured using a commercial temperature sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter the heating plate surface temperature increased from room temperature to 200 c within 30 s and then dropped gradually to room temperature over 12 min fig s1 all shock tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 model development and validation numerical finite element models were developed in comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa to validate the aforementioned mea profiles flow in the reactor was modeled by the navier stokes equations using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 eq 1 and eq 2 1 ρ t x t ρ ρ u 0 2 ρ u t x t u ρ u u p i τ f here ρ is density u v r t where v is the velocity vector in the rotating coordinate system and r is the position vector t is the mesh reference time x is a function of angular velocity and time p is pressure τ is shear stress and f is the external force vector to simulate the flow in the reactor a fixed domain and a rotating domain were defined and coupled using a continuity boundary condition on the common interior walls no slip boundary conditions were imposed at the exterior walls of the reactor representing no fluid velocity at the solid walls of the reactor additionally a zero shear stress condition was assumed on the top boundary the flow field was modeled by the frozen rotor assumption a special case of steady state to avoid computationally expensive simulations 2 5 monte carlo simulation of energy saving and treatment performance improvement in treatment systems using high resolution mea profiling monte carlo simulation was used to simulate energy savings chemical dose savings and treatment performance improvement with high resolution mea profiling and accurate feedback control mooney 1997 williams and ebel 2014 three targeted parameters temperature conductivity and ph were assumed to vary steadily throughout the length of a plug flow reactor pfr with an aerobic nitrification tank as the example in this study in contrast the homogeneity of ideal completely stirred tank reactors cstr would lead to the identical readings of all mea sensors deployed along the reactors existing single point sensors can only monitor the worst case scenario in order to meet the requirement of effluent water quality and consequently cause energy overconsumption chemical overuse and low treatment performance for the areas without monitoring thereby monte carlo simulation was used to predict the heterogeneity of these three parameters measured by multiple units of mea sensors along pfr in the monte carlo simulation the single point sensor would be positioned at the beginning section or the end section of the plug flow reactor while multiple mea sensors eight mea units of each type were assumed in this study would be positioned uniformly along the length of the tank and connected to the air supply for aeration and chemical pump for dosage controlled in a real time mode two assumptions were made to simplify monte carlo simulation first biochemical reactions e g cod removal nitrification progress uniformly along the length of the pfr so that these three parameters temperature conductivity and ph would change linearly along the reactor second these three parameters would be sampled from a uniform distribution in each zone monitored by meas the energy savings was calculated from the monte carlo simulation of temperature and conductivity the chemical dosage savings was calculated from the monte carlo simulation of ph and treatment performance was calculated by simplifying the relationship between temperature and biologic reactions the optimum temperature for biochemical reactions in wastewater is 30 c at which treatment performance is defined as 100 and declines with both higher and lower operating temperatures than the optimum the monte carlo simulation was performed with 10 000 iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 mea profiling of conductivity under transient shocks the initial conductivity of the solution 2 mg l nacl in the reactor was 4 42 0 22 μs cm with the shock solution 2 μl nacl solution 100 g l being injected at the top location 40 mm below the water surface on the 60th second after reaching steady state the conductivity increased rapidly in the first 35 s after the shock table 1 the peak value of the conductivities at the top middle and deep positions of the reactor were 318 33 8 19 μs cm 68 82 1 45 μs cm and 88 52 2 03 μs cm respectively indicating that the top mea increased fastest as it was the closest to the shock injection fig 2 a the peak value of the middle mea being lower than that of the deep mea can be explained by the slow mass transfer in the possible dead zone within the middle section the stirring bar on the bottom of the reactor caused more vigorous mixing within the deep section than in the middle section huang et al 2018 leading to the shortcut of mass transfer from the top section to the deep section and the lower mass transfer to the middle section the conductivity of the top mea dropped gradually over 190 s to the steady state conductivity of 106 11 2 55 μs cm while the conductivity readings of the middle and deep mea dropped gradually in 20 s and then slowly increased to the steady state conductivity of 106 11 2 55 μs cm with the shock solution 2 μl nacl solution 100 g l being injected at the middle location 85 mm below the water surface the conductivity peak value of the middle mea was highest among the three meas fig 2b demonstrating that the injection location influences the diffusion pattern of na and cl ions in the reactor it should be noted that the conductivity reading of the deep mea was slightly higher than that of the top mea in the first 170 s post injection which was caused by faster mass transfer from more vigorous mixing in the deep section than in the top section since the stirring bar was located on the bottom of the reactor the results of the shock injection at the deep location fig 2c confirmed that the shock location and the stirring bar location are two key factors for the observed transient conductivity profiles fig s2a the conductivity readings of the top mea under top shock the middle mea under middle shock and the deep mea under deep shock reached the maximum value of 318 μs cm and then dropped sharply to the final value of 106 μs cm fig 2d indicating that nacl diffusion occurred similarly near the shock injection location even at the slow mixing rate 50 rpm it should be noted that the peak for the middle mea was much wider than the top and deep meas fig 2d which corresponded well with its relatively slow response time after the peak table 1 and supports the claim that the middle section had the lowest rate of mass transfer in contrast the response time of mea sensors was similar for all three shocks at the high mixing rate 200 rpm fig s3 demonstrating that the difference of diffusion rate among these three position shocks declined with mixing intensity as the result of faster mass transfer under a higher mixing rate with the initial concentration of nacl solution as 2 mg l and the shock concentration of nacl solution as 100 g l the final concentration of the bulk nacl solution should be 54 60 mg l and the theoretical conductivity should be around 105 μs cm which matched well with the bulk solution conductivity 106 μs cm measured by the commercial conductivity sensor and the stable readings of three conductivity meas 220 s after the shock tests fig 2 the heterogeneous conductivities measured by meas were validated using an electrical conductivity ec model simulation that mainly includes two partial differential equations pdes consisting of mass transport and fluid dynamics fig s4 according to the fluid dynamics simulation the particle movement water molecule with na and cl ions 0 04 0 08 m s within the deep location was much faster than 0 01 m s within the top location fig s4 examples of the streamlines and nacl concentration iso surfaces for one snapshot in time t 2 5s are shown in fig s4 furthermore the comparison between experimental and simulation results for ec heterogeneity was conducted in dimensionless form fig 3 a c since the release volume and the rate of release of the nacl shock was difficult to be standardized and thus impossible to be faithfully reproduced in the simulation the simulation and experimental results followed the same trend for the conductivity mea closest to the shock location e g top mea under top shock middle mea under middle shock and deep mea under deep shock fig 3a c however there was a large discrepancy between the cfd simulated result and the sensor profiles of middle mea under the middle shock fig 3b which had the lowest mass transfer effectiveness the possible reason was that cfd simulation only considered the ideal condition e g smoothness of the reactor well mixing and neglected the slow mass transfer in the middle location when the mixing rate was accelerated to 200 rpm the mass transfer became much faster than that at 50 rpm based on the response time figs 4a 1 4b 1 4c 1 and table 1 which was clearly visualized using the mea profiling high resolution mea profiling provided sufficient datasets to determine the volumetric mass transfer coefficient in the reactor de figueiredo and calderbank 1979 johnson et al 1990 the profiling results and numerical data were fitted to the solution of the differential equation using linear regression on the semi log transformed data assuming that the exponential decay starts at the peak concentration garcia ochoa and gomez 1998 3 c l c 1 α e k l t where c l is the liquid phase concentration at a given point in time c is the fully mixed concentration k l is the mass transfer coefficient and α is an adjustable parameter for better fitting in the rising or falling limbs of the curves by fitting the solution of the differential equation eq 3 to the data obtained from three shock locations the mass transfer coefficient was estimated figs 4a 2 b 2 c 2 the fitted k l ranges from 0 02 to 0 23 s 1 for the experimental and numerical results discussed herein which is in reasonable agreement with the results mass transfer coefficients range between 0 015 and 0 04 s 1 and 0 3 to 0 7 s 1 previously reported ogut and hatch 1988 valverde et al 2016 and thus validate the cfd model 3 2 heterogeneity mea profiling of ph under transient shocks ph adjustment in water and wastewater treatment systems has been normally conducted by adding acidic basic chemicals and monitoring using single point ph sensors ai ghusain et al 1994 choi and park 2001 wunderlin et al 2012 this approach fails at capturing the transient sharp change along spatial dimensions of systems in this study the initial ph of the solution 0 2 mg l nacl in the reactor was 7 22 and the ph of the shock solution 1 m koh solution was 14 0 so that the final ph of the mixed solution should be 10 based on static models the final ph of the mixed solution measured by the ph meas was 10 24 0 19 which was similar to the values 10 22 0 02 measured by the commercial ph sensor the behavior of ph and related phenomena are considered as the functions of time during the dynamic process ylén 2001 the flow dynamics in the continuous flow process is described with partial material balances as 4 d a d t 1 v f a 0 f a where a is the concentration of ion a t is the time v is the volume of the reactor 378 ml and f is flow rate of the ion and a 0 is the ion a concentration of the influent due to the small volume of the ph shock solution 2 μl the change in v can be neglected when 2 μl of koh solution 1 m ph 14 was injected at the top of the reactor the ph reading of the top mea increased promptly in the first 8 s and then dropped gradually within 32 s to the steady state ph of 10 24 0 19 the maximum ph readings oat the top middle and deep locations of the reactor were 13 80 0 24 11 51 0 33 and 10 85 0 34 respectively indicating that ph decreased along the depth as the shock injection was near the top fig 5 a this fits jean s ph dynamic model of the strong base strong acid ylén 2001 the response of the middle mea and deep mea started on the 64th and 66th second respectively which was slower than that of the top mea 60th second this disparity is demonstrated by the flow dynamic equation eq 4 in which the distance between the sensors and the shock caused different response times table 1 in contrast the response time of the middle and deep conductivity meas were not delayed in the conductivity profiles fig 2a which could be explained by different mass transfer patterns in the water solution fig s1b the mass transfer under conductivity shocks was mainly ion diffusion na and cl driven by the mixing effect located on the bottom of the reactor leading to the slowest mass transfer in the middle section fig s2a however the mass transfer under ph shocks was correlated with ion diffusion as well as the bond of proton h with hydroxide ions oh ylén 2001 which caused continuous mass transport between adjacent sections fig s2b leading to fast mass transfer and fast response of meas to the ph shock table 1 for the ph shock on the middle location the ph reading of the middle mea jumped to 13 80 0 11 within the first 8 s and then gradually dropped to the ph of 10 24 0 09 fig 5b at 74 s after the shock during the whole shock test period the ph of the middle mea was always higher than that of the deep mea while the top mea had the lowest ph value the ph of the middle position increased faster than that on the top and deep locations due to short distance to the shock the middle position for the ph shock at the deep location the deep mea promptly captured the ph increase and the reading jumped faster than that at the top position due to the mixing effect fig 5c the readings of the top mea under top shock the middle mea under middle shock and the deep mea under deep shock jumped promptly to the maximum ph around 13 8 and then dropped gradually to the final ph of 10 22 fig 5d corresponding to the longest duration from the peak ph to the final ph table 1 the middle mea after middle shock exhibited the largest width of the peak fig 5d indicating that the middle section of the reactor had the slowest mixing effectiveness additionally although the pattern of the ph profiles was similar to that of the conductivity profiles figs 2a and 5a the mea sensors had much faster response to ph shocks than to conductivity shocks 30s vs 220s figs 2d and 5d table 1 which was caused by the strong acid ionization reaction in the ph shock besides promptly capturing the system heterogeneity under transient shocks both conductivity and ph profiles revealed that mea sensors could monitor the system homogeneity of uniform mixing in this batch mode cstr reactor before shock introduction 0 60 s figs 2a and 5a and after the reactor recovered to equilibrium after 250 s under conductivity shock fig 2a and after 140 s under ph shock fig 5a this well demonstrated the capability of high resolution mea profiling to validate the homogeneity of uniform complete mixing under steady status as well as capture the heterogeneity under transient shocks 3 3 heterogeneity mea profiling of temperature under slow lingering shock temperature shock normally occurs when a spike of industrial wastewater e g dairy farm slaughterhouse flows into municipal wastewater treatment plants borja and banks 1995 massé and masse 2001 ahsan et al 2005 in this study the initial steady state temperature of the solution was 18 5 0 12 c throughout the well mixed reactor the temperature shock was introduced only at the bottom surface of the reactor through an external heating plate that gradually raised the temperature of the water solution for 30 s fig 6 a and fig s1 which was slower and lasted much longer than the conductivity shock and ph shock the response pattern at fast mixing rate 200 rpm was not substantially different from that at slow mixing rate 50 rpm table 1 and fig 6a and 6d however during the initial heating period 60s 300s the temperature increase rate 0 017 c s at 200 rpm was faster than that 0 014 c s at 50 rpm demonstrating that mixing intensity indeed affected heat transfer in the water solution to compare the temperature heterogeneity profiling under this slow lingering temperature shock a heat transfer simulation was performed with the initial temperature of 18 5 c in the reactor the flow profile used in this model was the same as the one used for the solute transport model showing an excellent agreement between simulation and experimental results for all the three locations of temperature meas fig 6b and 6c the temperature readings of three meas on the top middle and deep locations of the reactor increased gradually to the final temperature 24 90 0 18 c fig 6b which matched well the readings of the commercial temperature sensor unlike the transient shocks of conductivity and ph instantaneously injected to a specific location along the depth of the reactor the temperature shock was introduced steadily using the heating plate at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 through which the heat transferred slowly from the bottom to the top of the whole reactor and the temperature profiles did not exhibit sharp peaks at any moment because the temperature of the external heater was always higher than that of the water solution in the reactor during the entire heating shock experiment the temperature readings of three temperature meas increased monotonically with time until the water solution reached thermal equilibrium with the external heater after 540 s fig 6b and heat transfer stopped additionally the axial and tangential velocities were the highest at the deep location of the reactor due to the stirrer location aho and karvinen 2007 leading to the fastest rate of heat transfer along with this fast heat transfer the heater directly contacted with the reactor bottom and the length of the reactor was only 180 mm all of which resulted in the similar temperature readings of three meas along the reactor depth fig 6b 3 4 estimation of energy chemical dosage saving and treatment performance enhancement using monte carlo simulation based on the experimental results obtained from the mea profiles of three parameters energy saving operation through high fidelity mea profiling along the length of a plug flow aerobic nitrification tank was simulated using the monte carlo method fig 7 a the assumptions for the parameter variation through the tank are described below the temperature of wastewater increases along the length of the tank due to exothermic reactions carried out by microorganisms in wastewater hellinga et al 1998 with the normal range of 20 ºc 30 c and the optimal temperature of 30 c kim et al 2017 the ph decreases due to nitrification reactions with the normal range of 6 5 7 and the optimal ph of 7 0 ripley et al 1986 the conductivity can be used to indicate the nh4 concentration levlin 2010 through which the oxygen demand can be determined ruiz et al 2003 for treatment performance estimation it was directly related with microbial activities rajeshwari et al 2000 which was assumed to be 100 at water temperature of 30 c wijtes et al 1993 and drop to 15 when the temperature was down to 10 c and drop to 20 when the temperature up to 45 c in monte carlo simulation each parameter would vary linearly in the aforementioned range through the length of the plug flow system monitored by either single point sensor in a zone or multi mea sensors deployed in multiple zones along the system 8 zones in total in this simulation fig 7a the feedback control strategy can be executed based on the mea profiles to make the system operate at the optimal set point values in each zone which is expected to enhance the system performance and save energy for example temperature is assumed to increase from 20 c to 30 c along the length of the system and follow the uniform distribution in each zone so that the temperature would be a random number t between 20 and 21 25 in zone 1 fig 7a for the existing single point sensor e g located in the zone 1 the worst case scenario with the lowest temperature the temperature of the entire system would be increased by the value δ 30 t to reach the optimal set point temperature 30 c in contrast the high fidelity mea profiling in 8 zones along the system will enable more accurate control and temperature adjustment based on the specific need in each zone rather than the whole system fig 7b the consequent energy saving was estimated to be 46 58 compared with the single point sensor located in zone 1 table s1 the chemical dosage for ph adjustment based on the single point sensor was estimated based on the sensor location in zone 8 the worst case scenario with the lowest ph while the chemical dosage based on the mea sensors was calculated along the length of the system fig 7c which was observed to save 54 71 of chemical dosage compared with the single point sensor table s1 the conductivity can be used as the indicator for nh4 concentration in wastewater which can indirectly reflect oxygen requirement levlin 2010 the oxygen requirement controlled by the single point conductivity sensor located in zone 1 the worst case scenario with the highest nh4 concentration could lead to unnecessary over aeration while the conductivity mea sensors located along the system can reflect the variation of oxygen requirement fig 7d which was observed to save 34 40 of energy consumption compared with single point sensor table s1 treatment performance of the plug flow system was estimated at different temperatures along the system with the assumption that bacterial activity was optimal at the temperature of 30 c and led to the highest treatment performance while bacterial activity dropped at low or high temperatures and lowered the treatment performance for single point sensor monitoring it either missed the optimal temperature in the plug flow system or overestimated the system performance by taking the measured single point temperature as the optimal temperature in contrast multiple mea sensors captured the variation of temperature along the system and could execute a customized control in each zone so that the optimal temperature for bacterial activity can be adjusted individually fig 7e overall the energy consumption and chemical dosage in a plug flow system using multi mea profiling in 8 zones were 59 53 and 45 27 of the system with single point sensing respectively while the performance was 116 28 compared with those with single point sensing fig 7f table s1 however the monte carlo simulation predicted that the enhancement extent of energy saving and treatment performance was expected to steadily drop with more mea sensors being deployed fig s5 for example the rate of performance enhancement would drop to 0 1 when the sensor number was increased from 19 to 20 the optimized sensor deployment including sensor numbers and sensor distance should be considered in terms of monitoring performance and deployment economics in this study the parameters such as temperature were assumed to vary linearly along the plug flow reactor due to biochemical reactions the optimized sensor number can be calculated by the initial and the final concentrations supplementary material calculation s1 1 while the sensor deployment economics should balance the trade off between the sensor cost e g capital cost and maintenance and the system enhancement e g energy saving chemical saving and treatment performance supplementary material calculation s1 2 3 5 distinct advantages of multiple mea over traditional single point sensors the flat thin mm sized mea sensors developed possess distinct advantages over single point sensors including compact structure integration of multiple types of miniature individually addressable sensors cost effective mass deployment to visualize systems at high spatiotemporal resolution and less intrusion to wastewater treatment units by utilizing high resolution mea profiling in physiochemical and biochemical systems heterogeneous status e g ph and temperature variation along systems and abnormity e g influent shocks deficient aeration dead mixing zone could be promptly captured based on which efficient decision making strategies can be execute without time delay for enhanced stability and resilience in the meantime high resolution mea profiling can also validate the homogeneity incurred by complete mixing in cstr systems which clearly visualize systems and provide the real time information to ensure mixing effectiveness in contrast traditional single point sensors could not detect heterogeneity within the reactor under steady state and shocks nor validate homogeneity uniformity under complete mixing 3 6 significance of high fidelity mea profiling for energy saving wastewater treatment high resolution heterogeneity homogeneity profiling is essential for system visualization real time feedback control process analysis and energy consumption estimation in wastewater treatment systems such as aerobic tanks anaerobic digesters fermenters and disinfection contact tanks optimizing the performance and economics of wastewater treatment process operation relies on the ability to observe the states of the system accurately predict transient behavior and effectively manipulate its behavior in real time due to the scale and biochemical complexity of wastewater treatment operations there exists substantial solution heterogeneity throughout the process posing significant challenges to the operations optimization problem as conventional systems lack the appropriate sensors to fully observe the system and therefore existing models can t be validated and used for real time control using the high

resolution controllability assure the real time optimization of operations in a closed loop fashion and ultimately lead to energy saving high performance robust and dynamic processes by targeting three typical operational parameters conductivity temperature and ph this study clearly demonstrates the heterogeneity of transient shocks in systems and the enhancement of energy savings and treatment performance using high resolution mea profiling 4 conclusions the high resolution sensors discussed herein enable fully characterizing the heterogeneous solution characteristics and subsequently validate predictive models e g the computational fluid dynamic model in turn these models and data can be used to generate and validate highly predictive reduced order models for nonlinear control of wastewater treatment processes mea profiling well captured the heterogeneity under transient shocks conductivity and ph and slow lingering shocks temperature along the reactor depth as well as homogeneity of uniform mixing under steady state monte carlo simulation estimated the energy saving chemical dosage saving and treatment performance enhancement in a system with multi mea profiling compared with the one with traditional single point sensor this study demonstrates that mea sensors have the immense potential to replace traditional expensive and bulky single point sensors to enable high resolution controllability that ensures the real time optimization of operations in a closed loop fashion enhances treatment performance and enables high resilience energy

transformations contribute to the carbon budget and thereby influence co2 emissions from aquatic systems several techniques have been developed that aim at an easy assessment of metabolic rates over long time periods or in many systems the 18 16o technique which utilizes the isotopic fractionation between 18o and 16o isotopes due to metabolic transformations is receiving increasing popularity in studies comparing the metabolism in many different lakes and served as basis for the conclusions that production increases with increasing atmospheric co2 and that surprisingly little terrestrial carbon is recycled in lakes of the arid circumpolar landscape however we demonstrate here that the steady state assumptions underlying the 18 16o technique cause large uncertainties in the estimated metabolic rates this conclusion is based on a sensitivity analysis using a numerical model of dissolved oxygen do and of dissolved 18o 18 o do but is also confirmed by published metabolic rates estimated from the 18 16o and the diel o2 techniques metabolic rates obtained from the 18 16o technique appear unsuited for correlation analyses between lakes but may provide reasonable estimates in systems with low and long term stable production in addition we illustrate that the combination of few 18o measurements with the diel o2 technique and an inverse fitting procedure can improve estimates of metabolic rates and in particular of respiration rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake metabolism diel o2 technique 18o isotope 18 16o technique production respiration 1 introduction lake metabolic rates have received much attention in recent years because they provide a quantitative link between the biocenosis and the carbon cycle in lakes bogard et al 2019 cole et al 2007 hanson et al 2003 hoellein et al 2013 staehr et al 2012 tranvik et al 2009 vogt et al 2017 understanding and quantification of the carbon fluxes between the inorganic and organic carbon pool in lakes and their link to primary production and respiration is important for the projection of greenhouse gas emissions from lakes and or uptake and storage of carbon in lakes under changing conditions several techniques have been proposed for the assessment of lake metabolic rates robinson and williams 2005 in recent years in situ techniques utilizing data on the diel change in concentrations of dissolved o2 do or dissolved inorganic carbon dic have been refined and employed in several studies honti and istvánovics 2019 obrador et al 2014 peeters et al 2016 solomon et al 2013 staehr et al 2010 in contrast to intensive field campaigns required by bottle techniques open water techniques typically utilize moored instruments for continuous high resolution collection of data on dissolved oxygen e g peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 or co2 peeters et al 2016 and therefore require only few visits of the field sites for maintenance of the moorings a limitation of the diel o2 technique is its assumption of a constant respiration rate r during each day peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 variations of r during a day can be resolved by combining do measurements with data on the oxygen isotope ratio δ18o hotchkiss and hall 2014 utilizing fractionation of oxygen isotopes by metabolic transformations see review by mader et al 2017 however the technique used by hotchkiss and hall 2014 requires resolving the diel change in δ18o which is very field intensive and thus not suitable for the assessment of metabolic rates over long time periods or in many different lakes bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 suggested that metabolic rates can be determined from a single field visit using a new isotopic 18 16o technique that extends a technique developed for the estimation of metabolic ratios quay et al 1995 according to bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 a single measurement of the isotopic composition i e the 18o 16o ratio in do in water and in the oxygen in the atmosphere above a lake and a single do measurement is sufficient to estimate daily mean of lake respiration r and lake gross primary production gpp metabolic rates estimated with this new 18 16o technique in numerous lakes have been the basis for the conclusion that an increase in atmospheric co2 results in an increase in gross production of phytoplankton vogt et al 2017 and that the contribution of lakes in the circumpolar landscape to terrestric cycling of carbon is unexpectedly small bogard et al 2019 however the isotopic technique proposed by bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 requires that do and the 18o 16o isotopic ratio in do are at steady state we demonstrate here that the steady state assumption limits the applicability of the 18o 16o technique comparisons of metabolic rates between lakes and at different times during the season especially if gpp is large may be unreliable if daily mean metabolic rates are determined using the 18 16o technique only if metabolic rates are low and change little between days long term and diel changes in do and isotopic ratios in dissolved oxygen are small and the steady state assumption leads to comparatively small errors of the metabolic rates determined with the 18 16o technique in addition to the analysis of the sensitivity of the 18 16o technique to the steady state assumption we illustrate that combining the diel o2 technique with very few measurements of δ18o in do water and atmospheric o2 can support the reliability of the estimates of time series of metabolic rates the calculation of metabolic rates in surface waters with the diel o2 technique requires consideration of gas exchange between the surface water and the atmosphere estimates of the lake respiration rate r in the surface mixed layer based on open water techniques are particularly sensitive to the gas fluxes at the lake surface and to the depth of the surface mixed layer z mix honti and istvánovics 2019 peeters et al 2016 including few data on δ18o in the analysis of the diel changes in do substantially constrains the impact of gas exchange on the estimated metabolic rates in the following we first explain the theoretical basis of the diel o2 and of the 18 16o isotopic techniques for the assessment of metabolic rates then the three systems used to exemplify typical conditions in standing freshwater ecosystems here reservoirs and the scenarios analyzed in our sensitivity study are described afterwards we present the results on metabolic rates obtained from the diel o2 technique for the three reservoirs investigated and illustrate the consequences of the non steady state conditions of do and δ18o for estimates of metabolic rates derived from the 18 16o technique we finally illustrate the sensitivity of the metabolic rates estimated from the diel o2 technique on z mix and gas exchange and further demonstrate that very few δ18o measurements can be used to improve the reliability of estimated metabolic rates if information on z mix and or the gas exchange velocity is not available 2 methods the 18 16o technique estimates metabolic rates based on the balance of the concentration of total dissolved oxygen do and the balance of the concentration of dissolved 18o isotopes 18 o do the ratios of isotopic concentrations 18 o 16 o are denoted by 18 16 o the isotopic ratios 18 16 o air 18 16 o h2o and 18 16 o do are the isotopic ratios of oxygen in air in water molecules and in dissolved oxygen respectively atomic fractions denote the ratio of the concentration of isotope 18o to the total concentration of oxygen i e 18 o 16 o hence 1 af 18 o 16 o 18 o 18 16 o 18 16 o 1 the atomic fractions in air in water and in dissolved oxygen are denoted by af air af h2o and af do respectively isotopic ratios are usually measured relative to the isotopic ratio of a standard here the isotopic ratio of the vienna standard mean ocean water 18 16 o vsmow 2 0052 10 3 and are denoted as 2 δ18 o 18 16 o 18 16 o vsmov 1 1000 in the following δ 18 o indicates the oxygen isotopic ratio in dissolved oxygen 2 1 balance of o2 and 18o in the surface mixed layer the temporal change of the

exchange velocity liss and merlivat 1986 see also peeters et al 2016 application of different empirical relations for the gas exchange velocity may result in different v o2 and thus influence estimates of metabolic rates dugan et al 2016 but does not affect the conclusions of the study here as long as the same v o2 are employed in the diel o2 and the 18 16o technique 2 2 estimation of metabolic rates from diel o2 and 18 16o technique the diel o2 technique odum 1956 peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 assumes that respiration i e r is constant during a day and that gross primary production gpp is zero at night but positive during the day gpp depends on the abundance of phytoplankton and on the specific production of the phytoplankton hence gpp strongly changes with light intensity and is expected to show a pronounced cycle during a day metabolic rates estimated using the diel o2 technique gpp o2 r o2 and nep o2 gpp o2 r o2 are determined from 7 r o 2 1 δ t n i g h t t

suggested by bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 assumes that do and also 18 o do see eqs 3 and 6 are at steady state i e constant during the entire day the steady assumption is required because the idea behind proposing the isotopic technique was to allow the estimation of lake metabolic rates denoted as r 18o and gpp 18o from a single visit of a lake bogard et al 2017 the steady state assumption implies that ddo dt 0 and d18 o do dt 0 under the assumptions above the metabolic rates estimated by the 18 16o technique gpp 18o and r 18o can be obtained from bocaniov et al 2012 9 g p p

technique implies that net production nep 18o must be equal to the rate of change in do due to gas exchange during productive time periods do is over saturated in many lakes and reservoirs during day and night e g lake illmensee peeters et al 2016 the reservoirs investigated here see fig 1 in these cases the underlying assumptions of the 18 16o technique imply that nep 18o is always positive and gpp occurs at night during darkness furthermore as the 18 16o technique has been developed and employed to assess metabolic rates from a single visit of a lake do and water temperature and thus also o 2 sat v o2 and z mix are estimated from the instantaneous conditions during the lake visit and assumed to be constant hence the metabolic rates gpp 18o and r 18o are constant during day and night implying gross production during darkness the assumptions of the 18 16o technique for the assessment of lake metabolic rates bocaniov et al 2012 bogard et al 2017 especially the assumption of steady state of do are clearly inconsistent with the assumptions and the fundamental basis i e the diel change in do of the diel oxygen technique peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 in the following we use numerical experiments to illustrate the consequences of the different assumptions underlying the diel o2 and 18 16o technique for the conclusions on lake metabolic rates we further demonstrate how 18o can be used to improve the reliability of respiration rates estimated with the diel o2 technique if information on z mix and or gas exchange velocities is not available 2 3 numerical approach metabolic rates estimated from time series of do using the diel o2 technique were computed with routines implemented previously in matlab peeters et al 2016 metabolic rates from the diel o2 technique were filtered using a 6 h box car filter running mean of 6 h of data eqs 3 and 6 describing the rates ddo dt and d 18 o do dt were implemented in matlab metabolic rates were prescribed and the equations on the rates ddo dt and d 18 o do dt were solved numerically using matlab s ode45 solver two model approaches were employed in this study i long term simulations of do and 18 o do considering more than 1000 days and assuming identical conditions each day the purpose of these simulations was to generate 18 o do consistent with do and the conditions in the respective system daily mean gpp daily mean r gas transfer velocity v o2 and oxygen saturation concentration o 2 sat were assumed to be constant sub daily changes in gpp were modelled using the same idealized temporal change of gpp see below each day the long term simulations driven each day by the same diel forcing pattern provided stable re occurrence patterns of the diel change in do and 18 o do unaffected by the initial conditions and the transition to the stable diel patterns based on the results on do and 18 o do after 1000 simulated days lake metabolic rates were determined using eqs 9 and 10 providing results on gpp 18o and r 18o from the 18 16o technique these metabolic rates were compared to the metabolic rates underlying the simulation of do and 18 o do ii short term simulations of time series of do and 18 o do were performed over 5 days using time series of v o2 and o 2 sat and time series of gpp o2 and r o2 obtained from the diel o2 technique applied to field data the sensitivity of the results from these simulations to the temporal changes in v o2 and o 2 sat were tested by additional simulations performed using daily mean v o2 and daily mean o 2 sat instead of v o2 and o 2 sat 2 4 scenarios considered in the numerical experiments for the sensitivity analysis the analysis considers different scenarios with different diel cycles of gross primary production gpp and daily constant r in all scenarios the isotopic ratios 18 16o in air and water 18 16 o air 18 16 o h2o were assumed to be the same as in bogard et al 2017 see table 1 the scenarios considered are based on observed time series of dissolved o2 and the environmental conditions in three different reservoirs schwarzenbach r gr brombachsee kl brombachsee details on the reservoirs are provided in the appendix metabolic rates were determined from the diel o2 technique utilizing time series of do and water temperature measured with oxygen optodes minidot pme at 1 m water depth in all cases we assumed a surface mixed layer depth of 2 m and negligible o2 flux from deeper water into the mixed surface layer data on wind speed required to estimate gas exchange at the water surface were available from a meteorological station located on the dam of schwarzenbach r and from the station weissenburg of the german weather service dwd near gr brombachsee and kl brombachsee idealized diel cycles of gpp and diel average values of r were employed only in the long term simulations generating typical stable diel cycles in do and 18 o do that were used to illustrate how such diel changes affect the estimates of metabolic rates from the 18 16o technique the construction of idealized diel cycles of gpp is based on daily averaged metabolic rates determined with the diel o2 technique assuming that the concentration of chl a and nutrients do not change substantially during a day the diel cycle of gpp is closely linked to the diel cycle of the intensity of incident light assuming further that specific production increases monotonously with light intensity i e maximum light intensities are too low to cause light inhibition gpp should be maximal around noon in our scenarios we use an idealized diel course of gpp o2 id providing maximum values at noon and zero values at night 11 g p p o 2 i d t d g p p o 2 d m e a n 1 0 0 5 d sin t d 2 π max 0 sin t d 2 π π 2 and t d is time in decimal days and gpp o2 dmean is a prescribed daily mean gross primary production note that the true time series of gpp does not necessarily follow a sinusoidal curve e g in case of light inhibition and that the daily maximum of gpp not necessarily occurs at noon but depends on season and latitude time series of gpp may be constructed from the temporal change in light intensity and p i models this approach requires a time series of incident light information on light attenuation and the vertical distribution of chl a in the water column a justification of the choice of a particular p i model and of the parameters of this model which depend on the algal community present however the simplified construction of gpp o2 id eq 11 is sufficient for the illustration purposes here because the temporal change of gpp o2 id agrees well with the temporal change of gpp o2 see results confirming that the idealized curves chosen provide realistic temporal changes in gpp on the same order as observed in the field in the investigations of the applicability of δ 18 o to constrain z mix and v o2 z mix time series of do and 18 o do were simulated over 5 days to predict δ 18 o at the end of the time interval z mix or v o2 z mix respectively are treated as fitting parameters and adjusted until the simulated δ 18 o at the end of the time interval agrees best with δ 18 o of the reference simulation which utilized the observed time series of v o2 and z mix 2 m 3 results 3 1 reference conditions dissolved oxygen and metabolic rates in three reservoirs during the stratified season do shows pronounced diel cycles in the surface waters of all three systems investigated fig 1a c blue line the diel amplitudes and the absolute values of do in kl brombachsee are substantially larger than in schwarzenbach r and in gr brombachsee in all cases do is oversaturated during most of the time with maximal saturation up to 180 in kl brombachsee fig 1g i hence oxygen is typically emitted from these systems and the oxygen flux to the atmosphere is positive and shows a pronounced diel cycle fig 1 j l gpp o2 calculated from the diel course of dissolved oxygen concentration shows a pronounced diel cycle fig 1d f dark blue line the amplitude and absolute values of gpp o2 in kl brombachsee are typically more than an order of magnitude larger than in the other two systems r o2 fig 1d f green line is also an order of magnitude larger in kl brombachsee than in the other systems the idealized diel course of gpp gpp o2 id eq 11 agrees reasonably well with gpp o2 fig 1d f red line dissolved oxygen simulated from eq 3 using gpp o2 and r o2 fig 1a c cyan and using gpp o2 id and r o2 fig 1a c red agree well with the original time series of dissolved oxygen note that in case of the calculations based on gpp o2 and r o2 the deviation between simulated and measured do cyan and blue lines in fig 1a c results from the filtering of gpp o2 but does not occur for unfiltered gpp o2 3 2 gpp 18o and r 18o limitations of the 18 16o technique idealized gpp calculated using the average gpp o2 of the entire time series gpp o2 idav and the time series averaged r o2 r o2 av are depicted in fig 2 a c red and cyan respectively based on these metabolic rates time series of do and δ 18 o were calculated for 1005 days do and δ 18 o from day 1001 to day 1005 show a stable pattern of diel oscillations fig 2d i red lines the 18 16o technique was applied to one day i e day 1001 of simulated do and δ 18 o providing gpp 18o and r 18o evaluated at different times during the day fig 2j o both properties gpp 18o fig 2j l and r 18o fig 2m o clearly depend of the time of evaluation during the day and can substantially deviate from the true daily mean gpp and r fig 2j o dashed lines the deviation of gpp 18o and r 18o from the true daily mean gpp and r can be particularly large in the highly productive kl brombachsee e g gpp 18o and r 18o can be up to 3 times larger than the true gpp and r respectively fig 2l o the comparison of gpp 18o between the three reservoirs in fig 2 suggests that the reliability of the 18 16o technique is sensitive to the overall gpp in the system this has been investigated in more detail in a sensitivity study in which we assumed a surface temperature of 20 c a wind speed of 2 m s 1 atmospheric pressure p 1 atm a true gpp that showed an idealized diel cycle according to eq 11 and a constant r the range of the deviations between gpp estimated from the 18 16o technique and the true daily mean gpp gpp 18o err increases with daily mean gpp and decreases with daily mean nep fig 3 a c the maximum gpp 18o err exceeds 100 at large 5 mgo2 l 1 d 1 daily mean gpp a similar trend can be observed for the deviation between r o18 and the true daily mean r r 18o err fig 3d f whereby maximum r 18o err are typically larger at low daily mean nep because this implies larger true daily mean r the range of do and δ 18 o during the diel cycles increases with daily mean gpp as is indicated by maximum blue minimum red and daily mean black concentrations depicted in fig 3m x at the lowest gpp considered here 0 25 mgo2 l 1 d 1 the diel change in do is only 0 14 mg l 1 daily mean do increases whereas daily mean δ 18 o decreases with increasing daily mean nep fig 3m x in the simulations of the conditions in the three reservoirs in which gpp and r were assumed to have the same daily mean value over long time periods and gpp was assumed to follow the idealized diel pattern gpp 18o and r 18o agreed well with the correct daily mean gpp and r when the 18 16o technique was applied at or shortly before the time of the daily maximum of gpp o2 idav fig 2j o evaluations conducted about 6 h before after the timing of the daily maximum of gpp o2 idav resulted in the strongest underestimation overestimation respectively of the correct daily mean gpp and r simulations of 18 o do considering the 5 day time series of gpp o2 and r o2 obtained with the diel o2 techniques and the observed temporal changes in water temperature and gas transfer velocity show that 18 o do and thus δ 18 o not only change at sub daily time scales but also between days fig 4 j o blue lines gpp 18o and r 18o determined from the 18 16o technique using the simulated do and 18 o do therefore show temporally less systematic and substantially larger deviation from the true daily mean gpp and r underlying the simulations than in the idealized case with the same true daily mean metabolic rates over many days fig 5 note that the deviation between gpp 18o and the true daily mean gpp can depend on the time of measurement during the day in a similar pattern as for the idealized scenario i e underestimation of the true daily mean gpp in the morning and overestimation in the afternoon fig 5d however gpp 18o can also substantially underestimate fig 5e or overestimate fig 5b the true daily mean gpp independent of the time of measurement during the day i e on the 4th of august gpp 18o is up to 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 fig 5b whereas on the 7th of august gpp o2 is up to 2 5 times larger than gpp 18o fig 5e hence changing conditions between days can cause substantial errors in gpp 18o that may even exceed the errors introduced by the non steady state conditions of do and 18 o do caused by the diel changes in gpp non steady state conditions are caused by temporal changes in gpp and r but also by the temporal changes in v o2 and o 2 sat metabolic rates calculated with the 18 16o technique from model simulations using daily mean v o2 and daily mean o 2 sat gpp 18o m show a similar diel course and similar over and underestimation of the true gpp as gpp 18o fig 5a c however at short time scales gpp 18o fluctuates much more than gpp 18o m fig 5a c suggesting that fluctuations in v o2 which may be caused e g by fluctuations in wind speed may affect gpp o18 mainly at short time scales note that using 5 day averages instead of daily averages of v o2 and o 2 sat had only little effect on the model results and metabolic rates determined from these simulations using the 18 16o technique did not differ substantially from gpp 18o m using daily mean values of o 2 sat instead of the original time series of o 2 sat had only little effect on metabolic rates estimated with the 18 16o technique the example from schwarzenbach r indicates that neither gpp r v o2 nor o 2 sat were at steady state and gpp 18o therefore substantially under and overestimates the true gpp by more than 100 within five days in the same reservoir this finding raises doubts about the reliability of conclusions on the variability of productivity and of carbon transformation in lakes across landscapes and over time if the conclusions are based on metabolic rates that were estimated with the 18 16o technique 3 3 improving the estimation of metabolic rates by combining diel o2 technique with data on δ 18 o in addition to the systematic errors arising from the steady state assumption inherent in the 18 16o technique a common cause of uncertainty in estimated metabolic rates obtained from 18 16o or diel o2 technique is the oxygen transport due to gas exchange affecting the concentrations in the surface water not only quantification of the gas exchange velocity but also of the mixed layer depth is required in 18 16o and diel o2 technique fig 4 illustrates that estimates of r o2 fig 4g i are more sensitive to the assumption on the mixed layer depth than estimates of gpp o2 fig 4a c and daily mean gpp o2 fig 4d f see also table 2 calculations assuming a mixed layer depth of z mix 2 m as in the previous simulations are depicted in blue and will be considered as the reference for comparisons simulations neglecting gas exchange entirely fig 4 black lines can be understood as simulations assuming an infinitely large mixing depth do simulated from the gpp o2 and r o2 estimated assuming different mixing depth agree very well with the data fig 4j l which is not surprising as the estimated metabolic rates were based on the measured do and the assumed z mix the deviations in case of kl brombachsee are a result of the filtering of the estimated gpp in contrast to do δ 18 o is rather sensitive to the z mix assumed showing lower values in case of larger mixing depth fig 4m o the sensitivity of the simulated δ 18 o to the effects of gas exchange suggests that data on δ 18 o can be used to support the estimation of metabolic rates from the diel o2 technique by constraining mixing depth and or gas exchange if these properties are uncertain as measurements of δ 18 o are time consuming we illustrate in the following that 2 measurements of δ 18 o one at the beginning and the other at the end of a 5 day time period can improve estimates of r if gas fluxes are known but not the relevant mixing depths the latter can be fitted using inverse modelling first gpp o2 and r o2 are calculated from the diel o2 technique eqs 7 and 8 afterwards these metabolic rates are employed to simulate the time series of δ 18 o using the first measured δ 18 o value as initial condition the simulated δ 18 o at the end of the 5 day time interval is compared to the value of δ 18 o measured at this time the entire procedure is repeated by assuming a different mixed layer depth until the difference between simulated and measured δ 18 o reaches a minimum because data on δ 18 o were not available the inverse fitting procedure is demonstrated here based on the δ 18 o of the reference simulation with the inverse fitting approach combining diel o2 technique and two values on δ 18 o the mixed layer depth of the reference simulation was reliably estimated and thus also the corresponding metabolic rates even if we started the fitting procedure assuming initially a very large z mix in cases in which the gas fluxes cannot be estimated few δ 18 o measurements may be sufficient to improve the reliability of estimated metabolic rates assuming that the gas exchange velocity divided by the mixed layer depth is constant in time i e v o2 z mix constant the same inverse modelling approach as above can be applied to estimate v o2 z mix this estimate of v o2 z mix can then be used to calculate metabolic rates fig 6 compares the concentrations of do and δ 18 o determined from the reference gpp o2 and r o2 mixed layer depth 2 m and gas exchange determined from data blue lines with do and δ 18 o simulated from gpp o2 nogas and r o2 nogas obtained assuming no gas exchange red line application of inverse modelling based on two values of δ 18 o taken from the reference simulation provides for each of the systems investigated best fit values of the average v o2 z mix that agree very well with the average v o2 z mix of the corresponding reference simulation table 3 the simulations of do and δ 18 o using the fitted v o2 z mix agree well with the results from the reference simulation fig 6a c and fig 6d f dark green and blue lines the respiration rates obtained from the results of the inverse modelling r o2 fit v zmix agree much better with the respiration rates of the reference simulation than with r o2 nogas i e the respiration rate calculated by neglecting the effects of gas exchange and the respiration rates r o2 obtained using the data based time series v o2 and z mix 1 m or z mix 3 m respectively table 3 and fig 7 4 discussion the fundamental difference between diel o2 and 18 16o techniques are the underlying assumptions for the calculation of metabolic rates the diel o2 technique utilizes the daily change in do as basis for the assessment of metabolic rates and assumes gpp to be zero at night and r to be constant during day and night in contrast the 18 16o technique assumes steady state conditions i e that do and 18 o do are constant during day and night and that gpp 18o and r 18o derived from do and 18 o do measured at a single time during a day represent daily mean gpp and daily mean r respectively the assumptions of the 18 16o technique imply that nep is equal to the o2 loss from the surface mixed layer due to gas exchange and that gpp is non zero at night see methods gas losses to the atmosphere depend e g on wind speed and can vary on short time scales in contrast lake metabolic rates are not directly connected to wind but to light intensity nutrients and biomass of the primary producers temporal changes of nep are therefore not expected to be dominated by changes in wind speed and gpp is not expected to occur during darkness furthermore o2 concentrations in the surface water of lakes and reservoirs typically show pronounced daily cycles e g fig 1a c and clearly are not at steady state these arguments indicate that the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o techniques is neither compatible with what is known about the processes causing metabolic rates in lakes and reservoirs nor with observations of do in the surface water of these systems this leads to the question whether the errors introduced by the assumptions of the 18 16o techniques are sufficiently small that the metabolic rates calculated with this technique can be considered a reasonable approximation of the true metabolic rates or whether the errors are large and the application of the18 16o technique provides unreliable results the sensitivity analysis performed here indicates that diel changes in gpp typical for reservoirs and lakes fig 1d f introduce systematic errors in the metabolic rates determined with the 18 16o technique that can be rather large causing gpp o18 and r o18 to deviate by more than 50 from the true gpp and r fig 3 in the sensitivity analysis based on simulations using repeatedly the same idealized diel course of gpp the errors of the metabolic rates depend very systematically on the timing of the measurement during a day in relation to the timing of the maximum gpp fig 2j o the systematic under and overestimation of gpp by gpp 18o arising from the time of measurement may suggest that it is possible to correct for the errors of gpp 18o caused by the diel changes in gpp o 2 and δ 18 o however under field conditions the timing of the daily maximum of the true gpp may vary between days because primary production depends on incident solar radiation and therefore shifts seasonally varies with latitude and is affected by the time series of cloud cover more importantly the changes of gpp between days can introduce even larger discrepancies between gpp 18o and the true gpp than the sub daily changes in gpp fig 5 the example from schwarzenbach r indicates that gpp 18o typically shows a similar diel pattern of the dependence on the measuring time of the day as gpp 18o in the idealized scenarios of gpp depicted in fig 2j o i e gpp 18o is lower if measurements are collected in the morning than in the afternoon of the same day however in contrast to the idealized scenarios the difference between gpp 18o and the true gpp is not necessarily minimal around midday and the true gpp is not necessarily underestimated overestimated by gpp 18o if measurements are conducted in the morning afternoon fig 5 note that the errors of gpp 18o discussed here are not caused by random processes but are systematic errors arising from the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique these errors do not include uncertainties in the measurements of do and δ 18 o note further that the errors of gpp 18o are assessed with a numerical sensitivity analysis in which the conditions are well controlled and the simulations are driven by prescribed gpp and r therefore the conclusions on the errors of gpp 18o are not affected by uncertainties in the gpp and r used in the sensitivity analyses or by uncertainties in vertical mixing or gas exchange in the simulations the prescribed true gpp and r are based on gpp o2 and r o2 derived from the diel o2 technique to include temporal changes of gpp and r in the model scenarios that are consistent with realistic temporal changes in the field note that the uncertainties of gpp o2 and r o2 may influence the time sequence of gpp and r used to drive the simulation but they do not affect the deviations of simulated gpp 18o and r 18o from the prescribed gpp and r the latter are the true metabolic rates within the framework of the numerical sensitivity analysis the conclusions from the numerical sensitivity analysis i e that the errors of gpp 18o and r o18 may deviate substantially from the true gpp and r and the deviations depend on the timing of the field measurements are consistent with comparisons of metabolic rates measured with the 18 16o technique the diel o2 technique and the traditional bottle technique gpp bot in the study by bocaniov et al 2012 gpp 18o calculated from measured do and δ 18 o are significantly correlated with gpp bot but deviate substantially from gpp bot i e gpp bot can be 36 smaller but also more than 4 times larger than gpp o18 gpp o18 measured in mesocosm experiments bogard et al 2017 were not correlated with gpp o2 p 0 54 and the deviation between gpp o2 and gpp 18o ranged from gpp o2 being 23 smaller to gpp o2 being more than an order of magnitude larger than gpp 18o bogard et al 2017 suggested treating the data from the two experiments with the largest gpp o2 as outliers however the remaining 6 values for gpp 18o and gpp o2 are also not correlated p 0 48 and gpp o2 is still up to more than 3 times larger than gpp 18o in lac croche gpp 18o and gpp o2 both declined over the summer months until november but gpp 18o was typically three times larger than gpp o2 bogard et al 2017 in simoncouche gpp 18o and gpp o2 did not show the same seasonal trends i e in contrast to gpp o2 gpp 18o declined over the summer months in summer gpp 18o was up to 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 but in november gpp 18o and gpp o2 had similar values bogard et al 2017 summarizing measurements of gpp o2 and gpp 18o in lakes and mesocosms show that gpp 18o can be more than 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 but that gpp o2 can also be more than 2 5 times larger than gpp 18o these observations are consistent with our sensitivity analysis indicating that the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique introduces errors in gpp 18o that can explain underestimation and overestimation of gpp o2 of gpp 18o by factors of 2 5 these large errors make inter comparisons of metabolic rates derived from the 18 16o technique between systems of different production vogt et al 2017 or across landscapes at regional scales bogard et al 2019 rather uncertain because of the systematic nature of the errors also statistical analysis may produce unreliable results as is suggested by the lack of correlation between gpp o2 of gpp 18o and r o2 of r 18o in mesocosm experiments and by the different long term trends of gpp o2 of gpp 18o in simoncouche bogard et al 2017 despite these limitations the 18 16o technique may be interesting for very low productive systems in which temporal changes in do and δ 18 o are small and the diel o2 technique may come to its limits e g in the simulation with idealized gpp and constant temperature and gas exchange velocity the diel amplitude of do was only 0 14 mg l 1 at daily mean gpp 0 25 mgo2 l 1 d 1 although such small changes in do can be resolved by oxygen optodes do in real systems is affected by gas exchange of o2 with the atmosphere and by mixing processes causing fluctuations in do that can exceed the diel change in do due to the metabolic transformations at small gpp in such cases the application of the diel o2 technique requires detailed corrections for the transport processes that are usually not available at sufficient precision the sensitivity analysis suggests that the 18 16o technique provides more reliable results in low than in high productive lakes fig 4 which is in contrast to bocaniov et al 2015 the decrease of the typical error range of gpp 18o with decreasing gpp fig 4 can be explained by the fact that at small gpp the diel change in do is smaller and thus the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique better justified than at large gpp whether the 18 16o technique indeed can help improving the estimates of metabolic rates in systems with low gpp depends on the accuracy of the δ18o measurements in do water and atmosphere but also on the rate of change within and between days of metabolic rates and environmental conditions and on the consequences of transport processes affecting do and 18 o do measurements of do and oxygen isotopes in low productive systems may help to constrain the range of gpp in which diel o2 and 18 16o technique respectively provide reliable estimates of metabolic rates independent of the 18 16o technique measurements of δ18o may support the analysis of metabolic rates and contribute to the reliability of estimated metabolic rates combination of the diel o2 technique with few δ 18 o measurements can constrain uncertainties especially in the estimates of r arising from uncertainties in the quantification of the effects of gas exchange on the o2 concentrations in the surface waters if z mix is difficult to determine in the aquatic system investigated it can be assessed by including δ18o measurements from at least two different sampling dates in the analysis based on the diel o2 technique note that such analysis assumes that z mix is constant during the time period between consecutive δ18o measurements which imposes a limit on the time span between required δ 18 o measurements similarly a mean value of v gas z mix can be estimated for the time span between the δ18o measurements 5 conclusions 1 the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique results in large errors between gpp 18o and the true gpp i e gpp 18o can underestimate or overestimate the true gpp by more than a factor of 2 5 2 gpp 18o does not provide reliable information on differences of gpp between systems or on the temporal development of gpp within systems in some studies gpp 18o and gpp were significantly correlated in others not observations include cases in which i gpp 18o increased with gpp ii gpp 18o changed while gpp was constant and iii changes in gpp 18o were not related to changes in gpp 3 the above conclusions indicate that correlation analyses of metabolic rates estimated from individual lake visits using the 18 16o techniques may be unreliable hence conclusions based on such analysis e g that primary production increases with an increase in co2 vogt et al 2017 or that lakes of the arid circumpolar landscape recycle surprisingly little terrestrial carbon bogard et al 2019 must be re considered carefully 4 in unproductive systems it may be beneficial to apply the 18 16o technique for the assessment of metabolic rates because temporal changes in do are small and the diel o2 technique may come to its limits 5 the combination of few stable isotope measurements with the diel o2 technique can be used in an inverse modelling approach to improve the reliability of estimates of gpp and especially of r

18508,metabolic transformations have a major impact on the development of primary producers in aquatic systems and thus affect the dynamics of the entire aquatic food web furthermore metabolic transformations contribute to the carbon budget and thereby influence co2 emissions from aquatic systems several techniques have been developed that aim at an easy assessment of metabolic rates over long time periods or in many systems the 18 16o technique which utilizes the isotopic fractionation between 18o and 16o isotopes due to metabolic transformations is receiving increasing popularity in studies comparing the metabolism in many different lakes and served as basis for the conclusions that production increases with increasing atmospheric co2 and that surprisingly little terrestrial carbon is recycled in lakes of the arid circumpolar landscape however we demonstrate here that the steady state assumptions underlying the 18 16o technique cause large uncertainties in the estimated metabolic rates this conclusion is based on a sensitivity analysis using a numerical model of dissolved oxygen do and of dissolved 18o 18 o do but is also confirmed by published metabolic rates estimated from the 18 16o and the diel o2 techniques metabolic rates obtained from the 18 16o technique appear unsuited for correlation analyses between lakes but may provide reasonable estimates in systems with low and long term stable production in addition we illustrate that the combination of few 18o measurements with the diel o2 technique and an inverse fitting procedure can improve estimates of metabolic rates and in particular of respiration rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake metabolism diel o2 technique 18o isotope 18 16o technique production respiration 1 introduction lake metabolic rates have received much attention in recent years because they provide a quantitative link between the biocenosis and the carbon cycle in lakes bogard et al 2019 cole et al 2007 hanson et al 2003 hoellein et al 2013 staehr et al 2012 tranvik et al 2009 vogt et al 2017 understanding and quantification of the carbon fluxes between the inorganic and organic carbon pool in lakes and their link to primary production and respiration is important for the projection of greenhouse gas emissions from lakes and or uptake and storage of carbon in lakes under changing conditions several techniques have been proposed for the assessment of lake metabolic rates robinson and williams 2005 in recent years in situ techniques utilizing data on the diel change in concentrations of dissolved o2 do or dissolved inorganic carbon dic have been refined and employed in several studies honti and istvánovics 2019 obrador et al 2014 peeters et al 2016 solomon et al 2013 staehr et al 2010 in contrast to intensive field campaigns required by bottle techniques open water techniques typically utilize moored instruments for continuous high resolution collection of data on dissolved oxygen e g peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 or co2 peeters et al 2016 and therefore require only few visits of the field sites for maintenance of the moorings a limitation of the diel o2 technique is its assumption of a constant respiration rate r during each day peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 variations of r during a day can be resolved by combining do measurements with data on the oxygen isotope ratio δ18o hotchkiss and hall 2014 utilizing fractionation of oxygen isotopes by metabolic transformations see review by mader et al 2017 however the technique used by hotchkiss and hall 2014 requires resolving the diel change in δ18o which is very field intensive and thus not suitable for the assessment of metabolic rates over long time periods or in many different lakes bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 suggested that metabolic rates can be determined from a single field visit using a new isotopic 18 16o technique that extends a technique developed for the estimation of metabolic ratios quay et al 1995 according to bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 a single measurement of the isotopic composition i e the 18o 16o ratio in do in water and in the oxygen in the atmosphere above a lake and a single do measurement is sufficient to estimate daily mean of lake respiration r and lake gross primary production gpp metabolic rates estimated with this new 18 16o technique in numerous lakes have been the basis for the conclusion that an increase in atmospheric co2 results in an increase in gross production of phytoplankton vogt et al 2017 and that the contribution of lakes in the circumpolar landscape to terrestric cycling of carbon is unexpectedly small bogard et al 2019 however the isotopic technique proposed by bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 requires that do and the 18o 16o isotopic ratio in do are at steady state we demonstrate here that the steady state assumption limits the applicability of the 18o 16o technique comparisons of metabolic rates between lakes and at different times during the season especially if gpp is large may be unreliable if daily mean metabolic rates are determined using the 18 16o technique only if metabolic rates are low and change little between days long term and diel changes in do and isotopic ratios in dissolved oxygen are small and the steady state assumption leads to comparatively small errors of the metabolic rates determined with the 18 16o technique in addition to the analysis of the sensitivity of the 18 16o technique to the steady state assumption we illustrate that combining the diel o2 technique with very few measurements of δ18o in do water and atmospheric o2 can support the reliability of the estimates of time series of metabolic rates the calculation of metabolic rates in surface waters with the diel o2 technique requires consideration of gas exchange between the surface water and the atmosphere estimates of the lake respiration rate r in the surface mixed layer based on open water techniques are particularly sensitive to the gas fluxes at the lake surface and to the depth of the surface mixed layer z mix honti and istvánovics 2019 peeters et al 2016 including few data on δ18o in the analysis of the diel changes in do substantially constrains the impact of gas exchange on the estimated metabolic rates in the following we first explain the theoretical basis of the diel o2 and of the 18 16o isotopic techniques for the assessment of metabolic rates then the three systems used to exemplify typical conditions in standing freshwater ecosystems here reservoirs and the scenarios analyzed in our sensitivity study are described afterwards we present the results on metabolic rates obtained from the diel o2 technique for the three reservoirs investigated and illustrate the consequences of the non steady state conditions of do and δ18o for estimates of metabolic rates derived from the 18 16o technique we finally illustrate the sensitivity of the metabolic rates estimated from the diel o2 technique on z mix and gas exchange and further demonstrate that very few δ18o measurements can be used to improve the reliability of estimated metabolic rates if information on z mix and or the gas exchange velocity is not available 2 methods the 18 16o technique estimates metabolic rates based on the balance of the concentration of total dissolved oxygen do and the balance of the concentration of dissolved 18o isotopes 18 o do the ratios of isotopic concentrations 18 o 16 o are denoted by 18 16 o the isotopic ratios 18 16 o air 18 16 o h2o and 18 16 o do are the isotopic ratios of oxygen in air in water molecules and in dissolved oxygen respectively atomic fractions denote the ratio of the concentration of isotope 18o to the total concentration of oxygen i e 18 o 16 o hence 1 af 18 o 16 o 18 o 18 16 o 18 16 o 1 the atomic fractions in air in water and in dissolved oxygen are denoted by af air af h2o and af do respectively isotopic ratios are usually measured relative to the isotopic ratio of a standard here the isotopic ratio of the vienna standard mean ocean water 18 16 o vsmow 2 0052 10 3 and are denoted as 2 δ18 o 18 16 o 18 16 o vsmov 1 1000 in the following δ 18 o indicates the oxygen isotopic ratio in dissolved oxygen 2 1 balance of o2 and 18o in the surface mixed layer the temporal change of the

exchange velocity liss and merlivat 1986 see also peeters et al 2016 application of different empirical relations for the gas exchange velocity may result in different v o2 and thus influence estimates of metabolic rates dugan et al 2016 but does not affect the conclusions of the study here as long as the same v o2 are employed in the diel o2 and the 18 16o technique 2 2 estimation of metabolic rates from diel o2 and 18 16o technique the diel o2 technique odum 1956 peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 assumes that respiration i e r is constant during a day and that gross primary production gpp is zero at night but positive during the day gpp depends on the abundance of phytoplankton and on the specific production of the phytoplankton hence gpp strongly changes with light intensity and is expected to show a pronounced cycle during a day metabolic rates estimated using the diel o2 technique gpp o2 r o2 and nep o2 gpp o2 r o2 are determined from 7 r o 2 1 δ t n i g h t t

suggested by bocaniov et al 2012 and bogard et al 2017 assumes that do and also 18 o do see eqs 3 and 6 are at steady state i e constant during the entire day the steady assumption is required because the idea behind proposing the isotopic technique was to allow the estimation of lake metabolic rates denoted as r 18o and gpp 18o from a single visit of a lake bogard et al 2017 the steady state assumption implies that ddo dt 0 and d18 o do dt 0 under the assumptions above the metabolic rates estimated by the 18 16o technique gpp 18o and r 18o can be obtained from bocaniov et al 2012 9 g p p

technique implies that net production nep 18o must be equal to the rate of change in do due to gas exchange during productive time periods do is over saturated in many lakes and reservoirs during day and night e g lake illmensee peeters et al 2016 the reservoirs investigated here see fig 1 in these cases the underlying assumptions of the 18 16o technique imply that nep 18o is always positive and gpp occurs at night during darkness furthermore as the 18 16o technique has been developed and employed to assess metabolic rates from a single visit of a lake do and water temperature and thus also o 2 sat v o2 and z mix are estimated from the instantaneous conditions during the lake visit and assumed to be constant hence the metabolic rates gpp 18o and r 18o are constant during day and night implying gross production during darkness the assumptions of the 18 16o technique for the assessment of lake metabolic rates bocaniov et al 2012 bogard et al 2017 especially the assumption of steady state of do are clearly inconsistent with the assumptions and the fundamental basis i e the diel change in do of the diel oxygen technique peeters et al 2016 staehr et al 2010 in the following we use numerical experiments to illustrate the consequences of the different assumptions underlying the diel o2 and 18 16o technique for the conclusions on lake metabolic rates we further demonstrate how 18o can be used to improve the reliability of respiration rates estimated with the diel o2 technique if information on z mix and or gas exchange velocities is not available 2 3 numerical approach metabolic rates estimated from time series of do using the diel o2 technique were computed with routines implemented previously in matlab peeters et al 2016 metabolic rates from the diel o2 technique were filtered using a 6 h box car filter running mean of 6 h of data eqs 3 and 6 describing the rates ddo dt and d 18 o do dt were implemented in matlab metabolic rates were prescribed and the equations on the rates ddo dt and d 18 o do dt were solved numerically using matlab s ode45 solver two model approaches were employed in this study i long term simulations of do and 18 o do considering more than 1000 days and assuming identical conditions each day the purpose of these simulations was to generate 18 o do consistent with do and the conditions in the respective system daily mean gpp daily mean r gas transfer velocity v o2 and oxygen saturation concentration o 2 sat were assumed to be constant sub daily changes in gpp were modelled using the same idealized temporal change of gpp see below each day the long term simulations driven each day by the same diel forcing pattern provided stable re occurrence patterns of the diel change in do and 18 o do unaffected by the initial conditions and the transition to the stable diel patterns based on the results on do and 18 o do after 1000 simulated days lake metabolic rates were determined using eqs 9 and 10 providing results on gpp 18o and r 18o from the 18 16o technique these metabolic rates were compared to the metabolic rates underlying the simulation of do and 18 o do ii short term simulations of time series of do and 18 o do were performed over 5 days using time series of v o2 and o 2 sat and time series of gpp o2 and r o2 obtained from the diel o2 technique applied to field data the sensitivity of the results from these simulations to the temporal changes in v o2 and o 2 sat were tested by additional simulations performed using daily mean v o2 and daily mean o 2 sat instead of v o2 and o 2 sat 2 4 scenarios considered in the numerical experiments for the sensitivity analysis the analysis considers different scenarios with different diel cycles of gross primary production gpp and daily constant r in all scenarios the isotopic ratios 18 16o in air and water 18 16 o air 18 16 o h2o were assumed to be the same as in bogard et al 2017 see table 1 the scenarios considered are based on observed time series of dissolved o2 and the environmental conditions in three different reservoirs schwarzenbach r gr brombachsee kl brombachsee details on the reservoirs are provided in the appendix metabolic rates were determined from the diel o2 technique utilizing time series of do and water temperature measured with oxygen optodes minidot pme at 1 m water depth in all cases we assumed a surface mixed layer depth of 2 m and negligible o2 flux from deeper water into the mixed surface layer data on wind speed required to estimate gas exchange at the water surface were available from a meteorological station located on the dam of schwarzenbach r and from the station weissenburg of the german weather service dwd near gr brombachsee and kl brombachsee idealized diel cycles of gpp and diel average values of r were employed only in the long term simulations generating typical stable diel cycles in do and 18 o do that were used to illustrate how such diel changes affect the estimates of metabolic rates from the 18 16o technique the construction of idealized diel cycles of gpp is based on daily averaged metabolic rates determined with the diel o2 technique assuming that the concentration of chl a and nutrients do not change substantially during a day the diel cycle of gpp is closely linked to the diel cycle of the intensity of incident light assuming further that specific production increases monotonously with light intensity i e maximum light intensities are too low to cause light inhibition gpp should be maximal around noon in our scenarios we use an idealized diel course of gpp o2 id providing maximum values at noon and zero values at night 11 g p p o 2 i d t d g p p o 2 d m e a n 1 0 0 5 d sin t d 2 π max 0 sin t d 2 π π 2 and t d is time in decimal days and gpp o2 dmean is a prescribed daily mean gross primary production note that the true time series of gpp does not necessarily follow a sinusoidal curve e g in case of light inhibition and that the daily maximum of gpp not necessarily occurs at noon but depends on season and latitude time series of gpp may be constructed from the temporal change in light intensity and p i models this approach requires a time series of incident light information on light attenuation and the vertical distribution of chl a in the water column a justification of the choice of a particular p i model and of the parameters of this model which depend on the algal community present however the simplified construction of gpp o2 id eq 11 is sufficient for the illustration purposes here because the temporal change of gpp o2 id agrees well with the temporal change of gpp o2 see results confirming that the idealized curves chosen provide realistic temporal changes in gpp on the same order as observed in the field in the investigations of the applicability of δ 18 o to constrain z mix and v o2 z mix time series of do and 18 o do were simulated over 5 days to predict δ 18 o at the end of the time interval z mix or v o2 z mix respectively are treated as fitting parameters and adjusted until the simulated δ 18 o at the end of the time interval agrees best with δ 18 o of the reference simulation which utilized the observed time series of v o2 and z mix 2 m 3 results 3 1 reference conditions dissolved oxygen and metabolic rates in three reservoirs during the stratified season do shows pronounced diel cycles in the surface waters of all three systems investigated fig 1a c blue line the diel amplitudes and the absolute values of do in kl brombachsee are substantially larger than in schwarzenbach r and in gr brombachsee in all cases do is oversaturated during most of the time with maximal saturation up to 180 in kl brombachsee fig 1g i hence oxygen is typically emitted from these systems and the oxygen flux to the atmosphere is positive and shows a pronounced diel cycle fig 1 j l gpp o2 calculated from the diel course of dissolved oxygen concentration shows a pronounced diel cycle fig 1d f dark blue line the amplitude and absolute values of gpp o2 in kl brombachsee are typically more than an order of magnitude larger than in the other two systems r o2 fig 1d f green line is also an order of magnitude larger in kl brombachsee than in the other systems the idealized diel course of gpp gpp o2 id eq 11 agrees reasonably well with gpp o2 fig 1d f red line dissolved oxygen simulated from eq 3 using gpp o2 and r o2 fig 1a c cyan and using gpp o2 id and r o2 fig 1a c red agree well with the original time series of dissolved oxygen note that in case of the calculations based on gpp o2 and r o2 the deviation between simulated and measured do cyan and blue lines in fig 1a c results from the filtering of gpp o2 but does not occur for unfiltered gpp o2 3 2 gpp 18o and r 18o limitations of the 18 16o technique idealized gpp calculated using the average gpp o2 of the entire time series gpp o2 idav and the time series averaged r o2 r o2 av are depicted in fig 2 a c red and cyan respectively based on these metabolic rates time series of do and δ 18 o were calculated for 1005 days do and δ 18 o from day 1001 to day 1005 show a stable pattern of diel oscillations fig 2d i red lines the 18 16o technique was applied to one day i e day 1001 of simulated do and δ 18 o providing gpp 18o and r 18o evaluated at different times during the day fig 2j o both properties gpp 18o fig 2j l and r 18o fig 2m o clearly depend of the time of evaluation during the day and can substantially deviate from the true daily mean gpp and r fig 2j o dashed lines the deviation of gpp 18o and r 18o from the true daily mean gpp and r can be particularly large in the highly productive kl brombachsee e g gpp 18o and r 18o can be up to 3 times larger than the true gpp and r respectively fig 2l o the comparison of gpp 18o between the three reservoirs in fig 2 suggests that the reliability of the 18 16o technique is sensitive to the overall gpp in the system this has been investigated in more detail in a sensitivity study in which we assumed a surface temperature of 20 c a wind speed of 2 m s 1 atmospheric pressure p 1 atm a true gpp that showed an idealized diel cycle according to eq 11 and a constant r the range of the deviations between gpp estimated from the 18 16o technique and the true daily mean gpp gpp 18o err increases with daily mean gpp and decreases with daily mean nep fig 3 a c the maximum gpp 18o err exceeds 100 at large 5 mgo2 l 1 d 1 daily mean gpp a similar trend can be observed for the deviation between r o18 and the true daily mean r r 18o err fig 3d f whereby maximum r 18o err are typically larger at low daily mean nep because this implies larger true daily mean r the range of do and δ 18 o during the diel cycles increases with daily mean gpp as is indicated by maximum blue minimum red and daily mean black concentrations depicted in fig 3m x at the lowest gpp considered here 0 25 mgo2 l 1 d 1 the diel change in do is only 0 14 mg l 1 daily mean do increases whereas daily mean δ 18 o decreases with increasing daily mean nep fig 3m x in the simulations of the conditions in the three reservoirs in which gpp and r were assumed to have the same daily mean value over long time periods and gpp was assumed to follow the idealized diel pattern gpp 18o and r 18o agreed well with the correct daily mean gpp and r when the 18 16o technique was applied at or shortly before the time of the daily maximum of gpp o2 idav fig 2j o evaluations conducted about 6 h before after the timing of the daily maximum of gpp o2 idav resulted in the strongest underestimation overestimation respectively of the correct daily mean gpp and r simulations of 18 o do considering the 5 day time series of gpp o2 and r o2 obtained with the diel o2 techniques and the observed temporal changes in water temperature and gas transfer velocity show that 18 o do and thus δ 18 o not only change at sub daily time scales but also between days fig 4 j o blue lines gpp 18o and r 18o determined from the 18 16o technique using the simulated do and 18 o do therefore show temporally less systematic and substantially larger deviation from the true daily mean gpp and r underlying the simulations than in the idealized case with the same true daily mean metabolic rates over many days fig 5 note that the deviation between gpp 18o and the true daily mean gpp can depend on the time of measurement during the day in a similar pattern as for the idealized scenario i e underestimation of the true daily mean gpp in the morning and overestimation in the afternoon fig 5d however gpp 18o can also substantially underestimate fig 5e or overestimate fig 5b the true daily mean gpp independent of the time of measurement during the day i e on the 4th of august gpp 18o is up to 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 fig 5b whereas on the 7th of august gpp o2 is up to 2 5 times larger than gpp 18o fig 5e hence changing conditions between days can cause substantial errors in gpp 18o that may even exceed the errors introduced by the non steady state conditions of do and 18 o do caused by the diel changes in gpp non steady state conditions are caused by temporal changes in gpp and r but also by the temporal changes in v o2 and o 2 sat metabolic rates calculated with the 18 16o technique from model simulations using daily mean v o2 and daily mean o 2 sat gpp 18o m show a similar diel course and similar over and underestimation of the true gpp as gpp 18o fig 5a c however at short time scales gpp 18o fluctuates much more than gpp 18o m fig 5a c suggesting that fluctuations in v o2 which may be caused e g by fluctuations in wind speed may affect gpp o18 mainly at short time scales note that using 5 day averages instead of daily averages of v o2 and o 2 sat had only little effect on the model results and metabolic rates determined from these simulations using the 18 16o technique did not differ substantially from gpp 18o m using daily mean values of o 2 sat instead of the original time series of o 2 sat had only little effect on metabolic rates estimated with the 18 16o technique the example from schwarzenbach r indicates that neither gpp r v o2 nor o 2 sat were at steady state and gpp 18o therefore substantially under and overestimates the true gpp by more than 100 within five days in the same reservoir this finding raises doubts about the reliability of conclusions on the variability of productivity and of carbon transformation in lakes across landscapes and over time if the conclusions are based on metabolic rates that were estimated with the 18 16o technique 3 3 improving the estimation of metabolic rates by combining diel o2 technique with data on δ 18 o in addition to the systematic errors arising from the steady state assumption inherent in the 18 16o technique a common cause of uncertainty in estimated metabolic rates obtained from 18 16o or diel o2 technique is the oxygen transport due to gas exchange affecting the concentrations in the surface water not only quantification of the gas exchange velocity but also of the mixed layer depth is required in 18 16o and diel o2 technique fig 4 illustrates that estimates of r o2 fig 4g i are more sensitive to the assumption on the mixed layer depth than estimates of gpp o2 fig 4a c and daily mean gpp o2 fig 4d f see also table 2 calculations assuming a mixed layer depth of z mix 2 m as in the previous simulations are depicted in blue and will be considered as the reference for comparisons simulations neglecting gas exchange entirely fig 4 black lines can be understood as simulations assuming an infinitely large mixing depth do simulated from the gpp o2 and r o2 estimated assuming different mixing depth agree very well with the data fig 4j l which is not surprising as the estimated metabolic rates were based on the measured do and the assumed z mix the deviations in case of kl brombachsee are a result of the filtering of the estimated gpp in contrast to do δ 18 o is rather sensitive to the z mix assumed showing lower values in case of larger mixing depth fig 4m o the sensitivity of the simulated δ 18 o to the effects of gas exchange suggests that data on δ 18 o can be used to support the estimation of metabolic rates from the diel o2 technique by constraining mixing depth and or gas exchange if these properties are uncertain as measurements of δ 18 o are time consuming we illustrate in the following that 2 measurements of δ 18 o one at the beginning and the other at the end of a 5 day time period can improve estimates of r if gas fluxes are known but not the relevant mixing depths the latter can be fitted using inverse modelling first gpp o2 and r o2 are calculated from the diel o2 technique eqs 7 and 8 afterwards these metabolic rates are employed to simulate the time series of δ 18 o using the first measured δ 18 o value as initial condition the simulated δ 18 o at the end of the 5 day time interval is compared to the value of δ 18 o measured at this time the entire procedure is repeated by assuming a different mixed layer depth until the difference between simulated and measured δ 18 o reaches a minimum because data on δ 18 o were not available the inverse fitting procedure is demonstrated here based on the δ 18 o of the reference simulation with the inverse fitting approach combining diel o2 technique and two values on δ 18 o the mixed layer depth of the reference simulation was reliably estimated and thus also the corresponding metabolic rates even if we started the fitting procedure assuming initially a very large z mix in cases in which the gas fluxes cannot be estimated few δ 18 o measurements may be sufficient to improve the reliability of estimated metabolic rates assuming that the gas exchange velocity divided by the mixed layer depth is constant in time i e v o2 z mix constant the same inverse modelling approach as above can be applied to estimate v o2 z mix this estimate of v o2 z mix can then be used to calculate metabolic rates fig 6 compares the concentrations of do and δ 18 o determined from the reference gpp o2 and r o2 mixed layer depth 2 m and gas exchange determined from data blue lines with do and δ 18 o simulated from gpp o2 nogas and r o2 nogas obtained assuming no gas exchange red line application of inverse modelling based on two values of δ 18 o taken from the reference simulation provides for each of the systems investigated best fit values of the average v o2 z mix that agree very well with the average v o2 z mix of the corresponding reference simulation table 3 the simulations of do and δ 18 o using the fitted v o2 z mix agree well with the results from the reference simulation fig 6a c and fig 6d f dark green and blue lines the respiration rates obtained from the results of the inverse modelling r o2 fit v zmix agree much better with the respiration rates of the reference simulation than with r o2 nogas i e the respiration rate calculated by neglecting the effects of gas exchange and the respiration rates r o2 obtained using the data based time series v o2 and z mix 1 m or z mix 3 m respectively table 3 and fig 7 4 discussion the fundamental difference between diel o2 and 18 16o techniques are the underlying assumptions for the calculation of metabolic rates the diel o2 technique utilizes the daily change in do as basis for the assessment of metabolic rates and assumes gpp to be zero at night and r to be constant during day and night in contrast the 18 16o technique assumes steady state conditions i e that do and 18 o do are constant during day and night and that gpp 18o and r 18o derived from do and 18 o do measured at a single time during a day represent daily mean gpp and daily mean r respectively the assumptions of the 18 16o technique imply that nep is equal to the o2 loss from the surface mixed layer due to gas exchange and that gpp is non zero at night see methods gas losses to the atmosphere depend e g on wind speed and can vary on short time scales in contrast lake metabolic rates are not directly connected to wind but to light intensity nutrients and biomass of the primary producers temporal changes of nep are therefore not expected to be dominated by changes in wind speed and gpp is not expected to occur during darkness furthermore o2 concentrations in the surface water of lakes and reservoirs typically show pronounced daily cycles e g fig 1a c and clearly are not at steady state these arguments indicate that the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o techniques is neither compatible with what is known about the processes causing metabolic rates in lakes and reservoirs nor with observations of do in the surface water of these systems this leads to the question whether the errors introduced by the assumptions of the 18 16o techniques are sufficiently small that the metabolic rates calculated with this technique can be considered a reasonable approximation of the true metabolic rates or whether the errors are large and the application of the18 16o technique provides unreliable results the sensitivity analysis performed here indicates that diel changes in gpp typical for reservoirs and lakes fig 1d f introduce systematic errors in the metabolic rates determined with the 18 16o technique that can be rather large causing gpp o18 and r o18 to deviate by more than 50 from the true gpp and r fig 3 in the sensitivity analysis based on simulations using repeatedly the same idealized diel course of gpp the errors of the metabolic rates depend very systematically on the timing of the measurement during a day in relation to the timing of the maximum gpp fig 2j o the systematic under and overestimation of gpp by gpp 18o arising from the time of measurement may suggest that it is possible to correct for the errors of gpp 18o caused by the diel changes in gpp o 2 and δ 18 o however under field conditions the timing of the daily maximum of the true gpp may vary between days because primary production depends on incident solar radiation and therefore shifts seasonally varies with latitude and is affected by the time series of cloud cover more importantly the changes of gpp between days can introduce even larger discrepancies between gpp 18o and the true gpp than the sub daily changes in gpp fig 5 the example from schwarzenbach r indicates that gpp 18o typically shows a similar diel pattern of the dependence on the measuring time of the day as gpp 18o in the idealized scenarios of gpp depicted in fig 2j o i e gpp 18o is lower if measurements are collected in the morning than in the afternoon of the same day however in contrast to the idealized scenarios the difference between gpp 18o and the true gpp is not necessarily minimal around midday and the true gpp is not necessarily underestimated overestimated by gpp 18o if measurements are conducted in the morning afternoon fig 5 note that the errors of gpp 18o discussed here are not caused by random processes but are systematic errors arising from the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique these errors do not include uncertainties in the measurements of do and δ 18 o note further that the errors of gpp 18o are assessed with a numerical sensitivity analysis in which the conditions are well controlled and the simulations are driven by prescribed gpp and r therefore the conclusions on the errors of gpp 18o are not affected by uncertainties in the gpp and r used in the sensitivity analyses or by uncertainties in vertical mixing or gas exchange in the simulations the prescribed true gpp and r are based on gpp o2 and r o2 derived from the diel o2 technique to include temporal changes of gpp and r in the model scenarios that are consistent with realistic temporal changes in the field note that the uncertainties of gpp o2 and r o2 may influence the time sequence of gpp and r used to drive the simulation but they do not affect the deviations of simulated gpp 18o and r 18o from the prescribed gpp and r the latter are the true metabolic rates within the framework of the numerical sensitivity analysis the conclusions from the numerical sensitivity analysis i e that the errors of gpp 18o and r o18 may deviate substantially from the true gpp and r and the deviations depend on the timing of the field measurements are consistent with comparisons of metabolic rates measured with the 18 16o technique the diel o2 technique and the traditional bottle technique gpp bot in the study by bocaniov et al 2012 gpp 18o calculated from measured do and δ 18 o are significantly correlated with gpp bot but deviate substantially from gpp bot i e gpp bot can be 36 smaller but also more than 4 times larger than gpp o18 gpp o18 measured in mesocosm experiments bogard et al 2017 were not correlated with gpp o2 p 0 54 and the deviation between gpp o2 and gpp 18o ranged from gpp o2 being 23 smaller to gpp o2 being more than an order of magnitude larger than gpp 18o bogard et al 2017 suggested treating the data from the two experiments with the largest gpp o2 as outliers however the remaining 6 values for gpp 18o and gpp o2 are also not correlated p 0 48 and gpp o2 is still up to more than 3 times larger than gpp 18o in lac croche gpp 18o and gpp o2 both declined over the summer months until november but gpp 18o was typically three times larger than gpp o2 bogard et al 2017 in simoncouche gpp 18o and gpp o2 did not show the same seasonal trends i e in contrast to gpp o2 gpp 18o declined over the summer months in summer gpp 18o was up to 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 but in november gpp 18o and gpp o2 had similar values bogard et al 2017 summarizing measurements of gpp o2 and gpp 18o in lakes and mesocosms show that gpp 18o can be more than 2 5 times larger than gpp o2 but that gpp o2 can also be more than 2 5 times larger than gpp 18o these observations are consistent with our sensitivity analysis indicating that the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique introduces errors in gpp 18o that can explain underestimation and overestimation of gpp o2 of gpp 18o by factors of 2 5 these large errors make inter comparisons of metabolic rates derived from the 18 16o technique between systems of different production vogt et al 2017 or across landscapes at regional scales bogard et al 2019 rather uncertain because of the systematic nature of the errors also statistical analysis may produce unreliable results as is suggested by the lack of correlation between gpp o2 of gpp 18o and r o2 of r 18o in mesocosm experiments and by the different long term trends of gpp o2 of gpp 18o in simoncouche bogard et al 2017 despite these limitations the 18 16o technique may be interesting for very low productive systems in which temporal changes in do and δ 18 o are small and the diel o2 technique may come to its limits e g in the simulation with idealized gpp and constant temperature and gas exchange velocity the diel amplitude of do was only 0 14 mg l 1 at daily mean gpp 0 25 mgo2 l 1 d 1 although such small changes in do can be resolved by oxygen optodes do in real systems is affected by gas exchange of o2 with the atmosphere and by mixing processes causing fluctuations in do that can exceed the diel change in do due to the metabolic transformations at small gpp in such cases the application of the diel o2 technique requires detailed corrections for the transport processes that are usually not available at sufficient precision the sensitivity analysis suggests that the 18 16o technique provides more reliable results in low than in high productive lakes fig 4 which is in contrast to bocaniov et al 2015 the decrease of the typical error range of gpp 18o with decreasing gpp fig 4 can be explained by the fact that at small gpp the diel change in do is smaller and thus the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique better justified than at large gpp whether the 18 16o technique indeed can help improving the estimates of metabolic rates in systems with low gpp depends on the accuracy of the δ18o measurements in do water and atmosphere but also on the rate of change within and between days of metabolic rates and environmental conditions and on the consequences of transport processes affecting do and 18 o do measurements of do and oxygen isotopes in low productive systems may help to constrain the range of gpp in which diel o2 and 18 16o technique respectively provide reliable estimates of metabolic rates independent of the 18 16o technique measurements of δ18o may support the analysis of metabolic rates and contribute to the reliability of estimated metabolic rates combination of the diel o2 technique with few δ 18 o measurements can constrain uncertainties especially in the estimates of r arising from uncertainties in the quantification of the effects of gas exchange on the o2 concentrations in the surface waters if z mix is difficult to determine in the aquatic system investigated it can be assessed by including δ18o measurements from at least two different sampling dates in the analysis based on the diel o2 technique note that such analysis assumes that z mix is constant during the time period between consecutive δ18o measurements which imposes a limit on the time span between required δ 18 o measurements similarly a mean value of v gas z mix can be estimated for the time span between the δ18o measurements 5 conclusions 1 the steady state assumption underlying the 18 16o technique results in large errors between gpp 18o and the true gpp i e gpp 18o can underestimate or overestimate the true gpp by more than a factor of 2 5 2 gpp 18o does not provide reliable information on differences of gpp between systems or on the temporal development of gpp within systems in some studies gpp 18o and gpp were significantly correlated in others not observations include cases in which i gpp 18o increased with gpp ii gpp 18o changed while gpp was constant and iii changes in gpp 18o were not related to changes in gpp 3 the above conclusions indicate that correlation analyses of metabolic rates estimated from individual lake visits using the 18 16o techniques may be unreliable hence conclusions based on such analysis e g that primary production increases with an increase in co2 vogt et al 2017 or that lakes of the arid circumpolar landscape recycle surprisingly little terrestrial carbon bogard et al 2019 must be re considered carefully 4 in unproductive systems it may be beneficial to apply the 18 16o technique for the assessment of metabolic rates because temporal changes in do are small and the diel o2 technique may come to its limits 5 the combination of few stable isotope measurements with the diel o2 technique can be used in an inverse modelling approach to improve the reliability of estimates of gpp and especially of r

18509,progestins pgs are a group of steroid hormones known to have endocrine disrupting effects these compounds can enter the aquatic environment via the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater and the disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants stps thus their removal in stps are of great importance the present study simultaneously investigated the occurrences and fates of 62 pgs in a municipal stp in beijing china progesterone p and its metabolites were found to be the predominant compounds with total dissolved concentrations of 1866 ng l in the influent about 11 p metabolites were newly detected accounting for 25 55 and 75 91 of the total concentrations in wastewater and sludge respectively for the other three groups of pgs derived from different parent compounds p derivatives were first detected in the stp with the highest concentration in the wastewater and sludge followed by 19 nortestosterone nt derivatives and 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives the removal efficiencies in the dissolved phase of wastewater were relatively high for p and its metabolites 95 99 and p derivatives 91 99 and the relative persistence of nt 68 99 and 17α ohp derivatives 79 99 was observed during the wastewater treatment processes mass balance analysis showed that the lost mass proportions were as high as 41 99 the mass fractions in sludge were in the range of 0 55 and 0 24 25 of the initial mass loadings was present in the effluent these results indicated that biodegradation was the major removal mechanism of pgs in the stp graphical abstract image 1 keywords progestins sewage treatment plant biodegradation adsorption mass balance 1 introduction in recent years the presence of steroid hormones in the aquatic environment has caused extensive concerns due to their endocrine disrupting effects parks et al 2001 sorensen et al 2005 zucchi et al 2012 2013 2014 runnalls et al 2013 liang et al 2015 progestins pgs are a group of steroid hormones with progestogenic activities with excretion rates from human and livestock 100 1000 times that of generally concerned estrogen shore and shemesh 2003 besse and garric 2009 in addition to natural pgs many synthetic pgs are widely used by humans and animals for various purposes such as oral contraceptives and growth promoters mortensen and pedersen 2007 yang et al 2009 liu et al 2011 fent 2015 these pgs can enter the environment mainly through the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater and the disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants stps and concentrated animal feeding operations zheng et al 2008 liu et al 2012 fent 2015 recently pgs were reported to have significant effects on reproduction in fathead minnows and japanese medaka at the nanogram per liter level dequattro et al 2012 runnalls et al 2013 paulos et al 2010 kumar et al 2015 therefore the presence of pgs in the environment is a potential threat to aquatic organisms and discharging of these compounds is important for assessing the ecological risks they pose stp plays a vital role in the pollution control of steroid hormones in the environment occurrences of some pgs have been investigated in the influents and effluents of stps chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 but information about behaviors and mass balances of a wide range of pgs in different treatment processes in the stps is scarce among pgs progesterone p is a naturally produced endogenous steroid hormone and is also chemically synthesized and used in human and veterinary therapy besides the parent compound p can be further biotransformed to more than 30 metabolites in humans and vertebrates some of the p metabolites have been reported to have biological activities and pose potential ecological risks for example 20β hydroprogesterone 20β ohp and 20α dihydroprogesterone 20α dhp have been reported to possess 20 50 of the relative progestogenic activity of p beranič et al 2011 bińkowska and woroń 2015 5β dhp is an agonist of the pregnane x receptor mitchell et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2007 and 3α 5β thp is a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa receptor and a negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor reddy 2003 however the previous studies only focused on the parent p and four metabolites 17α ohp 21α ohp 17α 20β dohp and 5α dhp fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and the behaviors of active p metabolites were neglected moreover it is unknown about the predominant p metabolites and their corresponding fates and removal in the stps besides p and its metabolites there is a broad spectrum steroids with progesterone like actions derived from different parent compounds p derivatives 19 nortestosterone nt derivatives and 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives are three major synthetic pgs 40 compounds according to chemical modifications of p t and 17α ohp respectively schindler et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 shen et al 2018 the three groups of pgs are used as the intergradient of various oral contraceptives and other medicines and they are used at quantities as high as 100 times those of estrogen zeilinger et al 2009 currently the available studies mainly focused on the establishment of analytical methods for these compounds in environmental samples fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 shen et al 2018 only a few pgs including 1 p derivatives 4 nt derivatives and 5 17α ohp derivatives were investigated in the stp processes and a wide range of removal rates 50 95 was reported chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 understanding the behavior and fate of these steroids can help improving treatment processes therefore there is a need to comprehensively acquire the occurrence fate and mass balance of these compounds in the stp moreover concentrations of pgs in dehydrated sludge are reported at levels similar to and sometimes even higher than those in stp effluents huang et al 2014 liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 the sorption behaviors of pgs with diverse structures in the sludge which may also be a potential source of pg contamination in the environment remained unknown based on the current studies in this study we simultaneously investigated the occurrences of 62 pgs including 19 p and metabolites 17 p derivatives 12 nt derivatives and 14 17α ohp derivatives figs s1 s4 in the wastewater and sludge sampled in a stp in beijing where the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o tanks were applied as the main treatment units the transport fate removal efficiencies and mechanisms of the four groups of pgs were studied in the aquatic and solid phases during the treatment processes by mass flow and mass balance analysis the results are expected to provide insights into the fate and removal of four groups of pgs in stps and their subsequent release to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the targeted sixty two pgs

grab samples collected from different times within each sampling day 3 the dehydrated sludge samples were collected at dehydration unit in the stp n 3 each samples was taken by combining five grab samples of which three were collected during the sampling time in november and two were further collected on december 8th and 15th taking 20 25 days of the solid retention time into consideration all the samples were collected in pre cleaned amber glass bottles after sealing without headspace the samples were transported immediately to the laboratory within 2 h for pretreatment sludge liquid samples were separated into the aqueous and solid phase by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 min water samples were filtered through a gf f 0 7 μm glass microfiber filter whatman maidstone uk sludge samples were freeze dried grinded and sifted 100 meshes of sieve the water flow q and several regular water quality parameters e g codcr bod5 nh4 n do tp and tss at each treatment unit were shown in the supplementary material table s2 during the sampling period the average removal efficiencies of codcr bod5 tp and tss were in the range of 92 97 suggesting that the studied stp were under normal operation conditions in addition tss and q were used for the estimations of mass flux and mass balance analysis 2 3 sample pretreatment the water samples were prepared by using our recently published method shen et al 2018 briefly six isotope labelled standards were spiked into the filtered wastewater 0 5 l influent 1 l effluent at concentrations of 100 ng l then the wastewater samples were extracted onto hlb cartridges in a vacuum manifold supelco visiprep 24tmdl madrid spain at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the cartridges were pre activated with 6 ml of etoac 6 ml of acn and 12 ml of purified water after washed and dried the cartridge was eluted with 6 ml of mixture of etoac acn 1 1 v v the eluents were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 200 μl methanol for instrumental analysis for sludge suspended particles 0 5 g freeze dried samples spiked with 20 ng of six isotope labelled standards were ultrasonic extracted with 20 ml mixture of methanol acn 1 1 v v ultrasound procedures at 200 w were performed in an ultrasonic cleaner model kq 500de kunshan china at room temperature for 20 min after centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant of slurry was transferred to a pear shaped flask this process was performed three times and the combined extract was concentrated to about 2 ml using a rotary evaporator the concentrated sample was diluted with 200 ml of ultrapure water and then purified on hlb cartridges with the same procedure as for the water samples described above 2 4 uplc ms ms analysis the pgs were analyzed by a waters acquity uplc system combined with a waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an esi interface in positive ion mode as described previously shen et al 2018 a uplc hss t3 1 7 μm 100 mm 2 1 mm waters was used to separate 62 analytes including 11 groups of isomers the injection volume used were 2 μl the column temperature selected was 40 c the flow rate used was 0 3 ml min the mobile phases consisted of methanol a and 0 1 formic acid in water b gradient conditions were initiated with 60 a followed by a linear increase to 70 in 8 min 85 in 5 min 100 in 1 min and maintained for 3 min the multi selected reaction monitoring mrm mode was used in the quantitation of pgs the protonated molecular ions m h was found to be the precursor ions for all the target pgs and two abundant mrm transitions were selected collision energy and cone voltage were acquired by injecting the standard solution of each pg into the mass spectrometer in order to improve the sensitivity of detection the data acquisition was performed under time segmented conditions based on the chromatographic separation of the target pgs table s3 the optimized parameters selected in the esi source were shown below cone gas flow 150 l h capillary voltage 3 00 kv desolvation gas flow 900 l h desolvation gas temperature 450 c and source temperature 150 c 2 5 quality assurance and quality control identification of the pgs in the samples was performed by comparing the retention time 2 and the ratio 20 of the two selected mrm ion transitions in comparison with the corresponding standards a recovery experiment was conducted to evaluate the method accuracy by spiking at least three times the original concentration of standard pgs into water samples and solid samples for the various matrices considered the recoveries of the present method were in the range of 68 112 with a relative standard deviation of 16 all equipment before use was rinsed with methanol to minimize the risk of contamination six procedural blanks three for water sample and three for solid sample were carried out with each set of samples to check the interfering peaks and potential background values for accurately quantifying the target compounds in various environmental matrices it would be ideal to have isotope labelled standards for each corresponding pg to compensate for losses and matrix effects unfortunately this equates to the added cost of obtaining labelled reference materials and more importantly it is not commercially available for each of isotope labelled pg in this study mga d3 ng d6 mfp d3 cpa d3 eth 13c2 and p d9 were used as surrogate standards and the isotope labelled standards corresponding to the quantification of each progestin were listed in table s3 as shown the isotope labelled standards are eluted at similar retention times to the corresponding pgs in the lc conditions and their application as surrogate standard has been used and assessed for quantifications of these pgs in river and effluent samples in our previous study shen et al 2018 in this study the recoveries of the six isotope labelled standards were in the range of 60 106 in the analyzed influent and sludge samples which was comparable to those 64 99 of pgs indicating their efficiency as surrogate standards to correct the losses of target pgs during extraction or sample preparation the method detection and quantification limit mdl and mql for each target compound in the field samples were calculated based on the signal to noise s n ratio near the target peak the mdls s n 3 of the target pgs were 0 02 0 67 ng l in the influent and 0 03 1 1 ng g dry weight dw in the sludge respectively concerning the mql s n 10 they ranged from 0 07 to 2 3 ng l for influent and from 0 11 to 3 7 ng g dw for sludge respectively table s3 no target pgs were found in the blank analysis n 18 2 6 mass balance calculations the mass flux of pgs in every processing unit including aerated grit chamber anaerobic tank anoxic tank aerobic tank secondary clarifier internal recirculation return sludge excess sludge and liquid of dehydrated sludge were calculated by multiplying the average daily flow rates by concentrations of pgs equation 1 1 w q c dissolved c adsorbed c tss where w g d means the total mass flow of pgs in each treatment unit c dissolved and c adsorbed represent the concentrations of pgs in the dissolved ng l and adsorbed ng g phase respectively q is daily water flow m3 d and c tss is the concentration of tss mg l in wastewater to evaluate the contribution of adsorption and degradation to the removal of pgs in the stp we regarded the influent as system input 100 then the output included effluent and dehydrated sludge the lost w lost was considered as degradation or transformation during wastewater treatment processes and could be calculated by equation 2 2 w lost w influent w effluent w sludge where w influent and w effluent show the mass loading of pgs in the influent and effluent g d respectively w sludge represent the mass in dehydrated sludge g d the w influent w effluent and w sludge were calculated by the daily water flow q m3 d and detected concentrations of pgs in the dissolved and adsorbed phases through equation 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrences in the stp influent of the 62 pgs analyzed 31 compounds were detected in influent with total dissolved concentrations up to 2000 ng l the median concentrations and standard deviations of four groups of pgs in dissolved and adsorbed phases were shown in table s4 and table s5 among the detected p and its metabolites four p metabolites 17α ohp 5α dhp 5β dhp and 3α 5β thp were the dominant compounds respectively accounting for 59 3 1 8 6 0 96 6 1 1 4 and 5 4 0 64 of the total dissolved pg concentrations the dissolved concentrations of p metabolites were significantly higher than those of the parent p consistent with the fact that p undergoes extensive metabolism and that only traces of the parent compound are excreted in biotas besse and garric 2009 however most previous investigations mainly studied the environmental occurrences of p yost et al 2014 huang et al 2014 pauwels et al 2008 and only four metabolites 17α 20β dohp 17α ohp 21α ohp and 5α dhp have been studied previously in stps liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 in this study fourteen p metabolites were detected in the influent of stp and their concentrations were mostly higher than those of p it should be noted that 17α ohp was detected at the highest concentrations 1180 64 ng l among all of the pgs and levels of the compound are much higher than those reported previously 0 9 14 2 ng l fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 in addition relatively high concentrations of 5β dhp 120 27 ng l and 3α 5β thp 107 12 ng l were first observed in the stp wastewater 5β dhp is an agonist of the pregnane x receptor regulating uterine contractility through activation of the receptor mitchell et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2007 3α 5β thp is a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa receptor and a negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor having anticonvulsant anesthetic anxiolytic and sedative effects reddy 2003 thus we could not exclude the possibility of their potential effects in the aquatic environment especially when they occur at high concentrations in environmental waters as for the other three groups of 42 pgs 8 p derivatives 3 nt derivatives and 5 17α ohp derivatives were detected in the influent the highest total dissolved concentrations were observed for p derivatives 70 12 ng l followed by nt derivatives 43 8 2 ng l and 17α ohp derivatives 4 6 1 3 ng l this is consistent with the wide usages of p derivatives in medical services schindler et al 2003 besse and garric 2009 in this study eight p derivatives were detected in the influent with 1 dhp dgt and 11 kp being the dominant compounds followed by 16 dhp 5β dh 11 kp 6β oh 11 kp deltap and 1 6 ddhp surprisingly p derivatives have been generally neglected in previous studies šauer et al 2018 fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 little data is available about their occurrences in environmental waters liu et al 2014 shen et al 2018 the predominance of p derivatives in synthetic pgs was also found in the river samples in our recent investigation shen et al 2018 concentrations of dgt were up to 9330 ng l in the waste lagoon from one swine farm in china liu et al 2015 p derivatives are progestin medications which are used for a variety of indications e g threatened or recurrent miscarriage and components of hormone therapy e g menopausal schindler et al 2003 kuhl 2005 as shown in fig s1 and s2 many p derivatives are structurally introduced π bonds e g dgt at c 6 1 6 ddhp at c 1 and c 6 or various groups at c 6 e g keto in 11 kp which are different from the general hydroxylation and hydrogenation in the natural metabolism of p the high levels of p derivatives might be additionally due to the microbial transformation from other steroids since the hydroxy keto interconversions and dehydrogenation have been reported for estrogens and androgens in natural and engineered systems khanal et al 2006 yang et al 2011 khan et al 2008 the wide applications and abundant occurrences of p derivatives suggested that more attentions should be paid on these compounds in the future among the analyzed nt derivatives three compounds were detected in this study with nvt being dominant followed by eth and mfp similar concentrations of mfp were also observed in the influent of six czech stps nd 0 65 ng l šauer et al 2018 the generally studied nt derivatives net ng were not detected in this investigation and similar results were also found in other three asian stps chang et al 2008 fan et al 2011 of the detected 17α ohp derivatives mpa and 15β ohcpa were the predominant compounds followed by cpa mga and 16 17 ep 15β ohcpa is the metabolite of cpa and it exhibits similar or even greater antiandrogen activity compared with the parent compound thus as highlighted in previous studies on pharmaceuticals and other chemicals huschek et al 2004 ashrap et al 2017 metabolism is one of the most important processes and special attention should be paid to the active metabolites of pgs 3 2 removal efficiencies in the dissolved phases after the secondary treatment the 31 pg compounds detected in the influent were found in the effluent with the total dissolved pg concentrations up to 18 2 0 ng l only limit pgs 17α ohp 17α 20β dohp 5α dhp mpa mga and cpa have been previously reported in the stp effluent chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 šauer et al 2018 in this study the predominant compounds were found to be 5α dhp 17α ohp and 5β dhp which respectively accounted for 24 15 and 7 2 of the total effluent concentrations by comparing the dissolved concentrations in influents and secondary effluents the removal efficiencies for the 31 detected pgs were in the range of 68 99 as shown in fig 5 p and its metabolites were removed by 95 99 which was slightly higher than those reported in several chinese stps and two japanese stps p 85 98 17α ohp 89 94 and 17α 20β dohp 18 100 chang et al 2008 2011 fan et al 2011 huang et al 2014 similar high removal efficiencies were also found for p derivatives 91 99 suggesting that these two pg groups were easily removed by the stp treatment processes relatively low removal efficiencies were found for nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives for example mfp 68 6 2 eth 79 2 9 16 17 ep 79 17 and cpa 80 2 9 these compounds exhibited relatively high recalcitrance under the current treatment processing conditions probably because of the persistent structures of these compounds for example cpa has a chlorine substitution at the c6 position and 16 17 ep has a cyclic configuration at the adjacent carbon atoms c16 and c17 miyamoto et al 2014 3 3 concentration variations within treatment units as shown in fig 1 the total dissolved pg concentrations significantly decreased along the treatment processes in the stp especially in the biological treatment processes the total pg concentrations were reduced by 80 in the anaerobic tank 80 in the anoxic tank and 48 in the aerobic tank suggesting that biodegradation is a very important process for removing pgs in the stp the concentration change percentages of abundant pgs in the three biological treatment units were shown in fig s6 anaerobic and anoxic treatments greatly reduced the concentrations of most pgs and similar high removal percentages were previously observed for 3 p metabolites and 2 17α ohp derivatives in the anaerobic and anoxic treatment units fan et al 2011 in contrast estrogens were mainly removed under the aerobic conditions joss et al 2004 it is interesting to note that the concentrations of 1 6 ddhp in the aerobic tank and 20β ohp and 16 dhp in the anoxic tank were increased with negative change percentages up to 91 it has been reported that microbial transformation of p could form dehydrogenation and hydroxylation products donova and egorova 2012 liu et al 2013 ojoghoro et al 2017 al awadi et al 2002 therefore 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp could be the microbial transformation products of p during the biological treatment processes further suggesting the importance of biodegradation for these pgs in the physicochemical treatment units the pg concentrations showed no obvious changes in the aerated grit chamber and secondary clarifiers fig 1 this phenomenon can be expected since the medium or low adsorption potentials of most pgs estimated log k ow 4 acd chemsketch 10 0 limit the capabilities of sedimentation for removing pgs in addition the specific size of sludge particles capable of adsorbing compounds is extremely restricted by the grit chamber or secondary clarifier nie et al 2012 luo et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the k d values of all detected pgs in each process of the stp were estimated most of the k d values are in the range of 0 01 35 l g except for 3β 5β thp 1 8 66 l g 3β 5α thp 1 5 81 l g 1 dhp 2 2 188 l g deltap 14 177 l g and 16 17 ep 14 70 l g these k d values are much lower than those of chemicals having strong adsorption affinities to sludge for example siloxanes with k d up to 1230 l g bletsou et al 2013 and chlorinated paraffins with k d up to 2030 l g zeng et al 2013 the low k d values were consistent with the fact that pg concentrations were relative constant in the physicochemical treatment units suggesting that sorption is of minor importance in removing of pgs in the stp esperanza et al 2007 in the suspended particles and dehydrated sludge twenty nine pgs were detected as shown in fig 1 the total adsorbed concentration was the highest in the suspended particles of influent 822 21 ng g dry weight dw and there was a decreasing trend along the treatment units different from wastewater the sludge concentrations of pgs in each biological treatment unit were very similar possibly because of the large amount of activated sludge recycled continuously as internal recirculation and the return sludge in the stp in the dehydrated sludge the total concentration of p and its metabolites 154 ng g dw was much higher than those of p derivatives 35 ng g dw nt derivatives 3 5 ng g dw and 17α ohp derivatives 4 3 ng g dw the large amount of sewage sludge is an important source of contamination in china and the accumulation of pgs in dehydrated sludge deserves more attention 3 4 profiles along the treatment processes proportions of target pgs in the wastewater and suspended particles sludge of each treatment unit are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 and the profiles of each group of the detected pgs are also shown in fig s7 s10 the detected p and its metabolites were divided into three groups i the parent p ii p metabolites reported in the previous studies 17α ohp 17α 20β dohp and 5α dhp and iii p metabolites first detected in this study including the other 11 compounds as shown in fig 2 the profiles of detected compounds in the wastewater and sludge were markedly different in the dissolved phases of wastewater proportions of the reported p metabolites 40 74 were found to be comparable to those of the first detected p metabolites 25 55 while p was detected at very low percentages 1 0 6 0 proportions of the reported p metabolites decreased to 5 8 18 in the solid samples and those of the first detected p metabolites increased to 75 91 these results indicate that the p metabolites first detected in this study account for a high proportion either in the dissolved or in the solid phases it is worth mentioning that the proportion of p increased slightly along the treatment process in wastewater and exhibited a decreasing trend in the sludge suggesting its relatively low affinity to sludge compared with its metabolites the proportions of three groups of other pgs were similar in the wastewater and sludge with p derivatives being the predominant group 59 85 followed by nt derivatives 8 2 37 and 17α ohp derivatives 3 3 14 fig 3 pgs were mainly removed through biodegradation in the stp as discussed above thus the profiles of the individual pgs along the treatment processes would help clarify the biodegradation of the compounds in each treatment unit among the detected pgs 17α ohp has been reported to be the microbial biotransformation product of p kolar et al 2007 manosroi et al 2008 donova and egorova 2012 furthermore 3 pgs 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp with negative concentration change percentages might also be the microbial transformation products of p as shown in fig s7 s8 the proportions of the four compounds exhibited significant variations along the treatment units thus the profile variations of the four pgs were analyzed the proportion of 17α ohp in dissolved phase showed a significant decrease in anoxic tank 63 35 while those in adsorbed phase showed a slight increase 6 3 12 this is possible due to that 17α ohp was vulnerable to microbial transformation in the anoxic tank which is supported by the previous studies that 17α ohp is transformed into a variety of hydroxylated products by microorganisms bhatti and khera 2012 the proportions of 20β ohp and 16 dhp in dissolved phase both showed an obvious increasing tendency in anoxic tank 0 5 4 1 5 3 22 while those in adsorbed phase were constant 1 7 1 3 3 3 2 7 fig s7 s8 hydroxylation and dehydrogenation of p have been reported by b sphaericus and b stearothermophilus donova and egorova 2012 al awadi et al 2002 respectively possibly contributing to the increased proportions of the two compounds in anoxic tank as for 1 6 ddhp the proportions in dissolved phase showed an increase in the aerobic tank 1 7 5 2 but those in the adsorbed phase was constant 0 35 0 49 fig s8 suggesting that p could be transformed to 1 6 ddhp via dehydrogenation by aerobic microorganisms similarly testosterone can be dehydrogenated to 1 dehydeotestosterone by aerobic bacterial cwiertny et al 2014 these results revealed that the biological treatment processes play an important role influencing the profiles of pgs along the treatment processes 3 5 mass flow and mass balance analysis to explore the removal mechanisms such as biodegradation adsorption and transformation of pgs in the stp the mass flux of individual pgs in dissolved and adsorbed phases in the treatment processes were calculated tables s6 and s7 and the mass flows of total pgs throughout the treatment processes are illustrated in fig 4 the individual mass flows of p and its metabolites p derivatives nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives are also displayed in figs s11 s14 in the influent the mass flows of total pgs entering the stp were 366 8 9 g d and they consisted of 317 g d in the dissolved phase and 49 g d in the adsorbed phase after passage through the aerated grit chamber the mass flows of pgs showed a slightly decrease 15 28 and the total pgs mass flows entering the activated sludge system were 293 11 g d of which 266 g d were found in the dissolved phase and 27 g d in the adsorbed phase the mass flows in the adsorbed phase showed a significant increase through the anaerobic and anoxic units this was mainly caused by the large amount of circulating sludge from the return sludge and internal recirculation in contrast the mass flows in the dissolved phase showed a significant decline across the activated sludge system with the mass change percentages being 60 in the anaerobic unit 57 in the anoxic unit and 51 in the aerobic unit the significant mass decrease of total pgs in the activated sludge system further illustrates that biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism of pgs in the stp it should be noted that the mass reductions of the four pg groups in the dissolved phase exhibited compound specific variations in the three biological treatment units the reduced mass percentages were very similar 53 60 for p and its metabolites in the three units the anaerobic process contributed to most of the mass reduction of p derivatives and nt derivatives 60 80 and the aerobic treatment contributed mostly to the mass reduction of 17α ohp derivatives in the secondary effluent the mass flows of total pgs in the dissolved phase were 2 9 0 31 g d the highest discharge loading was found in p and its metabolites 2 4 0 29 g d followed by 0 33 0 02 g d for p derivatives 0 11 0 01 g d for nt derivatives and 0 05 0 02 g d for 17α ohp derivatives in contrast the mass flows 0 35 0 09 g d were much lower for the total pgs in suspended solid besides the secondary effluent discharge dehydrated sludge was another pathway for pgs entering the environment and the mass flows were 11 1 0 g d 2 6 0 16 g d 0 26 0 01 g d and 0 31 0 13 g d for p and its metabolites p derivatives nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives respectively to evaluate the contributions of biodegradation and adsorption to the removal of the four groups of pgs in the current treatment processes of the investigated stp mass balance calculations were conducted fig 6 we considered the mass flows in the influent containing dissolved and adsorbed phases as the import 100 and the export comprised the i effluent w effluent ii dehydrated sludge w sludge with iii the mass loss during the process w lost as shown in fig 6 low proportions of pgs 0 24 6 5 were discharged through effluent except for nt derivatives 0 65 25 about 0 22 of the initial loading was discharged through dehydrated sludge except for the 17α ohp derivatives of which mass proportion of adsorption by sludge was found to be 1 4 55 especially for 16 17 ep this is possibly due to the relatively high log k ow and subsequent k d values of the group of compounds in contrast the proportions of mass losses due to biodegradation were as high as 88 99 for p and its metabolites except for 3β 5β thp and 3β 5α thp 63 64 78 94 for p derivatives 68 96 for nt derivatives and 41 96 for 17α ohp derivatives the mass balances were further calculated for p and its four potential microbial transformation products 17α ohp 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp since these compounds were degraded mainly through microbial pathways in the biological treatment units based on the above analysis and references donova and egorova 2012 bhatti and khera 2012 cwiertny et al 2014 the proportions of mass losses due to microbial degradation were 85 99 for the five compounds it has been reported that mineralization of steroids cholesterol testosterone and 17β estradiol was observed when these compounds were incubated with some microorganisms chiang et al 2007 fahrbach et al 2006 2010 about 6 of 17β estradiol and 63 of testosterone could be mineralized under aerobic conditions and only 0 2 of the compounds were anaerobically mineralized fan et al 2007 so the potential degradation mechanisms in the stp might include mineralization of pgs as carbon sources as well as microbial transformations exemplified by the conversion of p into 17α ohp kolar et al 2007 manosroi et al 2008 donova and egorova 2012 these results further demonstrated that biodegradation in terms of microbial pathways was the main removal mechanism of most pgs in the stp 4 conclusions the occurrence fate and mass balance of 62 pgs in a typical municipal stp were simultaneously studied p metabolites were the predominant compounds followed by p derivatives which were first found with high abundances compared to the widely concerned nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives 68 99 of the detected pgs in the dissolved phases were removed in the stp and biodegradation via microbial transformation was the major removal mechanism recycled activated sludge

18509,progestins pgs are a group of steroid hormones known to have endocrine disrupting effects these compounds can enter the aquatic environment via the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater and the disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants stps thus their removal in stps are of great importance the present study simultaneously investigated the occurrences and fates of 62 pgs in a municipal stp in beijing china progesterone p and its metabolites were found to be the predominant compounds with total dissolved concentrations of 1866 ng l in the influent about 11 p metabolites were newly detected accounting for 25 55 and 75 91 of the total concentrations in wastewater and sludge respectively for the other three groups of pgs derived from different parent compounds p derivatives were first detected in the stp with the highest concentration in the wastewater and sludge followed by 19 nortestosterone nt derivatives and 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives the removal efficiencies in the dissolved phase of wastewater were relatively high for p and its metabolites 95 99 and p derivatives 91 99 and the relative persistence of nt 68 99 and 17α ohp derivatives 79 99 was observed during the wastewater treatment processes mass balance analysis showed that the lost mass proportions were as high as 41 99 the mass fractions in sludge were in the range of 0 55 and 0 24 25 of the initial mass loadings was present in the effluent these results indicated that biodegradation was the major removal mechanism of pgs in the stp graphical abstract image 1 keywords progestins sewage treatment plant biodegradation adsorption mass balance 1 introduction in recent years the presence of steroid hormones in the aquatic environment has caused extensive concerns due to their endocrine disrupting effects parks et al 2001 sorensen et al 2005 zucchi et al 2012 2013 2014 runnalls et al 2013 liang et al 2015 progestins pgs are a group of steroid hormones with progestogenic activities with excretion rates from human and livestock 100 1000 times that of generally concerned estrogen shore and shemesh 2003 besse and garric 2009 in addition to natural pgs many synthetic pgs are widely used by humans and animals for various purposes such as oral contraceptives and growth promoters mortensen and pedersen 2007 yang et al 2009 liu et al 2011 fent 2015 these pgs can enter the environment mainly through the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater and the disposal of sludge from sewage treatment plants stps and concentrated animal feeding operations zheng et al 2008 liu et al 2012 fent 2015 recently pgs were reported to have significant effects on reproduction in fathead minnows and japanese medaka at the nanogram per liter level dequattro et al 2012 runnalls et al 2013 paulos et al 2010 kumar et al 2015 therefore the presence of pgs in the environment is a potential threat to aquatic organisms and discharging of these compounds is important for assessing the ecological risks they pose stp plays a vital role in the pollution control of steroid hormones in the environment occurrences of some pgs have been investigated in the influents and effluents of stps chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 but information about behaviors and mass balances of a wide range of pgs in different treatment processes in the stps is scarce among pgs progesterone p is a naturally produced endogenous steroid hormone and is also chemically synthesized and used in human and veterinary therapy besides the parent compound p can be further biotransformed to more than 30 metabolites in humans and vertebrates some of the p metabolites have been reported to have biological activities and pose potential ecological risks for example 20β hydroprogesterone 20β ohp and 20α dihydroprogesterone 20α dhp have been reported to possess 20 50 of the relative progestogenic activity of p beranič et al 2011 bińkowska and woroń 2015 5β dhp is an agonist of the pregnane x receptor mitchell et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2007 and 3α 5β thp is a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa receptor and a negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor reddy 2003 however the previous studies only focused on the parent p and four metabolites 17α ohp 21α ohp 17α 20β dohp and 5α dhp fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and the behaviors of active p metabolites were neglected moreover it is unknown about the predominant p metabolites and their corresponding fates and removal in the stps besides p and its metabolites there is a broad spectrum steroids with progesterone like actions derived from different parent compounds p derivatives 19 nortestosterone nt derivatives and 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives are three major synthetic pgs 40 compounds according to chemical modifications of p t and 17α ohp respectively schindler et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 shen et al 2018 the three groups of pgs are used as the intergradient of various oral contraceptives and other medicines and they are used at quantities as high as 100 times those of estrogen zeilinger et al 2009 currently the available studies mainly focused on the establishment of analytical methods for these compounds in environmental samples fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 shen et al 2018 only a few pgs including 1 p derivatives 4 nt derivatives and 5 17α ohp derivatives were investigated in the stp processes and a wide range of removal rates 50 95 was reported chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 šauer et al 2018 understanding the behavior and fate of these steroids can help improving treatment processes therefore there is a need to comprehensively acquire the occurrence fate and mass balance of these compounds in the stp moreover concentrations of pgs in dehydrated sludge are reported at levels similar to and sometimes even higher than those in stp effluents huang et al 2014 liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 the sorption behaviors of pgs with diverse structures in the sludge which may also be a potential source of pg contamination in the environment remained unknown based on the current studies in this study we simultaneously investigated the occurrences of 62 pgs including 19 p and metabolites 17 p derivatives 12 nt derivatives and 14 17α ohp derivatives figs s1 s4 in the wastewater and sludge sampled in a stp in beijing where the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o tanks were applied as the main treatment units the transport fate removal efficiencies and mechanisms of the four groups of pgs were studied in the aquatic and solid phases during the treatment processes by mass flow and mass balance analysis the results are expected to provide insights into the fate and removal of four groups of pgs in stps and their subsequent release to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the targeted sixty two pgs

phase extraction cartridges were supplied by waters milford ma usa ultrapure water was produced through the milli q purification system millipore billerica usa at the conductivity of 18 2 ω cm 1 2 2 sample collection the stp investigated in this study mainly treats domestic sewage 400 000 m3 d serving approximately a population of 814 000 in beijing china the influent firstly passes through the primary clarification including screen and aerated grit chamber the sludge from the aerated grit chamber is transported for dehydration and the primary effluent enters an activated sludge system with a2 o bioreactors part of the aerobic effluent returns to the anoxic bioreactor the secondary effluent was discharged into the receiving water after secondary sedimentation treatment after settled in the secondary sedimentation tank most of activated sludge was back to anaerobic bioreactor and the rest was transferred to the dehydrating station dehydrated sludge is removed for final disposal without further digestion the hydraulic retention time hrt were 15 h in aerated grit chamber 2 h in anaerobic 3 h in anoxic and 11 h in aerobic bioreactor the total solid retention time was 20 25 day to explore the transport and fate of pgs in the stp samples including wastewater sludge liquid and dehydrated sludge were taken from each sampling location on november 24 27 and 29 2017 respectively sunny weather the stp workflow and the sampling sites are displayed in fig s5 all samples were collected in duplicate on each sampling day and the detail information was listed 1 wastewater samples included influent primary effluent secondary effluent and liquid of dedydrated sludge n 24 influent and secondary effluent samples were 24 h composite samples which were collected using flow proportional samplers cooled at 4 c 2 h of sampling interval primary effluent samples and liquid of dedydrated sludge were collected three times on a sampling day between 9 00 and 11 00 a m and mixed as a composite water sample 2 sludge liquid samples were taken at the outlet of anaerobic anoxic aerobic return and excess sludge units n 30 each sludge liquid sample was obtained by combining four grab samples collected from different times within each sampling day 3 the dehydrated sludge samples were collected at dehydration unit in the stp n 3 each samples was taken by combining five grab samples of which three were collected during the sampling time in november and two were further collected on december 8th and 15th taking 20 25 days of the solid retention time into consideration all the samples were collected in pre cleaned amber glass bottles after sealing without headspace the samples were transported immediately to the laboratory within 2 h for pretreatment sludge liquid samples were separated into the aqueous and solid phase by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 min water samples were filtered through a gf f 0 7 μm glass microfiber filter whatman maidstone uk sludge samples were freeze dried grinded and sifted 100 meshes of sieve the water flow q and several regular water quality parameters e g codcr bod5 nh4 n do tp and tss at each treatment unit were shown in the supplementary material table s2 during the sampling period the average removal efficiencies of codcr bod5 tp and tss were in the range of 92 97 suggesting that the studied stp were under normal operation conditions in addition tss and q were used for the estimations of mass flux and mass balance analysis 2 3 sample pretreatment the water samples were prepared by using our recently published method shen et al 2018 briefly six isotope labelled standards were spiked into the filtered wastewater 0 5 l influent 1 l effluent at concentrations of 100 ng l then the wastewater samples were extracted onto hlb cartridges in a vacuum manifold supelco visiprep 24tmdl madrid spain at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the cartridges were pre activated with 6 ml of etoac 6 ml of acn and 12 ml of purified water after washed and dried the cartridge was eluted with 6 ml of mixture of etoac acn 1 1 v v the eluents were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 200 μl methanol for instrumental analysis for sludge suspended particles 0 5 g freeze dried samples spiked with 20 ng of six isotope labelled standards were ultrasonic extracted with 20 ml mixture of methanol acn 1 1 v v ultrasound procedures at 200 w were performed in an ultrasonic cleaner model kq 500de kunshan china at room temperature for 20 min after centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant of slurry was transferred to a pear shaped flask this process was performed three times and the combined extract was concentrated to about 2 ml using a rotary evaporator the concentrated sample was diluted with 200 ml of ultrapure water and then purified on hlb cartridges with the same procedure as for the water samples described above 2 4 uplc ms ms analysis the pgs were analyzed by a waters acquity uplc system combined with a waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an esi interface in positive ion mode as described previously shen et al 2018 a uplc hss t3 1 7 μm 100 mm 2 1 mm waters was used to separate 62 analytes including 11 groups of isomers the injection volume used were 2 μl the column temperature selected was 40 c the flow rate used was 0 3 ml min the mobile phases consisted of methanol a and 0 1 formic acid in water b gradient conditions were initiated with 60 a followed by a linear increase to 70 in 8 min 85 in 5 min 100 in 1 min and maintained for 3 min the multi selected reaction monitoring mrm mode was used in the quantitation of pgs the protonated molecular ions m h was found to be the precursor ions for all the target pgs and two abundant mrm transitions were selected collision energy and cone voltage were acquired by injecting the standard solution of each pg into the mass spectrometer in order to improve the sensitivity of detection the data acquisition was performed under time segmented conditions based on the chromatographic separation of the target pgs table s3 the optimized parameters selected in the esi source were shown below cone gas flow 150 l h capillary voltage 3 00 kv desolvation gas flow 900 l h desolvation gas temperature 450 c and source temperature 150 c 2 5 quality assurance and quality control identification of the pgs in the samples was performed by comparing the retention time 2 and the ratio 20 of the two selected mrm ion transitions in comparison with the corresponding standards a recovery experiment was conducted to evaluate the method accuracy by spiking at least three times the original concentration of standard pgs into water samples and solid samples for the various matrices considered the recoveries of the present method were in the range of 68 112 with a relative standard deviation of 16 all equipment before use was rinsed with methanol to minimize the risk of contamination six procedural blanks three for water sample and three for solid sample were carried out with each set of samples to check the interfering peaks and potential background values for accurately quantifying the target compounds in various environmental matrices it would be ideal to have isotope labelled standards for each corresponding pg to compensate for losses and matrix effects unfortunately this equates to the added cost of obtaining labelled reference materials and more importantly it is not commercially available for each of isotope labelled pg in this study mga d3 ng d6 mfp d3 cpa d3 eth 13c2 and p d9 were used as surrogate standards and the isotope labelled standards corresponding to the quantification of each progestin were listed in table s3 as shown the isotope labelled standards are eluted at similar retention times to the corresponding pgs in the lc conditions and their application as surrogate standard has been used and assessed for quantifications of these pgs in river and effluent samples in our previous study shen et al 2018 in this study the recoveries of the six isotope labelled standards were in the range of 60 106 in the analyzed influent and sludge samples which was comparable to those 64 99 of pgs indicating their efficiency as surrogate standards to correct the losses of target pgs during extraction or sample preparation the method detection and quantification limit mdl and mql for each target compound in the field samples were calculated based on the signal to noise s n ratio near the target peak the mdls s n 3 of the target pgs were 0 02 0 67 ng l in the influent and 0 03 1 1 ng g dry weight dw in the sludge respectively concerning the mql s n 10 they ranged from 0 07 to 2 3 ng l for influent and from 0 11 to 3 7 ng g dw for sludge respectively table s3 no target pgs were found in the blank analysis n 18 2 6 mass balance calculations the mass flux of pgs in every processing unit including aerated grit chamber anaerobic tank anoxic tank aerobic tank secondary clarifier internal recirculation return sludge excess sludge and liquid of dehydrated sludge were calculated by multiplying the average daily flow rates by concentrations of pgs equation 1 1 w q c dissolved c adsorbed c tss where w g d means the total mass flow of pgs in each treatment unit c dissolved and c adsorbed represent the concentrations of pgs in the dissolved ng l and adsorbed ng g phase respectively q is daily water flow m3 d and c tss is the concentration of tss mg l in wastewater to evaluate the contribution of adsorption and degradation to the removal of pgs in the stp we regarded the influent as system input 100 then the output included effluent and dehydrated sludge the lost w lost was considered as degradation or transformation during wastewater treatment processes and could be calculated by equation 2 2 w lost w influent w effluent w sludge where w influent and w effluent show the mass loading of pgs in the influent and effluent g d respectively w sludge represent the mass in dehydrated sludge g d the w influent w effluent and w sludge were calculated by the daily water flow q m3 d and detected concentrations of pgs in the dissolved and adsorbed phases through equation 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrences in the stp influent of the 62 pgs analyzed 31 compounds were detected in influent with total dissolved concentrations up to 2000 ng l the median concentrations and standard deviations of four groups of pgs in dissolved and adsorbed phases were shown in table s4 and table s5 among the detected p and its metabolites four p metabolites 17α ohp 5α dhp 5β dhp and 3α 5β thp were the dominant compounds respectively accounting for 59 3 1 8 6 0 96 6 1 1 4 and 5 4 0 64 of the total dissolved pg concentrations the dissolved concentrations of p metabolites were significantly higher than those of the parent p consistent with the fact that p undergoes extensive metabolism and that only traces of the parent compound are excreted in biotas besse and garric 2009 however most previous investigations mainly studied the environmental occurrences of p yost et al 2014 huang et al 2014 pauwels et al 2008 and only four metabolites 17α 20β dohp 17α ohp 21α ohp and 5α dhp have been studied previously in stps liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 in this study fourteen p metabolites were detected in the influent of stp and their concentrations were mostly higher than those of p it should be noted that 17α ohp was detected at the highest concentrations 1180 64 ng l among all of the pgs and levels of the compound are much higher than those reported previously 0 9 14 2 ng l fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 in addition relatively high concentrations of 5β dhp 120 27 ng l and 3α 5β thp 107 12 ng l were first observed in the stp wastewater 5β dhp is an agonist of the pregnane x receptor regulating uterine contractility through activation of the receptor mitchell et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2007 3α 5β thp is a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa receptor and a negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor having anticonvulsant anesthetic anxiolytic and sedative effects reddy 2003 thus we could not exclude the possibility of their potential effects in the aquatic environment especially when they occur at high concentrations in environmental waters as for the other three groups of 42 pgs 8 p derivatives 3 nt derivatives and 5 17α ohp derivatives were detected in the influent the highest total dissolved concentrations were observed for p derivatives 70 12 ng l followed by nt derivatives 43 8 2 ng l and 17α ohp derivatives 4 6 1 3 ng l this is consistent with the wide usages of p derivatives in medical services schindler et al 2003 besse and garric 2009 in this study eight p derivatives were detected in the influent with 1 dhp dgt and 11 kp being the dominant compounds followed by 16 dhp 5β dh 11 kp 6β oh 11 kp deltap and 1 6 ddhp surprisingly p derivatives have been generally neglected in previous studies šauer et al 2018 fan et al 2011 chang et al 2011 little data is available about their occurrences in environmental waters liu et al 2014 shen et al 2018 the predominance of p derivatives in synthetic pgs was also found in the river samples in our recent investigation shen et al 2018 concentrations of dgt were up to 9330 ng l in the waste lagoon from one swine farm in china liu et al 2015 p derivatives are progestin medications which are used for a variety of indications e g threatened or recurrent miscarriage and components of hormone therapy e g menopausal schindler et al 2003 kuhl 2005 as shown in fig s1 and s2 many p derivatives are structurally introduced π bonds e g dgt at c 6 1 6 ddhp at c 1 and c 6 or various groups at c 6 e g keto in 11 kp which are different from the general hydroxylation and hydrogenation in the natural metabolism of p the high levels of p derivatives might be additionally due to the microbial transformation from other steroids since the hydroxy keto interconversions and dehydrogenation have been reported for estrogens and androgens in natural and engineered systems khanal et al 2006 yang et al 2011 khan et al 2008 the wide applications and abundant occurrences of p derivatives suggested that more attentions should be paid on these compounds in the future among the analyzed nt derivatives three compounds were detected in this study with nvt being dominant followed by eth and mfp similar concentrations of mfp were also observed in the influent of six czech stps nd 0 65 ng l šauer et al 2018 the generally studied nt derivatives net ng were not detected in this investigation and similar results were also found in other three asian stps chang et al 2008 fan et al 2011 of the detected 17α ohp derivatives mpa and 15β ohcpa were the predominant compounds followed by cpa mga and 16 17 ep 15β ohcpa is the metabolite of cpa and it exhibits similar or even greater antiandrogen activity compared with the parent compound thus as highlighted in previous studies on pharmaceuticals and other chemicals huschek et al 2004 ashrap et al 2017 metabolism is one of the most important processes and special attention should be paid to the active metabolites of pgs 3 2 removal efficiencies in the dissolved phases after the secondary treatment the 31 pg compounds detected in the influent were found in the effluent with the total dissolved pg concentrations up to 18 2 0 ng l only limit pgs 17α ohp 17α 20β dohp 5α dhp mpa mga and cpa have been previously reported in the stp effluent chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2014 fan et al 2011 šauer et al 2018 in this study the predominant compounds were found to be 5α dhp 17α ohp and 5β dhp which respectively accounted for 24 15 and 7 2 of the total effluent concentrations by comparing the dissolved concentrations in influents and secondary effluents the removal efficiencies for the 31 detected pgs were in the range of 68 99 as shown in fig 5 p and its metabolites were removed by 95 99 which was slightly higher than those reported in several chinese stps and two japanese stps p 85 98 17α ohp 89 94 and 17α 20β dohp 18 100 chang et al 2008 2011 fan et al 2011 huang et al 2014 similar high removal efficiencies were also found for p derivatives 91 99 suggesting that these two pg groups were easily removed by the stp treatment processes relatively low removal efficiencies were found for nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives for example mfp 68 6 2 eth 79 2 9 16 17 ep 79 17 and cpa 80 2 9 these compounds exhibited relatively high recalcitrance under the current treatment processing conditions probably because of the persistent structures of these compounds for example cpa has a chlorine substitution at the c6 position and 16 17 ep has a cyclic configuration at the adjacent carbon atoms c16 and c17 miyamoto et al 2014 3 3 concentration variations within treatment units as shown in fig 1 the total dissolved pg concentrations significantly decreased along the treatment processes in the stp especially in the biological treatment processes the total pg concentrations were reduced by 80 in the anaerobic tank 80 in the anoxic tank and 48 in the aerobic tank suggesting that biodegradation is a very important process for removing pgs in the stp the concentration change percentages of abundant pgs in the three biological treatment units were shown in fig s6 anaerobic and anoxic treatments greatly reduced the concentrations of most pgs and similar high removal percentages were previously observed for 3 p metabolites and 2 17α ohp derivatives in the anaerobic and anoxic treatment units fan et al 2011 in contrast estrogens were mainly removed under the aerobic conditions joss et al 2004 it is interesting to note that the concentrations of 1 6 ddhp in the aerobic tank and 20β ohp and 16 dhp in the anoxic tank were increased with negative change percentages up to 91 it has been reported that microbial transformation of p could form dehydrogenation and hydroxylation products donova and egorova 2012 liu et al 2013 ojoghoro et al 2017 al awadi et al 2002 therefore 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp could be the microbial transformation products of p during the biological treatment processes further suggesting the importance of biodegradation for these pgs in the physicochemical treatment units the pg concentrations showed no obvious changes in the aerated grit chamber and secondary clarifiers fig 1 this phenomenon can be expected since the medium or low adsorption potentials of most pgs estimated log k ow 4 acd chemsketch 10 0 limit the capabilities of sedimentation for removing pgs in addition the specific size of sludge particles capable of adsorbing compounds is extremely restricted by the grit chamber or secondary clarifier nie et al 2012 luo et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the k d values of all detected pgs in each process of the stp were estimated most of the k d values are in the range of 0 01 35 l g except for 3β 5β thp 1 8 66 l g 3β 5α thp 1 5 81 l g 1 dhp 2 2 188 l g deltap 14 177 l g and 16 17 ep 14 70 l g these k d values are much lower than those of chemicals having strong adsorption affinities to sludge for example siloxanes with k d up to 1230 l g bletsou et al 2013 and chlorinated paraffins with k d up to 2030 l g zeng et al 2013 the low k d values were consistent with the fact that pg concentrations were relative constant in the physicochemical treatment units suggesting that sorption is of minor importance in removing of pgs in the stp esperanza et al 2007 in the suspended particles and dehydrated sludge twenty nine pgs were detected as shown in fig 1 the total adsorbed concentration was the highest in the suspended particles of influent 822 21 ng g dry weight dw and there was a decreasing trend along the treatment units different from wastewater the sludge concentrations of pgs in each biological treatment unit were very similar possibly because of the large amount of activated sludge recycled continuously as internal recirculation and the return sludge in the stp in the dehydrated sludge the total concentration of p and its metabolites 154 ng g dw was much higher than those of p derivatives 35 ng g dw nt derivatives 3 5 ng g dw and 17α ohp derivatives 4 3 ng g dw the large amount of sewage sludge is an important source of contamination in china and the accumulation of pgs in dehydrated sludge deserves more attention 3 4 profiles along the treatment processes proportions of target pgs in the wastewater and suspended particles sludge of each treatment unit are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 and the profiles of each group of the detected pgs are also shown in fig s7 s10 the detected p and its metabolites were divided into three groups i the parent p ii p metabolites reported in the previous studies 17α ohp 17α 20β dohp and 5α dhp and iii p metabolites first detected in this study including the other 11 compounds as shown in fig 2 the profiles of detected compounds in the wastewater and sludge were markedly different in the dissolved phases of wastewater proportions of the reported p metabolites 40 74 were found to be comparable to those of the first detected p metabolites 25 55 while p was detected at very low percentages 1 0 6 0 proportions of the reported p metabolites decreased to 5 8 18 in the solid samples and those of the first detected p metabolites increased to 75 91 these results indicate that the p metabolites first detected in this study account for a high proportion either in the dissolved or in the solid phases it is worth mentioning that the proportion of p increased slightly along the treatment process in wastewater and exhibited a decreasing trend in the sludge suggesting its relatively low affinity to sludge compared with its metabolites the proportions of three groups of other pgs were similar in the wastewater and sludge with p derivatives being the predominant group 59 85 followed by nt derivatives 8 2 37 and 17α ohp derivatives 3 3 14 fig 3 pgs were mainly removed through biodegradation in the stp as discussed above thus the profiles of the individual pgs along the treatment processes would help clarify the biodegradation of the compounds in each treatment unit among the detected pgs 17α ohp has been reported to be the microbial biotransformation product of p kolar et al 2007 manosroi et al 2008 donova and egorova 2012 furthermore 3 pgs 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp with negative concentration change percentages might also be the microbial transformation products of p as shown in fig s7 s8 the proportions of the four compounds exhibited significant variations along the treatment units thus the profile variations of the four pgs were analyzed the proportion of 17α ohp in dissolved phase showed a significant decrease in anoxic tank 63 35 while those in adsorbed phase showed a slight increase 6 3 12 this is possible due to that 17α ohp was vulnerable to microbial transformation in the anoxic tank which is supported by the previous studies that 17α ohp is transformed into a variety of hydroxylated products by microorganisms bhatti and khera 2012 the proportions of 20β ohp and 16 dhp in dissolved phase both showed an obvious increasing tendency in anoxic tank 0 5 4 1 5 3 22 while those in adsorbed phase were constant 1 7 1 3 3 3 2 7 fig s7 s8 hydroxylation and dehydrogenation of p have been reported by b sphaericus and b stearothermophilus donova and egorova 2012 al awadi et al 2002 respectively possibly contributing to the increased proportions of the two compounds in anoxic tank as for 1 6 ddhp the proportions in dissolved phase showed an increase in the aerobic tank 1 7 5 2 but those in the adsorbed phase was constant 0 35 0 49 fig s8 suggesting that p could be transformed to 1 6 ddhp via dehydrogenation by aerobic microorganisms similarly testosterone can be dehydrogenated to 1 dehydeotestosterone by aerobic bacterial cwiertny et al 2014 these results revealed that the biological treatment processes play an important role influencing the profiles of pgs along the treatment processes 3 5 mass flow and mass balance analysis to explore the removal mechanisms such as biodegradation adsorption and transformation of pgs in the stp the mass flux of individual pgs in dissolved and adsorbed phases in the treatment processes were calculated tables s6 and s7 and the mass flows of total pgs throughout the treatment processes are illustrated in fig 4 the individual mass flows of p and its metabolites p derivatives nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives are also displayed in figs s11 s14 in the influent the mass flows of total pgs entering the stp were 366 8 9 g d and they consisted of 317 g d in the dissolved phase and 49 g d in the adsorbed phase after passage through the aerated grit chamber the mass flows of pgs showed a slightly decrease 15 28 and the total pgs mass flows entering the activated sludge system were 293 11 g d of which 266 g d were found in the dissolved phase and 27 g d in the adsorbed phase the mass flows in the adsorbed phase showed a significant increase through the anaerobic and anoxic units this was mainly caused by the large amount of circulating sludge from the return sludge and internal recirculation in contrast the mass flows in the dissolved phase showed a significant decline across the activated sludge system with the mass change percentages being 60 in the anaerobic unit 57 in the anoxic unit and 51 in the aerobic unit the significant mass decrease of total pgs in the activated sludge system further illustrates that biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism of pgs in the stp it should be noted that the mass reductions of the four pg groups in the dissolved phase exhibited compound specific variations in the three biological treatment units the reduced mass percentages were very similar 53 60 for p and its metabolites in the three units the anaerobic process contributed to most of the mass reduction of p derivatives and nt derivatives 60 80 and the aerobic treatment contributed mostly to the mass reduction of 17α ohp derivatives in the secondary effluent the mass flows of total pgs in the dissolved phase were 2 9 0 31 g d the highest discharge loading was found in p and its metabolites 2 4 0 29 g d followed by 0 33 0 02 g d for p derivatives 0 11 0 01 g d for nt derivatives and 0 05 0 02 g d for 17α ohp derivatives in contrast the mass flows 0 35 0 09 g d were much lower for the total pgs in suspended solid besides the secondary effluent discharge dehydrated sludge was another pathway for pgs entering the environment and the mass flows were 11 1 0 g d 2 6 0 16 g d 0 26 0 01 g d and 0 31 0 13 g d for p and its metabolites p derivatives nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives respectively to evaluate the contributions of biodegradation and adsorption to the removal of the four groups of pgs in the current treatment processes of the investigated stp mass balance calculations were conducted fig 6 we considered the mass flows in the influent containing dissolved and adsorbed phases as the import 100 and the export comprised the i effluent w effluent ii dehydrated sludge w sludge with iii the mass loss during the process w lost as shown in fig 6 low proportions of pgs 0 24 6 5 were discharged through effluent except for nt derivatives 0 65 25 about 0 22 of the initial loading was discharged through dehydrated sludge except for the 17α ohp derivatives of which mass proportion of adsorption by sludge was found to be 1 4 55 especially for 16 17 ep this is possibly due to the relatively high log k ow and subsequent k d values of the group of compounds in contrast the proportions of mass losses due to biodegradation were as high as 88 99 for p and its metabolites except for 3β 5β thp and 3β 5α thp 63 64 78 94 for p derivatives 68 96 for nt derivatives and 41 96 for 17α ohp derivatives the mass balances were further calculated for p and its four potential microbial transformation products 17α ohp 20β ohp 1 6 ddhp and 16 dhp since these compounds were degraded mainly through microbial pathways in the biological treatment units based on the above analysis and references donova and egorova 2012 bhatti and khera 2012 cwiertny et al 2014 the proportions of mass losses due to microbial degradation were 85 99 for the five compounds it has been reported that mineralization of steroids cholesterol testosterone and 17β estradiol was observed when these compounds were incubated with some microorganisms chiang et al 2007 fahrbach et al 2006 2010 about 6 of 17β estradiol and 63 of testosterone could be mineralized under aerobic conditions and only 0 2 of the compounds were anaerobically mineralized fan et al 2007 so the potential degradation mechanisms in the stp might include mineralization of pgs as carbon sources as well as microbial transformations exemplified by the conversion of p into 17α ohp kolar et al 2007 manosroi et al 2008 donova and egorova 2012 these results further demonstrated that biodegradation in terms of microbial pathways was the main removal mechanism of most pgs in the stp 4 conclusions the occurrence fate and mass balance of 62 pgs in a typical municipal stp were simultaneously studied p metabolites were the predominant compounds followed by p derivatives which were first found with high abundances compared to the widely concerned nt derivatives and 17α ohp derivatives 68 99 of the detected pgs in the dissolved phases were removed in the stp and biodegradation via microbial transformation was the major removal mechanism recycled activated sludge
