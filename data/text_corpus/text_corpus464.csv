2320,understanding the interaction of terrestrial freshwater and seawater in the subterranean estuary ste is an important factor when considering nutrient fluxes from land to sea state of the art research describes the ste by a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell a freshwater discharge tube and a deep saltwater wedge however recent numerical modelling and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations for high energy beaches indicate that multiple saline recirculation cells may exist and affect the land sea interaction electrical resistivity tomography ert and direct push dp technologies are common tools to explore the subsurface due to their sensitivity to the electrical conductivity of pore water they permit investigating the ste this study combines ert and dp to image the salinity distribution within the ste of a meso tidal high energy beach we actively incorporate the dp data into the ert inversion and use geostatistical regularization for closing the resolution gap for the first time our experimental results confirm the existence of several 10 20 m deep reaching upper saline recirculation cells and corresponding brackish discharge locations generated by a pronounced runnel ridge beach system in 2019 whereas in 2021 only a single cell was displayed for a flat topography at the time keywords subterranean estuary high energy beach mesotidal electrical resistivity tomography direct push data availability data associated with this research are available and can be accessed via https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7531155 1 introduction as sea level rises the transition zone between terrestrial aquifer and the sea becomes increasingly important in the view of a sustainable water management robinson et al 2018 as terrestrial groundwater can significantly influence the local ecosystems burnett et al 2003 cho et al 2018 moore 1999 by providing carbon nutrients and or trace elements to coastal waters anschutz et al 2009 heiss et al 2014 santos et al 2009 thereby the so called subterranean estuaries stes moore 1999 below beaches are considered powerful biogeochemical reactors that modify and control the water composition prior to the discharge to the sea anschutz et al 2009 anwar et al 2014 santos et al 2008 in a tidal regime the fresh saltwater mixing zone in the ste has been described to consist of a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell or so called upper saline plume usp a freshwater discharge tube fdt and a density induced saltwater wedge robinson et al 2006 illustrated in fig 1 a during high tide seawater infiltrates around the high water line hwl and circulates through the usp before exfiltrating as saline submarine groundwater discharge near the low water line lwl additionally groundwater discharges from the fdt fresh or brackish and the wedge saline most studies predominantly suggested that the general compartments usp fdt saltwater wedge in the ste are rather stable features although their shape and extension is influenced by hydrogeological parameters e g beach slope hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude terrestrial recharge or aquifer depth abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2016 heiss and michael 2014 lebbe 1981 robinson et al 2007 röper et al 2015 nevertheless more significant changes of the size of the usp as response of spring neap tide events high wave activity changes in beach topography or seasonal changes in terrestrial water table oscillations were occasionally observed abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2007 moreover instabilities in form of fingering flow under certain conditions i e mainly as a result of very small beach slopes were also reported within experimental studies or numerical modelling greskowiak 2014 röper et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 local morphological features within the intertidal zone such as slope breaks tidal channels and sandbars have been found to affect the pore water flow patterns in the ste zhang et al 2017 sometimes leading to multiple local recirculation cells with clock and anti clockwise circulation and several groundwater discharge locations so far this was demonstrated mostly indirectly with the help of numerical modeling beck et al 2017 greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 nakada et al 2011 robinson et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 while to the author s knowledge evidence from field data alone is scarce such groundwater flow patterns are more likely to exist where the morphological highs and lows in the intertidal zone are very pronounced for instance chemical composition waska et al 2019 and apparent 3h he ages grünenbaum et al 2020 of pore waters in a so called runnel ridge system king and williams 1949 at a high energy beach on spiekeroog exhibiting strong morphological undulations suggested the existence of two separate usps and two main groundwater discharge locations runnel and lwl see fig 1b in these studies the data was acquired from shallow pore waters 1m depths and therefore the existence of multiple usps which may reach down to a minimum of 20 m e g beck et al 2017 grünenbaum et al 2020 was only deduced indirectly by modelling electrical resistivity tomography ert is a promising method to delineate these salinity patterns in the ste based on the relation between pore fluid salinity and measured resistivity schön 2015 günther and müller petke 2012 the method can display salinity variations and thus provide a continuous picture of the subsurface salinity distribution even for greater depth e g hermans et al 2012 thereby ert can be deployed for both single snapshot of a freshwater saltwater zone and repeated measurements at the same location in a so called timelapse ert experiment e g palacios et al 2020 the latter can be automated by installing monitoring systems directly at the surface huizer et al 2017 ogilvy et al 2009 or in the subsurface grinat et al 2018 ronczka et al 2020 the resulting resistivity distribution can be transformed to 2 dimensional salinity profiles which help to improve the conception of hydrogeological models in coastal aquifers these are increasingly needed to e g evaluate saltwater intrusion processes or the relevance of sgd for coastal ecosystems in the view of a rising sea level beaujean et al 2014 de franco et al 2009 morrow et al 2010 existing studies using ert to display the subsurface salinity distribution often do not cover the whole intertidal zone as it is difficult to access buquet et al 2016 morrow et al 2010 sutter and ingham 2017 depending on the site a complete view of the ste might even require extending surveys on the sea side using submerged cables or marine ert e g paepen et al 2020 further in order to obtain a more realistic image of a coastal aquifer hermans et al 2012 studied the salinity distribution with an induction log and derived correlation lengths being used for regularizing the ert inversion generally ert is intrinsically non unique and other for instance direct measurements of the subsurface properties are needed to obtain a more realistic resistivity model a simultaneous application of vertical direct push dp probing is suitable in order to verify ert results and or serve as constrains to support the inversion process dp refers to a family of tools used for performing subsurface investigations by driving pushing and or vibrating small diameter hollow steel rods into the ground epa 1997 hence dp technology can be used efficiently for the retrieval of soil groundwater or soil gas samples dietrich and leven 2006 in addition dp facilitates the rapid collection of continuous or discontinuous in situ information about the vertical distribution of soil specific properties by attaching sensor probes to the end of the dp rod string butler 2005 dietrich and leven 2006 liu et al 2012 mccall et al 2006 wunderlich et al 2018 included dp data actively in ert inversion using fixed resistivity regions obtained from blocking the dp soundings in the present study we aim to determine the salinity distribution in the subsurface of a meso tidal high energy beach based on ert and dp investigations to test the previously developed concept of multiple recirculation cells as a function of beach topography so far only suggested by numerical simulations and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations in the pore water ert together with dp was jointly carried out in 2019 to elaborate the effect of data processing on the subsurface salinity distribution with and without dp constrained inversion ert measurements were repeated in 2021 to delineate changes in the horizontal and vertical extent of recirculation cells the existence of multiple recirculation cells would have important implications on the fresh saline transition zone subsurface residence times and dispersive mixing processes which in turn effect the reactive transport of solutes and ultimately their mass fluxes into the sea anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2017 heiss et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and previous work ert and dp were carried out between the dunes and the lwl at the northern beach of spiekeroog a barrier island in front of the north german coastline with a total surface area of approximately 21 km2 streif 1990 fig 2 a the island s dunes consist of fine to medium grained holocene sands above pleistocene deposits streif 1990 and enable the almost immediate and complete infiltration of the precipitation surplus precipitation average 808 mm year 1 oowv 2012 groundwater recharge was estimated to be 350 mm a 1 röper et al 2012 and lead to the formation of a permanent freshwater lens which is used for islands drinking water supply the aquifer basis is confined by a clay layer at a depth of 40 m below sea level restricting the maximum freshwater lens thickness to just over 40 m röper et al 2012 extensive biogeochemical investigations in combination with numerical modeling observed freshwater exfiltration in the intertidal zone of the respective northern beach of spiekeroog ahrens et al 2020 beck et al 2017 grünenbaum et al 2020 reckhardt et al 2017 waska et al 2019 due to its position towards the open north sea the sediment relocation is assumed to be especially intense at the northern beach site the strong interplay between wind waves and tides tidal range is 2 7 m tidal regime is meso tidal results in a highly variable beach morphology which is dominated by sand banks and troughs aligned parallel to the shoreline flemming and davis 1994 in the following referred to as runnel and ridge although these characteristic beach structures seemingly relocate within the intertidal zone they were observed during all seasons beck et al 2017 reckhardt et al 2017 waska et al 2019 in previous studies the ridge was generally inundated during high tide and uncovered during low tide e g waska et al 2019 beck et al 2017 were the first to suspect the compartments of a classical hydrological zonation in a tidal ste with an usp a fdt and a saltwater wedge for the northern beach based on shallow salinity measurements in pore water and a 2 dimension model along a cross shore transect they suggested that all freshwater from the island s lens discharges into the runnel they further concluded that the ridge functions as a groundwater divide during low tide impeding the terrestrial fresh groundwater to flow further seawards however both extended hydrogeochemical sampling of waska et al 2019 and numerical modelling from grünenbaum et al 2020 indicated that the groundwater divide is not always equally strong occasionally leading to a splitting of the fdt compare fig 1b once the ridge is less pronounced some of the fresh groundwater flows underneath the groundwater divide and discharges nearby at the lwl while some freshwater also directly exfiltrates into the runnel however as the numerical models were limited to 2 dimensions and the salinity patterns from shallow pore water sampling lances across the intertidal zone were often patchy the groundwater flow patterns for the study site were assumed to be even more complex than previously thought mainly evoked by the strong morphodynamics density differences and the heterogeneity of the aquifer itself grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2019 2 2 sampling two field campaigns took place in 2019 30th august to 4th september and 2021 july 20 to 22 at the northern beach of spiekeroog topographical information of the sampling points was determined with a stonex s9 iii plusgnss differential gps the topography of the two campaigns was quite different while in 2019 a predominant runnel and ridge topography was present two years later the beach exhibited only a uniform slope in order to display the subsurface salinity distribution measured bulk electrical conductivity ec was transformed into pore water ec over a derived formation factor see section 2 3 and further converted into salinity g l according to stuyfzand 1993 salinity f ec 25 1 with measured ec of the water sample at 25 c ec 25 ms cm 1 and a conversion factor f for spiekeroog island of 0 6768 holt et al 2017 note that measured ec values are referenced to a temperature of 25 c by default as the ec is dependent on temperature however as we gained depth dependent temperature information from dp probing point 6 we consider the effect of a dropping temperature in the aquifer for both ert and dp ec which is assumed to cause a decrease in ec of 2 per degree celsius 2 2 1 shallow pore water sampling shallow pore water samples were collected close to electrodes positions of the ert profiles intertidal 5 5 m and upper beach in 2019 by driving stainless steel push point sampling lancets into the sediment up to the respective groundwater level water was extracted with polyethylene syringes pore water ec was measured directly with a handheld device wtw cond 340 after lancets and syringes were flushed with sampling water 3 4 syringe volumes the data are shown in fig a1 and compared to ert for validation purpose 2 2 2 dp probing in 2019 the geoprobe sp 16 groundwater sampling system was used to obtain groundwater samples directly through a protected filter at the end of the rod string for more information on the sp16 system see geoprobe 2006 at dp probing point 6 fig 2b the depth resolution varied between one and three meter as the probing was temporally limited due to the rising water level due to high tide ec measurements were performed on these groundwater samples to determine water salinity at selected depths tab a 1 in addition to dp sampling dp profiling was used to obtain vertical high resolution profiles of bulk ecs using a geoprobe sc 500 probe operated in wenner configuration a 1 5 cm while the ec probe is pushed or hammered into the subsurface an electrical current is applied to the ground and the applied current as well as the resulting voltage is measured see christy et al 1994 mccall et al 2006 and sellwood et al 2005 an increase in subsurface ec can be related to an increase of clay mineral content or as in this study to dissolved ions in the water vienken et al 2017 successfully demonstrated the use of dp ec profiling to distinguish between pore waters of different salinities successive transformation of measured bulk ec values from dp profiling to ground water salinity values is further explained in section 2 3 bulk ec measured by dp is shown for six locations in fig 3 it is directly used in conjunction with the ert data in section 2 4 1 low ec values directly below the surface are attributed to unsaturated conditions in the upper part of the beach where the connection of electrodes is insufficient depending on the respective sediment s compaction probing depths between 23 and 24 5 m below surface could be reached by the dp device in the upper meters of the beach aquifer measured bulk ec increases from dune base towards the sea at all stations there is a drop in bulk ec between 15 and 20 m below surface which is especially pronounced at stations 4 to 6 below respective bulk ec slightly increases again before dropping to lower bulk ec down to below 100 ms m 1 at stations 5 and 6 2 3 ec and salinity relationship the four point electrode array mounted at the dp device measures the bulk ec distribution quasi continuously in 1 5 cm vertical resolution steps whereas the pore water samples provide fluid conductivity at specific locations for reconstructing the subsurface salinity distribution a formation factor between measured bulk and pore water ec is needed eq 2 the ratio between the two is referred to as formation factor f eq 3 and depends on the porosity the grain size distribution and compaction günther and müller petke 2012 2 ec fluid f ec bulk 3 f α ϕ m c b c pw with the tortuosity factor α the porosity ϕ the cementation exponent of the rock m measured electric conductivity in bulk c b and electrical conductivity in porewater c pw we tested different f values to convert the fluid conductivity to bulk conductivity fig 4 based on the relation between shallow pore water sampling and single ert inversion in 2019 fig a1 we derived a value of f 4 5 yellow x points in fig 4 corresponding to 34 porosity for an assumed cementation exponent in archie s equation of 1 3 after wyllie and gregory 1953 this value is similar to the study of huizer et al 2017 who determined an averaged formation factor of 4 2 in a sandy coastal aquifer system at the dutch coast and the value of 3 83 determined by günther and müller petke 2012 for borkum island it also matches literature values for coarse sand friedman 2005 while f 4 5 shows a good match for the uppermost meters at our site it overestimates the ec values at greater depth in order to fit the values at the maximum depth values of f 7 pink x points in fig 4 corresponding to a porosity of 22 5 are required we propose a linear increase of the formation factor and thus a corresponding porosity decrease with depth from f 4 5 at z 0 m to f 7 at z 20 m red crosses in fig 4 which matches the entire depth distribution of bulk ec very well the depth dependent decrease in porosity might be attributed to the sediment s heterogeneity as such strong compaction within the first 20 m of the aquifer is unlikely however information of the sediment characteristics at greater depth could not be derived in this study and the reason for the apparent linear decrease in porosity remains unclear yet it matches the data in the following the linear function is subsequently used to transfer both ert and dp ec into salinity images shown in section 3 1 2 4 electrical resistivity tomography 2 4 1 ert measurements for the measurements an ares ii device by gf instruments with an electrode spacing of 5 5 m and an abem terrameter ls2 with 2 m electrode spacing were used two profiles were measured in 2019 fig 2b with the large spacing one profile was measured in the intertidal zone and one at the upper beach where the dp soundings were conducted for both profiles the wenner configuration was employed resulting in 247 data points each additionally a 160 m long intertidal profile was measured with 2 m spacing and the multi gradient array yielding 1436 data in 2021 we measured a 160 m long profile with 2 5 m spacing and the multi gradient array along a transect covering the intertidal zone fig 2b this data set comprised 1001 data points note that this campaign did not include any simultaneous sampling of pore water or groundwater 2 4 2 ert inversion methodology the reconstruction of resistivity subsurface images is prone to ambiguity i e different models are able to the fit the data within error bounds this ambiguity depends on the data quality but also on the chosen array type e g the resolution is better for arrays like dipole dipole or multi gradient compared to the commonly used wenner array dahlin zhou 2004 to achieve a unique solution a regularization term is introduced usually a smoothness operator that locally constrains the model cells to each other alternatively geostatistical operators can be used that couple all model cells with each other according to their horizontal and vertical distance using a geostatistical correlation model the approach was first introduced by yeh et al 2002 and applied to surface ert at a coastal aquifer by hermans et al 2012 who already extended the approach originally only developed for regular grids to irregular grids for which is was studied in detail by jordi et al 2018 it has already been used to study seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer by palacios et al 2020 as a result of bad coupling conditions in 2019 the data quality appears to be rather poor particularly for the profile at the upper beach that we focus on first as there are dp validation data we estimated errors of 5 for all data sets fig 5 a shows the standard inversion result in terms of electrical conductivity using smoothness along with the dp data that are plotted onto the tomogram for comparison conductivities are generally low at the dune base and high rather constant ec of up to 1000 ms m 1 in the intertidal zone x 180 m but also on the upper beach where floods do not regularly reach the shore this saltwater zone almost reaches the dunes but there it is restricted to depths of 5 10 m below mean sea level z 0 below the ec is higher pointing to saltwater the interface becomes smoother with increasing depth so that we have no clear indication of freshwater anymore at the base of the profile the direct push data coincides well up to 15 m depth but contradicts below here we clearly see decreasing ec in the dp data particularly at the last two soundings in fig 5b we used geostatistical regularization in a very similar setting hermans et al 2012 obtained 8 4 m vertical range from variogram analysis of the dp data and 70 m horizontal range from the resulting ert images therefore the same values were chosen keeping in mind that the actual values are of less importance once the angle and the rough anisotropy ratio is met jordi et al 2018 optimizing the correlation lengths would require variogram analyses of the dp soundings and is beyond the scope of the paper the resulting tomogram shows a more layer like behavior the conductor at the beginning of the profile is expressed by a thin front at about z 4 m the high ec at the second part of the profile divides into two fronts with a much clearer lower boundary at about z 25 m so that there is clear evidence of the fdt however the contradiction to the dp even increases as the next step we included the dp data into the inversion fig 5c in an earlier study wunderlich et al 2018 binned existing dp data into piece wise constant parts and incorporated regions of known resistivity into the model here we follow a different approach the dp data is used as data with corresponding errors in the minimization of the objective function using a joint inversion scheme in the pygimli rücker et al 2017 framework the data vectors of ert and dp are simply concatenated forming a joint data vector and the forward modelling and jacobian matrices likewise on the project webpage www pygimli org there is an example that illustrates the method in more detail for the dp data we estimated errors of 10 in view of the small scale variations first we used smoothness constraints for the joint inversion the tomogram in fig 5c is in general as expected very similar to the one without dp in fig 5a only at the dp positions the smooth behavior changes locally to match the dp data which makes the tomogram even harder to interpret finally we inverted both ert and dp data with the geostatistical operator yielding fig 5d in contrast to the smoothness operator the joint inversion results in large differences to the single ert inversion the two conductive layers are merged as imaged by dp and the resistive layer below is shifted upwards with lowest values at the two seaward pointing dp soundings below another conductor becomes visible that is probably the seawater wedge or the local aquitard but the length of the profile and the poor data quality forbids any detailed interpretation in contrast to all other tomograms a very thin resistive top layer can be observed that is below the resolution limit of the rather large electrode spacing to summarize the least complicated and valid in terms of dp result was obtained by a joint inversion with geostatistical constraints we therefore used this procedure for interpreting the 2019 data to this end we combined the two overlapping profiles with a 5 5 m spacing to yield a single tomogram additionally we inverted the intertidal profile a 2 m in order to obtain a high resolution image for the 2021 data no dp data is available however for those profiles the multi gradient electrode array with a very good data quality provided an improved resolution by its own the comparison with shallow pore water conductivity measurements was equally good for all inversion results and supported the choice of the formation factor f 4 5 for the near surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 subsurface salinity on spiekeroog beach 3 1 1 summer 2019 fig 6 a shows the salinity distribution from joint ert dp inversion using geostatistical regularization the jointly inverted ert profiles upper beach and intertidal a 5 5 cover a cross shore transect from the dune base towards lwl at spiekeroog island extension 400 m up to 25 m bsl note that the given salinity is always an approximation although ert is used qualitatively to interpret the relative change in salinity e g paepen et al 2022 demonstrated that the quantitative interpretation can be difficult due to the smoothing effect of the inversion process corresponding bulk electrical conductivity distribution of the jointly inverted ert profiles upper beach and intertidal a 5 5 taking the dp data into account can be seen in fig a2 the image indicates the separation of the classical tidal saltwater recirculation cell into two compartments in the intertidal zone which seem to be spatially confined by topographical lows where fresh groundwater discharges to the surface particularly at x 325 m there is a clear discharge zone with salinities of about 16 g l that borders saltwater recirculation below the ridge this recirculation cell reaches down to a depth of 10 m bsl the two discharge zones can be seen more clearly in fig 6b where the ert results for the intertidal zone are shown based on the higher resolution ert profile intertidal a 2 m as the electrodes only covered a cross shore transect of 180 m interpretation in vertical direction is limited to 15 m bsl the occurrence of saltwater in the aquifer far above the mean hwl up to x 70 m is likely attributed to spring tides and storm floods in the months prior to sampling overall the salinity distribution coincides well with shallow salinity measurements of waska et al 2019 who repeatedly detected brackish pore water spots salinities of 15 g l at the lwl and in the runnel across all seasons at this beach reduced salinities 20 g l in the runnel are also displayed by ert x 225 m and limits saltwater recirculation towards the hwl 3 1 2 summer 2021 fig 7 shows the salinity distribution in the intertidal zone at northern beach of spiekeroog for july 2021 based on ert inversion using the same geostatistical regularization in contrast to the runnel and ridge case in 2019 the beach topography was very flat in 2021 ert results suggest that the freshwater tube exfiltrates only around the lwl at more than 300 m distance from the dune base thereby the overall structures are mainly imaging the classical concept of a tidally influence ste with one recirculation cell and one freshwater discharge tube compare fig 1a smaller areas of exfiltrating freshwater in between caused by topographical elevated areas in the intertidal zone as found in 2019 are missing 3 2 salinity distribution of high energy beaches the salinity distribution in 2019 fig 6 shows an enlarged first usp starting above mean hwl up to a depth of 20 m and a smaller usp under the ridge down to 10 m below surface this indicates that several recirculation cells may occur under certain topographical conditions at high energy beaches this is in line with previous studies greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2020 and it is the first study that actually proves it based on field data regarding the size the larger cell is deeper as compared to other studies heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 but coincides well with findings from grünenbaum et al 2020 who simulated even deeper recirculation cells for an averaged beach morphology from the site several studies suspected before that the usp at beaches with a higher tidal amplitude reaches deeper into the subsurface beck et al 2017 seidel et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 compared to lower energy beaches besides numerical studies e g lebbe et al 1981 or paepen et al 2020 2022 proved the existence of 10 to 15 m deep usp for the belgian coast in addition to the general picture with several saltwater recirculation cells and brackish discharge locations in between small patches of reduced salinity were also found in topographically elevated areas e g at x 300 m where the infiltration of seawater is expected as already proposed by waska et al 2019 and grünenbaum et al 2020 we suggest that these may be attributed to the fact that topography changes constantly at high energy beaches turning locations of former topographic lows where a freshwater discharge tube was previously formed into topographic highs former freshwater tubes may then still exist as relicts in the subsurface furthermore salt fingering flow may contribute to this observed pattern squeezing freshwater up while salt fingers sink down as illustrated in field scale numerical simulations greskowiak 2014 zhang et al 2017 at the investigated site the beach morphology considerably changes over time and with that the hydraulic gradients grünenbaum et al 2020 in addition to topographical changes seasonal storm events further affect the hydraulic forcing and deliver salt water into the upper beach thus it is suspected that the here presented pictures pose only a snapshot of a more complex and dynamic subsurface flow field with a continuously changing salinity distribution over time this is supported by ert results from 2021 fig 7 that are completely different to those from 2019 only one big recirculation cell is displayed without interfering brackish discharge locations hence ert results from two campaigns indicate that the salinity distribution in the subsurface is dynamic so far it is unclear to what extent and in which periods these changes take place and how long they last recent generic density dependent groundwater flow modeling of a dynamic ste by greskowiak and massmann 2021 considering the effect of morphodynamics and seasonal storm floods supports the presented findings their 2d vertical cross section model loosely resembles the conditions at the study site a snapshot of the simulated salinity distribution is presented in fig 8 the simulation results show multiple ups including several brackish discharge locations the full extent of subsurface flow and transport dynamics and how the usps and discharge locations migrate back and forth depending on morphodynamics and storm floods are best visible in an accompanying video provided in the supporting information of greskowiak and massmann 2021 note that the model is not a calibrated site specific model but a generic model illustrating effects of topography changes on subsurface flow thus observed and simulated salinity distributions cannot be expected to match however the model can explain the principal patterns that we have observed at the investigated field site in 2019 the complexity of groundwater flow and transport found at the investigated site is likely present at other high energy beaches as well however so far field investigations in such dynamic environments confirmed the occurrence of only one saline recirculation cell for instance morrow et al 2010 were able to display a single saltwater recirculation cell at a highly dynamic beach in new zealand using ert whose generally occurrence could be confirmed by subsequent ert measurements across the seasons conducted by sutter and ingham 2017 similarly at a macro tidal beach de westhoek belgium france ert imaging across the entire intertidal zone revealed a single more than 400 m wide and 10 m deep continuous usp i e lacking distinct multiple freshwater discharge locations paepen et al 2020 paepen et al 2022 this is in clear contrast to our findings although the belgian coast also consists of tidal dominated sandy runnel ridge beaches vandenbohede 2003 the reason for this contrasting observation is not clear but it could be attributed to less pronounced morphological structures at this particular site latest ert investigations at de westhoek showed some lateral changes in resistivity that occurred close to topographical variations paepen et al 2022 as the study focused on the total extension of the usp they were not further interpreted however in combination with our findings some of these lateral variations could be indeed explained by the occurrence of multiple recirculation cells further in the upper part of a high energy macro tidal beach in france buquet et al 2016 delineated one shallow brackish saline recirculation cell reaching down to 5 m below surface by ert even though a runnel ridge system was described to be present at this site anschutz et al 2009 due to the macrotidal condition at that site a deeper seawater recirculation could be expected note that buquet et al 2016 covered transects from the upper beach down to msl not spanning the entire intertidal zone while our sampling strategy was different we displayed the salinity distribution for the whole area from dune base towards the lwl by combining two ert transects thus we were able to delineate the salinity distribution down to 25 m below sediment surface and capture the expected discharge zone near the lwl however deviations between the field sites could also be attributed to environmental conditions as a varying groundwater recharge rate beach slope fresh terrestrial groundwater flux and or different tidal conditions regarding the data analysis the presented methodology is rather a first step than a ready solution even though the conclusions are robust with respect to the chosen inversion parameters the resulting ert tomograms are affected by the chosen correlation lengths a rigorous variogram analysis of the dp data would be required to assess the validity of the chosen values in the whole modelling domain synthetic experiments in conjunction with extensive tests on the data could help investigating the effects of these parameters 4 conclusion the study provides insight into the groundwater flow and transport within a tidally influenced ste at a high energy beach to the author s knowledge it is the first study that shows directly and indirectly measured deep salinity distributions in such a highly dynamic environment covering the complete intertidal zone the results suggest that the tidally driven saltwater recirculation may under certain topographical conditions break up into several sub cells that are separated from each other by individual freshwater discharge tubes directed towards topographical lows to the author s knowledge it is the first time that such a pattern has been observed in a ste it also confirms the results from shallow previous salinity pore water sampling and numerical modelling from the site greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2019 this suggests that groundwater flow and transport patterns at high energy beaches are complex and dynamic even at greater depths because the morphodynamics are intense dobrynin et al 2010 waska et al 2019 it was previously shown that already a single tide induced usp greatly enhances dispersion controlled biogeochemical transformation rates due to increased residence times in the ste compared to no tide conditions anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2017 heiss et al 2017 therefore we suspect that the highly dynamic and complex groundwater flow in the ste below high energy beaches further enhances the reactive processes having important implications on solute mass fluxes from land to sea and coastal ecosystems as single ert measurements enable imaging the saltwater recirculation compartments at a certain point in time and at reasonable resolution time lapse ert measurements in addition to regular vertical dp probing to support ert data in combination with numerical flow and transport modeling could provide insight into the temporal development of the water compartments furthermore installing an automated monitoring systems in the subsurface grinat et al 2018 ronczka et al 2020 providing high temporal resolution would be beneficial such a framework is urgently needed in order to better understand the complexity of groundwater flow and its implications on reactive transport processes below high energy beaches hermans et al 2022

2320,understanding the interaction of terrestrial freshwater and seawater in the subterranean estuary ste is an important factor when considering nutrient fluxes from land to sea state of the art research describes the ste by a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell a freshwater discharge tube and a deep saltwater wedge however recent numerical modelling and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations for high energy beaches indicate that multiple saline recirculation cells may exist and affect the land sea interaction electrical resistivity tomography ert and direct push dp technologies are common tools to explore the subsurface due to their sensitivity to the electrical conductivity of pore water they permit investigating the ste this study combines ert and dp to image the salinity distribution within the ste of a meso tidal high energy beach we actively incorporate the dp data into the ert inversion and use geostatistical regularization for closing the resolution gap for the first time our experimental results confirm the existence of several 10 20 m deep reaching upper saline recirculation cells and corresponding brackish discharge locations generated by a pronounced runnel ridge beach system in 2019 whereas in 2021 only a single cell was displayed for a flat topography at the time keywords subterranean estuary high energy beach mesotidal electrical

transition zone between terrestrial aquifer and the sea becomes increasingly important in the view of a sustainable water management robinson et al 2018 as terrestrial groundwater can significantly influence the local ecosystems burnett et al 2003 cho et al 2018 moore 1999 by providing carbon nutrients and or trace elements to coastal waters anschutz et al 2009 heiss et al 2014 santos et al 2009 thereby the so called subterranean estuaries stes moore 1999 below beaches are considered powerful biogeochemical reactors that modify and control the water composition prior to the discharge to the sea anschutz et al 2009 anwar et al 2014 santos et al 2008 in a tidal regime the fresh saltwater mixing zone in the ste has been described to consist of a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell or so called upper saline plume usp a freshwater discharge tube fdt and a density induced saltwater wedge robinson et al 2006 illustrated in fig 1 a during high tide seawater infiltrates around the high water line hwl and circulates through the usp before exfiltrating as saline submarine groundwater discharge near the low water line lwl additionally groundwater discharges from the fdt fresh or brackish and the wedge saline most studies predominantly suggested that the general compartments usp fdt saltwater wedge in the ste are rather stable features although their shape and extension is influenced by hydrogeological parameters e g beach slope hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude terrestrial recharge or aquifer depth abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2016 heiss and michael 2014 lebbe 1981 robinson et al 2007 röper et al 2015 nevertheless more significant changes of the size of the usp as response of spring neap tide events high wave activity changes in beach topography or seasonal changes in terrestrial water table oscillations were occasionally observed abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2007 moreover instabilities in form of fingering flow under certain conditions i e mainly as a result of very small beach slopes were also reported within experimental studies or numerical modelling greskowiak 2014 röper et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 local morphological features within the intertidal zone such as slope breaks tidal channels and sandbars have been found to affect the pore water flow patterns in the ste zhang et al 2017 sometimes leading to multiple local recirculation cells with clock and anti clockwise circulation and several groundwater discharge locations so far this was demonstrated mostly indirectly with the help of numerical modeling beck et al 2017 greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 nakada et al 2011 robinson et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 while to the author s knowledge evidence from field data alone is scarce such groundwater flow patterns are more likely to exist where the morphological highs and lows in the intertidal zone are very pronounced for instance chemical composition waska et al 2019 and apparent 3h he ages grünenbaum et al 2020 of pore waters in a so called runnel ridge system king and williams 1949 at a high energy beach on spiekeroog exhibiting strong morphological undulations suggested the existence of two separate usps and two main groundwater discharge locations runnel and lwl see fig 1b in these studies the data was acquired from shallow pore waters 1m depths and therefore the existence of multiple usps which may reach down to a minimum of 20 m e g beck et al 2017 grünenbaum et al 2020 was only deduced indirectly by modelling electrical resistivity tomography ert is a promising method to delineate these salinity patterns in the ste based on the relation between pore fluid salinity and measured resistivity schön 2015 günther and müller petke 2012 the method can display salinity variations and thus provide a continuous picture of the subsurface salinity distribution even for greater depth e g hermans et al 2012 thereby ert can be deployed for both single snapshot of a freshwater saltwater zone and repeated measurements at the same location in a so called timelapse ert experiment e g palacios et al 2020 the latter can be automated by installing monitoring systems directly at the surface huizer et al 2017 ogilvy et al 2009 or in the subsurface grinat et al 2018 ronczka et al 2020 the resulting resistivity distribution can be transformed to 2 dimensional salinity profiles which help to improve the conception of hydrogeological models in coastal aquifers these are increasingly needed to e g evaluate saltwater intrusion processes or the relevance of sgd for coastal ecosystems in the view of a rising sea level beaujean et al 2014 de franco et al 2009 morrow et al 2010 existing studies using ert to display the subsurface salinity distribution often do not cover the whole intertidal zone as it is difficult to access buquet et al 2016 morrow et al 2010 sutter and ingham 2017 depending on the site a complete view of the ste might even require extending surveys on the sea side using submerged cables or marine ert e g paepen et al 2020 further in order to obtain a more realistic image of a coastal aquifer hermans et al 2012 studied the salinity distribution with an induction log and derived correlation lengths being used for regularizing the ert inversion generally ert is intrinsically non unique and other for instance direct measurements of the subsurface properties are needed to obtain a more realistic resistivity model a simultaneous application of vertical direct push dp probing is suitable in order to verify ert results and or serve as constrains to support the inversion process dp refers to a family of tools used for performing subsurface investigations by driving pushing and or vibrating small diameter hollow steel rods into the ground epa 1997 hence dp technology can be used efficiently for the retrieval of soil groundwater or soil gas samples dietrich and leven 2006 in addition dp facilitates the rapid collection of continuous or discontinuous in situ information about the vertical distribution of soil specific properties by attaching sensor probes to the end of the dp rod string butler 2005 dietrich and leven 2006 liu et al 2012 mccall et al 2006 wunderlich et al 2018 included dp data actively in ert inversion using fixed resistivity regions obtained from blocking the dp soundings in the present study we aim to determine the salinity distribution in the subsurface of a meso tidal high energy beach based on ert and dp investigations to test the previously developed concept of multiple recirculation cells as a function of beach topography so far only suggested by numerical simulations and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations in the pore water ert together with dp was jointly carried out in 2019 to elaborate the effect of data processing on the subsurface salinity distribution with and without dp constrained inversion ert measurements were repeated in 2021 to delineate changes in the horizontal and vertical extent of recirculation cells the existence of multiple recirculation cells would have important implications on the fresh saline transition zone subsurface residence times and dispersive mixing processes which in turn effect the reactive transport of solutes and ultimately their mass fluxes into the sea anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2017 heiss et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and previous work ert and dp were carried out between the dunes and the lwl at the northern beach of spiekeroog a barrier island in front of the north german coastline with a total surface area of approximately 21 km2 streif 1990 fig 2 a the island s dunes consist of fine to medium grained holocene sands above pleistocene deposits streif 1990 and enable the almost immediate and complete infiltration of the precipitation surplus precipitation average 808 mm year 1 oowv 2012 groundwater recharge was estimated to be 350 mm a 1 röper et al 2012 and lead to the formation of a permanent freshwater lens which is used for islands drinking water supply the aquifer basis is confined by a clay layer at a depth of 40 m below sea level restricting the maximum freshwater lens thickness to just over 40 m röper et al 2012 extensive biogeochemical investigations in combination with numerical modeling observed freshwater exfiltration in the intertidal zone of the respective northern beach of spiekeroog ahrens et al 2020 beck et al 2017 grünenbaum et al 2020 reckhardt et al 2017 waska et al 2019 due to its position towards the open north sea the sediment relocation is assumed to be especially intense at the northern beach site the strong interplay between wind waves and tides tidal range is 2 7 m tidal regime is meso tidal results in a highly variable beach morphology which is dominated by sand banks and troughs aligned parallel to the shoreline flemming and davis 1994 in the following referred to as runnel and ridge although these characteristic beach structures seemingly relocate within the intertidal zone they were observed during all seasons beck et al 2017 reckhardt et al 2017 waska et al 2019 in previous studies the ridge was generally inundated during high tide and uncovered during low tide e g waska et al 2019 beck et al 2017 were the first to suspect the compartments of a classical hydrological zonation in a tidal ste with an usp a fdt and a saltwater wedge for the northern beach based on shallow salinity measurements in pore water and a 2 dimension model along a cross shore transect they suggested that all freshwater from the island s lens discharges into the runnel they further concluded that the ridge functions as a groundwater divide during low tide impeding the terrestrial fresh groundwater to flow further seawards however both extended hydrogeochemical sampling of waska et al 2019 and numerical modelling from grünenbaum et al 2020 indicated that the groundwater divide is not always equally strong occasionally leading to a splitting of the fdt compare fig 1b once the ridge is less pronounced some of the fresh groundwater flows underneath the groundwater divide and discharges nearby at the lwl while some freshwater also directly exfiltrates into the runnel however as the numerical models were limited to 2 dimensions and the salinity patterns from shallow pore water sampling lances across the intertidal zone were often patchy the groundwater flow patterns for the study site were assumed to be even more complex than previously thought mainly evoked by the strong morphodynamics density differences and the heterogeneity of the aquifer itself grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2019 2 2 sampling two field campaigns took place in 2019 30th august to 4th september and 2021 july 20 to 22 at the northern beach of spiekeroog topographical information of the sampling points was determined with a stonex s9 iii plusgnss differential gps the topography of the two campaigns was quite different while in 2019 a predominant runnel and ridge topography was present two years later the beach exhibited only a uniform slope in order to display the subsurface salinity distribution measured bulk electrical conductivity ec was transformed into pore water ec over a derived formation factor see section 2 3 and further converted into salinity g l according to stuyfzand 1993 salinity f ec 25 1 with measured ec of the water sample at 25 c ec 25 ms cm 1 and a conversion factor f for spiekeroog island of 0 6768 holt et al 2017 note that measured ec values are referenced to a temperature of 25 c by default as the ec is dependent on temperature however as we gained depth dependent temperature information from dp probing point 6 we consider the effect of a dropping temperature in the aquifer for both ert and dp ec which is assumed to cause a decrease in ec of 2 per degree celsius 2 2 1 shallow pore water sampling shallow pore water samples were collected close to electrodes positions of the ert profiles intertidal 5 5 m and upper beach in 2019 by driving stainless steel push point sampling lancets into the sediment up to the respective groundwater level water was extracted with polyethylene syringes pore water ec was measured directly with a handheld device wtw cond 340 after lancets and syringes were flushed with sampling water 3 4 syringe volumes the data are shown in fig a1 and compared to ert for validation purpose 2 2 2 dp probing in 2019 the geoprobe sp 16 groundwater sampling system was used to obtain groundwater samples directly through a protected filter at the end of the rod string for more information on the sp16 system see geoprobe 2006 at dp probing point 6 fig 2b the depth resolution varied between one and three meter as the probing was temporally limited due to the rising water level due to high tide ec measurements were performed on these groundwater samples to determine water salinity at selected depths tab a 1 in addition to dp sampling dp profiling was used to obtain vertical high resolution profiles of bulk ecs using a geoprobe sc 500 probe operated in wenner configuration a 1 5 cm while the ec probe is pushed or hammered into the subsurface an electrical current is applied to the ground and the applied current as well as the resulting voltage is measured see christy et al 1994 mccall et al 2006 and sellwood et al 2005 an increase in subsurface ec can be related to an increase of clay mineral content or as in this study to dissolved ions in the water vienken et al 2017 successfully demonstrated the use of dp ec profiling to distinguish between pore waters of different salinities successive transformation of measured bulk ec values from dp profiling to ground water salinity values is further explained in section 2 3 bulk ec measured by dp is shown for six locations in fig 3 it is directly used in conjunction with the ert data in section 2 4 1 low ec values directly below the surface are attributed to unsaturated conditions in the upper part of the beach where the connection of electrodes is insufficient depending on the respective sediment s compaction probing depths between 23 and 24 5 m below surface could be reached by the dp device in the upper meters of the beach aquifer measured bulk ec increases from dune base towards the sea at all stations there is a drop in bulk ec between 15 and 20 m below surface which is especially pronounced at stations 4 to 6 below respective bulk ec slightly increases again before dropping to lower bulk ec down to below 100 ms m 1 at stations 5 and 6 2 3 ec and salinity relationship the four point electrode array mounted at the dp device measures the bulk ec distribution quasi continuously in 1 5 cm vertical resolution steps whereas the pore water samples provide fluid conductivity at specific locations for reconstructing the subsurface salinity distribution a formation factor between measured bulk and pore water ec is needed eq 2 the ratio between the two is referred to as formation factor f eq 3 and depends on the porosity the grain size distribution and compaction günther and müller petke 2012 2 ec fluid f ec bulk 3 f α ϕ m c b c pw with the tortuosity factor α the porosity ϕ the cementation exponent of the rock m measured electric conductivity in bulk c b and electrical conductivity in porewater c pw we tested different f values to convert the fluid conductivity to bulk conductivity fig 4 based on the relation between shallow pore water sampling and single ert inversion in 2019 fig a1 we derived a value of f 4 5 yellow x points in fig 4 corresponding to 34 porosity for an assumed cementation exponent in archie s equation of 1 3 after wyllie and gregory 1953 this value is similar to the study of huizer et al 2017 who determined an averaged formation factor of 4 2 in a sandy coastal aquifer system at the dutch coast and the value of 3 83 determined by günther and müller petke 2012 for borkum island it also matches literature values for coarse sand friedman 2005 while f 4 5 shows a good match for the uppermost meters at our site it overestimates the ec values at greater depth in order to fit the values at the maximum depth values of f 7 pink x points in fig 4 corresponding to a porosity of 22 5 are required we propose a linear increase of the formation factor and thus a corresponding porosity decrease with depth from f 4 5 at z 0 m to f 7 at z 20 m red crosses in fig 4 which matches the entire depth distribution of bulk ec very well the depth dependent decrease in porosity might be attributed to the sediment s heterogeneity as such strong compaction within the first 20 m of the aquifer is unlikely however information of the sediment characteristics at greater depth could not be derived in this study and the reason for the apparent linear decrease in porosity remains unclear yet it matches the data in the following the linear function is subsequently used to transfer both ert and dp ec into salinity images shown in section 3 1 2 4 electrical resistivity tomography 2 4 1 ert measurements for the measurements an ares ii device by gf instruments with an electrode spacing of 5 5 m and an abem terrameter ls2 with 2 m electrode spacing were used two profiles were measured in 2019 fig 2b with the large spacing one profile was measured in the intertidal zone and one at the upper beach where the dp soundings were conducted for both profiles the wenner configuration was employed resulting in 247 data points each additionally a 160 m long intertidal profile was measured with 2 m spacing and the multi gradient array yielding 1436 data in 2021 we measured a 160 m long profile with 2 5 m spacing and the multi gradient array along a transect covering the intertidal zone fig 2b this data set comprised 1001 data points note that this campaign did not include any simultaneous sampling of pore water or groundwater 2 4 2 ert inversion methodology the reconstruction of resistivity subsurface images is prone to ambiguity i e different models are able to the fit the data within error bounds this ambiguity depends on the data quality but also on the chosen array type e g the resolution is better for arrays like dipole dipole or multi gradient compared to the commonly used wenner array dahlin zhou 2004 to achieve a unique solution a regularization term is introduced usually a smoothness operator that locally constrains the model cells to each other alternatively geostatistical operators can be used that couple all model cells with each other according to their horizontal and vertical distance using a geostatistical correlation model the approach was first introduced by yeh et al 2002 and applied to surface ert at a coastal aquifer by hermans et al 2012 who already extended the approach originally only developed for regular grids to irregular grids for which is was studied in detail by jordi et al 2018 it has already been used to study seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer by palacios et al 2020 as a result of bad coupling conditions in 2019 the data quality appears to be rather poor particularly for the profile at the upper beach that we focus on first as there are dp validation data we estimated errors of 5 for all data sets fig 5 a shows the standard inversion result in terms of electrical conductivity using smoothness along with the dp data that are plotted onto the tomogram for comparison conductivities are generally low at the dune base and high rather constant ec of up to 1000 ms m 1 in the intertidal zone x 180 m but also on the upper beach where floods do not regularly reach the shore this saltwater zone almost reaches the dunes but there it is restricted to depths of 5 10 m below mean sea level z 0 below the ec is higher pointing to saltwater the interface becomes smoother with increasing depth so that we have no clear indication of freshwater anymore at the base of the profile the direct push data coincides well up to 15 m depth but contradicts below here we clearly see decreasing ec in the dp data particularly at the last two soundings in fig 5b we used geostatistical regularization in a very similar setting hermans et al 2012 obtained 8 4 m vertical range from variogram analysis of the dp data and 70 m horizontal range from the resulting ert images therefore the same values were chosen keeping in mind that the actual values are of less importance once the angle and the rough anisotropy ratio is met jordi et al 2018 optimizing the correlation lengths would require variogram analyses of the dp soundings and is beyond the scope of the paper the resulting tomogram shows a more layer like behavior the conductor at the beginning of the profile is expressed by a thin front at about z 4 m the high ec at the second part of the profile divides into two fronts with a much clearer lower boundary at about z 25 m so that there is clear evidence of the fdt however the contradiction to the dp even increases as the next step we included the dp data into the inversion fig 5c in an earlier study wunderlich et al 2018 binned existing dp data into piece wise constant parts and incorporated regions of known resistivity into the model here we follow a different approach the dp data is used as data with corresponding errors in the minimization of the objective function using a joint inversion scheme in the pygimli rücker et al 2017 framework the data vectors of ert and dp are simply concatenated forming a joint data vector and the forward modelling and jacobian matrices likewise on the project webpage www pygimli org there is an example that illustrates the method in more detail for the dp data we estimated errors of 10 in view of the small scale variations first we used smoothness constraints for the joint inversion the tomogram in fig 5c is in general as expected very similar to the one without dp in fig 5a only at the dp positions the smooth behavior changes locally to match the dp data which makes the tomogram even harder to interpret finally we inverted both ert and dp data with the geostatistical operator yielding fig 5d in contrast to the smoothness operator the joint inversion results in large differences to the single ert inversion the two conductive layers are merged as imaged by dp and the resistive layer below is shifted upwards with lowest values at the two seaward pointing dp soundings below another conductor becomes visible that is probably the seawater wedge or the local aquitard but the length of the profile and the poor data quality forbids any detailed interpretation in contrast to all other tomograms a very thin resistive top layer can be observed that is below the resolution limit of the rather large electrode spacing to summarize the least complicated and valid in terms of dp result was obtained by a joint inversion with geostatistical constraints we therefore used this procedure for interpreting the 2019 data to this end we combined the two overlapping profiles with a 5 5 m spacing to yield a single tomogram additionally we inverted the intertidal profile a 2 m in order to obtain a high resolution image for the 2021 data no dp data is available however for those profiles the multi gradient electrode array with a very good data quality provided an improved resolution by its own the comparison with shallow pore water conductivity measurements was equally good for all inversion results and supported the choice of the formation factor f 4 5 for the near surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 subsurface salinity on spiekeroog beach 3 1 1 summer 2019 fig 6 a shows the salinity distribution from joint ert dp inversion using geostatistical regularization the jointly inverted ert profiles upper beach and intertidal a 5 5 cover a cross shore transect from the dune base towards lwl at spiekeroog island extension 400 m up to 25 m bsl note that the given salinity is always an approximation although ert is used qualitatively to interpret the relative change in salinity e g paepen et al 2022 demonstrated that the quantitative interpretation can be difficult due to the smoothing effect of the inversion process corresponding bulk electrical conductivity distribution of the jointly inverted ert profiles upper beach and intertidal a 5 5 taking the dp data into account can be seen in fig a2 the image indicates the separation of the classical tidal saltwater recirculation cell into two compartments in the intertidal zone which seem to be spatially confined by topographical lows where fresh groundwater discharges to the surface particularly at x 325 m there is a clear discharge zone with salinities of about 16 g l that borders saltwater recirculation below the ridge this recirculation cell reaches down to a depth of 10 m bsl the two discharge zones can be seen more clearly in fig 6b where the ert results for the intertidal zone are shown based on the higher resolution ert profile intertidal a 2 m as the electrodes only covered a cross shore transect of 180 m interpretation in vertical direction is limited to 15 m bsl the occurrence of saltwater in the aquifer far above the mean hwl up to x 70 m is likely attributed to spring tides and storm floods in the months prior to sampling overall the salinity distribution coincides well with shallow salinity measurements of waska et al 2019 who repeatedly detected brackish pore water spots salinities of 15 g l at the lwl and in the runnel across all seasons at this beach reduced salinities 20 g l in the runnel are also displayed by ert x 225 m and limits saltwater recirculation towards the hwl 3 1 2 summer 2021 fig 7 shows the salinity distribution in the intertidal zone at northern beach of spiekeroog for july 2021 based on ert inversion using the same geostatistical regularization in contrast to the runnel and ridge case in 2019 the beach topography was very flat in 2021 ert results suggest that the freshwater tube exfiltrates only around the lwl at more than 300 m distance from the dune base thereby the overall structures are mainly imaging the classical concept of a tidally influence ste with one recirculation cell and one freshwater discharge tube compare fig 1a smaller areas of exfiltrating freshwater in between caused by topographical elevated areas in the intertidal zone as found in 2019 are missing 3 2 salinity distribution of high energy beaches the salinity distribution in 2019 fig 6 shows an enlarged first usp starting above mean hwl up to a depth of 20 m and a smaller usp under the ridge down to 10 m below surface this indicates that several recirculation cells may occur under certain topographical conditions at high energy beaches this is in line with previous studies greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2020 and it is the first study that actually proves it based on field data regarding the size the larger cell is deeper as compared to other studies heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 but coincides well with findings from grünenbaum et al 2020 who simulated even deeper recirculation cells for an averaged beach morphology from the site several studies suspected before that the usp at beaches with a higher tidal amplitude reaches deeper into the subsurface beck et al 2017 seidel et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 compared to lower energy beaches besides numerical studies e g lebbe et al 1981 or paepen et al 2020 2022 proved the existence of 10 to 15 m deep usp for the belgian coast in addition to the general picture with several saltwater recirculation cells and brackish discharge locations in between small patches of reduced salinity were also found in topographically elevated areas e g at x 300 m where the infiltration of seawater is expected as already proposed by waska et al 2019 and grünenbaum et al 2020 we suggest that these may be attributed to the fact that topography changes constantly at high energy beaches turning locations of former topographic lows where a freshwater discharge tube was previously formed into topographic highs former freshwater tubes may then still exist as relicts in the subsurface furthermore salt fingering flow may contribute to this observed pattern squeezing freshwater up while salt fingers sink down as illustrated in field scale numerical simulations greskowiak 2014 zhang et al 2017 at the investigated site the beach morphology considerably changes over time and with that the hydraulic gradients grünenbaum et al 2020 in addition to topographical changes seasonal storm events further affect the hydraulic forcing and deliver salt water into the upper beach thus it is suspected that the here presented pictures pose only a snapshot of a more complex and dynamic subsurface flow field with a continuously changing salinity distribution over time this is supported by ert results from 2021 fig 7 that are completely different to those from 2019 only one big recirculation cell is displayed without interfering brackish discharge locations hence ert results from two campaigns indicate that the salinity distribution in the subsurface is dynamic so far it is unclear to what extent and in which periods these changes take place and how long they last recent generic density dependent groundwater flow modeling of a dynamic ste by greskowiak and massmann 2021 considering the effect of morphodynamics and seasonal storm floods supports the presented findings their 2d vertical cross section model loosely resembles the conditions at the study site a snapshot of the simulated salinity distribution is presented in fig 8 the simulation results show multiple ups including several brackish discharge locations the full extent of subsurface flow and transport dynamics and how the usps and discharge locations migrate back and forth depending on morphodynamics and storm floods are best visible in an accompanying video provided in the supporting information of greskowiak and massmann 2021 note that the model is not a calibrated site specific model but a generic model illustrating effects of topography changes on subsurface flow thus observed and simulated salinity distributions cannot be expected to match however the model can explain the principal patterns that we have observed at the investigated field site in 2019 the complexity of groundwater flow and transport found at the investigated site is likely present at other high energy beaches as well however so far field investigations in such dynamic environments confirmed the occurrence of only one saline recirculation cell for instance morrow et al 2010 were able to display a single saltwater recirculation cell at a highly dynamic beach in new zealand using ert whose generally occurrence could be confirmed by subsequent ert measurements across the seasons conducted by sutter and ingham 2017 similarly at a macro tidal beach de westhoek belgium france ert imaging across the entire intertidal zone revealed a single more than 400 m wide and 10 m deep continuous usp i e lacking distinct multiple freshwater discharge locations paepen et al 2020 paepen et al 2022 this is in clear contrast to our findings although the belgian coast also consists of tidal dominated sandy runnel ridge beaches vandenbohede 2003 the reason for this contrasting observation is not clear but it could be attributed to less pronounced morphological structures at this particular site latest ert investigations at de westhoek showed some lateral changes in resistivity that occurred close to topographical variations paepen et al 2022 as the study focused on the total extension of the usp they were not further interpreted however in combination with our findings some of these lateral variations could be indeed explained by the occurrence of multiple recirculation cells further in the upper part of a high energy macro tidal beach in france buquet et al 2016 delineated one shallow brackish saline recirculation cell reaching down to 5 m below surface by ert even though a runnel ridge system was described to be present at this site anschutz et al 2009 due to the macrotidal condition at that site a deeper seawater recirculation could be expected note that buquet et al 2016 covered transects from the upper beach down to msl not spanning the entire intertidal zone while our sampling strategy was different we displayed the salinity distribution for the whole area from dune base towards the lwl by combining two ert transects thus we were able to delineate the salinity distribution down to 25 m below sediment surface and capture the expected discharge zone near the lwl however deviations between the field sites could also be attributed to environmental conditions as a varying groundwater recharge rate beach slope fresh terrestrial groundwater flux and or different tidal conditions regarding the data analysis the presented methodology is rather a first step than a ready solution even though the conclusions are robust with respect to the chosen inversion parameters the resulting ert tomograms are affected by the chosen correlation lengths a rigorous variogram analysis of the dp data would be required to assess the validity of the chosen values in the whole modelling domain synthetic experiments in conjunction with extensive tests on the data could help investigating the effects of these parameters 4 conclusion the study provides insight into the groundwater flow and transport within a tidally influenced ste at a high energy beach to the author s knowledge it is the first study that shows directly and indirectly measured deep salinity distributions in such a highly dynamic environment covering the complete intertidal zone the results suggest that the tidally driven saltwater recirculation may under certain topographical conditions break up into several sub cells that are separated from each other by individual freshwater discharge tubes directed towards topographical lows to the author s knowledge it is the first time that such a pattern has been observed in a ste it also confirms the results from shallow previous salinity pore water sampling and numerical modelling from the site greskowiak and massmann 2021 grünenbaum et al 2020 waska et al 2019 this suggests that groundwater flow and transport patterns at high energy beaches are complex and dynamic even at greater depths because the morphodynamics are intense dobrynin et al 2010 waska et al 2019 it was previously shown that already a single tide induced usp greatly enhances dispersion controlled biogeochemical transformation rates due to increased residence times in the ste compared to no tide conditions anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2017 heiss et al 2017 therefore we suspect that the highly dynamic and complex groundwater flow in the ste below high energy beaches further enhances the reactive processes having important implications on solute mass fluxes from land to sea and coastal ecosystems as single ert measurements enable imaging the saltwater recirculation compartments at a certain point in time and at reasonable resolution time lapse ert measurements in addition to regular vertical dp probing to support ert data in combination with numerical flow and transport modeling could provide insight into the temporal development

2321,meandering rivers have an important role in transporting runoff from rainfall especially during floods with many cities and villages along rivers and the construction of water management structures in floodplains the flow pattern of the meandering rivers changes in time of floods here the flow behaviors in meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and one sided building floodplains are investigated using laboratory experiments the experiments have been performed at three relative depths of 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 and the corresponding discharges the results show that the block density in a floodplain has a significant effect on flow behavior in the main channel so that with the increase of the relative depth the ratios of main channel discharge compared to the total discharge q mc q decreases in the bends with minimal extension of blocks floodplain the crossover areas and the bends with maximal extension of blocks floodplain for a given dr the significant increase in the manning s n values as the density of the blocks increases approximately 30 with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively which shows that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 under one sided blocked floodplain conditions the maximum longitudinal velocity in the main channel in the section with maximal extension of the blocks in the floodplain cs7 is greater than the section with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain cs1 at the relative depth of 0 49 the maximum value of depth averaged velocity in sections cs1 4 decreased by an average of 52 compared to the smooth floodplain the maximum shear stress on the bed at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the bed shear stress at all sections decreases with decreasing relative depth and in the section with minimal extension of blocks floodplain cs1 and cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed decreases with increasing the block density and these changes are more near the convex side than the concave side

introduction over the past 30 years 1985 2014 floods have killed more than 500 000 people worldwide and displaced an estimated 650 million more kocornik mina et al 2020 evidence shows that the 53 large floods that occurred from 2003 to 2008 affected more than 1 800 cities in 40 countries around the world kocornik mina et al 2020 part of the problem is that many cities were originally built near rivers and coastlines areas more than 860 million people live in flood prone urban lands worldwide marx et al 2013 in recent decades many countries have become increasingly developed and urbanized these new developments especially uncontrolled construction have occurred in floodplains that are prone to widespread flooding kocornik mina et al 2020 in urban areas roads and buildings constructed in floodplain areas increase impermeable surfaces and limit the river s capacity to convey floodwater this situation leads to increased flood risks such as inundation and erosion flood damage can be very severe because urban areas have higher populations and economic activities neal 2014 the distribution of flow and velocity in a meandering river are important topics in river hydraulics in relation to the bank protection navigation water intakes and sediment transport and deposition patterns knowledge of velocity distribution in a channel also helps to determine the energy expenditure boundary shear stress distribution and the associated heat and mass transport problems it is important to understand the flow characteristics in a river both in bank and over bank flow conditions when the flow is out of bank i e typically during a flood there is a significant increase in the complexity of flow behavior in a prismatic compound channel the velocity changes between the main channel and floodplain flows may produce strong lateral shear layers as shown by refs sellin 1964 ikeda 1999 ikeda et al 2002 bousmar 2002 li et al 2021 and elsewhere turbulence usually observed in such channels causes an intermittent upward flow motion at the interface between the main channel and floodplains the secondary flows are induced by the imbalance of the normal reynolds shear stress originating from complex nature of channel cross section as shown in refs knight and shiono 1990 knight 1999 anderson et al 1996 dupuis et al 2017 in case of over bank flows the main channel flow is affected by the floodplains and the conveyance capacity of main channel is usually reduced much less information is available for meandering compound channel flows than that of straight compound channel flows velocity measurements for meandering compound channels have been conducted by toebes and sooky 1967 by using a prandtl tube sellin et al 1993 by a laser doppler anemometer lda they observed that the primary velocity within the main channel below the bankfull level tends to follow the meandering channel whereas above the bankfull level intends to follow in the valley direction toebes and sooky 1967 reported that the rotating direction of the dominant secondary flow cells at the apex in the over bank case is opposite to that in a case of in bank flow they suggested that from observations at the crossover section the dominant cell at the bend apex is created by the impinging floodplain flow from the upstream side as it flows over and into the main channel this was also observed by stein and rouve 1988 and shiono and muto 1993 they suggested that the difference is not only in the flow structure but also in the originating mechanism of secondary flows between in bank and over bank cases shiono et al 1999 measured boundary shear stress in meandering channels for over bank flow using a preston tube and a heated thin film sensor measurements of secondary flow were also carried out using lda the distribution of boundary stress and secondary flow cells along the meandering channels for over bank flow show that the locations of peak and dip on boundary shear stress distribution well correspond to those of the secondary flow downwards and upwards motion respectively knight and macdonald 1979 and ishigaki et al 1996 measured the boundary shear stress using a preston tube and investigated its distribution with respect to an aspect ratio in straight open channels knight et al 1984 measured the boundary shear stress in the strong secondary flow regions in a relatively large meandering channel their results indicated that an undulation of the boundary shear stress distribution is closely related to the secondary flow structure the downwards motion of secondary flow is generally related to larger boundary shear stress on the other hand the upwards motion is related to smaller boundary shear stress sanjou and nezu 2010 investigated the impacts of trees and shrubs along floodplain edges in natural rivers and their impact on hydrodynamic characteristics they found that the spanwise profile of the streamwise velocity component is influenced by the drag force of the trees consequently the streamwise velocity decreases locally behind trees and near the junction between the main channel and the floodplains as the number of bend flow studies has increased many scholars have realized that the effects of vegetation on bend flow cannot be ignored and those researchers have carried out many studies to quantify the influences for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied the type density and placement of vegetation influences flow resistance ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated non vegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influences the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length liu et al 2016 analyzed the velocity distribution and structure of secondary flow cells in meandering compound channels with vegetated floodplains and proposed a new calculation method for the stage discharge relation savickis et al 2016 conducted a numerical study to analyze the effect of channel sinuosity and vegetation density on the hydraulic behavior in a channelized wetland shan et al 2017 proposed an analytical model for estimating the stage discharge relation in a meandering compound channel with dense submerged flexible floodplain vegetation under high flow conditions based on numerical simulations naghavi et al 2019 showed that with a 64 increase in the amount of sinuosity in the meandering compound channels the maximum longitudinal velocity decreases by 24 by examining the velocity distribution characteristics in meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains pan et al 2019 showed that the flow velocity in the section with maximal extension of the vegetated floodplain is higher than the section with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain the deflection near the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those with a smooth floodplain but the deflection near bends with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are larger than the corresponding smooth floodplain case near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side naghavi et al 2021a used numerical simulation of flow distribution and shear stress in meandering compound channels with floodplain width change to show that with 92 increase in floodplain width the maximum flow velocity in the main channel and the bed shear stress decreased by 24 and 35 respectively by examining the transverse current in meandering compound channels it was found that the maximum rotational power of vortices increased by 195 with increasing sinuosity from 1 to 1 209 naghavi et al 2021b naghavi et al 2022 conducted a series of laboratory experiments in a meandering compound channel with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains the results showed that for channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient was located in the central region in cross over sections the maximum amount of bed shear stress at the apex section for all channel sections occurs near the convex side and it decreases at all sections by decreasing the relative depth dr h h h where h is the flow depth in the main channel and h is the bankfull floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters they result in almost irr1 25 billion loss in iran naieni and ardalan 2006 catastrophic and rapidly forming floods as known flash floods occur annually in the provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan in the northern part of iran in recent years the frequency of floods in the northern part of iran has reached their historical peak and damage is increasing over time sharifi 2020 flash floods in northern iran cause considerable human and economic losses include the nowshahr flood in 2012 the sari flood in 2013 and the aqqala and gomishan flood in 2019 bui et al 2019 golestan province is famous for its history of deadly flash floods especially in rural areas in 2001 2002 and 2005 ardalan et al 2009 more specifically the gorganroud river in golestan province is well known for its large number of floods with over 120 recorded floods between 1991 and 2012 safaripour et al 2012 in the last case in aqqala and gomishan march 2019 the whole aqqala city was flooded fig 1 around 700 families were sheltered in camps shokri et al 2020 in these areas urbanization and extensive anthropogenic activity increase the likelihood of flood events these include construction activities in the floodplain that require the occupation of parts of the river and reduce the natural capacity of the river and thus increasing water levels during floods with respect to the broad applications of the present research it can be said that the first step in flood control is to identify the behavior of the river during a flood event after determining the flow structure in a meandering compound channel with building density in the floodplain river management and engineering can be performed to prevent erosion and sedimentation when construction results in locating buildings in the floodplain this analysis can be used as a predictive tool to reduce flood damage due as a consequence of the density of buildings the depth of a flood rises therefore the building density in a particular region is important for predicting flooding consequences 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures the experiments were conducted in a flume that was 16 m long 2 07 m wide and 0 40 m high at the laboratory of advanced hydraulics river engineering urmia university urmia iran see fig 2 to explore the effect of floodplain blocks on the main channel flow eighteen runs were performed in a straight concrete channel having a meandering main channel with some blocks in one floodplain six channels with different number block densities at three different relative depths of flow fig 2 shows channels with different blocks densities in this research non submerged blocks with a square cross section 10 cm 10 cm are used to model the blocks density due to the fact that the dimensions of structural barriers towns rural houses recreational camps etc in nature are variable compared to the dimensions of rivers so it is not possible to consider an exact value for the size of structural barriers in the model in order to simplify the modeling of the existing structural barriers in the floodplain non submerged rectangular cubic blocks with dimensions of 22 10 10 cm have been used and the aim is to consider the structural density of the floodplain by knowing the structural density in each area through satellite images and having the geometric information of rivers and floods engineering measures can be taken to manage and control floods for estimate the percentage of floodplain blocks density st first the plain flood area was calculated at the half a wavelength of the meandering compound channel then the numbers of blocks located in the floodplain were counted at the half a wavelength of meandering compound channel according to the area of each block 10 cm 10 cm and the number of blocks the total blocks area was calculated then the percentage of blocks density was calculated as the ratio of the total blocks area to the floodplains area at the half a wavelength of meandering compound channel based on a sinuosity s of natural rivers s 1 21 characterizes this meandering main channel the total width of the compound channel is b 2 07 m and the main channel width is b 0 5 m corresponding to an aspect ratio b h of 5 the valley slope of the flume is s0 0 001 the lateral and vertical distance y and z were both normalized by h 0 1 m and the left hand vertical sidewall of the main channel was defined as the origin fig 3 a rectangular weir was installed at the end section of the flume to measure the flow discharge in the inlet the flow discharge was controlled with a valve and monitored through an electromagnetic flow meter to the accuracy of 0 3 l s the stage discharge curves in the channel were recorded for a range of flow depths all experiments were performed under a quasi uniform flow condition with the slope of the water surface parallel to the bed slope at each meander by manually adjusting the downstream tailgate the water surface slope was calculated using the measured flow depth at the centerline of the flume at the apex sections when the deviation of water surface and bed slope became less than 5 as the quasi uniform flow had been achieved and the measurements were started ismail 2007 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the flume was made of concrete material with a smooth boundary surface at both the main channel and floodplains the overall manning s roughness parameter is estimated by the well known manning equation as n 1 u m r 2 3 s 0 1 2 in which um is the mean velocity at the apex section um q a q is the total flow discharge a is the cross sectional area at the bend apex and r is the hydraulic radius of the apexes liu et al 2016 according to fig 3 the flow direction in the meandering main channel is parallel with the wall of the main channel therefore the direction along the meander main channel wall was defined as the streamwise coordinate x and that perpendicular to x as the lateral coordinate y all experimental data were recorded at cs1 to cs7 perpendicular to the primary flow direction in the main channel in the meandering main channel 11 slices of vertical measurement lines were arranged and separated by a lateral interval of 4 5 cm from the left hand wall y 0 m to the right hand wall y 0 5 m these measurement lines in cs1 7 were numbered sequentially from 1 to 11 see fig 3 also identical measurement intervals of 1 5 cm between two vertical points were defined in the main channel fig 3 the distance of the first measurement point from the channel bed and lateral walls are 1 5 and 2 5 cm respectively a summary of the experimental parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 calculation methods of hydraulic parameters although there are several methods to calculate shear stress at the river bed and wall surfaces the preston tube method being an indirect estimate is often used for experimental observations in this study local boundary shear stress measurements were taken using a preston tube having an outer diameter of 3 mm ismail 2007 thus satisfying the size limitation recommended by preston 1954 a preston tube consists of two isolated tubes the static tube and a dynamic tube the static tube was fixed at the bottom of the flow depth and was used to measure the static pressure of the flow the dynamic tube was placed within the boundary shear layer facing into the flow and measured the dynamic pressure head preston 1954 developed a simple technique for measuring local shear stress on smooth boundaries using a pitot tube in contact with the surface his method was based on the assumption of an inner law relating the boundary shear stress to the velocity distribution near the wall preston presented a non dimensional relationship between the preston tube differential pressure δp and the boundary shear stress τ0 of the form 1 τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 f δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 where d is the outer diameter of the preston tube ρ is the density of the flow υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and f is an empirical function patel 1965 further extended the research and his calibration is given in terms of two non dimensional parameters x and y which are used to convert pressure readings to boundary shear stress where 2 x l o g δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 3 y l o g τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 in the form 4 y 0 5 x 0 037 f o r y 1 5 5 y 0 8287 0 1381 x 0 1437 x 2 0 006 x 3 f o r 1 5 y 3 5 6 x y 2 l o g 1 95 y 4 1 f o r 3 5 y 5 3 these equations are used to calculate the bed shear stress first according to the preston tube differential pressure δp the outer diameter of the preston tube d and the kinematic viscosity and mass density of the fluid the dimensionless parameters x is calculated then the dimensionless parameters y is calculated if the assumptions of eqs 4 6 satisfy value of y is acceptable and then bed shear stress is calculated based on the y patel 1965 the measured static dynamic pressure from the tube was transmitted to a pressure transducer and data were collected using a computer program each of the data acquired consisted of 1 000 readings per minute and this large dataset provided an accurate mean value al romaih 1995 declared that for 900 readings per minute the mean value was practically constant by the fortieth second of the sampling time ismail 2007 in this study the velocity distribution was measured using an 13 mm diameter miniature propeller flow meter h32 1a produced by armfield engineering co https armfield co uk this flow meter is used to measure very low point velocities in water with an accuracy of 1 mm s depth averaged velocity ud cross sectional

10 10 f 8 τ 0 ρ u d 2 3 results 3 1 stage discharge relationship and main channel discharge capacity fig 4 gives the stage discharge curves for smooth floodplain and one sided blocks floodplain conditions according to fig 4 the additional resistance produced by one sided blocks has the significant effect on the discharge capacity of the meandering compound channel with a high flow depth and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the flow depth for a given discharge the flow depth in the case with one sided blocks floodplain is larger than the case with smooth floodplain in fig 5 the stage discharge curves for one sided blocks in floodplain are compared with the experimental results of naghavi et al 2022 two sided blocks as seen in this figure in the cases with low blocks density 3 5 the deviation of the stage discharge curves compared to the smooth floodplain mat for the case with one sided blocks mbo and the case with two sided blocks mbt is very small with the increase of blocks density to 9 7 in case with one sided blocks meo and the case with two sided blocks met these graphs diverge and the changes in the slope of stage discharge curve are more significant because of increasing the share of blocks against the flow fig 6 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge q mc q with a smooth floodplain and one sided block floodplain from fig 6 under the smooth floodplain conditions mat the cross sectional discharges in the bending apexes are high and those in the crossover areas are low as the relative depth increases q mc q decreases however in case of one sided block conditions the cross sectional discharge is highest at the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks cs7 it is lowest near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks cs1 the q mc q in the bends with minimal extension of blocks cs1 the crossover areas and the bends with maximal extension of blocks cs7 decreases with an increase of the relative depth in case of the one sided blocks conditions the q mc q ratios in the bends with minimal extension of blocks cs1 and the cross sections cs2 3 decrease with an increase of the building density so q mc q ratios in the bends with maximal extension of blocks floodplain cs7 and the cross sections cs5 and cs6 increase by increasing the block densities under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the main channel discharge and cross sectional average velocities are all high the upstream floodplain directs fluid towards the bending apexes where they are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse motion is retarded by the main channel flow this causes upstream floodplain fluids to converge at the bending apexes in contrast the upstream floodplain fluid velocities at the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks cs1 are reduced due to the retardation of the model blocks thus upstream fluids motion towards the bending apex sections is driven by inertial effects there is enough time for the upstream floodplain fluids to diffuse transversely this behavior appears to reduce the discharge on the blocks side of the floodplain and weakens flow convergence near the bending apexes with minimal extension of block in the floodplain therefore the cross sectional average velocities and the q mc q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal blocks are all low this is because the upstream area of the bending apex with the maximum extension of blocks in the floodplain cs7 is a smooth floodplain the retardation effect of the smooth floodplain on the fluid is small and the flow velocities on the smooth floodplain are high in addition due to the transverse diffusion on the blocks side of the floodplain the upstream smooth floodplain of the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain requires a large flow so when the fluid upstream of the bending apex with the maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain flows towards the bending apex under inertia effects an intense convergence occurs the q mc q ratio at the bending apex with the maximum extension of blocks increases significantly this is a significant finding for actual engineering applications in meandering compound channels associated with one sided block filled floodplains it is necessary to implement protective engineering measures near the bending apexes in floodplains to avoid riverbank collapse pan et al 2019 3 2 manning s roughness n versus dr in open channels flow resistance is one of the important engineering issues to face much effort has been expended by many researchers to develop means and formulae to calculate the relationship between different flow characteristics and the channel geometry the aim of this section is to relate the flow depth to the resistance coefficient for different densities in the blocked in floodplain cases it is very important to have a good understanding of manning s n friction factor in order to understand the effects caused by the presence of blocks as well as their density the variation of n compared with dr is plotted in fig 7 all the values of manning s n were found to be within the accepted range of manning s n as reported by chow 1959 considering the manning s roughness n values for channels with six different block densities manning s n for channels is seen to decrease as dr increases by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases and the resistance due to obstacles such as the roughness of the floodplain bed is not effective the variations of the manning s n with relative depth for the blocked in floodplain cases follow a similar trend to the smooth floodplain case but differ in magnitude for different densities of blocks for a given dr the significant increase in the manning s n values as the density of the blocks increases the manning s n value for the blocked in floodplain is approximately 30 higher than that for the smooth floodplain case 3 3 local velocity at the cross sectional positions figs 8 and 9 show plots of the evolution of dimensionless longitudinal velocity u um along half a meander cs1 cs4 and cs7 at small and large flow depths dr 0 29 and 0 49 for smooth and one sided blocks meandering channels values of z h greater than 0 and less than 0 represent the distances above and below the bank full level respectively figs 8 and 9 also show dr and one sided blocks floodplain conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given dr the local velocities at the cross sectional positions under a one sided blocked conditions are lower than those under the smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents the reductions of the local velocities occur because the one sided floodplain blocks increase the total flow resistance in the meandering compound channel thus the main channel discharge for a given dr is also reduced when dr is small i e dr 0 29 with a smooth and one sided floodplains the local velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle part of the main channel s convex side additionally the local velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain cs7 are higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extensions of blocks on the floodplain cs1 this pattern is mainly a result of the bending radius being small and the curvature is large causing the flow directions near the main channel concave sides to change slowly except for the friction retardation near the bottom of the main channel and at the concave sidewalls the fluids near the concave sidewalls are also subject to the head on retardations at the concave sidewalls while the fluids near the convex sidewalls are not subject to head on retardations additionally the kinetic energy of the fluid near the water surface is consumed by the intense turbulence caused by the momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain the kinetic energy near the main channel bottom is also consumed by frictional effects consequently the areas with larger local velocities are disposed in the middle of the main channel convex sides under one sided blocked floodplain conditions the blocked side fluid is impeded by the model buildings thus the blocked side floodplain discharge is reduced the reduced discharge referred to as surplus discharge will be reallocated to the smooth side floodplain and main channel because the transverse widths of the concave side blocked floodplains in the test area are smaller than that of the convex side blocked floodplain the blocked side floodplain with maximal transverse width produces more discharge than the blocked side floodplains with minimal transverse width however as the transverse widths of convex side smooth floodplains are larger than that of the concave side smooth floodplain in the test area the main channel discharge in the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain must be larger than those in the bends with minimal extension of blocks floodplain consequently the longitudinal velocities near the middle parts of the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of blocks are higher than the corresponding values in bends with minimal blocks when the relative depth is large dr 0 49 in fig 9 the higher longitudinal velocities in the main channel curved segments with smooth floodplain conditions and those in the bend with maximal extension of blocks are adjacent to the main channel convex side and near the water surface but the longitudinal velocities in the bends with minimal extension of blocked floodplains are high in the middle region of the cross section by increasing the relative depth the areas near the water surface have exceeded the limited influential ranges of the spare disturbances caused by the sidewalls and the floodplain blocks this is the fundamental reason for the increases of the longitudinal velocities near the water surface when the relative depth is large the additional resistance generated by the blocked models only account for a small proportion of the total flow resistance so the ratio of surplus discharge caused by the blocks retardation effect compared with the total discharge is reduced however the transverse widths of the convex side smooth floodplain in the test area are larger which causes more discharge to pass over the smooth side of the floodplain because the main channel discharge capacities in the bends with minimal blocks are weakened and the cross sectional average velocities are reduced the head on retardations exerted on the fluid near the main channel concave sides are also weakened thus the areas with high longitudinal velocities move to the cross sectional middle region the longitudinal velocities with a one sided blocked floodplain are larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions only near the bending apex with a maximal extension of blocks the longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal blocks in the floodplain are all lower fig 10 shows the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity u mc max u m in sections cs1 and cs7 relative to the change in density of blocks at three different relative depths at each relative depth under smooth floodplain conditions st 0 a mirror distribution of velocity is observed at cs1 and cs7 with negligible difference due to the symmetric flow in the meandering channel with the increase of blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity of section cs1 the bend with minimal extension of blocks on the floodplain decreases and the value of maximum longitudinal velocity of section cs7 the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain increases and the value of the maximum longitudinal velocity in section cs7 is higher than its corresponding values in section cs1 in each density of blocks the difference of maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 increases with increasing relative depth so that this difference reaches its maximum value at the relative depth of 0 49 3 4 depth averaged velocity distributions in figs 11 and 12 according to the change of one sided blocks density the distribution of the depth averaged velocity of the main channel at different sections for two different relative depths are shown as shown in these figures for all block densities at a relative depth of 0 49 the maximum depth averaged velocity occurred in sections cs1 2 3 near the convex arch right wall in section cs4 for cases with low blocks density mbo mco the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs in the center of the main channel but for high blocks density mdo meo mfo the maximum depth averaged velocity appears near the right wall in sections cs5 6 7 for cases with low blocks density the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs near the left wall but for cases with high blocks density the maximum depth averaged velocity moves from the center of the main channel in section cs5 to the left wall in section cs6 7 at the relative depth of 0 29 for sections cs1 2 3 in all block densities the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs near the convex arch right wall and in sections cs4 5 the maximum depth averaged velocity moves towards the center of the main channel and finally in sections cs6 7 it appears near the left wall at the relative depth of 0 49 for sections cs1 4 the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density so that at a blocks density of 23 7 the highest blocks density the maximum value of depth averaged velocity in sections cs1 4 decreased by an average of 52 compared to the smooth floodplain but in section cs5 with the increase of blocks density to 23 7 the depth averaged velocity decreases 47 in the left half of the main channel and increases 14 in the right half of the main channel so that the velocity decrease rate in the left half of the main channel is higher than the increase rate in section cs6 with the increase of blocks density to 23 7 the depth averaged velocity decreases 19 in a small part of the cross section of the main channel near the left wall and increases 14 in a large area of the right part of the main channel in section cs7 with the increase of blocks density the depth averaged velocity increases in all cases except for a small part of the mfo near the left wall of the main channel which decreases with the increase of blocks density in the relative depth of 0 29 for sections cs1 3 the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density and the increasing trend of the depth averaged velocity with the increase of blocks density in the right half of the main channel starts from section cs4 and gradually expands in the entire width of the main channel in sections cs5 7 the range of velocity changes in the relative depth of 0 29 is lower than the relative depth of 0 49 also the value of the depth averaged velocity in all sections of these cases decreases with the decrease of the relative depth the reason that the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density in section cs1 is that the flow velocity in the floodplain upstream of the section cs1 decreases due to the effect of blocks density in each block density the number of blocks located in the floodplain upstream of section cs1 in the half wavelength of the meandering compound channel is more than the number of blocks in the floodplain upstream of section cs7 therefore during the movement of the floodplain flow towards apex section cs1 there is enough time for the transverse diffusion of the flow which causes the discharge rate to decrease in the floodplain with blocks cover and weaken the phenomenon of flow convergence near the main channel in the section cs1 as a result the depth averaged velocity of the main channel in the section cs1 is reduced as the density of blocks increases this decrease in depth averaged velocity is more significant because the surface covered with one sided blocks in the floodplain upstream of cs1 is more than other sections cs2 7 and in other sections the surface covered with one sided blocks in the floodplain upstream is gradually reduced and added to the smooth floodplain surface so that in the section cs7 the least covered surface with blocks density is observed therefore at this section the blocks density change does not have much effect on the flow velocity in the floodplain upstream of section cs7 the majority of the floodplain surface is smooth and the effect of reducing the fluid velocity in the smooth floodplain is low so the flow velocity in the floodplain increases in addition the smooth floodplain upstream of section cs7 section receives additional flow due to the transverse diffusion of floodplain fluid in the block covered surface therefore when the flow of the upstream floodplain moves towards the apex section cs7 under the effect of inertia a strong convergence occurs and the average velocity in the section cs7 increases significantly fig 13 shows the cross sectional average velocities in smooth and one sided blocks floodplain conditions in different relative depths according to this figure for smooth floodplain conditions mat the cross sectional average velocities along the meandering main channel form a w shape the values are higher at the bending apexes and are lower in the crossover areas and they are directly proportional to the relative depth however by increasing relative depth the cross sectional average velocities increase to a greater degree near the bending apexes than in the crossover areas in contrast in case of one sided blocks in a floodplain the distributions present an approximate v or u shape with an increase in block densities the cross sectional average velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain cs1 and in the crossover areas all decrease whereas those near the bending apex with maximal extension of the blocks in the floodplain cs7 increase 3 5 impact of different configurations on bed shear stress values in natural rivers the bed shear stress is an important parameter for determining the bed erosion as well as sediment transport rate shan et al 2017 measurement of bed shear stress in a meandering compound channel helps deepen knowledge of bed load transport due to shear stress momentum transfer and channel migration this section presents the bed shear stress as an application of the initial step in the erosion process fig 14 shows the distribution of bed shear stress for six channels with different block densities at three different relative depths as shown in this figure the amount of bed shear stress in all sections decreases by decreasing relative depth according to fig 14 at three different relative depths the maximum bed shear stress in sections cs1 and cs2 for all block densities occurs near the convex side right wall in section cs3 the maximum bed shear stress moves from the convex side to the center and in the cs4 and 5 sections the maximum shear stress appears in the central area of the main channel in section cs6 the maximum shear stress moves from the center to the left wall finally for section cs7 the maximum shear stress occurs near the left wall convex side in sections cs1 6 for three relative depths the shear stress decreases with increasing building density but in section cs7 with increasing building density shear stress first increases and then decreases and the net change of shear stress is negligible in the upstream region with maximal extension of blocks floodplain cs7 most of the floodplain is smooth therefore the change in block density has little effect on the flow velocity in the upstream floodplain in section cs1 with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain most of the upstream floodplain is covered with buildings and this block density reduces the upstream velocity by changing block density the intensity of changes in velocity and shear stress in section cs1 exceeds that of section cs7 see fig 10 in fig 15 the bed shear stress distribution with the experimental results of naghavi et al 2022 two sided blocks have been compared in the case with low block density mc and the case with high block density mf at a relative depth of 0 49 for sections cs1 4 7 according to fig 15 in the section cs1 for cases with low block density mc the amount of bed shear stress in mct1 two sided blocks is higher than mco1 one sided blocks and in both cases the bed shear stress is lower than the smooth floodplain mat1 but for cases with high block density mf the amount of bed shear stress in mft1 is higher than the smooth floodplain and in mfo1 is lower than the smooth floodplain in the middle section cs4 for the case with low block density the amount of bed shear stress in the mct1 is still higher than mco1 and in both cases the bed shear stress is almost lower than the mat1 but for the case with high block density the amount of bed shear stress in the left half of the main channel for mft1 is higher than the mat1 and in the mfo1 it is lower than the mat1 in section cs7 for the case with low block density the amount of bed shear stress in the mco1 is higher than the mat1 and in the mct1 it is lower than the mat1 but for the case with high block density the amount of bed shear stress in the right part of the main channel for mat1 is higher than the rest of the cases and in the middle part of the main channel the bed shear stress of mfo1 is the highest and near the left wall of the main channel the maximum bed shear stress appears in mft1 in section cs7 due to the fact that the structural barriers of the floodplain upstream have the least effect in reducing the velocity of one sided blocks density its bed shear stress is almost higher than the two sided blocks density but in section cs1 the floodplain upstream has the greatest effect in reducing the velocity of one sided blocks density and the amount of bed shear stress is lower than the case of two sided blocks density according to fig 15 the maximum bed shear stress in section cs1 for the case with one sided blocks compared to the case with two sided blocks in the blocks density of 4 8 and 23 7 is reduced by 23 and 63 respectively but in section cs7 for the case with one sided blocks compared to the case with two sided blocks in the blocks density of 4 8 and 23 7 the maximum bed shear stress is increases by 14 and decreases by 9 respectively in fig 16 the location of the maximum bed shear stress along the main channel is shown according to one sided blocks mfo1 and two sided blocks mft1 in floodplain as seen in fig 16 in the cross over sections cs3 5 for one sided blocks due to the transverse diffusion of flow in the floodplain with blocks density the maximum flow velocity and bed shear stress in the main channel have moved towards the floodplain where there are no structural barriers at the apex sections of the meandering compound channel cs1 7 the maximum shear stress in all cases occurs near the convex arch 3 6 darcy weisbach friction factor f fig 17 shows the darcy weisbach friction factor f of the main channel at different sections according to the blocks density change for a relative depth of 0 49 as shown in this figure the darcy weisbach friction factor of the main channel increases with the increase in the blocks density of the floodplain so that this increase is greater in sections cs1 2 and 3 due to the one sided blocks density arrangement in the floodplain upstream of the section cs1 there is the largest surface covered with structural barriers therefore the decrease in flow velocity in the section cs1 is more significant due to the increase in blocks density as a result the darcy weisbach friction factor increases more in these sections with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively which shows that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 4 concluding remarks a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering compound channel having smooth floodplains and one sided blocks in a floodplain detailed measurements were acquired in 7 sections along half a meander for low medium and high relative flow depths i e dr 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 respectively the main conclusions are 1 the cross sectional average velocities and q mc q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain are lower than that of a smooth floodplain whereas the ratios near the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks floodplain are much larger 2 manning s n for channels decreases as dr increases this is because by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases the manning s n value for the blocked in floodplain is approximately 30 higher than that for the smooth floodplain case 3 near the bending apexes the longitudinal velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when dr is small dr 0 29 compared to the smooth floodplain condition the one sided blocked floodplain features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain when dr is large dr 0 49 the transverse gradients near the block apexes with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain are all much smaller than those of smooth floodplains however near the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal velocities under the both floodplain conditions 4 it can be seen that dr and one sided blocked floodplains significantly influence the longitudinal velocity distributions in a meandering main channel for a given dr the longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions under one sided blocks floodplain are lower than those of smooth floodplain condition to varying extents 5 the maximum boundary shear stress at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the amount of bed shear stress at all sections decreases by decreasing dr 6 in the channels with a one sided blocked floodplain the section with minimal blocks in the floodplain and cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed decreases by increasing blocks density and those changes are greater near the convex side than the concave side 7 in the channels with a one sided blocked floodplain the location of maximum bed shear stress in the main channel has moved toward the floodplain where there are no blocks indeed 8 with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively showing that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 9 the findings in this paper may help the readers to understand the direct impacts of one sided blocks in floodplain on discharge capacity velocity

2321,meandering rivers have an important role in transporting runoff from rainfall especially during floods with many cities and villages along rivers and the construction of water management structures in floodplains the flow pattern of the meandering rivers changes in time of floods here the flow behaviors in meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and one sided building floodplains are investigated using laboratory experiments the experiments have been performed at three relative depths of 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 and the corresponding discharges the results show that the block density in a floodplain has a significant effect on flow behavior in the main channel so that with the increase of the relative depth the ratios of main channel discharge compared to the total discharge q mc q decreases in the bends with minimal extension of blocks floodplain the crossover areas and the bends with maximal extension of blocks floodplain for a given dr the significant increase in the manning s n values as the density of the blocks increases approximately 30 with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively which shows that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 under one sided blocked floodplain conditions the maximum longitudinal velocity in the main channel in the section with maximal extension of the blocks in the floodplain cs7 is greater than the section with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain cs1 at the relative depth of 0 49 the maximum value of depth averaged velocity in sections cs1 4 decreased by an average of 52 compared to the smooth floodplain the maximum shear stress on the bed at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the bed shear stress at all sections decreases with decreasing relative depth and in the section with minimal extension of blocks floodplain cs1 and cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed decreases with increasing the block density and these changes are more near the convex side than the concave side

introduction over the past 30 years 1985 2014 floods have killed more than 500 000 people worldwide and displaced an estimated 650 million more kocornik mina et al 2020 evidence shows that the 53 large floods that occurred from 2003 to 2008 affected more than 1 800 cities in 40 countries around the world kocornik mina et al 2020 part of the problem is that many cities were originally built near rivers and coastlines areas more than 860 million people live in flood prone urban lands worldwide marx et al 2013 in recent decades many countries have become increasingly developed and urbanized these new developments especially uncontrolled construction have occurred in floodplains that are prone to widespread flooding kocornik mina et al 2020 in urban areas roads and buildings constructed in floodplain areas increase impermeable surfaces and limit the river s capacity to convey floodwater this situation leads to increased flood risks such as inundation and erosion flood damage can be very severe because urban areas have higher populations and economic activities neal 2014 the distribution of flow and velocity in a meandering river are important topics in river hydraulics in relation to the bank protection navigation water intakes and sediment transport and deposition patterns knowledge of velocity distribution in a channel also helps to determine the energy expenditure boundary shear stress distribution and the associated heat and mass transport problems it is important to understand the flow characteristics in a river both in bank and over bank flow conditions when the flow is out of bank i e typically during a flood there is a significant increase in the complexity of flow behavior in a prismatic compound channel the velocity changes between the main channel and floodplain flows may produce strong lateral shear layers as shown by refs sellin 1964 ikeda 1999 ikeda et al 2002 bousmar 2002 li et al 2021 and elsewhere turbulence usually observed in such channels causes an intermittent upward flow motion at the interface between the main channel and floodplains the secondary flows are induced by the imbalance of the normal reynolds shear stress originating from complex nature of channel cross section as shown in refs knight and shiono 1990 knight 1999 anderson et al 1996 dupuis et al 2017 in case of over bank flows the main channel flow is affected by the floodplains and the conveyance capacity of main channel is usually reduced much less information is available for meandering compound channel flows than that of straight compound channel flows velocity measurements for meandering compound channels have been conducted by toebes and sooky 1967 by using a prandtl tube sellin et al 1993 by a laser doppler anemometer lda they observed that the primary velocity within the main channel below the bankfull level tends to follow the meandering channel whereas above the bankfull level intends to follow in the valley direction toebes and sooky 1967 reported that the rotating direction of the dominant secondary flow cells at the apex in the over bank case is opposite to that in a case of in bank flow they suggested that from observations at the crossover section the dominant cell at the bend apex is created by the impinging floodplain flow from the upstream side as it flows over and into the main channel this was also observed by stein and rouve 1988 and shiono and muto 1993 they suggested that the difference is not only in the flow structure but also in the originating mechanism of secondary flows between in bank and over bank cases shiono et al 1999 measured boundary shear stress in meandering channels for over bank flow using a preston tube and a heated thin film sensor measurements of secondary flow were also carried out using lda the distribution of boundary stress and secondary flow cells along the meandering channels for over bank flow show that the locations of peak and dip on boundary shear stress distribution well correspond to those of the secondary flow downwards and upwards motion respectively knight and macdonald 1979 and ishigaki et al 1996 measured the boundary shear stress using a preston tube and investigated its distribution with respect to an aspect ratio in straight open channels knight et al 1984 measured the boundary shear stress in the strong secondary flow regions in a relatively large meandering channel their results indicated that an undulation of the boundary shear stress distribution is closely related to the secondary flow structure the downwards motion of secondary flow is generally related to larger boundary shear stress on the other hand the upwards motion is related to smaller boundary shear stress sanjou and nezu 2010 investigated the impacts of trees and shrubs along floodplain edges in natural rivers and their impact on hydrodynamic characteristics they found that the spanwise profile of the streamwise velocity component is influenced by the drag force of the trees consequently the streamwise velocity decreases locally behind trees and near the junction between the main channel and the floodplains as the number of bend flow studies has increased many scholars have realized that the effects of vegetation on bend flow cannot be ignored and those researchers have carried out many studies to quantify the influences for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied the type density and placement of vegetation influences flow resistance ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated non vegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influences the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length liu et al 2016 analyzed the velocity distribution and structure of secondary flow cells in meandering compound channels with vegetated floodplains and proposed a new calculation method for the stage discharge relation savickis et al 2016 conducted a numerical study to analyze the effect of channel sinuosity and vegetation density on the hydraulic behavior in a channelized wetland shan et al 2017 proposed an analytical model for estimating the stage discharge relation in a meandering compound channel with dense submerged flexible floodplain vegetation under high flow conditions based on numerical simulations naghavi et al 2019 showed that with a 64 increase in the amount of sinuosity in the meandering compound channels the maximum longitudinal velocity decreases by 24 by examining the velocity distribution characteristics in meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains pan et al 2019 showed that the flow velocity in the section with maximal extension of the vegetated floodplain is higher than the section with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain the deflection near the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those with a smooth floodplain but the deflection near bends with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are larger than the corresponding smooth floodplain case near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side naghavi et al 2021a used numerical simulation of flow distribution and shear stress in meandering compound channels with floodplain width change to show that with 92 increase in floodplain width the maximum flow velocity in the main channel and the bed shear stress decreased by 24 and 35 respectively by examining the transverse current in meandering compound channels it was found that the maximum rotational power of vortices increased by 195 with increasing sinuosity from 1 to 1 209 naghavi et al 2021b naghavi et al 2022 conducted a series of laboratory experiments in a meandering compound channel with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains the results showed that for channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient was located in the central region in cross over sections the maximum amount of bed shear stress at the apex section for all channel sections occurs near the convex side and it decreases at all sections by decreasing the relative depth dr h h h where h is the flow depth in the main channel and h is the bankfull floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters they result in almost irr1 25 billion loss in iran naieni and ardalan 2006 catastrophic and rapidly forming floods as known flash floods occur annually in the provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan in the northern part of iran in recent years the frequency of floods in the northern part of iran has reached their historical peak and damage is increasing over time sharifi 2020 flash floods in northern iran cause considerable human and economic losses include the nowshahr flood in 2012 the sari flood in 2013 and the aqqala and gomishan flood in 2019 bui et al 2019 golestan province is famous for its history of deadly flash floods especially in rural areas in 2001 2002 and 2005 ardalan et al 2009 more specifically the gorganroud river in golestan province is well known for its large number of floods with over 120 recorded floods between 1991 and 2012 safaripour et al 2012 in the last case in aqqala and gomishan march 2019 the whole aqqala city was flooded fig 1 around 700 families were sheltered in camps shokri et al 2020 in these areas urbanization and extensive anthropogenic activity increase the likelihood of flood events these include construction activities in the floodplain that require the occupation of parts of the river and reduce the natural capacity of the river and thus increasing water levels during floods with respect to the broad applications of the present research it can be said that the first step in flood control is to identify the behavior of the river during a flood event after determining the flow structure in a meandering compound channel with building density in the floodplain river management and engineering can be performed to prevent erosion and sedimentation when construction results in locating buildings in the floodplain this analysis can be used as a predictive tool to reduce flood damage due as a consequence of the density of buildings the depth of a flood rises therefore the building density in a particular region is important for predicting flooding consequences 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures the experiments were conducted in a flume that was 16 m long 2 07 m wide and 0 40 m high at the laboratory of advanced hydraulics river engineering urmia university urmia iran see fig 2 to explore the effect of floodplain blocks on the main channel flow eighteen runs were performed in a straight concrete channel having a meandering main channel with some blocks in one floodplain six channels with different number block densities at three different relative depths of flow fig 2 shows channels with different blocks densities in this research non submerged blocks with a square cross section 10 cm 10 cm are used to model the blocks density due to the fact that the dimensions of structural barriers towns rural houses recreational camps etc in nature are variable compared to the dimensions of rivers so it is not possible to consider an exact value for the size of structural barriers in the model in order to simplify the modeling of the existing structural barriers in the floodplain non submerged rectangular cubic blocks with dimensions of 22 10 10 cm have been used and the aim is to consider the structural density of the floodplain by knowing the structural density in each area through satellite images and having the geometric information of rivers and floods engineering measures can be taken to manage and control floods for estimate the percentage of floodplain blocks density st first the plain flood area was calculated at the half a wavelength of the meandering compound channel then the numbers of blocks located in the floodplain were counted at the half a wavelength of meandering compound channel according to the area of each block 10 cm 10 cm and the number of blocks the total blocks area was calculated then the percentage of blocks density was calculated as the ratio of the total blocks area to the floodplains area at the half a wavelength of meandering compound channel based on a sinuosity s of natural rivers s 1 21 characterizes this meandering main channel the total width of the compound channel is b 2 07 m and the main channel width is b 0 5 m corresponding to an aspect ratio b h of 5 the valley slope of the flume is s0 0 001 the lateral and vertical distance y and z were both normalized by h 0 1 m and the left hand vertical sidewall of the main channel was defined as the origin fig 3 a rectangular weir was installed at the end section of the flume to measure the flow discharge in the inlet the flow discharge was controlled with a valve and monitored through an electromagnetic flow meter to the accuracy of 0 3 l s the stage discharge curves in the channel were recorded for a range of flow depths all experiments were performed under a quasi uniform flow condition with the slope of the water surface parallel to the bed slope at each meander by manually adjusting the downstream tailgate the water surface slope was calculated using the measured flow depth at the centerline of the flume at the apex sections when the deviation of water surface and bed slope became less than 5 as the quasi uniform flow had been achieved and the measurements were started ismail 2007 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the flume was made of concrete material with a smooth boundary surface at both the main channel and floodplains the overall manning s roughness parameter is estimated by the well known manning equation as n 1 u m r 2 3 s 0 1 2 in which um is the mean velocity at the apex section um q a q is the total flow discharge a is the cross sectional area at the bend apex and r is the hydraulic radius of the apexes liu et al 2016 according to fig 3 the flow direction in the meandering main channel is parallel with the wall of the main channel therefore the direction along the meander main channel wall was defined as the streamwise coordinate x and that perpendicular to x as the lateral coordinate y all experimental data were recorded at cs1 to cs7 perpendicular to the primary flow direction in the main channel in the meandering main channel 11 slices of vertical measurement lines were arranged and separated by a lateral interval of 4 5 cm from the left hand wall y 0 m to the right hand wall y 0 5 m these measurement lines in cs1 7 were numbered sequentially from 1 to 11 see fig 3 also identical measurement intervals of 1 5 cm between two vertical points were defined in the main channel fig 3 the distance of the first measurement point from the channel bed and lateral walls are 1 5 and 2 5 cm respectively a summary of the experimental parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 calculation methods of hydraulic parameters although there are several methods to calculate shear stress at the river bed and wall surfaces the preston tube method being an indirect estimate is often used for experimental observations in this study local boundary shear stress measurements were taken using a preston tube having an outer diameter of 3 mm ismail 2007 thus satisfying the size limitation recommended by preston 1954 a preston tube consists of two isolated tubes the static tube and a dynamic tube the static tube was fixed at the bottom of the flow depth and was used to measure the static pressure of the flow the dynamic tube was placed within the boundary shear layer facing into the flow and measured the dynamic pressure head preston 1954 developed a simple technique for measuring local shear stress on smooth boundaries using a pitot tube in contact with the surface his method was based on the assumption of an inner law relating the boundary shear stress to the velocity distribution near the wall preston presented a non dimensional relationship between the preston tube differential pressure δp and the boundary shear stress τ0 of the form 1 τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 f δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 where d is the outer diameter of the preston tube ρ is the density of the flow υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and f is an empirical function patel 1965 further extended the research and his calibration is given in terms of two non dimensional parameters x and y which are used to convert pressure readings to boundary shear stress where 2 x l o g δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 3 y l o g τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 in the form 4 y 0 5 x 0 037 f o r y 1 5 5 y 0 8287 0 1381 x 0 1437 x 2 0 006 x 3 f o r 1 5 y 3 5 6 x y 2 l o g 1 95 y 4 1 f o r 3 5 y 5 3 these equations are used to calculate the bed shear stress first according to the preston tube differential pressure δp the outer diameter of the preston tube d and the kinematic viscosity and mass density of the fluid the dimensionless parameters x is calculated then the dimensionless parameters y is calculated if the assumptions of eqs 4 6 satisfy value of y is acceptable and then bed shear stress is calculated based on the y patel 1965 the measured static dynamic pressure from the tube was transmitted to a pressure transducer and data were collected using a computer program each of the data acquired consisted of 1 000 readings per minute and this large dataset provided an accurate mean value al romaih 1995 declared that for 900 readings per minute the mean value was practically constant by the fortieth second of the sampling time ismail 2007 in this study the velocity distribution was measured using an 13 mm diameter miniature propeller flow meter h32 1a produced by armfield engineering co https armfield co uk this flow meter is used to measure very low point velocities in water with an accuracy of 1 mm s depth averaged velocity ud cross sectional

conditions according to fig 4 the additional resistance produced by one sided blocks has the significant effect on the discharge capacity of the meandering compound channel with a high flow depth and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the flow depth for a given discharge the flow depth in the case with one sided blocks floodplain is larger than the case with smooth floodplain in fig 5 the stage discharge curves for one sided blocks in floodplain are compared with the experimental results of naghavi et al 2022 two sided blocks as seen in this figure in the cases with low blocks density 3 5 the deviation of the stage discharge curves compared to the smooth floodplain mat for the case with one sided blocks mbo and the case with two sided blocks mbt is very small with the increase of blocks density to 9 7 in case with one sided blocks meo and the case with two sided blocks met these graphs diverge and the changes in the slope of stage discharge curve are more significant because of increasing the share of blocks against the flow fig 6 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge q mc q with a smooth floodplain and one sided block floodplain from fig 6 under the smooth floodplain conditions mat the cross sectional discharges in the bending apexes are high and those in the crossover areas are low as the relative depth increases q mc q decreases however in case of one sided block conditions the cross sectional discharge is highest at the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks cs7 it is lowest near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks cs1 the q mc q in the bends with minimal extension of blocks cs1 the crossover areas and the bends with maximal extension of blocks cs7 decreases with an increase of the relative depth in case of the one sided blocks conditions the q mc q ratios in the bends with minimal extension of blocks cs1 and the cross sections cs2 3 decrease with an increase of the building density so q mc q ratios in the bends with maximal extension of blocks floodplain cs7 and the cross sections cs5 and cs6 increase by increasing the block densities under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the main channel discharge and cross sectional average velocities are all high the upstream floodplain directs fluid towards the bending apexes where they are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse motion is retarded by the main channel flow this causes upstream floodplain fluids to converge at the bending apexes in contrast the upstream floodplain fluid velocities at the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks cs1 are reduced due to the retardation of the model blocks thus upstream fluids motion towards the bending apex sections is driven by inertial effects there is enough time for the upstream floodplain fluids to diffuse transversely this behavior appears to reduce the discharge on the blocks side of the floodplain and weakens flow convergence near the bending apexes with minimal extension of block in the floodplain therefore the cross sectional average velocities and the q mc q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal blocks are all low this is because the upstream area of the bending apex with the maximum extension of blocks in the floodplain cs7 is a smooth floodplain the retardation effect of the smooth floodplain on the fluid is small and the flow velocities on the smooth floodplain are high in addition due to the transverse diffusion on the blocks side of the floodplain the upstream smooth floodplain of the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain requires a large flow so when the fluid upstream of the bending apex with the maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain flows towards the bending apex under inertia effects an intense convergence occurs the q mc q ratio at the bending apex with the maximum extension of blocks increases significantly this is a significant finding for actual engineering applications in meandering compound channels associated with one sided block filled floodplains it is necessary to implement protective engineering measures near the bending apexes in floodplains to avoid riverbank collapse pan et al 2019 3 2 manning s roughness n versus dr in open channels flow resistance is one of the important engineering issues to face much effort has been expended by many researchers to develop means and formulae to calculate the relationship between different flow characteristics and the channel geometry the aim of this section is to relate the flow depth to the resistance coefficient for different densities in the blocked in floodplain cases it is very important to have a good understanding of manning s n friction factor in order to understand the effects caused by the presence of blocks as well as their density the variation of n compared with dr is plotted in fig 7 all the values of manning s n were found to be within the accepted range of manning s n as reported by chow 1959 considering the manning s roughness n values for channels with six different block densities manning s n for channels is seen to decrease as dr increases by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases and the resistance due to obstacles such as the roughness of the floodplain bed is not effective the variations of the manning s n with relative depth for the blocked in floodplain cases follow a similar trend to the smooth floodplain case but differ in magnitude for different densities of blocks for a given dr the significant increase in the manning s n values as the density of the blocks increases the manning s n value for the blocked in floodplain is approximately 30 higher than that for the smooth floodplain case 3 3 local velocity at the cross sectional positions figs 8 and 9 show plots of the evolution of dimensionless longitudinal velocity u um along half a meander cs1 cs4 and cs7 at small and large flow depths dr 0 29 and 0 49 for smooth and one sided blocks meandering channels values of z h greater than 0 and less than 0 represent the distances above and below the bank full level respectively figs 8 and 9 also show dr and one sided blocks floodplain conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given dr the local velocities at the cross sectional positions under a one sided blocked conditions are lower than those under the smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents the reductions of the local velocities occur because the one sided floodplain blocks increase the total flow resistance in the meandering compound channel thus the main channel discharge for a given dr is also reduced when dr is small i e dr 0 29 with a smooth and one sided floodplains the local velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle part of the main channel s convex side additionally the local velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain cs7 are higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extensions of blocks on the floodplain cs1 this pattern is mainly a result of the bending radius being small and the curvature is large causing the flow directions near the main channel concave sides to change slowly except for the friction retardation near the bottom of the main channel and at the concave sidewalls the fluids near the concave sidewalls are also subject to the head on retardations at the concave sidewalls while the fluids near the convex sidewalls are not subject to head on retardations additionally the kinetic energy of the fluid near the water surface is consumed by the intense turbulence caused by the momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain the kinetic energy near the main channel bottom is also consumed by frictional effects consequently the areas with larger local velocities are disposed in the middle of the main channel convex sides under one sided blocked floodplain conditions the blocked side fluid is impeded by the model buildings thus the blocked side floodplain discharge is reduced the reduced discharge referred to as surplus discharge will be reallocated to the smooth side floodplain and main channel because the transverse widths of the concave side blocked floodplains in the test area are smaller than that of the convex side blocked floodplain the blocked side floodplain with maximal transverse width produces more discharge than the blocked side floodplains with minimal transverse width however as the transverse widths of convex side smooth floodplains are larger than that of the concave side smooth floodplain in the test area the main channel discharge in the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain must be larger than those in the bends with minimal extension of blocks floodplain consequently the longitudinal velocities near the middle parts of the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of blocks are higher than the corresponding values in bends with minimal blocks when the relative depth is large dr 0 49 in fig 9 the higher longitudinal velocities in the main channel curved segments with smooth floodplain conditions and those in the bend with maximal extension of blocks are adjacent to the main channel convex side and near the water surface but the longitudinal velocities in the bends with minimal extension of blocked floodplains are high in the middle region of the cross section by increasing the relative depth the areas near the water surface have exceeded the limited influential ranges of the spare disturbances caused by the sidewalls and the floodplain blocks this is the fundamental reason for the increases of the longitudinal velocities near the water surface when the relative depth is large the additional resistance generated by the blocked models only account for a small proportion of the total flow resistance so the ratio of surplus discharge caused by the blocks retardation effect compared with the total discharge is reduced however the transverse widths of the convex side smooth floodplain in the test area are larger which causes more discharge to pass over the smooth side of the floodplain because the main channel discharge capacities in the bends with minimal blocks are weakened and the cross sectional average velocities are reduced the head on retardations exerted on the fluid near the main channel concave sides are also weakened thus the areas with high longitudinal velocities move to the cross sectional middle region the longitudinal velocities with a one sided blocked floodplain are larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions only near the bending apex with a maximal extension of blocks the longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal blocks in the floodplain are all lower fig 10 shows the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity u mc max u m in sections cs1 and cs7 relative to the change in density of blocks at three different relative depths at each relative depth under smooth floodplain conditions st 0 a mirror distribution of velocity is observed at cs1 and cs7 with negligible difference due to the symmetric flow in the meandering channel with the increase of blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity of section cs1 the bend with minimal extension of blocks on the floodplain decreases and the value of maximum longitudinal velocity of section cs7 the bend with maximal extension of blocks on the floodplain increases and the value of the maximum longitudinal velocity in section cs7 is higher than its corresponding values in section cs1 in each density of blocks the difference of maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 increases with increasing relative depth so that this difference reaches its maximum value at the relative depth of 0 49 3 4 depth averaged velocity distributions in figs 11 and 12 according to the change of one sided blocks density the distribution of the depth averaged velocity of the main channel at different sections for two different relative depths are shown as shown in these figures for all block densities at a relative depth of 0 49 the maximum depth averaged velocity occurred in sections cs1 2 3 near the convex arch right wall in section cs4 for cases with low blocks density mbo mco the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs in the center of the main channel but for high blocks density mdo meo mfo the maximum depth averaged velocity appears near the right wall in sections cs5 6 7 for cases with low blocks density the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs near the left wall but for cases with high blocks density the maximum depth averaged velocity moves from the center of the main channel in section cs5 to the left wall in section cs6 7 at the relative depth of 0 29 for sections cs1 2 3 in all block densities the maximum depth averaged velocity occurs near the convex arch right wall and in sections cs4 5 the maximum depth averaged velocity moves towards the center of the main channel and finally in sections cs6 7 it appears near the left wall at the relative depth of 0 49 for sections cs1 4 the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density so that at a blocks density of 23 7 the highest blocks density the maximum value of depth averaged velocity in sections cs1 4 decreased by an average of 52 compared to the smooth floodplain but in section cs5 with the increase of blocks density to 23 7 the depth averaged velocity decreases 47 in the left half of the main channel and increases 14 in the right half of the main channel so that the velocity decrease rate in the left half of the main channel is higher than the increase rate in section cs6 with the increase of blocks density to 23 7 the depth averaged velocity decreases 19 in a small part of the cross section of the main channel near the left wall and increases 14 in a large area of the right part of the main channel in section cs7 with the increase of blocks density the depth averaged velocity increases in all cases except for a small part of the mfo near the left wall of the main channel which decreases with the increase of blocks density in the relative depth of 0 29 for sections cs1 3 the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density and the increasing trend of the depth averaged velocity with the increase of blocks density in the right half of the main channel starts from section cs4 and gradually expands in the entire width of the main channel in sections cs5 7 the range of velocity changes in the relative depth of 0 29 is lower than the relative depth of 0 49 also the value of the depth averaged velocity in all sections of these cases decreases with the decrease of the relative depth the reason that the depth averaged velocity decreases with the increase of blocks density in section cs1 is that the flow velocity in the floodplain upstream of the section cs1 decreases due to the effect of blocks density in each block density the number of blocks located in the floodplain upstream of section cs1 in the half wavelength of the meandering compound channel is more than the number of blocks in the floodplain upstream of section cs7 therefore during the movement of the floodplain flow towards apex section cs1 there is enough time for the transverse diffusion of the flow which causes the discharge rate to decrease in the floodplain with blocks cover and weaken the phenomenon of flow convergence near the main channel in the section cs1 as a result the depth averaged velocity of the main channel in the section cs1 is reduced as the density of blocks increases this decrease in depth averaged velocity is more significant because the surface covered with one sided blocks in the floodplain upstream of cs1 is more than other sections cs2 7 and in other sections the surface covered with one sided blocks in the floodplain upstream is gradually reduced and added to the smooth floodplain surface so that in the section cs7 the least covered surface with blocks density is observed therefore at this section the blocks density change does not have much effect on the flow velocity in the floodplain upstream of section cs7 the majority of the floodplain surface is smooth and the effect of reducing the fluid velocity in the smooth floodplain is low so the flow velocity in the floodplain increases in addition the smooth floodplain upstream of section cs7 section receives additional flow due to the transverse diffusion of floodplain fluid in the block covered surface therefore when the flow of the upstream floodplain moves towards the apex section cs7 under the effect of inertia a strong convergence occurs and the average velocity in the section cs7 increases significantly fig 13 shows the cross sectional average velocities in smooth and one sided blocks floodplain conditions in different relative depths according to this figure for smooth floodplain conditions mat the cross sectional average velocities along the meandering main channel form a w shape the values are higher at the bending apexes and are lower in the crossover areas and they are directly proportional to the relative depth however by increasing relative depth the cross sectional average velocities increase to a greater degree near the bending apexes than in the crossover areas in contrast in case of one sided blocks in a floodplain the distributions present an approximate v or u shape with an increase in block densities the cross sectional average velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain cs1 and in the crossover areas all decrease whereas those near the bending apex with maximal extension of the blocks in the floodplain cs7 increase 3 5 impact of different configurations on bed shear stress values in natural rivers the bed shear stress is an important parameter for determining the bed erosion as well as sediment transport rate shan et al 2017 measurement of bed shear stress in a meandering compound channel helps deepen knowledge of bed load transport due to shear stress momentum transfer and channel migration this section presents the bed shear stress as an application of the initial step in the erosion process fig 14 shows the distribution of bed shear stress for six channels with different block densities at three different relative depths as shown in this figure the amount of bed shear stress in all sections decreases by decreasing relative depth according to fig 14 at three different relative depths the maximum bed shear stress in sections cs1 and cs2 for all block densities occurs near the convex side right wall in section cs3 the maximum bed shear stress moves from the convex side to the center and in the cs4 and 5 sections the maximum shear stress appears in the central area of the main channel in section cs6 the maximum shear stress moves from the center to the left wall finally for section cs7 the maximum shear stress occurs near the left wall convex side in sections cs1 6 for three relative depths the shear stress decreases with increasing building density but in section cs7 with increasing building density shear stress first increases and then decreases and the net change of shear stress is negligible in the upstream region with maximal extension of blocks floodplain cs7 most of the floodplain is smooth therefore the change in block density has little effect on the flow velocity in the upstream floodplain in section cs1 with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain most of the upstream floodplain is covered with buildings and this block density reduces the upstream velocity by changing block density the intensity of changes in velocity and shear stress in section cs1 exceeds that of section cs7 see fig 10 in fig 15 the bed shear stress distribution with the experimental results of naghavi et al 2022 two sided blocks have been compared in the case with low block density mc and the case with high block density mf at a relative depth of 0 49 for sections cs1 4 7 according to fig 15 in the section cs1 for cases with low block density mc the amount of bed shear stress in mct1 two sided blocks is higher than mco1 one sided blocks and in both cases the bed shear stress is lower than the smooth floodplain mat1 but for cases with high block density mf the amount of bed shear stress in mft1 is higher than the smooth floodplain and in mfo1 is lower than the smooth floodplain in the middle section cs4 for the case with low block density the amount of bed shear stress in the mct1 is still higher than mco1 and in both cases the bed shear stress is almost lower than the mat1 but for the case with high block density the amount of bed shear stress in the left half of the main channel for mft1 is higher than the mat1 and in the mfo1 it is lower than the mat1 in section cs7 for the case with low block density the amount of bed shear stress in the mco1 is higher than the mat1 and in the mct1 it is lower than the mat1 but for the case with high block density the amount of bed shear stress in the right part of the main channel for mat1 is higher than the rest of the cases and in the middle part of the main channel the bed shear stress of mfo1 is the highest and near the left wall of the main channel the maximum bed shear stress appears in mft1 in section cs7 due to the fact that the structural barriers of the floodplain upstream have the least effect in reducing the velocity of one sided blocks density its bed shear stress is almost higher than the two sided blocks density but in section cs1 the floodplain upstream has the greatest effect in reducing the velocity of one sided blocks density and the amount of bed shear stress is lower than the case of two sided blocks density according to fig 15 the maximum bed shear stress in section cs1 for the case with one sided blocks compared to the case with two sided blocks in the blocks density of 4 8 and 23 7 is reduced by 23 and 63 respectively but in section cs7 for the case with one sided blocks compared to the case with two sided blocks in the blocks density of 4 8 and 23 7 the maximum bed shear stress is increases by 14 and decreases by 9 respectively in fig 16 the location of the maximum bed shear stress along the main channel is shown according to one sided blocks mfo1 and two sided blocks mft1 in floodplain as seen in fig 16 in the cross over sections cs3 5 for one sided blocks due to the transverse diffusion of flow in the floodplain with blocks density the maximum flow velocity and bed shear stress in the main channel have moved towards the floodplain where there are no structural barriers at the apex sections of the meandering compound channel cs1 7 the maximum shear stress in all cases occurs near the convex arch 3 6 darcy weisbach friction factor f fig 17 shows the darcy weisbach friction factor f of the main channel at different sections according to the blocks density change for a relative depth of 0 49 as shown in this figure the darcy weisbach friction factor of the main channel increases with the increase in the blocks density of the floodplain so that this increase is greater in sections cs1 2 and 3 due to the one sided blocks density arrangement in the floodplain upstream of the section cs1 there is the largest surface covered with structural barriers therefore the decrease in flow velocity in the section cs1 is more significant due to the increase in blocks density as a result the darcy weisbach friction factor increases more in these sections with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively which shows that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 4 concluding remarks a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering compound channel having smooth floodplains and one sided blocks in a floodplain detailed measurements were acquired in 7 sections along half a meander for low medium and high relative flow depths i e dr 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 respectively the main conclusions are 1 the cross sectional average velocities and q mc q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain are lower than that of a smooth floodplain whereas the ratios near the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks floodplain are much larger 2 manning s n for channels decreases as dr increases this is because by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases the manning s n value for the blocked in floodplain is approximately 30 higher than that for the smooth floodplain case 3 near the bending apexes the longitudinal velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when dr is small dr 0 29 compared to the smooth floodplain condition the one sided blocked floodplain features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of blocks floodplain when dr is large dr 0 49 the transverse gradients near the block apexes with minimal extension of blocks in the floodplain are all much smaller than those of smooth floodplains however near the bending apex with maximal extension of blocks in the floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal velocities under the both floodplain conditions 4 it can be seen that dr and one sided blocked floodplains significantly influence the longitudinal velocity distributions in a meandering main channel for a given dr the longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions under one sided blocks floodplain are lower than those of smooth floodplain condition to varying extents 5 the maximum boundary shear stress at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the amount of bed shear stress at all sections decreases by decreasing dr 6 in the channels with a one sided blocked floodplain the section with minimal blocks in the floodplain and cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed decreases by increasing blocks density and those changes are greater near the convex side than the concave side 7 in the channels with a one sided blocked floodplain the location of maximum bed shear stress in the main channel has moved toward the floodplain where there are no blocks indeed 8 with increasing the blocks density from zero to 23 7 the maximum darcy weisbach friction factor in sections cs1 and cs7 increases by 110 and 2 respectively showing that increasing the density of blocks does not have a great effect on f in the section cs7 9 the findings in this paper may help the readers to understand the direct impacts of one sided blocks in floodplain on discharge capacity velocity

2322,quantifying seepage losses from unlined irrigation canals is necessary to improve water use and conservation the use of heat as a tracer is widely used in quantifying seepage rates across the sediment water interface in this study field observations and two dimensional numerical models were used to simulate seepage losses during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation season in the truckee canal system nineteen transects were instrumented with temperature probes and stage recording devices for inverse modeling to derive seepage flux and volumetric losses over the 39 km length of canal the numerical models for each transect were calibrated and validated using the two year dataset soil zones and observation data were used in each numerical model to help guide calibration of vertical and lateral heat and fluid fluxes model simulations were used to derive multivariable regression equations that consider stage temperature and hydraulic gradient the results demonstrate the value of long term datasets that illustrate the seasonality of groundwater levels siltation stage and temperature on seepage rates seepage rates estimated by the numerical models range from 0 16 to 4 6 m3 d m 1 total annual volumetric losses estimated for 2018 and 2019 were 1 6 10 2 to 1 2 10 2 km3 respectively the seepage losses estimated by this study account for 32 to 41 of the inflow volumes regression

irrigation is a major use of ground and surface water accounting for 42 percent of the nation s total freshwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 in arid environments the reliance on irrigation from surface water within watersheds that are highly susceptible to climate variability poses major challenges in managing water resources usgcrp 2017 given these challenges irrigation canals are important for inter basin transfer of surface water to agricultural areas and reservoirs within watersheds that are water limited and may not receive sustainable water naturally water scarcity is driving the need to improve understanding of flows and fluxes within agricultural areas to improve sustainability and efficiency of water resources steduto et al 2012 climate change is contributing to already mounting pressures to conserve water resources to maintain economic and environmental benefits sterle et al 2020 irrigation canals used for conveyance of water for agriculture represent an evolving challenge for managers there is a general recognition that improvements in conveyance efficiency are needed to better manage water resources lindenbach et al 2021 seepage losses from unlined canals can represent substantial inefficiencies in surface water conveyance accounting for 15 to 50 percent of the total diverted volume van der leen et al 1990 kacimov 1992 sharma and chawla 1979 requiring more water to be diverted to meet irrigation demand the volume of water diverted for agriculture can result in substantial declines in streamflow that may result in water quality and ecosystems impacts wurtsbaugh et al 2017 scanlon et al 2007 chen et al 2003 scoppettone et al 1986 improvements in conveyance efficiency are a critical resource management objective to conserve water and ensure farmers receive their permitted water allocations canal maintenance and lining projects are a means to increase conveyance efficiency and reduce seepage but may have unintended consequences seepage contributes to aquifer recharge that can be recovered for further agriculture or domestic use as such in some communities there is a reliance on recharge from canals for domestic water use or for continued agricultural use by groundwater pumping arumí et al 2009 fernald and guldan 2006 recharge from irrigation canals can also provide water quality benefits and restore depleted aquifers thodal and tumbusch 2006 pohll et al 2001 aquifer recharge from irrigation canals is often included as an important component within regional studies given the spatial extent of canal networks and quantity

canal seepage losses are governed by hydraulic properties of sediments canal geometry stage and the hydraulic gradient between surface flows with the underlying aquifer bouwer 1965 robinson and rohwer 1959 the presence of low permeability sediments at the base of and beneath the canals influences the rates and direction of seepage wachyan and uston 1987 yao et al 2012 other factors that influence rates are sediment temperatures periods of operation wet dry cycles and canal maintenance removing vegetation and fine sediments to improve conveyance naranjo and smith 2016 in the presence of near surface clogging seepage can become drastically reduced settling of fine sediments can be mediated by both physical and biotic factors leading to seasonably variable seepage rates rosenberry et al 2021 naranjo and smith 2016 quantifying the rate and locations of seepage can be challenging due to spatial variations of canal characteristics and temporal variability of operations traditional direct methods such as ponding methods seepage meters and inflow outflow measurements have been used widely batlle aguilar and cook 2012 alam and bhutta 2004 robinson and rohwer 1959 warnick 1951 these approaches are generally considered suitable for many systems but have practical limitations ponding methods require controlled measurements of stage decline between sections of a diked reach causing disruptions to water operations seepage meters have been used for several decades and are an efficient method to obtain discrete seepage measurements at multiple locations for both losing and gaining sections of canals drawbacks include the need for multiple deployments to obtain seepage rates during different stage conditions and may be challenging or impractical in unwadable conditions or in canals with high stage variability rosenberry et al 2020 seepage losses made from inflow outflow or differential discharge measurements are reliable when losses are greater than discharge measurement uncertainty and canal flow is maintained at steady state conditions acoustic doppler current profilers adcp are better suited for discharge as measurement uncertainty is reduced martin and gates 2014 kinzli et al 2010 surface geophysical methods can be a viable indirect tool for mapping long sections of canals to identify potentially high seepage rates hobza and andersen 2010 used resistivity surveys on 84 km of canals in nebraska to determine contrasting lithologies to a depth of 8 m below land surface to better understand spatial variations in seepage additional field observations such as sediment descriptions electrical conductivity logs and seepage meters are combined with electrical conductivity inverse of resistivity to estimate seepage loss hobza and andersen 2010 hotchiss et al 2001 a key limitation to traditional approaches is the inability to account for variations of losses during canal operations and over the duration of the entire irrigation season heat as a tracer has been widely used for estimated fluxes between surface water and groundwater at variable time and spatial scales e g schilling et al 2019 rau et al 2014 constantz et al 2008 andersen 2006 stonestrom and constantz 2003 this approach can also be used to quantify the effects of scour and siltation on seepage rates by evaluating the changes in thermal gradients over time naranjo and smith 2016 tonina et al 2014 in addition to seepage estimates identifying large scale sections of a canal where groundwater discharge is present can also be made from distributed fiber

seepage rates but rarely are considered rosenberry et al 2021 our primary objective in this study was to use field data and numerical seepage models to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of seepage rates during operation of the truckee canal nevada in this project we measured subsurface temperatures canal stage and groundwater levels to calibrate and validate parameters used in the numerical seepage models during a two year period of canal operations multivariable regression models were developed from numerical models to provide seepage equations to be applied with field data

to the truckee river in this reach the tc intersects numerous narrow ephemeral drainages that once flowed to the southern slope of the truckee river canyon the tc was excavated into an existing hillslope with the sediment material used to construct the left embankment facing downstream the left embankment ranges in height from 1 5 to 15 0 m reclamation 2015a boreholes drilled for geological investigations encountered groundwater at a depth greater than 3 0 m below the base of the tc while the tc was dry five seepage sites in the derby reach were selected to be collocated with seeps identified along the left outer embankment the presence of seeps on the outer embankment are expressed as visible flowing or ponded water seepage sites 1 3 were selected in 2018 and sites 0 5 and 2 5 were added in 2019 fig 1 the upstream most site within this reach site 0 5 was located 2 7 km downstream of derby dam at the end of the reach site 3 was located 0 26 km from the usgs gage at wadsworth the average bottom width of seepage sites on the derby reach was 5 4 m with an average of embankment slope vertical to horizontal of 1 2 5 2 2 the fernley reach the fernley reach is 18 km and trends southeast through gently sloping terrain along the edge of the city of fernley several seepage and geologic investigations have been done in this reach to address water resource and safety concerns reclamation 2015b shanafield et al 2014 mihevc et al 2002 pohll et al 2001 van denburgh and arteaga 1985 the tc in the fernley reach has been breached at least nine times with the most recent occurring in 2008 reclamation 2015b improvements to the sections of canal where historic breaches occurred widened the tc stabilized the banks and fine sediments were placed at the bottom of the tc to reduce seepage rates flows entering this reach are measured at the usgs wadsworth gage and there are nine lateral canals with three gate structures or checks that control the canal stage for diversions into lateral ditches there were eight seepage sites selected in this reach at an average distance interval of 2 2 km co located with seeps and located up gradient of gate structures seepage sites 4 9 were selected in 2018 and 3 5 and 9 5 were added in 2019 fig 1 site 6 was located near a monitoring well that was included in the monitoring effort the average bottom width of seepage sites

sloping terrain to the terminus of lahontan reservoir in the carson river basin flows in this reach are measured at the usgs gage near hazen usgs 10351400 near a gate structure that controls flow into lahontan reservoir and a lateral canal canal sediments and embankment materials consist of a heterogenous mixture of sandy silts and silty sand derived from lakebed sediments excavated during canal construction reclamation 2015c the tc also flows through sections of alluvial and volcanic deposits with loamy sand through cobble size sediments groundwater was encountered approximately 5 0 m below the base of the tc perched above layers of low permeable lakebed sediments and volcanic rock while the canal was dry reclamation 2015c there were 6 seepage sites selected in this reach at an average distance interval of 1 9 km co located with seeps and located up gradient of gate structures fig 1 the last seepage site site 15 was located 250 m down gradient of the usgs gage near hazen the average bottom width of sites on the lahontan reach was 6 3 m with an average of vertical to horizontal side slope of 1 3 0 3 methods 3 1 field methods equipment deployed at each seepage site was used to characterize vertical and lateral seepage by focusing sensor placement near the sediment water interface at the bottom and sides of the canal two temperature probes naranjo and turcotte 2015 were installed in the bottom of the channel at each transect fig 2 each probe contained temperature sensors spaced at 0 10 20 50 75 and 100 cm beneath the sediment water interface at the canal invert a 2 54 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc piezometer was driven 2 3 m below the ground surface along the left bank in the canal access road only one piezometer was installed given access to download data from the right side of the canal during operations was impractical a screen length of 10 cm was located 5 cm from the bottom of the piezometers to monitor the potential for rising water tables however given the depth to water and side slope of embankment material piezometers driven with hand tools were not able to reach the groundwater table three to four temperature sensors ibcods type z alpha mach inc were strung inside the piezometer at evenly spaced depths ranging from 10 to 40 cm apart the upper most temperature sensor ibcod type g alpha mach inc was placed 10 20 cm below the surface to measure land surface temperatures temperature data were recorded at one hour intervals and retrieved from the loggers monthly prior to deployment of equipment the temperature sensors were independently calibrated in a water bath utilizing a 5 point linear regression to validate raw temperature readings accuracy of the sensors after calibration is within 0 1 c naranjo and turcotte 2015 canal stage is monitored by truckee carson irrigation district and reclamation at 12 seepage sites along the tc the remaining 7 sites were instrumented with pressure transducers td divers van essen instruments deployed near the canal bottom to capture the low flow stage but close enough to the edge of water to manually measure stage at monthly intervals stage as discussed herein is defined as the head or height of water above the bottom of the canal stage was recorded every hour and manual water level measurements taken monthly were used to verify and correct pressure transducer derived water level measurements sauer and turnipseed 2010 the accuracy of the pressure transducer measurements is 2 0 cm with a resolution of 0 2 cm the temperature readings have an accuracy of 0 2 c and a resolution of 0 01 c the tc is generally considered hydraulically disconnected from the saturated aquifer and is characterized as a losing system however groundwater may mound above low permeable lakebed sediments and contribute to perched aquifers with recharge from the tc to measure the influence of changing water levels on seepage rates pressure transducers and temperature sensors were installed in existing monitoring wells at site 2 and site 6 during the deployment of sensors in april 2018 the wells were dry elevation data for each cross section monitoring well bank piezometer and temperature probe were obtained through rtk gnss survey techniques rydlund and densmore 2012 soil cores 3 2 cm diameter were collected from the bottom of the channel to a depth of 61 cm to provide visual descriptions of the soil profile and to identify confining or low permeable deposits near the surface thermal conductivity was measured monthly along the saturated embankment sediments using a handheld thermal conductivity probe kd2 pro decagon observations taken from bottom sediments were not possible while the canal was in operation values obtained from discrete measurements were used to set the range in values of thermal conductivity at saturation for model calibration 3 2 numerical methods seepage was numerically simulated for each of the 19 transects using the variably saturated two dimensional hydraulic model vs2dhi hsieh et al 2000 healy and ronan 1996 vs2dhi is a finite difference model that uses the richard s equation for variably saturated flow and the energy transport equation to simulate the change in thermal storage as a function of thermal conduction dispersion and convection healy and ronan 1996 groundwater flow simulated by the model accounts for temperature dependency of viscosity within the hydraulic conductivity term healy and ronan 1996 k ρgk μ t 1 where ρ is density in kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity in m s2 k is the intrinsic permeability in m2 and μ is viscosity in ns m2 as a function of temperature t viscosity is calculated empirically kipp 1987 μ t 2 4 105 10 247 8 t 133 16 2 two dimensional 2d seepage models were created for each transect by defining the cross sectional representation of the canal soils initial conditions boundary conditions and locations of observations in the graphical processor vs2dhi hsieh et al 2000 fig 2 soil thermal and hydraulic properties were defined by soil zone polygons fig 2b the sediments near the sediment water interface with the greatest variations in temperature and were represented by three zones zone 1 3 soil zone 4 was used to describe subsurface properties important for simulating lateral flow away from the canal soil zone 5 was used at transects where borehole data indicated volcanic or lakebed sediments were present not shown in fig 2 see naranjo et al 2023 and supplemental data figure si 1 the 2d conceptual model assumes the bottom canal sediments are represented by a uniform clogging layer naranjo and smith 2016 however the parameter estimation calibration technique pest welter et al 2015 could confirm the presence or absence of surface clogging layers by matching near surface temperature observations 0 10 to 0 20 cm depths that are very sensitive to soil hydraulic conductivity as such low amplitude temperature signals measured near the surface would be indicative of heat conduction due to low permeable sediments whereas high amplitude signals would be indicative of heat advection due to high permeable sediments the two temperature probes were used to estimate parameters in zones 1 2 and 4 fig 2b the near surface canal embankment materials were defined by soil zone 3 and assumed to represent both sides of the canal ten temperature observations were used to calibrate the models for estimation of vertical seepage zones 1 2 and 4 three to four temperature observations collected in the embankment sediments were used to calibrate each model for estimation of lateral seepage zone 3 a variable temperature boundary condition representing soil temperatures were specified at the upper boundary of the model stage and temperature measured at the sediment water interface 0 cm depth along the wetted perimeter were specified as a variable head and temperatures boundary condition lateral vertical boundary conditions were defined as no flow and positioned away from influence on subsurface flow at sites 2 and 6 groundwater levels measured in monitoring wells were used to define the bottom and both lateral boundaries the 2d seepage models were defined by the surveyed cross section that included bottom width side slope and embankment sediments the model grids were refined near the canal boundary and temperature observations grid spacing between 0 01 and 3 0 m was used in the horizontal direction and between 0 01 and 1 m in the vertical direction with coarser grid spacing further away from the observations and wetted perimeter the width and depth of the model domain varied for each model to avoid boundary condition edge effects on the simulations the models extent in the horizontal and vertical direction varied between 80 and 200 m and 15 and 40 m respectively the vertical sides of the models were specified as no flow boundaries the lower horizontal boundary of the model was specified as gravity drainage in transects where the canal was hydraulically connected to groundwater the lateral and bottom horizontal boundary conditions was specified as variable head boundary condition initial conditions specified for each model were initial moisture content and sediment temperatures the initial moisture contents among the different cross sectional models were assumed to range between 0 05 to 0 15 m3 m3 for the zones near the sediment water interface the initial temperature for each model was based on interpolation of the observed temperature measurements at the start of the simulation for the entire model domain 3 3 model calibration the parameter estimation model pest welter et al 2015 was used to calibrate each transect model by adjusting hydraulic and thermal properties to match observed temperatures pest is an independent object oriented parameter estimation code that executes the vs2dhi model and adjusts the parameters using the gauss marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm by comparing the simulated temperatures to the observed through a weighted least squares objective function pest allows the use of observation and time varying weights to give greater importance to data points or specific behaviors in the data such as daily fluctuations of temperature temperatures near the daily minimum and maximum were given a weight of 1 to emphasize amplitude variations all other temperatures were given zero weight focusing on the amplitude variations yield model simulations that are more representative of field data and directly relate to the hydraulic and thermal properties of the soils naranjo and smith 2016 arrays of time varying weights were created using the first observation 0 0 m in the center of canal with series see v1 12 halford et al 2012 using the period function soil property values that were not estimated were assigned based on values reported in carsel and parrish 1988 for general soil textural classifications provided in vs2dhi parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity thermal conductivity porosity and heat capacity are among the most sensitive to temperature simulations naranjo and smith 2016 however the saturated hydraulic conductivity predominantly influences seepage rates lapham 1989 constantz 2008 naranjo and smith 2016 the parameter values and ranges used in pest are provided in table 1 the estimated parameters in each transect model were saturated hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction kh thermal conductivity at saturation kts and volumetric heat capacity of sediments cs the ratio of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the vertical to horizontal direction anisotropy was assumed to be 0 1 for canal sediments and 0 01 for subsurface lakebed and volcanic sediments performance of each model was evaluated during calibration and validation periods model calibration was based on 2 500 h of sediment temperature and stage data measured after the canal stage was relatively stable and seasonal variability in canal water temperature ranged between 10 c and 25 c may to august the model parameters determined during calibration were then validated by evaluating each model s performance for the irrigation season march to november into the subsequent year model performance was measured by the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated temperatures for each sensor location separately and for all observations differences between observed and simulated temperatures rmse were examined within the validation period to determine whether recalibration was necessary for the following year validation rmse values that are different from calibration rmse values of more than 1 0 c are typically caused by changes in hydraulic and thermal properties due to siltation or scour naranjo and smith 2016 siltation reduces infiltration by reducing the porosity and hydraulic conductivity thereby dampening the amplitude of the temperature signal imparted by canal seepage beneath the surface scour events can rapidly remove deposited silt layers and decrease the thermal gradients sebok et al 2015 this effect is distinguishable by the similarity in temperature in observations with respect to depth within a profile tonina et al 2014 deweese et al 2017 thus using observational data for model validation can provide insight into potentially time varying hydraulic and thermal properties naranjo and smith 2016 increases in model rmse calculated for all observations between calibration and validation periods to a maximum of 0 5 c were considered acceptable seepage loss regressions for the tc need to account for the range in stage conditions during normal operations of the canal additional transect models herein defined as max stage were developed to simulate seepage losses at the maximum operational stage numerical model seepage predictions for 2018 2019 and max stage were then used to develop regressions models that would account for range in temperature and stage conditions for each transect model a new boundary condition was developed by increasing the observed stage by a factor until the average stage condition was at the maximum operational stage of the canal by using a factor the daily and seasonal variation in stage was preserved the temperature boundary condition within the canal was assumed to be consistent with daily and seasonal variation observed at 0 0 m depth during 2018 or 2019 for each transect model 4 results the numerical models were used to simulate seepage losses along transects during operation of the truckee canal during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons naranjo et al 2023 multivariable regression equations were then developed from numerical models for each transect the numerical model output and regression model are presented as total seepage flux in vertical and lateral directions across the wetted canal surface the results described in this section demonstrate the use of temperature and stage observations to calibrate numerical models for brevity a transect model from each reach is discussed the reader is referred to naranjo et al 2023 for further description of models observation data and calibration results 4 1 numerical model performance the calculated overall rmse for all observations at each transect for the calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 2 during the calibration period typically may to august see naranjo et al 2023 for simulation periods the models performed reasonably well with overall rmse values ranging from 0 34 c to 0 76 c during the validation periods for 2018 and 2019 march to november the overall rmse values ranged from 0 33 to 0 99 c at site 3 the overall rmse computed for the 2018 validation period was substantially greater than the 0 5 c criteria and required re calibration with temperature data from 2019 the re calibrated 2019 model performed reasonably well with an overall rmse of 0 76 c a difference of 0 14 c compared to the calibration results of 2018 re calibration of the model was done manually by reducing kh until simulated temperatures in 2019 were within agreement with observation data and the rmse was within the threshold of 0 5 c of the 2018 calibration model the changes in kh at this transect were likely caused by localized siltation as other transect models were not affected stage measured at site 1 varied from 0 2 m to 1 4 m with large variations occurring during the initial 1 500 hrs and final 100 hrs of operation fig 3 seasonal temperature variations observed at 0 1 m varied from 5 4 to 25 5 c during the remainder of 2018 march to november naranjo et al 2023 model simulations match the daily amplitudes in the shallow observations near the sediment water interface as well as the seasonal variation in heat transport in the deeper observations overall rmse 0 63 c during the early validation period 0 to 200 hrs the model underestimates the large variations in thermal patterns at all depths as flow in the canal starts and during initially dry soil the canal stage was significantly more variable at transects located upgradient of the gate structures used to divert water to lateral canals additionally transects at these locations also recorded higher stages during water delivery to the laterals fig 4 shows the stage conditions at site 8 in the fernley reach where the stage varied from 1 8 to 2 7 m during 2018 march to november seasonal variation in temperatures observed at 0 1 m depth was 4 1 to 26 4 c at this transect the daily temperature variations at 0 10 m depth were dampened compared to site 1 with approximately 1 0 c in variation overall the model simulates the general behavior during the may to august calibration 2018 period overall rmse 0 40 c with greater deviation from the observations occurring during the april to november 2018 validation period 4 500 5 000 hrs at the 0 75 and 1 0 m depths overall rmse 0 62 c the stage at site 14 varied from 0 4 to 1 7 m during april to november 2018 as water was delivered to a lateral canal fig 5 during this period temperature at 0 10 m varied seasonally from 2 7 to 26 4 c larger daily variations were observed during calibration with the amplitude variations at 0 5 m the model simulates and captures the general behavior during the calibration period overall rmse 0 49 c with greater deviation from the observations occurring during the validation period 2 760 to 5 400 hrs at the 0 75 and 1 0 m depths overall rmse 0 52 c at sites 1 and 14 there are clear links between simulated seepage flux and observed sediment temperature fig 6 while it is apparent that variations in canal stage affect seepage when stage is relatively constant the seasonal fluxes are influenced by temperature the seasonal effect of temperature can be observed at site 1 with notable differences in seepage behavior from 2018 and 2019 fig 6b during 3 30 2018 to 7 2 2018 stage and simulated flux rapidly varied between 0 2 and 1 5 m and 0 7 to 4 4 m3d 1m 1 respectively fig 6b during 2019 the seasonal change in simulated flux corresponds to changes in observed temperature during 5 1 2019 to 8 15 2019 an average stage of 1 0 m was observed with a doubling 2 4 to 4 4 m3d 1m 1 of the simulated flux along with observed temperature 10 to 25 c in months following the peak in temperature august 2019 the simulated flux decreased from 4 2 to 2 0 m3d 1m 1 along with decreases in temperature from 26 0 to 5 0 c while stage was nearly constant at 1 2 m at site 8 in the fernley reach canal stage fluctuated between two contrasting hydraulic properties of soil zone 2 kh 0 15 mhr 1 and soil zone 3 kh 0 26 mhr 1 see naranjo et al 2023 figure si 1 and table 1 which resulted in rapidly changing seepage behavior fig 6d at site 8 lateral seepage through the embankment material is the dominant direction of flow at site 14 within the lahontan reach the seasonal change in stage during operations of the canal in 2018 and 2019 obscures the influence of temperature fig 6e f in 2018 seepage rates corresponded to the sediment temperature increase until the annual maximum temperature of 26 c on 7 16 2018 then declines to 13 6 on 10 12 2018 in 2019 seepage rates were responding to rapid changes in canal stage and temperature seasonal temperature declines 4 2 seepage flux and volume estimates the seepage flux and volumetric loss per unit length of canal estimated for each transect during the modeling period of 2018 and 2019 are shown in table 3 seepage flux estimated along the transects ranged from 0 2 to 4 6 m3d 1m 1 with an average across all transects of 1 5 m3d 1m 1 site 15 was located down gradient of a gate structure controlling nearly all the flow measured at the usgs gage at hazen usgs 10351400 an average of 0 2 m of canal stage was observed at this location during the period of monitoring the canal was dry for both years downgradient of site 15 the seepage flux estimated for each transect model was used to compute volumetric loss for each reach table 4 because seepage estimates could not be made for the entire 16 km lahontan reach to lahontan reservoir the volumetric losses were estimated for 10 3 km to the usgs gage at hazen site 14 the seepage fluxes per unit length of canal were assumed to represent the segment of canal between transects and summed over each reach the total volumetric losses for the 2018 and 2019 irrigation periods were 1 6 10 2 km3 12 737 acre ft and 1 2 x10 2 km3 9 497 acre ft respectively averaged over the 38 3 km distance from derby dam to the usgs gage at hazen the overall volumetric loss per unit length of canal was 4 2 10 4 km3 km 1 474 acre ft mi 1 and 3 0 x10 4 km3 km 1 351 acre ft mi 1 during 2018 and 2019 monitoring period respectively the seepage losses represent 32 to 41 of the inflow volume measured at the usgs gage at wadsworth usgs 10351650 4 3 multivariable regression regression equations that include stage and temperature to estimate seepage losses are necessary to account for seasonal variability the relationship between stage and sediment temperature at the sediment water interface 0 0 m and seepage loss for the range of conditions observed in 2018 2019 and for the maximum stage models are shown in fig 7 seepage rates were grouped by sediment temperatures low 10 c moderate 10 to 20 c and high greater than20 c at site 1 the simulated flux at 2 0 m stage for sediment temperatures 10 c was 4 0 m3d 1m 1 for sediment temperatures greater than 20 c the same stage condition would result in 38 increase in losses of 5 5 m3d 1m 1 for the same change in temperature and stage condition the increase in simulated seepage flux would be 23 2 4 to 3 0 m3d 1m 1 and 44 4 7 to 6 8 m3d 1m 1 at site 8 and site 14 respectively canal temperature increases from derby to lahontan at site 1 temperatures were in the low moderate and high ranges 13 54 and 32 of time respectively for comparison sediment temperatures were warmer 40 4 km further down the canal at site 14 with temperatures in the low moderate and high ranges 10 49 and 41 percent of the time respectively seepage flux derived from multivariable regression equations using observations of temperature stage and vs2dhi estimated seepage flux for each transect on the tc are summarized in table 5 regressions developed with stage and temperature have statistically significant p values p 0 001 in the derby reach the multi regression equations explain more than 81 of the variability in seepage p 0 001 for the fernley reach correlations between estimates were much more variable with a range of r2 between 0 62 and 0 95 p 0 001 there were limited groundwater wells within the vicinity of the tc to account for fluctuating groundwater levels on seepage rates at site 6 the multi regression equation needed to account for the effect of changing groundwater elevations on seepage flux using stage and groundwater level data the horizontal hydraulic gradient between the canal and an existing monitoring well a distance of 8 7 m from the edge of the canal was included in the multi regression equation including the horizontal gradient in the regression equation improved the correlation r2 from 0 53 to 0 85 in the lahontan reach the multi regressions with stage and temperature explain more than 95 of the variability in seepage p 0 001 time series comparison between seepage fluxes estimated by vs2dhi and multi regression for site 1 site 8 and site 14 are shown in fig 8 overall the regression models match reasonably well to the seasonal and daily seepage estimates from vs2dhi at site 1 and site 14 however at site 8 the multi regression equation matched the seasonal variation but did not replicate the large daily variations caused by stage fluctuations and lateral losses into embankment soils as such the regression equations describing fluxes at site 8 had the highest error between losses estimated with vs2dhi r2 0 62 p 0 001 rmse 0 29 m3d 1m 1 the effects of groundwater elevation and temperature on seepage rates were influential at the fernley reach site 6 fig 9 shows the variations in groundwater elevation in response to recharge from canal seepage and subsequent declines likely due to groundwater pumping during the period between april to july stage in the canal remained relatively constant with 0 8 m of variation during the early wetting up period april to may the average seepage rates were 1 8 m3d 1m 1 the seepage rates decreased to a minimum of 0 8 m3d 1m 1 during a period when groundwater elevations reached the bottom elevation of the canal the rapid variations in groundwater elevations could be attributed to groundwater pumping the overall increasing trend in seepage is attributed to the effect of temperature resulting in a 213 increase in rates the groundwater elevation decreased below the screen interval of the well for the remaining period beyond june 5 2018 5 discussion 5 1 operational seepage monitoring the purpose of this study was to use field data and numerical seepage models to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of seepage rates during canal operations seepage models were used to derive regression equations based on stage and temperature with one transect model including hydraulic gradient the numerical models provide estimates of seepage flux and volumetric loss per unit length of canal accounting for variations in hydraulic and thermal properties of canal sediments to utilize the seepage information gained from the numerical models the regressions equations provide seepage estimates that can be made from future observations of canal stage and temperature regression equations are necessary because canal seepage will vary from year to year depending on water availability and canal operations regression equations were derived the numerical models estimates for the full range of canal stage and seasonal variation in temperatures the existing monitoring infrastructure in the tc provide unique opportunities for automating seepage estimates during canal operations the use of sediment temperatures for estimating fluid flux is advantageous because temperature based estimates are sensitive to changes in infiltration caused by siltation erosion and streambed clogging schmidt et al 2014 demonstrated the use sediment temperatures along with analytical equations for automated vertical fluid flux estimation and provided workflow for translating field data to online accessible fluid rates this study uses similar datasets to develop seepage relationships for total flux vertical and lateral as well as account for hydraulic connectivity to groundwater results of this study highlight the importance of temperature in seasonal variations in seepage flux and volumetric losses seepage rates are influenced by the temperature dependent viscosity of water e g rosenberry et al 2021 constantz 2008 ronan et al 1998 constantz et al 1994 jaynes 1990 levy et al 1989 robinson and rohwer 1959 as reported by constantz et al 1994 the hydraulic conductivity doubles within an increase in temperatures from 0 0 c to 25 c and for typical diurnal variations of 10 c from a mean of 15 c an increase of 30 in seepage rates would be expected in the modeling approach applied on the tc we observed variations between 4 0 and 26 0 c in temperature and seepage rates seasonally varied with temperatures from a practical standpoint future implementation of the regression equations can be applied given that stage and temperature are actively being measured this would involve a separate regression of temperature measured at the sediment water interface 0 0 m with canal water temperature measured with existing sensors to input the sediment temperature in the seepage equations regression equations provide a simple and effective tool in seepage estimation salmasi and abraham 2020 hosseinzadeh et al 2020 the regression equations based on numerical seepage models account for differences in soil hydraulic and thermal properties governing vertical and lateral seepage with site specific information for each transect additional groundwater data are needed to refine the seepage estimates along the canal where water table fluctuation influenced seepage rates prior to this study the truckee canal was assumed to be hydraulically disconnected from the shallow aquifer epstein et al 2007 shanafield et al 2014 the findings presented from this study indicate the canal and shallow aquifer may transition between being hydraulically connected and disconnected within an irrigation season along sections of canal given the distance between transects it is uncertain to what spatial and temporal extent groundwater levels may influence seepage further work is needed to examine the implications of these transitions in hydraulic connectivity to reach scale volumetric losses 5 2 previous seepage investigations on the truckee canal previous seepage investigations on the tc focused on annual volumetric losses using inflow outflow heat as a tracer ponding experiments and modeling at varying spatial and temporal scales van denburgh et al 1973 mihevc et al 2002 shanafield et al 2014 to guide comparisons among different methods seepage loss for the 27 km reach between the usgs gages at wadsworth and hazen are discussed seepage losses estimated for this length of the fernley and lahontan reaches were similar during 2018 and 2019 with annual rates of 1 1 10 2 km3 yr 1 8 889 acre ftyr 1 and 1 0 10 2 km3 yr 1 7 992 acre ft yr 1 respectively table 4 seepage losses as a percentage of inflows during 2018 and 2019 at wadsworth were 32 and 41 respectively seepage losses estimated by inflow outflow measurements between the gages were done as a part of a 1970 s reconnaissance study for the truckee river basin van denburgh et al 1973 van denburgh and arteaga 1985 accounting for diversions van dengburgh and arteaga 1985 estimated 3 0 10 2 km3yr 1 24 000 acre ft yr 1 for the period of 1968 to 1978 during this period inflows to the usgs gage at wadsworth averaged 0 25 km3yr 1 and as a percentage seepage losses for this section were 22 of the inflow volume nowlin 1987 estimated seepage rates from 1979 to 1980 for the same length of canal an average of 3 0 10 2 km3yr 1 24 000 acre ft yr 1 with inflows at the usgs gage wadsworth measured at 0 23 km3yr 1 the seepage loss represented 13 of the inflow volume annual seepage estimates were made by pohll et al 2001 using a 20 year inflow period 1969 to 1995 to refine a regional groundwater flow model of the fernley area a developed regression based on measured annual average inflow volume predicted seepage rates to range between 1 6 x10 2 to 4 9 x10 2 km3yr 1 13 352 to 40 057 acre ft yr 1 an investigation by mihevc et al 2002 along a 11 km section of the fernley reach was approached using heat as a tracer quantified along two dimensional transects at 6 study sites the seepage rates ranged from 1 0 x10 4 to 8 5 10 3 km3yr 1 with an inflow volume of 0 15 km3yr 1 the seepage estimates were 3 3 10 2 km3 yr 1 26 954 acre ft yr 1 or 22 of the inflow mihevc et al 2002 shanafield et al 2014 applied the diffusion wave approach on a 6 4 km section of the fernley reach and found seepage flux estimates to be consistent with mihevc et al 2002 at transect sites applying the shanafield et al 2014 regression with the average inflow during 2018 and 2019 of 1 9 m3s 1 inflow results in an estimated seepage loss is 1 5 10 2 km3yr 1 12 480 acre ft yr 1 or about 53 of the average inflow volumetric losses estimated by reclamation during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons by inflow outflow from usgs gages measured diversions and unmetered estimates of lateral diversions were 1 4 10 2 km3yr 1 11 698 acre ft and 1 2 10 2 km3yr 1 9 744 acre ft or 45 and 50 of the inflows at wadsworth reclamation 2019 2020 differences in volumetric seepage loss reported for the tc can be attributed to differences in methodology assumptions timeframe inflow rates and changes in canal operations for example during the mihevc et al 2002 study inflow at wadsworth were 78 lower than what was observed in 2018 this difference in inflow may contribute to the 67 reduction in estimated seepage losses for the wadsworth to hazen reach results of our study provide new information for the derby and lahontan reaches where seepage has not been studied and identified a section of canal where groundwater may influence rates within the fernley reach in previous studies the influence of groundwater on seepage rates were not accounted for 5 3 management considerations for water managers planning accurate conveyance of water in canals involves making predictions of seepage losses this investigation provides insights into the influence of temperature on seepage rates that could be used to improve canal operations and improve conveyance efficiency for example canal operations could be optimized during seasonally cooler temperatures to reduce seepage losses hydraulic connectivity between canal flow and groundwater were shown to seasonally vary in the presence of water level fluctuations and declines in these conditions spatial and temporal data are needed to identify reaches where the water table may influence seasonal seepage rates considerations for reduction of seepage losses through engineering approaches are effective means of reducing losses understanding where high seepage occurs minimizing losses and improvements to conveyance can be accomplished by canal lining reclamation 1976 low cost options such as compacted earth lining can be an effective means to reducing rates of seepage burt et al 2010 reported 86 to 90 reduction in seepage losses when the sides and bottom of the canal were treated by compaction and measured by ponded infiltration test numerical modeling by el molla and el molla 2021 estimated 99 8 seepage reduction through compaction combining compaction with clay lining can also prove effective in reducing seepage rates yao et al 2012 the use of synthetic and concrete materials may be successful for reductions of seepage but can be costly and deteriorate over time han et al 2021 reductions of seepage through lining improves conveyance but can also have unintended impacts on water levels and domestic use meijer et al 2006 compacted earth lining along embankment could be a viable low cost option to reduce seepage losses where coarse bank sediments are contributing to high lateral seepage managing water resources in arid environments is complicated but critical for the sustainability of water use in the western united states this study quantified seepage losses in a large irrigation canal using two dimensional numerical models calibrated with field data the model simulations were used to develop regression equations to be applied in managing and forecasting water deliveries the numerical models demonstrate the need to account for temperature effects on canal conveyance regression equations compare reasonably well with numerical models and can be easily applied within the framework of existing stage and temperature monitoring in the presence of contrasting hydraulic properties of embankment sediments simple regression equations may be problematic in predicting seepage with substantial variations in stage 6 conclusions this study shows that estimates of seepage rates and volumetric losses over an irrigation season are improved by inclusion of the dependence of temperature variations in stage and connectivity to groundwater the field data and numerical models were used to derive hydraulic thermal properties of canal sediments represented by soil zones to estimate vertical and lateral seepage rates transects with high seepage can be managed through embankment compaction or lining the numerical models used for each transect were derived from parsimony accounting for near surface siltation and the groundwater table data where available segregating the modelling approach into calibration and validation periods allowed confirmation of estimated parameters and recalibration of a transect affected by siltation during canal operations lateral seepage rates can fluctuate widely through embankment materials with high contrast in hydraulic conductivity the numerical models demonstrate the importance of accounting for seasonal temperature changes on seepage rates and seasonal volume estimates more than half the time of operation the tc exhibits shallow sediment temperatures within the 10 to 25 c during these periods seepage rates can increase by nearly 50 over periods of operation when temperatures are below 10 c this case study integrated field data and models to provide simple relationships to be implemented with field data collected from the canal for routine operations applying the regression models with canal operations data can provide real time estimates of seepage rates for improved accounting of water conveyance periodic updating of regressions maybe necessary if hydraulic or thermal properties of canal sediments change substantially from validated seepage models the use of heat as a groundwater tracer continues to be a reliable approach for quantifying seepage rates and this approach would be valid for developing and updating regression equations further refinements of transect scale seepage rates to reach scale volumetric losses can be made using ground based geophysics lindenbach et al 2021 efficient use of surface water diverted from the truckee river for irrigation will be beneficial for farmers and the lower truckee river system to pyramid lake the data collected from this study will

2322,quantifying seepage losses from unlined irrigation canals is necessary to improve water use and conservation the use of heat as a tracer is widely used in quantifying seepage rates across the sediment water interface in this study field observations and two dimensional numerical models were used to simulate seepage losses during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation season in the truckee canal system nineteen transects were instrumented with temperature probes and stage recording devices for inverse modeling to derive seepage flux and volumetric losses over the 39 km length of canal the numerical models for each transect were calibrated and validated using the two year dataset soil zones and observation data were used in each numerical model to help guide calibration of vertical and lateral heat and fluid fluxes model simulations were used to derive multivariable regression equations that consider stage temperature and hydraulic gradient the results demonstrate the value of long term datasets that illustrate the seasonality of groundwater levels siltation stage and temperature on seepage rates seepage rates estimated by the numerical models range from 0 16 to 4 6 m3 d m 1 total annual volumetric losses estimated for 2018 and 2019 were 1 6 10 2 to 1 2 10 2 km3 respectively the seepage losses estimated by this study account for 32 to 41 of the inflow volumes regression models were able to reproduce seepage time series simulated by the numerical models reasonably well in arid environments water diverted into irrigation canals may be influenced by seasonal variations in temperature sufficient to influence the water accounting of conveyed surface flows data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the united states agricultural irrigation is a major use of ground and surface water accounting for 42 percent of the nation s total freshwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 in arid environments the reliance on irrigation from surface water within watersheds that are highly susceptible to climate variability poses major challenges in managing water resources usgcrp 2017 given these challenges irrigation canals are important for inter basin transfer of surface water to agricultural areas and reservoirs within watersheds that are water limited and may not receive sustainable water naturally water scarcity is driving the need to improve understanding of flows and fluxes within agricultural areas to improve sustainability and efficiency of water resources steduto et al 2012 climate change is contributing to already mounting pressures to conserve water resources to maintain economic and environmental benefits sterle et al 2020 irrigation canals used for conveyance of water for agriculture represent an evolving challenge for managers there is a general recognition that improvements in conveyance efficiency are needed to better manage water resources lindenbach et al 2021 seepage losses from unlined canals can represent substantial inefficiencies in surface water conveyance accounting for 15 to 50 percent of the total diverted volume van der leen et al 1990 kacimov 1992 sharma and chawla 1979 requiring more water to be diverted to meet irrigation demand the volume of water diverted for agriculture can result in substantial declines in streamflow that may result in water quality and ecosystems impacts wurtsbaugh et al 2017 scanlon et al 2007 chen et al 2003 scoppettone et al 1986 improvements in conveyance efficiency are a critical resource management objective to conserve water and ensure farmers receive their permitted water allocations canal maintenance and lining projects are a means to increase conveyance efficiency and reduce seepage but may have unintended consequences seepage contributes to aquifer recharge that can be recovered for further agriculture or domestic use as such in some communities there is a reliance on recharge from canals for domestic water use or for continued agricultural use by groundwater pumping arumí et al 2009 fernald and guldan 2006 recharge from irrigation canals can also provide water quality benefits and restore depleted aquifers thodal and tumbusch 2006 pohll et al 2001 aquifer recharge from irrigation canals is often included as an important component within regional studies given the spatial extent of canal networks and quantity of water supplied arumí et al 2009 maurer 2002 pohll et al 2001 irrigation canals can also serve important secondary purposes to provide ecosystem services carlson et al 2019 fleming et al 2014 reduce flood peaks during spring runoff fernald and guldan 2006 and restore declines in aquifer storage for managed aquifer recharge niswonger et al 2017 agricultural water is multifunctional and plays a critical role in rural community livelihood cultural heritage and identity water management decisions may need to consider a more diverse set of integrated benefits canals provide groenfeldt 2006 canal seepage losses are governed by hydraulic properties of sediments canal geometry stage and the hydraulic gradient between surface flows with the underlying aquifer bouwer 1965 robinson and rohwer 1959 the presence of low permeability sediments at the base of and beneath the canals influences the rates and direction of seepage wachyan and uston 1987 yao et al 2012 other factors that influence rates are sediment temperatures periods of operation wet dry cycles and canal maintenance removing vegetation and fine sediments to improve conveyance naranjo and smith 2016 in the presence of near surface clogging seepage can become drastically reduced settling of fine sediments can be mediated by both physical and biotic factors leading to seasonably variable seepage rates rosenberry et al 2021 naranjo and smith 2016 quantifying the rate and locations of seepage can be challenging due to spatial variations of canal characteristics and temporal variability of operations traditional direct methods such as ponding methods seepage meters and inflow outflow measurements have been used widely batlle aguilar and cook 2012 alam and bhutta 2004 robinson and rohwer 1959 warnick 1951 these approaches are generally considered suitable for many systems but have practical limitations ponding methods require controlled measurements of stage decline between sections of a diked reach causing disruptions to water operations seepage meters have been used for several decades and are an efficient method to obtain discrete seepage measurements at multiple locations for both losing and gaining sections of canals drawbacks include the need for multiple deployments to obtain seepage rates during different stage conditions and may be challenging or impractical in unwadable conditions or in canals with high stage variability rosenberry et al 2020 seepage losses made from inflow outflow or differential discharge measurements are reliable when losses are greater than discharge measurement uncertainty and canal flow is maintained at steady state conditions acoustic doppler current profilers adcp are better suited for discharge as measurement uncertainty is reduced martin and gates 2014 kinzli et al 2010 surface geophysical methods can be a viable indirect tool for mapping long sections of canals to identify potentially high seepage rates hobza and andersen 2010 used resistivity surveys on 84 km of canals in nebraska to determine contrasting lithologies to a depth of 8 m below land surface to better understand spatial variations in seepage additional field observations such as sediment descriptions electrical conductivity logs and seepage meters are combined with electrical conductivity inverse of resistivity to estimate seepage loss hobza and andersen 2010 hotchiss et al 2001 a key limitation to traditional approaches is the inability to account for variations of losses during canal operations and over the duration of the entire irrigation season heat as a tracer has been widely used for estimated fluxes between surface water and groundwater at variable time and spatial scales e g schilling et al 2019 rau et al 2014 constantz et al 2008 andersen 2006 stonestrom and constantz 2003 this approach can also be used to quantify the effects of scour and siltation on seepage rates by evaluating the changes in thermal gradients over time naranjo and smith 2016 tonina et al 2014 in addition to seepage estimates identifying large scale sections of a canal where groundwater discharge is present can also be made from distributed fiber optic temperature sensing selker et al 2006 briggs et al 2011 sebok et al 2013 recent advancements in processing programs are available to automate processing of temperature time series and calculate vertical seepage flux such as ex stream swanson and cardenas 2011 and vflux gordon et al 2012 integrating temperature observations into fully coupled surface and groundwater models provide insight in hydrogeological constraints brookfield et al 2009 engeler et al 2011 continuous observations of sediment temperatures can be used to estimate early infiltration rates or in the case of lateral canals periods of flow and no flow and variations in flux caused by stage conditions karan et al 2014 the heat as a tracer approach for canal seepage estimation can provide seepage or loss rates during managed canal operation through embankment sediments and during periods of hydraulic disconnection with the aquifer naranjo and smith 2016 hobza and andersen 2010 shanafield et al 2010 mihevc et al 2002 the consideration of seasonal effects such as episodic deposition and erosion water table fluctuations sediment clogging and temperature effects are becoming increasingly important in quantifying seepage rates but rarely are considered rosenberry et al 2021 our primary objective in this study was to use field data and numerical seepage models to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of seepage rates during operation of the truckee canal nevada in this project we measured subsurface temperatures canal stage and groundwater levels to calibrate and validate parameters used in the numerical seepage models during a two year period of canal operations multivariable regression models were developed from numerical models to provide seepage equations to be applied with field data for future canal operations 2 study area the truckee canal tc conveys water from the derby dam on the truckee river to lahontan reservoir within the carson river basin fig 1 the construction of the tc occurred in 1903 and was the first u s bureau of reclamation reclamation project in the united states townley 1977 the tc is roughly trapezoidal in geometry and is operated and managed in three major reaches derby reach 16 km fernley reach 18 km and lahontan reach 16 km approximately 42 km of the canal is unlined with earthen embankments and is gaged by the u s geological survey usgs at two locations the truckee canal at wadsworth usgs 10351650 nevada and at the truckee canal near hazen nevada usgs 10351400 usgs 2018 during the last century diversions into the tc and other upstream

threatened lahontan cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi scoppettone et al 1986 since 1997 several operating criteria and procedures ocap for the newlands reclamation project have been established to regulate the timing and amount of water that can be diverted out of the truckee river to serve water rights minimize the use of truckee river and maximize the use of the carson river ocap 1997 the truckee river operating agreement troa coordinates the operation of upstream reservoirs and provide additional storage to benefit instream flows reduce the declining water levels of pyramid lake and improve water quality in the lower truckee river troa 2008 the tc was originally designed to convey up to 43 m3s 1 however in recent decades of operation the canal has rarely conveyed more than 21 m3s 1 in 2008 a section of the fernley reach breached causing flooding and property damage since this failure the tc has been operated under reduced flows to limit risk of future failure with a maximum flow of 10 m3s 1 reclamation 2015b during 2018 and 2019 an average inflow of approximately 2 m3s 1 was measured at the usgs gage at wadsworth usgs 10 351 650 truckee river at wadsworth

overlying alluvium and lakebed sediments are present downgradient of the usgs gage at wadsworth and throughout the fernley and lahontan reaches reclamation 2015b 2015c lakebed sediments consist of a horizontally bedded sequence of clay silt and sand with claystone and siltstone deposits formed by paleo lake lahontan benson 1981 the climate where the tc is located is considered arid and lies in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada where the average annual precipitation is 119 mm most of which occurs in the surrounding mountains during the winter moffet et al 2019 thodal and tumbusch 2006 daily high temperatures during summer months are warm normally ranging from 27 c to 32 c and can exceed 38 c moffet et al 2019 average monthly air temperatures fernley area range from 3 1 c to 20 c 2

to the truckee river in this reach the tc intersects numerous narrow ephemeral drainages that once flowed to the southern slope of the truckee river canyon the tc was excavated into an existing hillslope with the sediment material used to construct the left embankment facing downstream the left embankment ranges in height from 1 5 to 15 0 m reclamation 2015a boreholes drilled for geological investigations encountered groundwater at a depth greater than 3 0 m below the base of the tc while the tc was dry five seepage sites in the derby reach were selected to be collocated with seeps identified along the left outer embankment the presence of seeps on the outer embankment are expressed as visible flowing or ponded water seepage sites 1 3 were selected in 2018 and sites 0 5 and 2 5 were added in 2019 fig 1 the upstream most site within this reach site 0 5 was located 2 7 km downstream of derby dam at the end of the reach site 3 was located 0 26 km from the usgs gage at wadsworth the average bottom width of seepage sites on the derby reach was 5 4 m with an average of embankment slope vertical to horizontal of 1 2 5 2 2 the fernley reach the fernley reach is 18 km and trends southeast through gently sloping terrain along the edge of the city of fernley several seepage and geologic investigations have been done in this reach to address water resource and safety concerns reclamation 2015b shanafield et al 2014 mihevc et al 2002 pohll et al 2001 van denburgh and arteaga 1985 the tc in the fernley reach has been breached at least nine times with the most recent occurring in 2008 reclamation 2015b improvements to the sections of canal where historic breaches occurred widened the tc stabilized the banks and fine sediments were placed at the bottom of the tc to reduce seepage rates flows entering this reach are measured at the usgs wadsworth gage and there are nine lateral canals with three gate structures or checks that control the canal stage for diversions into lateral ditches there were eight seepage sites selected in this reach at an average distance interval of 2 2 km co located with seeps and located up gradient of gate structures seepage sites 4 9 were selected in 2018 and 3 5 and 9 5 were added in 2019 fig 1 site 6 was located near a monitoring well that was included in the monitoring effort the average bottom width of seepage sites in the fernley reach was 4 3 m with an average vertical to horizontal side slope of 1 3 4 2 3 the lahontan reach the lahontan reach is 16 km and trends southeast to southwest mostly across gently sloping terrain to the terminus of lahontan reservoir in the carson river basin flows in this reach are measured at the usgs gage near hazen usgs 10351400 near a gate structure that controls flow into lahontan reservoir and a lateral canal canal sediments and embankment materials consist of a heterogenous mixture of sandy silts and silty sand derived from lakebed sediments excavated during canal construction reclamation 2015c the tc also flows through sections of alluvial and volcanic deposits with loamy sand through cobble size sediments groundwater was encountered approximately 5 0 m below the base of the tc perched above layers of low permeable lakebed sediments and volcanic rock while the canal was dry reclamation 2015c there were 6 seepage sites selected in this reach at an average distance interval of 1 9 km co located with seeps and located up gradient of gate structures fig 1 the last seepage site site 15 was located 250 m down gradient of the usgs gage near hazen the average bottom width of sites on the lahontan reach was 6 3 m with an average of vertical to horizontal side slope of 1 3 0 3 methods 3 1 field methods equipment deployed at each seepage site was used to characterize vertical and lateral seepage by focusing sensor placement near the sediment water interface at the bottom and sides of the canal two temperature probes naranjo and turcotte 2015 were installed in the bottom of the channel at each transect fig 2 each probe contained temperature sensors spaced at 0 10 20 50 75 and 100 cm beneath the sediment water interface at the canal invert a 2 54 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc piezometer was driven 2 3 m below the ground surface along the left bank in the canal access road only one piezometer was installed given access to download data from the right side of the canal during operations was impractical a screen length of 10 cm was located 5 cm from the bottom of the piezometers to monitor the potential for rising water tables however given the depth to water and side slope of embankment material piezometers driven with hand tools were not able to reach the groundwater table three to four temperature sensors ibcods type z alpha mach inc were strung inside the piezometer at evenly spaced depths ranging from 10 to 40 cm apart the upper most temperature sensor ibcod type g alpha mach inc was placed 10 20 cm below the surface to measure land surface temperatures temperature data were recorded at one hour intervals and retrieved from the loggers monthly prior to deployment of equipment the temperature sensors were independently calibrated in a water bath utilizing a 5 point linear regression to validate raw temperature readings accuracy of the sensors after calibration is within 0 1 c naranjo and turcotte 2015 canal stage is monitored by truckee carson irrigation district and reclamation at 12 seepage sites along the tc the remaining 7 sites were instrumented with pressure transducers td divers van essen instruments deployed near the canal bottom to capture the low flow stage but close enough to the edge of water to manually measure stage at monthly intervals stage as discussed herein is defined as the head or height of water above the bottom of the canal stage was recorded every hour and manual water level measurements taken monthly were used to verify and correct pressure transducer derived water level measurements sauer and turnipseed 2010 the accuracy of the pressure transducer measurements is 2 0 cm with a resolution of 0 2 cm the temperature readings have an accuracy of 0 2 c and a resolution of 0 01 c the tc is generally considered hydraulically disconnected from the saturated aquifer and is characterized as a losing system however groundwater may mound above low permeable lakebed sediments and contribute to perched aquifers with recharge from the tc to measure the influence of changing water levels on seepage rates pressure transducers and temperature sensors were installed in existing monitoring wells at site 2 and site 6 during the deployment of sensors in april 2018 the wells were dry elevation data for each cross section monitoring well bank piezometer and temperature probe were obtained through rtk gnss survey techniques rydlund and densmore 2012 soil cores 3 2 cm diameter were collected from the bottom of the channel to a depth of 61 cm to provide visual descriptions of the soil profile and to identify confining or low permeable deposits near the surface thermal conductivity was measured monthly along the saturated embankment sediments using a handheld thermal conductivity probe kd2 pro decagon observations taken from bottom sediments were not possible while the canal was in operation values obtained from discrete measurements were used to set the range in values of thermal conductivity at saturation for model calibration 3 2 numerical methods seepage was numerically simulated for each of the 19 transects using the variably saturated two dimensional hydraulic model vs2dhi hsieh et al 2000 healy and ronan 1996 vs2dhi is a finite difference model that uses the richard s equation for variably saturated flow and the energy transport equation to simulate the change in thermal storage as a function of thermal conduction dispersion and convection healy and ronan 1996 groundwater flow simulated by the model accounts for temperature dependency of viscosity within the hydraulic conductivity term healy and ronan 1996 k ρgk μ t 1 where ρ is density in kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity in m s2 k is the intrinsic permeability in m2 and μ is viscosity in ns m2 as a function of temperature t viscosity is calculated empirically kipp 1987 μ t 2 4 105 10 247 8 t 133 16 2 two dimensional 2d seepage models were created for each transect by defining the cross sectional representation of the canal soils initial conditions boundary conditions and locations of observations in the graphical processor vs2dhi hsieh et al 2000 fig 2 soil thermal and hydraulic properties were defined by soil zone polygons fig 2b the sediments near the sediment water interface with the greatest variations in temperature and were represented by three zones zone 1 3 soil zone 4 was used to describe subsurface properties important for simulating lateral flow away from the canal soil zone 5 was used at transects where borehole data indicated volcanic or lakebed sediments were present not shown in fig 2 see naranjo et al 2023 and supplemental data figure si 1 the 2d conceptual model assumes the bottom canal sediments are represented by a uniform clogging layer naranjo and smith 2016 however the parameter estimation calibration technique pest welter et al 2015 could confirm the presence or absence of surface clogging layers by matching near surface temperature observations 0 10 to 0 20 cm depths that are very sensitive to soil hydraulic conductivity as such low amplitude temperature signals measured near the surface would be indicative of heat conduction due to low permeable sediments whereas high amplitude signals would be indicative of heat advection due to high permeable sediments the two temperature probes were used to estimate parameters in zones 1 2 and 4 fig 2b the near surface canal embankment materials were defined by soil zone 3 and assumed to represent both sides of the canal ten temperature observations were used to calibrate the models for estimation of vertical seepage zones 1 2 and 4 three to four temperature observations collected in the embankment sediments were used to calibrate each model for estimation of lateral seepage zone 3 a variable temperature boundary condition representing soil temperatures were specified at the upper boundary of the model stage and temperature measured at the sediment water interface 0 cm depth along the wetted perimeter were specified as a variable head and temperatures boundary condition lateral vertical boundary conditions were defined as no flow and positioned away from influence on subsurface flow at sites 2 and 6 groundwater levels measured in monitoring wells were used to define the bottom and both lateral boundaries the 2d seepage models were defined by the surveyed cross section that included bottom width side slope and embankment sediments the model grids were refined near the canal boundary and temperature observations grid spacing between 0 01 and 3 0 m was used in the horizontal direction and between 0 01 and 1 m in the vertical direction with coarser grid spacing further away from the observations and wetted perimeter the width and depth of the model domain varied for each model to avoid boundary condition edge effects on the simulations the models extent in the horizontal and vertical direction varied between 80 and 200 m and 15 and 40 m respectively the vertical sides of the models were specified as no flow boundaries the lower horizontal boundary of the model was specified as gravity drainage in transects where the canal was hydraulically connected to groundwater the lateral and bottom horizontal boundary conditions was specified as variable head boundary condition initial conditions specified for each model were initial moisture content and sediment temperatures the initial moisture contents among the different cross sectional models were assumed to range between 0 05 to 0 15 m3 m3 for the zones near the sediment water interface the initial temperature for each model was based on interpolation of the observed temperature measurements at the start of the simulation for the entire model domain 3 3 model calibration the parameter estimation model pest welter et al 2015 was used to calibrate each transect model by adjusting hydraulic and thermal properties to match observed temperatures pest is an independent object oriented parameter estimation code that executes the vs2dhi model and adjusts the parameters using the gauss marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm by comparing the simulated temperatures to the observed through a weighted least squares objective function pest allows the use of observation and time varying weights to give greater importance to data points or specific behaviors in the data such as daily fluctuations of temperature temperatures near the daily minimum and maximum were given a weight of 1 to emphasize amplitude variations all other temperatures were given zero weight focusing on the amplitude variations yield model simulations that are more representative of field data and directly relate to the hydraulic and thermal properties of the soils naranjo and smith 2016 arrays of time varying weights were created using the first observation 0 0 m in the center of canal with series see v1 12 halford et al 2012 using the period function soil property values that were not estimated were assigned based on values reported in carsel and parrish 1988 for general soil textural classifications provided in vs2dhi parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity thermal conductivity porosity and heat capacity are among the most sensitive to temperature simulations naranjo and smith 2016 however the saturated hydraulic conductivity predominantly influences seepage rates lapham 1989 constantz 2008 naranjo and smith 2016 the parameter values and ranges used in pest are provided in table 1 the estimated parameters in each transect model were saturated hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction kh thermal conductivity at saturation kts and volumetric heat capacity of sediments cs the ratio of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the vertical to horizontal direction anisotropy was assumed to be 0 1 for canal sediments and 0 01 for subsurface lakebed and volcanic sediments performance of each model was evaluated during calibration and validation periods model calibration was based on 2 500 h of sediment temperature and stage data measured after the canal stage was relatively stable and seasonal variability in canal water temperature ranged between 10 c and 25 c may to august the model parameters determined during calibration were then validated by evaluating each model s performance for the irrigation season march to november into the subsequent year model performance was measured by the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated temperatures for each sensor location separately and for all observations differences between observed and simulated temperatures rmse were examined within the validation period to determine whether recalibration was necessary for the following year validation rmse values that are different from calibration rmse values of more than 1 0 c are typically caused by changes in hydraulic and thermal properties due to siltation or scour naranjo and smith 2016 siltation reduces infiltration by reducing the porosity and hydraulic conductivity thereby dampening the amplitude of the temperature signal imparted by canal seepage beneath the surface scour events can rapidly remove deposited silt layers and decrease the thermal gradients sebok et al 2015 this effect is distinguishable by the similarity in temperature in observations with respect to depth within a profile tonina et al 2014 deweese et al 2017 thus using observational data for model validation can provide insight into potentially time varying hydraulic and thermal properties naranjo and smith 2016 increases in model rmse calculated for all observations between calibration and validation periods to a maximum of 0 5 c were considered acceptable seepage loss regressions for the tc need to account for the range in stage conditions during normal operations of the canal additional transect models herein defined as max stage were developed to simulate seepage losses at the maximum operational stage numerical model seepage predictions for 2018 2019 and max stage were then used to develop regressions models that would account for range in temperature and stage conditions for each transect model a new boundary condition was developed by increasing the observed stage by a factor until the average stage condition was at the maximum operational stage of the canal by using a factor the daily and seasonal variation in stage was preserved the temperature boundary condition within the canal was assumed to be consistent with daily and seasonal variation observed at 0 0 m depth during 2018 or 2019 for each transect model 4 results the numerical models were used to simulate seepage losses along transects during operation of the truckee canal during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons naranjo et al 2023 multivariable regression equations were then developed from numerical models for each transect the numerical model output and regression model are presented as total seepage flux in vertical and lateral directions across the wetted canal surface the results described in this section demonstrate the use of temperature and stage observations to calibrate numerical models for brevity a transect model from each reach is discussed the reader is referred to naranjo et al 2023 for further description of models observation data and calibration results 4 1 numerical model performance the calculated overall rmse for all observations at each transect for the calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 2 during the calibration period typically may to august see naranjo et al 2023 for simulation periods the models performed reasonably well with overall rmse values ranging from 0 34 c to 0 76 c during the validation periods for 2018 and 2019 march to november the overall rmse values ranged from 0 33 to 0 99 c at site 3 the overall rmse computed for the 2018 validation period was substantially greater than the 0 5 c criteria and required re calibration with temperature data from 2019 the re calibrated 2019 model performed reasonably well with an overall rmse of 0 76 c a difference of 0 14 c compared to the calibration results of 2018 re calibration of the model was done manually by reducing kh until simulated temperatures in 2019 were within agreement with observation data and the rmse was within the threshold of 0 5 c of the 2018 calibration model the changes in kh at this transect were likely caused by localized siltation as other transect models were not affected stage measured at site 1 varied from 0 2 m to 1 4 m with large variations occurring during the initial 1 500 hrs and final 100 hrs of operation fig 3 seasonal temperature variations observed at 0 1 m varied from 5 4 to 25 5 c during the remainder of 2018 march to november naranjo et al 2023 model simulations match the daily amplitudes in the shallow observations near the sediment water interface as well as the seasonal variation in heat transport in the deeper observations overall rmse 0 63 c during the early validation period 0 to 200 hrs the model underestimates the large variations in thermal patterns at all depths as flow in the canal starts and during initially dry soil the canal stage was significantly more variable at transects located upgradient of the gate structures used to divert water to lateral canals additionally transects at these locations also recorded higher stages during water delivery to the laterals fig 4 shows the stage conditions at site 8 in the fernley reach where the stage varied from 1 8 to 2 7 m during 2018 march to november seasonal variation in temperatures observed at 0 1 m depth was 4 1 to 26 4 c at this transect the daily temperature variations at 0 10 m depth were dampened compared to site 1 with approximately 1 0 c in variation overall the model simulates the general behavior during the may to august calibration 2018 period overall rmse 0 40 c with greater deviation from the observations occurring during the april to november 2018 validation period 4 500 5 000 hrs at the 0 75 and 1 0 m depths overall rmse 0 62 c the stage at site 14 varied from 0 4 to 1 7 m during april to november 2018 as water was delivered to a lateral canal fig 5 during this period temperature at 0 10 m varied seasonally from 2 7 to 26 4 c larger daily variations were observed during calibration with the amplitude variations at 0 5 m the model simulates and captures the general behavior during the calibration period overall rmse 0 49 c with greater deviation from the observations occurring during the validation period 2 760 to 5 400 hrs at the 0 75 and 1 0 m depths overall rmse 0 52 c at sites 1 and 14 there are clear links between simulated seepage flux and observed sediment temperature fig 6 while it is apparent that variations in canal stage affect seepage when stage is relatively constant the seasonal fluxes are influenced by temperature the seasonal effect of temperature can be observed at site 1 with notable differences in seepage behavior from 2018 and 2019 fig 6b during 3 30 2018 to 7 2 2018 stage and simulated flux rapidly varied between 0 2 and 1 5 m and 0 7 to 4 4 m3d 1m 1 respectively fig 6b during 2019 the seasonal change in simulated flux corresponds to changes in observed temperature during 5 1 2019 to 8 15 2019 an average stage of 1 0 m was observed with a doubling 2 4 to 4 4 m3d 1m 1 of the simulated flux along with observed temperature 10 to 25 c in months following the peak in temperature august 2019 the simulated flux decreased from 4 2 to 2 0 m3d 1m 1 along with decreases in temperature from 26 0 to 5 0 c while stage was nearly constant at 1 2 m at site 8 in the fernley reach canal stage fluctuated between two contrasting hydraulic properties of soil zone 2 kh 0 15 mhr 1 and soil zone 3 kh 0 26 mhr 1 see naranjo et al 2023 figure si 1 and table 1 which resulted in rapidly changing seepage behavior fig 6d at site 8 lateral seepage through the embankment material is the dominant direction of flow at site 14 within the lahontan reach the seasonal change in stage during operations of the canal in 2018 and 2019 obscures the influence of temperature fig 6e f in 2018 seepage rates corresponded to the sediment temperature increase until the annual maximum temperature of 26 c on 7 16 2018 then declines to 13 6 on 10 12 2018 in 2019 seepage rates were responding to rapid changes in canal stage and temperature seasonal temperature declines 4 2 seepage flux and volume estimates the seepage flux and volumetric loss per unit length of canal estimated for each transect during the modeling period of 2018 and 2019 are shown in table 3 seepage flux estimated along the transects ranged from 0 2 to 4 6 m3d 1m 1 with an average across all transects of 1 5 m3d 1m 1 site 15 was located down gradient of a gate structure controlling nearly all the flow measured at the usgs gage at hazen usgs 10351400 an average of 0 2 m of canal stage was observed at this location during the period of monitoring the canal was dry for both years downgradient of site 15 the seepage flux estimated for each transect model was used to compute volumetric loss for each reach table 4 because seepage estimates could not be made for the entire 16 km lahontan reach to lahontan reservoir the volumetric losses were estimated for 10 3 km to the usgs gage at hazen site 14 the seepage fluxes per unit length of canal were assumed to represent the segment of canal between transects and summed over each reach the total volumetric losses for the 2018 and 2019 irrigation periods were 1 6 10 2 km3 12 737 acre ft and 1 2 x10 2 km3 9 497 acre ft respectively averaged over the 38 3 km distance from derby dam to the usgs gage at hazen the overall volumetric loss per unit length of canal was 4 2 10 4 km3 km 1 474 acre ft mi 1 and 3 0 x10 4 km3 km 1 351 acre ft mi 1 during 2018 and 2019 monitoring period respectively the seepage losses represent 32 to 41 of the inflow volume measured at the usgs gage at wadsworth usgs 10351650 4 3 multivariable regression regression equations that include stage and temperature to estimate seepage losses are necessary to account for seasonal variability the relationship between stage and sediment temperature at the sediment water interface 0 0 m and seepage loss for the range of conditions observed in 2018 2019 and for the maximum stage models are shown in fig 7 seepage rates were grouped by sediment temperatures low 10 c moderate 10 to 20 c and high greater than20 c at site 1 the simulated flux at 2 0 m stage for sediment temperatures 10 c was 4 0 m3d 1m 1 for sediment temperatures greater than 20 c the same stage condition would result in 38 increase in losses of 5 5 m3d 1m 1 for the same change in temperature and stage condition the increase in simulated seepage flux would be 23 2 4 to 3 0 m3d 1m 1 and 44 4 7 to 6 8 m3d 1m 1 at site 8 and site 14 respectively canal temperature increases from derby to lahontan at site 1 temperatures were in the low moderate and high ranges 13 54 and 32 of time respectively for comparison sediment temperatures were warmer 40 4 km further down the canal at site 14 with temperatures in the low moderate and high ranges 10 49 and 41 percent of the time respectively seepage flux derived from multivariable regression equations using observations of temperature stage and vs2dhi estimated seepage flux for each transect on the tc are summarized in table 5 regressions developed with stage and temperature have statistically significant p values p 0 001 in the derby reach the multi regression equations explain more than 81 of the variability in seepage p 0 001 for the fernley reach correlations between estimates were much more variable with a range of r2 between 0 62 and 0 95 p 0 001 there were limited groundwater wells within the vicinity of the tc to account for fluctuating groundwater levels on seepage rates at site 6 the multi regression equation needed to account for the effect of changing groundwater elevations on seepage flux using stage and groundwater level data the horizontal hydraulic gradient between the canal and an existing monitoring well a distance of 8 7 m from the edge of the canal was included in the multi regression equation including the horizontal gradient in the regression equation improved the correlation r2 from 0 53 to 0 85 in the lahontan reach the multi regressions with stage and temperature explain more than 95 of the variability in seepage p 0 001 time series comparison between seepage fluxes estimated by vs2dhi and multi regression for site 1 site 8 and site 14 are shown in fig 8 overall the regression models match reasonably well to the seasonal and daily seepage estimates from vs2dhi at site 1 and site 14 however at site 8 the multi regression equation matched the seasonal variation but did not replicate the large daily variations caused by stage fluctuations and lateral losses into embankment soils as such the regression equations describing fluxes at site 8 had the highest error between losses estimated with vs2dhi r2 0 62 p 0 001 rmse 0 29 m3d 1m 1 the effects of groundwater elevation and temperature on seepage rates were influential at the fernley reach site 6 fig 9 shows the variations in groundwater elevation in response to recharge from canal seepage and subsequent declines likely due to groundwater pumping during the period between april to july stage in the canal remained relatively constant with 0 8 m of variation during the early wetting up period april to may the average seepage rates were 1 8 m3d 1m 1 the seepage rates decreased to a minimum of 0 8 m3d 1m 1 during a period when groundwater elevations reached the bottom elevation of the canal the rapid variations in groundwater elevations could be attributed to groundwater pumping the overall increasing trend in seepage is attributed to the effect of temperature resulting in a 213 increase in rates the groundwater elevation decreased below the screen interval of the well for the remaining period beyond june 5 2018 5 discussion 5 1 operational seepage monitoring the purpose of this study was to use field data and numerical seepage models to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of seepage rates during canal operations seepage models were used to derive regression equations based on stage and temperature with one transect model including hydraulic gradient the numerical models provide estimates of seepage flux and volumetric loss per unit length of canal accounting for variations in hydraulic and thermal properties of canal sediments to utilize the seepage information gained from the numerical models the regressions equations provide seepage estimates that can be made from future observations of canal stage and temperature regression equations are necessary because canal seepage will vary from year to year depending on water availability and canal operations regression equations were derived the numerical models estimates for the full range of canal stage and seasonal variation in temperatures the existing monitoring infrastructure in the tc provide unique opportunities for automating seepage estimates during canal operations the use of sediment temperatures for estimating fluid flux is advantageous because temperature based estimates are sensitive to changes in infiltration caused by siltation erosion and streambed clogging schmidt et al 2014 demonstrated the use sediment temperatures along with analytical equations for automated vertical fluid flux estimation and provided workflow for translating field data to online accessible fluid rates this study uses similar datasets to develop seepage relationships for total flux vertical and lateral as well as account for hydraulic connectivity to groundwater results of this study highlight the importance of temperature in seasonal variations in seepage flux and volumetric losses seepage rates are influenced by the temperature dependent viscosity of water e g rosenberry et al 2021 constantz 2008 ronan et al 1998 constantz et al 1994 jaynes 1990 levy et al 1989 robinson and rohwer 1959 as reported by constantz et al 1994 the hydraulic conductivity doubles within an increase in temperatures from 0 0 c to 25 c and for typical diurnal variations of 10 c from a mean of 15 c an increase of 30 in seepage rates would be expected in the modeling approach applied on the tc we observed variations between 4 0 and 26 0 c in temperature and seepage rates seasonally varied with temperatures from a practical standpoint future implementation of the regression equations can be applied given that stage and temperature are actively being measured this would involve a separate regression of temperature measured at the sediment water interface 0 0 m with canal water temperature measured with existing sensors to input the sediment temperature in the seepage equations regression equations provide a simple and effective tool in seepage estimation salmasi and abraham 2020 hosseinzadeh et al 2020 the regression equations based on numerical seepage models account for differences in soil hydraulic and thermal properties governing vertical and lateral seepage with site specific information for each transect additional groundwater data are needed to refine the seepage estimates along the canal where water table fluctuation influenced seepage rates prior to this study the truckee canal was assumed to be hydraulically disconnected from the shallow aquifer epstein et al 2007 shanafield et al 2014 the findings presented from this study indicate the canal and shallow aquifer may transition between being hydraulically connected and disconnected within an irrigation season along sections of canal given the distance between transects it is uncertain to what spatial and temporal extent groundwater levels may influence seepage further work is needed to examine the implications of these transitions in hydraulic connectivity to reach scale volumetric losses 5 2 previous seepage investigations on the truckee canal previous seepage investigations on the tc focused on annual volumetric losses using inflow outflow heat as a tracer ponding experiments and modeling at varying spatial and temporal scales van denburgh et al 1973 mihevc et al 2002 shanafield et al 2014 to guide comparisons among different methods seepage loss for the 27 km reach between the usgs gages at wadsworth and hazen are discussed seepage losses estimated for this length of the fernley and lahontan reaches were similar during 2018 and 2019 with annual rates of 1 1 10 2 km3 yr 1 8 889 acre ftyr 1 and 1 0 10 2 km3 yr 1 7 992 acre ft yr 1 respectively table 4 seepage losses as a percentage of inflows during 2018 and 2019 at wadsworth were 32 and 41 respectively seepage losses estimated by inflow outflow measurements between the gages were done as a part of a 1970 s reconnaissance study for the truckee river basin van denburgh et al 1973 van denburgh and arteaga 1985 accounting for diversions van dengburgh and arteaga 1985 estimated 3 0 10 2 km3yr 1 24 000 acre ft yr 1 for the period of 1968 to 1978 during this period inflows to the usgs gage at wadsworth averaged 0 25 km3yr 1 and as a percentage seepage losses for this section were 22 of the inflow volume nowlin 1987 estimated seepage rates from 1979 to 1980 for the same length of canal an average of 3 0 10 2 km3yr 1 24 000 acre ft yr 1 with inflows at the usgs gage wadsworth measured at 0 23 km3yr 1 the seepage loss represented 13 of the inflow volume annual seepage estimates were made by pohll et al 2001 using a 20 year inflow period 1969 to 1995 to refine a regional groundwater flow model of the fernley area a developed regression based on measured annual average inflow volume predicted seepage rates to range between 1 6 x10 2 to 4 9 x10 2 km3yr 1 13 352 to 40 057 acre ft yr 1 an investigation by mihevc et al 2002 along a 11 km section of the fernley reach was approached using heat as a tracer quantified along two dimensional transects at 6 study sites the seepage rates ranged from 1 0 x10 4 to 8 5 10 3 km3yr 1 with an inflow volume of 0 15 km3yr 1 the seepage estimates were 3 3 10 2 km3 yr 1 26 954 acre ft yr 1 or 22 of the inflow mihevc et al 2002 shanafield et al 2014 applied the diffusion wave approach on a 6 4 km section of the fernley reach and found seepage flux estimates to be consistent with mihevc et al 2002 at transect sites applying the shanafield et al 2014 regression with the average inflow during 2018 and 2019 of 1 9 m3s 1 inflow results in an estimated seepage loss is 1 5 10 2 km3yr 1 12 480 acre ft yr 1 or about 53 of the average inflow volumetric losses estimated by reclamation during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons by inflow outflow from usgs gages measured diversions and unmetered estimates of lateral diversions were 1 4 10 2 km3yr 1 11 698 acre ft and 1 2 10 2 km3yr 1 9 744 acre ft or 45 and 50 of the inflows at wadsworth reclamation 2019 2020 differences in volumetric seepage loss reported for the tc can be attributed to differences in methodology assumptions timeframe inflow rates and changes in canal operations for example during the mihevc et al 2002 study inflow at wadsworth were 78 lower than what was observed in 2018 this difference in inflow may contribute to the 67 reduction in estimated seepage losses for the wadsworth to hazen reach results of our study provide new information for the derby and lahontan reaches where seepage has not been studied and identified a section of canal where groundwater may influence rates within the fernley reach in previous studies the influence of groundwater on seepage rates were not accounted for 5 3 management considerations for water managers planning accurate conveyance of water in canals involves making predictions of seepage losses this investigation provides insights into the influence of temperature on seepage rates that could be used to improve canal operations and improve conveyance efficiency for example canal operations could be optimized during seasonally cooler temperatures to reduce seepage losses hydraulic connectivity between canal flow and groundwater were shown to seasonally vary in the presence of water level fluctuations and declines in these conditions spatial and temporal data are needed to identify reaches where the water table may influence seasonal seepage rates considerations for reduction of seepage losses through engineering approaches are effective means of reducing losses understanding where high seepage occurs minimizing losses and improvements to conveyance can be accomplished by canal lining reclamation 1976 low cost options such as compacted earth lining can be an effective means to reducing rates of seepage burt et al 2010 reported 86 to 90 reduction in seepage losses when the sides and bottom of the canal were treated by compaction and measured by ponded infiltration test numerical modeling by el molla and el molla 2021 estimated 99 8 seepage reduction through compaction combining compaction with clay lining can also prove effective in reducing seepage rates yao et al 2012 the use of synthetic and concrete materials may be successful for reductions of seepage but can be costly and deteriorate over time han et al 2021 reductions of seepage through lining improves conveyance but can also have unintended impacts on water levels and domestic use meijer et al 2006 compacted earth lining along embankment could be a viable low cost option to reduce seepage losses where coarse bank sediments are contributing to high lateral seepage managing water resources in arid environments is complicated but critical for the sustainability of water use in the western united states this study quantified seepage losses in a large irrigation canal using two dimensional numerical models calibrated with field data the model simulations were used to develop regression equations to be applied in managing and forecasting water deliveries the numerical models demonstrate the need to account for temperature effects on canal conveyance regression equations compare reasonably well with numerical models and can be easily applied within the framework of existing stage and temperature monitoring in the presence of contrasting hydraulic properties of embankment sediments simple regression equations may be problematic in predicting seepage with substantial variations in stage 6 conclusions this study shows that estimates of seepage rates and volumetric losses over an irrigation season are improved by inclusion of the dependence of temperature variations in stage and connectivity to groundwater the field data and numerical models were used to derive hydraulic thermal properties of canal sediments represented by soil zones to estimate vertical and lateral seepage rates transects with high seepage can be managed through embankment compaction or lining the numerical models used for each transect were derived from parsimony accounting for near surface siltation and the groundwater table data where available segregating the modelling approach into calibration and validation periods allowed confirmation of estimated parameters and recalibration of a transect affected by siltation during canal operations lateral seepage rates can fluctuate widely through embankment materials with high contrast in hydraulic conductivity the numerical models demonstrate the importance of accounting for seasonal temperature changes on seepage rates and seasonal volume estimates more than half the time of operation the tc exhibits shallow sediment temperatures within the 10 to 25 c during these periods seepage rates can increase by nearly 50 over periods of operation when temperatures are below 10 c this case study integrated field data and models to provide simple relationships to be implemented with field data collected from the canal for routine operations applying the regression models with canal operations data can provide real time estimates of seepage rates for improved accounting of water conveyance periodic updating of regressions maybe necessary if hydraulic or thermal properties of canal sediments change substantially from validated seepage models the use of heat as a groundwater tracer continues to be a reliable approach for quantifying seepage rates and this approach would be valid for developing and updating regression equations further refinements of transect scale seepage rates to reach scale volumetric losses can be made using ground based geophysics lindenbach et al 2021 efficient use of surface water diverted from the truckee river for irrigation will be beneficial for farmers and the lower truckee river system to pyramid lake the data collected from this study will help improve forecasts of water deliveries and guide canal modifications such as canal lining credit authorship contribution statement ramon naranjo conceptualization methodology software formal

2323,understanding and modeling suspended sediment concentration c dynamics in river channels are essential for many theoretical as well as practical purposes the sediment rating curve approach that relates c with river discharge q is among the most followed modeling approaches mainly because of its simplicity and effectiveness although studies in the past have suggested the possibility of c q relationship for a basin not being unique how the relationship evolves with time is not yet fully understood in this study we limit our analysis to recession periods when both c and q continuously decrease with time and show that the coefficient of c q power law equation changes across recession events furthermore we propose to express d c d t as a function of c for recession periods d c d t f c e the exponent e is assumed to be related to static catchment characteristics and the coefficient f to dynamic factors namely catchment water storage and sediment availability condition assuming the dynamic factors controlling f to evolve slowly with time we propose that it is possible to predict f for a recession event considering only past c data once f is estimated we can predict c for anytime during the recession event the advantage of the proposed model is that it can predict future suspended sediment concentration at a river cross section during a recession event we applied the proposed model to 35 us geological survey basins and found the 25th 50th and 75th values of nse respectively to be 0 55 0 64 and 0 78 and the corresponding values for the rating curve model 0 05 0 01 and 0 20 the results here essentially highlight the importance of recognizing the dynamic nature of suspended sediment concentration discharge relationship keywords event scale recession events past sediment information sediment rating curve temporal variability data availability we have shared the data source link in the article 1 introduction suspended sediment transport has been identified as the main global mechanism of fluvial sediment transport babinski 2005 cisty et al 2021 matos et al 2017 walling fang 2003 xu et al 2019 estimations reflect that the global amount of suspended sediment transport is about 3 5 times higher than that of solutes while the bed load represents only a small component of fluvial transport walling and webb 1981a walling and webb 1981b seepage erosion and bank failure are also considered to be contributors to suspended sediment concentration karmaker and dutta 2011 2013 the effect of urbanization and increased precipitation on annual sediment yield is also quite significant ampomahet al 2020 suspended sediment transport is responsible for aquatic habitat degradation reservoir sedimentation and the transport of sediment bound pollutants such as pesticides particulate nutrients and heavy metals bečvář 2006 meter et al 2016 accurate estimation of suspended sediment concentration in rivers is thus an important factor for designing and constructing hydraulic structures implementing soil conservation and watershed management afan et al 2016 azadi et al 2020 ghorbani et al 2013 zarris et al 2011 due to difficulties in collecting suspended sediment concentration data and maintaining large networks of observation centers engineers generally rely on models that predict suspended sediment concentration dastranj et al 2014 or remote sensing methods blum and roberts 2009 park and latrubesse 2014 shrestha et al 2013 yu et al 2013 one can find a variety of models in the scientific literature some models take into account detailed physical processes responsible for sediment generation and transportation and are thus expected to explain the spatial and temporal variation of sediment concentration in a river network on the other hand there are data driven or black box type models that intend to predict suspended sediment concentration without bothering to understand the underlying physics adnan et al 2021 gholami and khaleghi 2021 while physics based models are preferable it is practically difficult to employ them in most cases due to the unavailability of necessary data and computational resources adnan et al 2019 amiri and haghizadeh 2015 her and heatwole 2016 romero et al 2008 although data driven models such as artificial neural networks are known for their prediction accuracy they do not help to draw new insights into physical processes romero et al 2008 some statistical methods have also been employed for sediment prediction such as quasi maximum likelihood estimator smearing and minimum variance unbiased estimator with bias correction improvement khaleghi and gholami 2018 the third alternative in front of us is to develop simple parsimonious models by exploiting our limited understanding of suspended sediment concentration dynamics one such approach is the use of sediment rating curves which is simple and effective campbell and bauder 1940 farr clarke 1984 ferguson 1986 horowitz 2003 harrington and harrington 2013 hu et al 2011 miller 1951 olive et al 1980 walling and webb 1981a walling and webb 1981b a sediment rating curve is a functional relationship between the concentration of suspended sediment c and river discharge q typically expressed employing a power law equation walling 1974 1977 warrick 2015 1 c aq b numerous studies in the past have applied eq 1 to predict suspended sediment concentration for catchments with different sizes and land use types douglas 1967 livesey 1975 piest and heinemann 1963 samkele and wang 2016 temple and sundborg 1972 a few authors in the past have focused on improving prediction of c through bias correction of the parameters a and b e g crawford 1991 the parameters a and b are known to be dependent on the mechanism of runoff generation e g syvitski et al 2000 their values are also governed by factors such as the amount of sediment available for transportation the particle size distribution of the available sediment and the variation of channel morphology from upstream to downstream asselman 1999 dadson et al 2004 huang and montgomery 2013 walling 1974 yang et al 2007 available sediment for transport depends on sediment supply to the river channel and hence an increase in discharge with constant sediment supply decreases sediment concentration affecting the rating curve parameters asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 warrick 2015 the above observations suggest that we need to properly analyze the relationship between c and q the accuracy of c prediction will be higher for a catchment if the correlation between c and q is higher and vice versa c vs q plots are often characterized by large scatter which means prediction accuracy will be lower for those cases however one may wonder if the scatter in a c vs q plot is mere because of observational errors because if there is any other reason behind the scatter it would imply that we can improve prediction accuracy by recognizing the underlying physics in other words it won t be very accurate to assume the relationship between c and q to be unique when scatter in the c vs q plot has physical origins indeed many studies in the past have argued that the relationship between c and q is not unique in particular they have reported hysteresis in c q plots bača 2008 soler et al 2008 varvani et al 2019 williams 1989 which means for a given discharge suspended sediment concentration can assume a wide range of values although it is widely accepted that c q relation is not unique no model intending to predict suspended sediment concentration in rivers to our knowledge acknowledges the dynamic nature of c q relation in this study we attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to exploit the dynamic behavior of c q relationship for predicting c in particular we focus on predicting c during recession periods by assuming that c q relationship is unique for individual recession events mohanty and biswal 2022 furthermore we argue that it is possible to predict c at any point of time during a recession event using only past c data the advantage of the proposed model over the sediment rating curve is that it can predict sediment concentration for the future days during a recession event 2 theoretical backgrounds the flow of water and sediment in a catchment is a phenomenon and hence it is practically impossible to develop a purely mechanistic model that accounts for the detailed physical processes streamflow is typically modeled following the mass balance equation biswal and kumar 2015 2 d s d dt e r q where er is effective rainfall i e the part of rainfall that transforms into streamflow and s d is drainable storage although eq 2 is simple to interpret its implementation is not easy as it is practically impossible to measure sd one way to address this problem is to relate sd with q since streamflow results from depletion of storage a functional relationship between sd and q can be developed considering streamflow data from recession periods for which er 0 thus eq 2 becomes d s d d t q or s d t s d t d s d t t q d t if a recession period lasts long enough and sd eventually approaches zero at time t one can easily relate sd with q however this strategy is not very useful as recession events are almost always short lived an alternative approach relating sd with q was proposed by

one to one i e α and k vary across recession events biswal and marani 2010 biswal and kumar 2014 chen and krajewski 2016 in particular the coefficient k varies by order of magnitude across recession events while α remains fairly constant biswal and marani 2014 it is often assumed that α is related to static catchment characteristics such as channel network morphology and dominant soil types biswal and marani 2010 patnaik et al 2018 on the other hand the power law coefficient k for an event is determined by the initial soil moisture condition biswal and marani 2014 biswal and kumar 2015 basso et al 2021 shaw et al 2013 here we assume that the power law exponent b in eq 1 is dependent on static catchment characteristics and that the coefficient a for a recession event depends on initial sediment availability conditions if a large fraction of the surface area of the basin is bare or prone to erosion the value of a will be higher and vice versa thus the relationship between d c d t and c can be expressed by combining eq s 1 and 3 4 dc dt f c e where f k 1 a α b 1 and e α 1 b 1 thus the coefficient e is expected to be related to static properties of the catchment and the exponent f to initial soil moisture and sediment availability conditions eq 4 can be written as c e d c f d t which can be integrated with limits for t from 0 to t and for c from c 0 to c to obtain

primarily by c 0 when t is small and by f when t is large for a fixed t t f c t 1 e when t is large if c 0 and c t are not correlated the relationship between f and c t will improve with t also see biswal and marani 2014 if the value f is known c can be predicted for any t during a recession event after observing c 0 thus the proposed model has an advantage as it can predict future suspended sediment concentration values during a recession event unlike the rating curve based models that require observed discharge to predict suspended sediment concentration many studies in the past have highlighted that the coefficient k exhibits a power law relationship with past average discharge implying it is possible to use past discharge data to predict k for an event biswal and kumar 2014 bart

hypothesize that there exists a power law relationship between f and past average c 6 f f c pn μ c pn in eq 6 is the average c for the selected past time of duration n the negative sign in the exponent of c pn in eq 6 indicates that f is inversely related to past average suspended sediment concentration much like f is related to past average discharge for a comparative assessment we also use the rating curve method eq 1 to predict c during recession periods 3 data and analysis daily mean discharge and suspended sediment concentration time series data were collected from the us geological survey database https waterdata usgs gov nwis inventory for all the analyses in this study as we are interested to study only natural factors influencing discharge and suspended sediment concentration we selected basins that are not heavily influenced by human intervention such as large dams large scale agricultural activities and large urban areas observation made considering google earth images since our analysis focus on recession periods each basin has undergone at least ten number of recession events a recession event is defined here as the time duration while both c and q continuously decrease with time for at least 6 days additionally to make our analysis robust and draw general conclusions we selected basins from diverse geological topographic and climatic regions in total time series data for 35 basins were collected locational and other key details of the study basins are given in fig 1 and table s1 provided as supporting document the coefficient a and the exponent b of eq 1 for each event of a basin are obtained considering the logarithmic values of c and q similarly the coefficient f and the exponent e of eq 4 for an event are obtained considering d c d t and c data points note that because eq 4 is a differential equation d c d t and c were numerically defined following the central difference scheme d c d t c i c i 1 and c c i c i 1 2 note that the time step δ t here is one day after obtaining e of eq 4 for all the recession events we considered the median value as the representative e for the basin to re calculate f for all the events following the fixed exponent method biswal 2021 similar principle of calibration is implemented on the first half of the suspended sediment time series to compute μ and f and for each recession event f is predicted in the second half for validation purposes note that all the above computations were conducted following the least squares linear regression method we then used c 0 and predicted f values to predict c for all days of each recession event following eq 5 the model s performance was evaluated utilizing r 2 as well as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse li and nieber 2017 similarly the rating curve model eq 1 is used for predicting c during recession periods with the help of observed q each catchments time series data is divided into two equal halves there initial half of the data is considered for calibrating a and b of the rating curve model eq 1 following the least squares linear regression method then the latter half is used for validating the model in terms of r 2 and nse 4 results and discussion fig 2 shows c vs q scatter plot for a sample basin considering data points from all the recession events together grey color and on top of it c vs q scatter plots for seven selected recession events separately it is noticeable that individual c vs q has much less scatter compared to the combined plot r 2 for all the seven c q plots are greater than 0 95 whereas the value for the combined plot is only 0 27 the observation here strongly supports our hypothesis that c q relationship is not unique for a basin which means we need to analyze c q curves from recession events separately mohanty and biswal 2022 although studies in the past have proposed the idea that c q relationship is not unique warrick 2015 no such modeling framework has been developed to address this issue the absence of a unique c q relationship likely supports our earlier hypothesis that suspended sediment concentration in a river not only depends on discharge but also sediment availability conditions if the catchment is more exposed during a recession event due to lack of vegetation it will produce more sediment for the same value of q and vice versa in other words it is hypothesized here that c q relationship is dynamic because of vegetation dynamics in the catchment one can also notice the regression lines in the log log plane to have quite similar slopes but different intercepts fig 2 the implication is that the exponent b eq 1 will be underestimated if all the c q data points are considered together as evident in fig 2 biswal and marani 2010 2014 mutzner et al 2013 fig 3 highlights the same phenomena concerning d c d t c relationship the relationship between d c d t and c is a power law type but not unique for a basin while the individual d c d t c curves for the sample recession events are characterized by little scatter r 2 ranging between 0 93 and 0 99 all the d c d t c considered together show a large amount of scatter r 2 0 75 again the combined d c d t c power law regression curve shows a lower exponent e 1 31 compared to the values of e for the sample recession events computed individually e ranging between 1 41 and 1 67 these results here thus reinforce the idea that both c q and d c d t c data points from the recession events need to be analyzed separately power law equations possess some unique attributes while the exponent of a power law curve is dimensionless the units of the coefficient depend on the exponent thus we can compare the exponents of different curves but not the coefficients to draw any meaningful insight both b and e show variation across recession events fig 4 shows the probability density functions pdf of both b and e for the sample basin 11467000 it is assumed that b and e vary across events primarily because of uncertainty in the data which appears to be supported by the observation that b and e exhibit less variation when we selected only the recession events for which d c d t also continuously decreased with time see fig 4 in other words the exponents b and e are mainly decided by static catchment characteristics and the coefficients a and f by storage and sediment availability dynamics the median of b for the sample basin is 1 41 which means c q relationship is non linear asselman 2000 walling 1974 in fig 4 the spread is observed to be more in pdf of b and e during recession considering decreasing c criteria than recession considering decreasing d c d t criteria which signifies a reduction in error while considering recession with decreasing d c d t criteria and also suggests that c q relationship as well as d c d t c relationship is generally non linear considering the median e of a basin as its representative e we computed the power law coefficient f for each recession event at median e as predicted by eq 5 f exhibits a power law relationship with c t for the sample basin 01664000 fig 5 interestingly f c t relationship characterized through r 2 improves with t see fig 5 this implies that the relationship between c t and c 0 is quite weak likely because the mechanism governing suspended sediment concentration in the river during late recession periods is not the same as that during early recession periods similar observations were made for other study basins too fig 6 shows scatter plots between f and past average c for the sample basin for different time periods c pn s the relationship between f and c pn is characterized by a power law equation shown in eq 6 which supports our earlier hypothesis we can notice that the strength of f c pn relationship expressed as r pn 2 decreases with n indicating that catchment water storage and sediment availability states of the basin evolve with time and that f of a recession event cannot be influenced much by storage and sediment availability long back it is observed that f c pn relationship is strongest in general for n 5 fig 6b which means we can use c p 5 information to predict f to avoid this ambiguity we have considered c avg as c pn instead of c p 5 c avg is taken as the minimum value among c p 5 c p 10 c p 30 c p 60 and c p 120 where the above parameters correspond to the average value of c for the past 5 days 10 days 30 days 60 days and 120 days respectively for some of the basins the value of r pn 2 is quite low which means c pn cannot predict f very accurately for those basins this also means that past suspended sediment concentration data can provide valuable information on f at least for some basins however it should be emphasized here that this study for the first time is attempting to explain variation of f across recession events future studies may explore alternative avenues to predict f more accurately once f is estimated using c pn eq 5 can be applied to estimate c for any day during a recession event fig 7 shows the scatter plot between modeled c vs observed c for four sample basins using the rating curve method whereas fig 8 shows the same using the proposed method r 2 s and nse s for the basins are quite satisfactory for proposed method which seem to be indicating that the proposed model is capable of predicting suspended sediment concentration quite well considering only past sediment concentration data fig 9 shows the box plots of r 2 s and nse s using the rating curve method and the proposed method considering results from all the study basins with their 75th 50th and 25th values of r 2 as 0 48 0 8 0 28 0 72 and 0 11 0 63 and corresponding nse values as 0 20 0 78 0 01 0 64 and 0 05 0 55 respectively these results essentially suggest the possibility of improving prediction of c substantially by recognizing that the relationship between q and c changes across recession events moreover the proposed model s performance is quite comparable to other models reported in the literature for example ghani et al 2013 determined sediment yield using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model at cameron highlands pahang malaysia and reported r

sediment rating curve src models for the prediction of daily suspended sediment load in the iowa river gauging station in the united states and obtained nses respectively are 0 67 0 81 0 60 and 0 39 respectively based on historical satellite based land cover data the multiple linear regression mlr model was adopted for the cuyahoga watershed which gave an output value of r 2 as 0 71 ampomahet al 2020 azadi et al 2020 applied a rating curve based method to predict monthly suspended sediment concentration in abiaca creek watershed over the period 1991 2003 which resulted with nrmse n s e and r 2 equals to 0 40 0 70 and 0 70 respectively we would like to note that our analysis might involve observational clarke et al 2000 olive rieger 1988 smith and croke 2005 as well as methodological uncertainties asselman 2000 chen et al 2019 crawford 1991 parker 1988 walling and webb 1981a walling and webb 1981b nevertheless the results from the above studies suggest that the proposed model is capable of predicting daily suspended sediment concentration reasonably well for most of the study basins 5 conclusions the relationship between suspended sediment concentration c and river discharge q is dynamic in nature we have shown that c and q exhibit a strong power law type relationship which changes across recession events implying that c vs q curves from recession events should be analyzed separately in particular the exponent of the power law equation remains fairly constant while the coefficient exhibits wide variation across events considering the facts that c and q as well as d q d t and q exhibit power law relationships for a recession event in a basin we can show that there exists a power law relationship between d c d t and c the main advantage of relating d c d t with c is that we can analyze sediment concentration data and draw meaningful insights into suspended sediment concentration dynamics in the basin without using discharge data results here support our hypothesis that the exponent of d c d t vs c power law relationship e can be assumed to be fairly constant whereas the coefficient f representative of catchment storage and sediment availability conditions of the catchment varies widely across recession events the relationship between f and c t improves with t for all the study basins indicating that processes governing suspended sediment concentration during early recession periods are different from those during late recession periods assuming that catchment storage and sediment availability conditions change slowly with time we can use past sediment concentration information to predict f for an event once f is estimated we can easily predict c for any day during a recession event the proposed model showed reasonable performance for most of the study basins one limitation of the proposed model is that it requires suspended sediment concentration data and hence it can be used for locations where suspended sediment concentration records are available overall our study for the first time proposes the idea that it is possible to obtain crucial information on suspended sediment dynamics in rivers by analyzing suspended sediment concentration recession curves future studies may focus on developing more accurate models for simulation of suspended sediment concentration based on the finding that the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentration is dynamic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2323,understanding and modeling suspended sediment concentration c dynamics in river channels are essential for many theoretical as well as practical purposes the sediment rating curve approach that relates c with river discharge q is among the most followed modeling approaches mainly because of its simplicity and effectiveness although studies in the past have suggested the possibility of c q relationship for a basin not being unique how the relationship evolves with time is not yet fully understood in this study we limit our analysis to recession periods when both c and q continuously decrease with time and show that the coefficient of c q power law equation changes across recession events furthermore we propose to express d c d t as a function of c for recession periods d c d t f c e the exponent e is assumed to be related to static catchment characteristics and the coefficient f to dynamic factors namely catchment water storage and sediment availability condition assuming the dynamic factors controlling f to evolve slowly with time we propose that it is possible to predict f for a recession event considering only past c data once f is estimated we can predict c for anytime during the recession event the advantage of the proposed model is that it can predict future suspended sediment concentration at a river cross section during a recession event we applied the proposed model to 35 us geological survey basins and found the 25th 50th and 75th values of nse respectively to be 0 55 0 64 and 0 78 and the corresponding values for the rating curve model 0 05 0 01 and 0 20

pesticides particulate nutrients and heavy metals bečvář 2006 meter et al 2016 accurate estimation of suspended sediment concentration in rivers is thus an important factor for designing and constructing hydraulic structures implementing soil conservation and watershed management afan et al 2016 azadi et al 2020 ghorbani et al 2013 zarris et al 2011 due to difficulties in collecting suspended sediment concentration data and maintaining large networks of observation centers engineers generally rely on models that predict suspended sediment concentration dastranj et al 2014 or remote sensing methods blum and roberts 2009 park and latrubesse 2014 shrestha et al 2013 yu et al 2013 one can find a variety of models in the scientific literature some models take into account detailed physical processes responsible for sediment generation and transportation and are thus expected to explain the spatial and temporal variation of sediment concentration in a river network on the other hand there are data driven or black box type models that intend to predict suspended sediment concentration without bothering to understand the underlying physics adnan et al 2021 gholami and khaleghi 2021 while physics based models are preferable it is practically difficult to employ them in most cases due to the unavailability of necessary data and computational resources adnan et al 2019 amiri and haghizadeh 2015 her and heatwole 2016 romero et al 2008 although data driven models such as artificial neural networks are known for their prediction accuracy they do not help to draw new insights into physical processes romero et al 2008 some statistical methods have also been employed for sediment prediction such as quasi maximum likelihood estimator smearing and minimum variance unbiased estimator with bias correction improvement khaleghi and gholami 2018 the third alternative in front of us is to develop simple parsimonious models by exploiting our limited understanding of suspended sediment concentration dynamics one such approach is the use of sediment rating curves which is simple and effective campbell and bauder 1940 farr clarke 1984 ferguson 1986 horowitz 2003 harrington and harrington 2013 hu et al 2011 miller 1951 olive et al 1980 walling and webb 1981a walling and webb 1981b a sediment rating curve is a functional relationship between the concentration of suspended sediment c and river discharge q typically expressed employing a power law equation walling 1974 1977 warrick 2015 1 c aq b numerous studies in the past have applied eq 1 to predict suspended sediment concentration for catchments with different sizes and land use types douglas 1967 livesey 1975 piest and heinemann 1963 samkele and wang 2016 temple and sundborg 1972 a few authors in the past have focused on improving prediction of c through bias correction of the parameters a and b e g crawford 1991 the parameters a and b are known to be dependent on the mechanism of runoff generation e g syvitski et al 2000 their values are also governed by factors such as the amount of sediment available for transportation the particle size distribution of the available sediment and the variation of channel morphology from upstream to downstream asselman 1999 dadson et al 2004 huang and montgomery 2013 walling 1974 yang et al 2007 available sediment for transport depends on sediment supply to the river channel and hence an increase in discharge with constant sediment supply decreases sediment concentration affecting the rating curve parameters asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 warrick 2015 the above observations suggest that we need to properly analyze the relationship between c and q the accuracy of c prediction will be higher for a catchment if the correlation between c and q is higher and vice versa c vs q plots are often characterized by large scatter which means prediction accuracy will be lower for those cases however one may wonder if the scatter in a c vs q plot is mere because of observational errors because if there is any other reason behind the scatter it would imply that we can improve prediction accuracy by recognizing the underlying physics in other words it won t be very accurate to assume the relationship between c and q to be unique when scatter in the c vs q plot has physical origins indeed many studies in the past have argued that the relationship between c and q is not unique in particular they have reported hysteresis in c q plots bača 2008 soler et al 2008 varvani et al 2019 williams 1989 which means for a given discharge suspended sediment concentration can assume a wide range of values although it is widely accepted that c q relation is not unique no model intending to predict suspended sediment concentration in rivers to our knowledge acknowledges the dynamic nature of c q relation in this study we attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to exploit the dynamic behavior of c q relationship for predicting c in particular we focus on predicting c during recession periods by assuming that c q relationship is unique for individual recession events mohanty and biswal 2022 furthermore we argue that it is possible to predict c at any point of time during a recession event using only past c data the advantage of the proposed model over the sediment rating curve is that it can predict sediment concentration for the future days during a recession event 2 theoretical backgrounds the flow of water and sediment in a catchment is a phenomenon and hence it is practically impossible to develop a purely mechanistic model that accounts for the detailed physical processes streamflow is typically modeled following the mass balance equation biswal and kumar 2015 2 d s d dt e r q where er is effective rainfall i e the part of rainfall that transforms into streamflow and s d is drainable storage although eq 2 is simple to interpret its implementation is not easy as it is practically impossible to measure sd one way to address this problem is to relate sd with q since streamflow results from depletion of storage a functional relationship between sd and q can be developed considering streamflow data from recession periods for which er 0 thus eq 2 becomes d s d d t q or s d t s d t d s d t t q d t if a recession period lasts long enough and sd eventually approaches zero at time t one can easily relate sd with q however this strategy is not very useful as recession events are almost always short lived an alternative approach relating sd with q was proposed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 considering the relationship between d q d t and q which is typically a power law type 3 dq dt k q α once α and k are obtained eqs 2 and 3 can be combined to relate sd with q

biswal and marani 2010 patnaik et al 2018 on the other hand the power law coefficient k for an event is determined by the initial soil moisture condition biswal and marani 2014 biswal and kumar 2015 basso et al 2021 shaw et al 2013 here we assume that the power law exponent b in eq 1 is dependent on static catchment characteristics and that the coefficient a for a recession event depends on initial sediment availability conditions if a large fraction of the surface area of the basin is bare or prone to erosion the value of a will be higher and vice versa thus the relationship between d c d t and c can be expressed by combining eq s 1 and 3 4 dc dt f c e where f k 1 a α b 1 and e α 1 b 1 thus the coefficient e is expected to be related to static properties of the catchment and the exponent f to initial soil moisture and sediment availability conditions eq 4 can be written as c e d c f d t which can be integrated with limits for t from 0 to t and for c from c 0 to c to obtain

q relationship as well as d c d t c relationship is generally non linear considering the median e of a basin as its representative e we computed the power law coefficient f for each recession event at median e as predicted by eq 5 f exhibits a power law relationship with c t for the sample basin 01664000 fig 5 interestingly f c t relationship characterized through r 2 improves with t see fig 5 this implies that the relationship between c t and c 0 is quite weak likely because the mechanism governing suspended sediment concentration in the river during late recession periods is not the same as that during early recession periods similar observations were made for other study basins too fig 6 shows scatter plots between f and past average c for the sample basin for different time periods c pn s the relationship between f and c pn is characterized by a power law equation shown in eq 6 which supports our earlier hypothesis we can notice that the strength of f c pn relationship expressed as r pn 2 decreases with n indicating that catchment water storage and sediment availability states of the basin evolve with time and that f of a recession event cannot be influenced much by storage and sediment availability long back it is observed that f c pn relationship is strongest in general for n 5 fig 6b which means we can use c p 5 information to predict f to avoid this ambiguity we have considered c avg as c pn instead of c p 5 c avg is taken as the minimum value among c p 5 c p 10 c p 30 c p 60 and c p 120 where the above parameters correspond to the average value of c for the past 5 days 10 days 30 days 60 days and 120 days respectively for some of the basins the value of r pn 2 is quite low which means c pn cannot predict f very accurately for those basins this also means that past suspended sediment concentration data can provide valuable information on f at least for some basins however it should be emphasized here that this study for the first time is attempting to explain variation of f across recession events future studies may explore alternative avenues to predict f more accurately once f is estimated using c pn eq 5 can be applied to estimate c for any day during a recession event fig 7 shows the scatter plot between modeled c vs observed c for four sample basins using the rating curve method whereas fig 8 shows the same using the proposed method r 2 s and nse s for the basins are quite satisfactory for proposed method which seem to be indicating that the proposed model is capable of predicting suspended sediment concentration quite well considering only past sediment concentration data fig 9 shows the box plots of r 2 s and nse s using the rating curve method and the proposed method considering results from all the study basins with their 75th 50th and 25th values of r 2 as 0 48 0 8 0 28 0 72 and 0 11 0 63 and corresponding nse values as 0 20 0 78 0 01 0 64 and 0 05 0 55 respectively these results essentially suggest the possibility of improving prediction of c substantially by recognizing that the relationship between q and c changes across recession events moreover the proposed model s performance is quite comparable to other models reported in the literature for example ghani et al 2013 determined sediment yield using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model at cameron highlands pahang malaysia and reported r 2 of 0 64 duan 1983 conducted a case study in chaohe river upstream to verify the applicability of the soil and water assessment tool swat for predicting sediment yields in a semi arid mountainous basin and got nse and r 2 as 0 51 and 0 78 for validation period rajaeeet al 2011 applied artificial neural network ann wavelet analysis and ann combination wann multilinear regression mlr and sediment rating curve src models for the prediction of daily suspended sediment load in the iowa river gauging station in the united states and obtained nses respectively are 0 67 0 81 0 60 and 0 39 respectively based on historical satellite based land cover data the multiple linear regression mlr model was adopted for the cuyahoga watershed which gave an output value of r 2 as 0 71 ampomahet al 2020 azadi et al 2020 applied a rating curve based method to predict monthly suspended sediment concentration in abiaca creek watershed over the period 1991 2003 which resulted with nrmse n s e and r 2 equals to 0 40 0 70 and 0 70 respectively we would like to note that our analysis might involve observational clarke et al 2000 olive rieger 1988 smith and croke 2005 as well as methodological uncertainties asselman 2000 chen et al 2019 crawford 1991 parker 1988 walling and webb 1981a walling and webb 1981b nevertheless the results from the above studies suggest that the proposed model is capable of predicting daily suspended sediment concentration reasonably well for most of the study basins 5 conclusions the relationship between suspended sediment concentration c and river discharge q is dynamic in nature we have shown that c and q exhibit a strong power law type relationship which changes across recession events implying that c vs q curves from recession events should be analyzed separately in particular the exponent of the power law equation remains fairly constant while the coefficient exhibits wide variation across events considering the facts that c and q as well as d q d t and q exhibit power law relationships for a recession event in a basin we can show that there exists a power law relationship between d c d t and c the main advantage of relating d c d t with c is that we can analyze sediment concentration data and draw meaningful insights into suspended sediment concentration dynamics in the basin without using discharge data results here support our hypothesis that the exponent of d c d t vs c power law relationship e can be assumed to be fairly constant whereas the coefficient f representative of catchment storage and sediment availability conditions of the catchment varies widely across recession events the relationship between f and c t improves with t for all the study basins indicating that processes governing suspended sediment concentration during early recession periods are different from those during late recession periods assuming that catchment storage and sediment availability conditions change slowly with time we can use past sediment concentration information to predict f for an event once f is estimated we can easily predict c for any day during a recession event the proposed model showed reasonable performance for most of the study basins one limitation of the proposed model is that it requires suspended sediment concentration data and hence it can be used for locations where suspended sediment concentration records are available overall our study for the first time proposes the idea that it is possible to obtain crucial information on suspended sediment dynamics in rivers by analyzing suspended sediment concentration recession curves future studies may focus on developing more accurate models for simulation of suspended sediment concentration based on the finding that the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentration is dynamic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2324,the demand for more accurate simulation of physical river basin puts forward higher requirements on the number of hydrological forecast stations types of hydrological variables forecast accuracy forecast period and quantitative uncertainty therefore how to simultaneously obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations is a key issue to be solved in this study firstly the background of river basin digital twin is introduced and the new problems faced by hydrological forecasting in this background are analyzed then the input and output of hydrological forecasting are reconstructed into 4 d tensors next a new hybrid deep learning model b cm c3d based on 3 d convolutional neural network convolutional minimum gate memory neural network and variational bayesian neural network is proposed to obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations finally in order to verify the performance of this model it was compared with four state of the art models in the yangtze river basin the experimental results show that 1 the deterministic prediction accuracy and probabilistic forecasting comprehensive performance of b cm c3d are better than other comparison models in 80 of the results 2 b cm c3d shortens the training time of b cl c3d by 43 and improves the prediction accuracy keywords river basin digital twin hydrological forecasting probabilistic forecasting deep learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction digital twin dt refers to a system that simulates the real world within a virtualized world sookhak lari et al 2022 river basin digital twin rbdt is the mapping of physical river basin in the digital world and ideally it can simulate the running laws of physical river basin rbdt has two key aspects external display and internal driving the former makes rbdt look like a physical river basin and the latter makes rbdt operate according to the laws of the physical river basin in order to simulate the physical river basin more accurately in rbdt it is inseparable from the high precision forecasting model scheduling model flood evolution model and other models zhang et al 2012 this study focuses on hydrological forecasting in the context of rbdt which needs to consider the following four important aspects 1 the flow of downstream stations is affected by the flow of upstream stations 2 the hydrological variables such as flow and water level in the river channel also influence each other 3 multi step ahead forecasting of hydrological variables provide more information than single step ahead forecasting 4 there are uncertainties in hydrological forecasts therefore how to simultaneously obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations under the background of rbdt is the purpose of this study hydrological prediction methods are mainly divided into two categories physical process driven methods and data driven methods liu et al 2018 the physical process driven method is based on principle of hydrology muluye 2011 such as the xin an river model zang et al 2021 due to the strong correlation between rainfall and runoff the numerical weather prediction nwp ming et al 2020 model is also used to assist runoff forecasting usually the nwp model is used to achieve rainfall forecasting and then complete the runoff forecasting zhao et al 2022 the advantage of the physical process driven method is that the model is highly interpretable but the disadvantage is that it requires more basic data complex modeling and time consuming solution papadopoulos et al 2008 data driven methods usually use statistical methods such as machine learning or deep learning to predict hydrological variables based on historical runoff information and meteorological related factors quaghebeur et al 2022 the advantages of the data driven method are that the calculation speed is fast and the prediction accuracy is high the disadvantage is that the forecast model is a black box model and has poor interpretability ghaith et al 2020 common data driven methods can be classified into time series models machine learning or deep learning models and multi method hybrid models zhang et al 2021 the prerequisite for using time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima yan et al 2022 for prediction is that the data satisfy the assumption of stationarity or the assumption of stationarity after differential processing zhang et al 2019a which limits the application scenarios of this type of model in order to deal with the nonlinear and random characteristics of hydrological variables support vector regression svr kalteh 2014 extreme learning machine elm boucher et al 2020 artificial neural network ann ghazvinian et al 2021 and other machine learning models chen et al 2021 are often used for hydrological forecasting in recent years with the vigorous development of computer technology and artificial intelligence deep learning models lecun et al 2015 have been gradually applied in the field of hydrological prediction long short term memory network lstm gers et al 2000 and convolutional neural network cnn liu et al 2020a b are used in hydrology prediction because they are good at time series processing and feature extraction respectively in order to overcome the shortcomings of a single prediction model and take advantage of multiple prediction models at the same time hybrid models have gradually become the mainstream method of hydrological prediction wan et al 2019 such as the combination of time series model and machine learning model arima ann khan et al 2020 the combination of modal decomposition mechanism and deep learning models zuo et al 2020 the combination of lstm and cnn deep learning models barzegar et al 2021 etc at the same time graph neural network gnn began to be used to model the unknown spatial temporal connectivity in river network so as to serve the hydrological forecast sun et al 2021 sun et al 2022 affected by the uncertainty characteristics of hydrological variables krzystofowicz 1999 the deterministic forecasting results provide limited information to dispatch decision makers hydrological probabilistic forecasting is becoming a research hotspot and trend in the field of hydrological forecasting it is one of the ideas to construct predictive intervals corresponding to a certain confidence level khosravi et al 2011 to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological variables more comprehensively the probability prediction model based on bayesian theory huang et al 2019 gaussian process regression gpr kleiber et al 2012 or quantile regression qr zhang et al 2019b combined with kernel density estimation kde benson et al 2021 can be used to obtained the probability density function of hydrological variables which can provide more abundant information for dispatchers the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique is used to reduce parameter uncertainty in a conceptual hydrological modeling application lin et al 2014 the markov chain monte carlo approach uses markov chains to simulate the stochastic process by preserving the state transition probability of the samples wu et al 2019 the bayesian forecasting system is an analysis method applicable to correction of real time streamflow error based on real time rainfall information ajami et al 2007 the existing multi step ahead forecasting methods usually have two ideas one is to use the results of single step ahead forecasting as the input to roll the forecast model multiple times in this way the accumulation of errors is serious and it is easy to appear that the trend is always rising or falling and it is difficult to predict the inflection point in the multi step ahead forecasting results another way is to construct multiple forecasting model by dislocating time series data this method does not consider the hydrological variables of multiple forecast periods as a whole and the multiple single step ahead forecasting models are separated bayesian inference is a probabilistic forecasting framework when it is combined with different deterministic forecast models it is necessary to deduce the formula on the basis of the original framework idea to complete the uncertainty quantification of the deterministic forecast model the training of deep learning models is usually time consuming therefore the key problems to be solved in this study are as follows 1 how to obtain the forecasting results of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations at the same time 2 how does multi step ahead forecasting achieve the overall consideration 3 how to use bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty of the multi step ahead forecasting results of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations 4 how to reduce the training time of the model in this study a probabilistic forecasting hybrid model based on 3 d convolutional neural network conv3d ji et al 2013 convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm and variational bayesian neural network vbnn liu et al 2020a b is proposed to obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations under the background of rbdt the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the time series of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations are rearranged into 4 d tensors 2 a new deep learning neural network layer convmgm is proposed which shortens the training time of the existing convolutional long short term memory network convlstm layer and improves the prediction accuracy 3 conv3d and convmgm are combined into a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d which combines the advantages that conv3d is good at mining features and convmgm is good at processing time series 4 using the variational bayesian framework to quantify the uncertainty of cm c3d a complete new probabilistic forecasting deep learning model b cm c3d is obtained the remaining sections of this paper are as follows the background of rbdt is introduced in section 2 the methods used in this study are described in section 3 a case study to verify the performance of this research is completed in section 4 the last section summarizes the content and conclusions of this study 2 background of river basin digital twin rbdt can be simply understood as building a physical real world river basin in the digital world the two key points in the construction of rbdt are the three dimensional visualization technology and the river basin operation model the former makes rbdt look like a real river basin and the latter enables rbdt to truly map the real river basin by simulating the key hydrological processes of the river basin forecast models reservoir scheduling models and flow evolution models are all important components of the basin operation model the focus of this study is how to simulate or predict the processes of the hydrological variable at multiple key sites in the river channel and quantify the forecasting uncertainty the schematic diagram of rbdt is shown in fig 1 where sub figure a represents the physical real river basin usually a real river will be cut into multiple river segments by reservoirs hydrological stations and other stations these stations and river segments constitute the two dimensional topolopy in the digital world shown as sub figure b there are multiple key hydrological variables at each station such as water level z runoff r and precipitation p the 2 dimensional structure becomes a 3 dimensional scene by taking into account the hydrological variables shown as sub figure c at the same time most of these hydrological elements are time series therefore the complete rbdt is a 4 dimensional time series scenario shown as sub figure d the work of this research is using historical 4 d time series scenarios to predict future 4 d time series scenarios the detailed problems to be solved in this study are as follows 1 how to construct a forecast model with 4 d input and 4 d output 2 how many historical scenarios are suitable for forecasting if the number of historical 3 d scenarios is too small the prediction accuracy will be too low and if the number is too large the model training will be very time consuming 3 it is appropriate to predict how many 3 d scenarios in the future at most if the number of predicted future scenarios is too large the accuracy will be reduced 4 how to improve such a complex forecasting model to increase its forecasting accuracy and reduce training time 5 no model can predict perfectly and there is always uncertainty how to obtain the probability density function pdf of the 4 d scenario is the key problem to be solved in this research 3 methods 3 1 time series correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient pcc busico et al 2020 and maximum information coefficient mic zhang et al 2019c are common correlation analysis methods they usually analyze two groups of variables at the same time but if there is a time lag between the two groups of variables it will affect the analysis results when a flood flows from upstream to downstream in a river channel the upstream runoff is correlated with the downstream runoff at the same time considering the influence of water flow speed it takes a period of time for the upstream flood peak to propagate to the downstream this phenomenon can be characterized by subgraph a and subgraph b in fig 2 if the runoff process between the upstream station and the downstream station at the same time are used to calculate the correlation coefficient the result will be small as shown in area i of sub figure b therefore a time series correlation analysis tsca method is proposed in this study to analyze the correlation of hydrological processes with time lags the formulas for calculating t step ahead pcc and mic are as follows 1 pc c t t 0 t 2 p c c x 1 t t 1 y t t i 1 t t 1 x i x 1 t t 1 y i y t t i 1 t t 1 x i x 1 t t 1 2 i 1 t t 1 y i y t t 2 2 mi c t t 0 t 2 m i c x 1 t t 1 y t t max xy b d i d x 1 t t 1 y t t log 2 min x 1 t t 1 y t t max xy b d max g i d g log 2 min x 1 t t 1 y t t where pc c t and mi c t are t step ahead pcc and mic respectively x 1 t t 1 represents samples of the independent variable indexed from 1 to t t 1 and y t t represents samples of the dependent variable indexed from t to t x 1 t t 1 and y t t are sample means d is a set of ordered pairs for x 1 t t 1 y t t for a grid g d g is the probability distribution induced by the data d on the cells of g i d g denotes mutual information function b n n 0 6 and d is the size of data d t is the total number of samples symbol t stands for time lag and its range is in 0 t 2 the purpose of tsca is to find the lag with the largest correlation coefficient which is t max let t change from 0 to t 2 and calculate the corresponding pc c t and mi c t in turn then find the t corresponding to the largest pc c t and mi c t as t max in subgraph c of fig 2 the time series correlation coefficient radar charts of the runoff process between the upstream station and the upstream station the upstream station and the midstream station and the upstream station and the downstream station are respectively shown from upstream to downstream the solid line with color in the radar chart represents the correlation coefficient corresponding to 0 to n step ahead and the red dotted line represents the step ahead number corresponding to the largest correlation coefficient the closer to the center of the radar chart the smaller the correlation coefficient and vice versa for the upstream station itself pc c 0 is the largest so t max 0 the t max of the midstream station and downstream station are 2 and 4 respectively the farther the upstream and downstream stations are the longer the lag time and the larger the t max tsca is not only conducive to exploring the correlation between upstream and downstream stations but also helps to solve the problems 2 and 3 raised in section 2 the value t max can provide guidance on how many 3 d scenarios are used for input and output in multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting model of multiple hydrological variables since the corresponding to t max is the largest it is not recommended that the longest forecast period exceed t max at the same time the number of historical 3 d scenarios used for forecast input should be greater than t max if the computer performance for training the model is better more historical scenario inputs can be considered 3 or 4 times the value of t max if the computer performance is relatively average the forecasting results with a number of inputs greater than t max or twice as large as t max is acceptable in this study it is recommended to use the number of historical scenarios twice to three times the value of t max as the forecasting model input and the number of scenarios equal to t max as the forecasting output 3 2 convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm lstm is good at processing sequence data while cnn is excellent for mining features in the input convolutional long short term memory neural network convlstm was proposed in 2015 integrating the advantages of both hu et al 2020 convolutional gated recurrent unit neural network convgru yu et al 2022 reduces the structure of three gates input gates forget gates output fates in convlstm to a structure of two gates reset gates update gates which reduces the training time without reducing the prediction accuracy further convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm is proposed in this study reducing the number of gate structures to one it greatly reduces the model parameters and training time improving the prediction accuracy the network structure of convmgm is shown in fig 3 the forward propagation formulas of convmgm are as follows 3 ne t t w h h t 1 w x x t 4 f t σ n e t t σ w h h t 1 w x x t 5 i t 1 f t 6 a t tanh n e t t t a n h w h h t 1 w x x t 7 h t f t h t 1 i t a t where w h and w x are weight tensors h t is the output of convmgm layer in t th period ne t t f t i t and a t are all intermediate variables in the t th period x t denotes the input features in the t th period whose shape is m q a m and q respectively represent the number of rows and columns in the study area after the stations are arranged in a rectangle and a is the number of key hydrological variables also called the channel number of the hidden state in deep learning study the complete inputs are x x 1 x 2 x t whose shape is t m q a t is the number of historical scenarios σ and tanh are sigmoid and tanh activation functions respectively symbols and are matrix multiplication between matrix elements and hadamard product also called the convolution operator respectively convlstm has four sets of weight tensors like w h and w x to train and convgru has three sets convmgm is reduced to a set which greatly reduces the training parameters and time and the prediction accuracy is also improved in the case study convmgm helps to solve the problem 4 raised in section 2 there are some conclusions greff et al 2017 about lstm variants by testing the performance of eight variant models on three typical cases 1 coupling the input and forget gates or removing peephole connections simplified lstm without significantly decreasing performance 2 the forget gate and the output activation function are the most critical components of the lstm block in network structure of convmgm input gates and forget gates are coupled i t 1 f t satisfying the first conclusion activation functions sigmoid and tanh are retained in convmgm satisfying the second conclusion these two points indicate that the design of convmgm is reasonable and has excellent precision 3 3 scenario forecasting model based on convmgm and conv3d cm c3d conv3d is a three dimensional convolutional neural network and its forward propagation formula can be found in ji et al 2013 convmgm has a temporal memory function and conv3d is good at mining the relationship in feature inputs both of which are beneficial for hydrological scenario forecasting the convmgm layer cm has the same input and output format as the conv3d layer c3d therefore combining these two types of layers as part of the hidden layer forms a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d the cm c3d model is a deterministic forecasting model which cannot quantify the forecasting uncertainty the input and output shapes of cm c3d model are both 4 d which solves the problem 1 raised in section 2 3 4 variational bayesian probabilistic forecasting framework 3 4 1 description of neural network probabilistic model probabilistic neural networks panidhapu et al 2020 differ from deterministic neural networks in that their weight variables obey a probabilistic distribution rather than a deterministic single value these probabilistic distributions describe the uncertainty of the weights and can thus be used to quantify the forecasting uncertainty a neural network can be viewed as deterministic model y f x w where x and y are inputs and outputs respectively w is the model weight tensor the deterministic neural network directly trains the model weight w after training w is deterministic value and y can be directly predicted by inputting x however in the neural network probabilistic model the weight w is no longer a deterministic value but obeys a certain probabilistic distribution p w at the same time the forecasting result is no longer a definite single value but a probability density function p y x 8 p y x p y x w p w d w where p y x represents the pdf of the forecast result corresponding to the input x p w is the model weight probabilistic distribution p y x w denotes the conditional probability density of the forecast result given the input x and model weight w 3 4 2 training of neural network probabilistic model given a training dataset d x y in order to obtain the probabilistic forecasting results by the above formula the posterior distribution of the weight needs to be solved first 9 p w d p d w p w p d where p w d is the posterior distribution of the weight w given the training set d p d w and p w are the likelihood and prior respectively p d is not affected by weight w unfortunately an analytical solution for the posterior p w d in neural networks is not tractable because of the intractable multidimensional integrals li et al 2021 therefore a variational distribution q w θ of known functional form whose parameters are need to estimate is used to approximate the true posterior p w d a better variational distribution q w θ is obtained by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence brunetti et al 2020 between q w θ and p w d 10 θ arg min θ k l q w θ p w d where θ represents the parameter with the optimal variational distribution after training kl q w θ p w d is the kl divergence between q w θ and p w d arg min θ is the function to find the corresponding parameter of the minimum kl divergence kl q w θ p w d can not be solved directly it can be deduced as follows 11 kl q w θ p w d q w θ log q w θ p w d d w q w θ log q w θ p d w p w p d d w q w θ log q w θ p w d w q w θ log p d w d w o g p d k l q w θ p w e q w θ log p d w log p d where e q w θ log p d w is called the expected log likelihood log p d does not depend on w minimizing kl q w θ p w d is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound elbo the formula of elbo is as follows 12 elbo e q w θ log p d w k l q w θ p w the first item e q w θ log p d w can be approximated by monte carlo estimation as follow 13 e q w θ log p d w 1 n n 1 n log p y n f x n w n w n q w θ 1 n n 1 n log p y n y n 1 n n 1 n l y n y n where the sample x n y n is sampled from the training set d n is the total number of samples each sample generates a weight w n from variational distribution q w θ y n is the forecast result given the input x n and model weight w n log p y n y n can be understood as a loss function l y n y n that measures the difference between observation y n and prediction y n the first term in the elbo formula is now computable in this study a scale mixture of two gaussians is used as prior distribution 14 p w λ n w 0 σ 1 2 1 λ n w 0 σ 2 2 where λ 0 1 σ 1 and σ 2 are hyper parameters and they are not learned during training liu et al 2020a b n w 0 σ 2 represents gaussian distribution a gaussian distribution is used for the variational posterior parameterized by θ μ σ 15 q w θ n μ σ 16 w μ σ ε ε n 0 1 where weight w is calculated according to the parameters μ σ and ε is a random number that obeys the normal distribution the work of directly training weights w in deterministic neural networks becomes training parameters μ σ of the variational distribution in variational bnn vbnn both p w and q w θ have specific function expressions and parameters therefore kl q w θ p w can also be calculated through the above derivation elbo can already be calculated and the parameters can be trained using gradient like optimization algorithms tsitsiklis et al 1986 3 4 3 forecasting of neural network probabilistic model after training the neural network probabilistic model the parameters of variational distribution are learned and can be used to finish probabilistic forecasting the pdf of forecasting result in eq 8 can be approximated as follows 17 p y x p y f x w q w θ d w although both p y f x w and q w θ are computable the analytical solution of p y x is still difficult to derive by integral derivation monte carlo simulation is used to randomly generate multiple parameters w 1 w 2 w n from q w θ and then obtain multiple predictions y 1 y 2 y n corresponding to the parameters w 1 w 2 w n and input x 18 y 1 y 2 y n f x w 1 w 2 w n w 1 w 2 w n q w θ the pdf of y 1 y 2 y n can be estimated by the kernel density estimation kde method benson et al 2021 3 5 variational bayesian scenario probabilistic forecasting model b cm c3d in this study a new hybrid deep learning model b cm c3d combined with convmgm conv3d and vbnn are built for hydrological scenario probabilistic forecasting whose network structure is shown as fig 4 the b cm c3d model has one input layer five hidden layers two convmgm layers two conv3d layers one vbnn layer and one output layer the input shape is t m q a and the meaning of variables t m q a is the same as above the first two hidden layers are convmgm layers called cm 1 layer and cm 2 layer respectively the third and fourth hidden layers are conv3d layers named c3d 1 layer and c3d 2 layer the fifth hidden layer is vbnn layer through which the deterministic forecasting results can be converted into probabilistic forecasting results the last layer is the output layer the output of which is the pdf of multiple variables for future forecasting hydrological scenarios the input shape output shape and hyperparameters of each layer are shown in fig 4 the combination of vbnn layer solves problem 5 raised in section 2 3 6 evaluation metrics 3 6 1 deterministic forecasting metrics in this study six metrics including coefficient of

model for the fairness of the comparison these models are trained by the adam optimizer with 200 epochs they are written in the python 3 8 programming language referencing the keras 2 7 0 and tensorflow 2 7 0 deep learning frameworks the computer configurations on which the experiments were run in this study are xeon w 2255 3 70 ghz cpu and single nvidia quadro p2200 gpu 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 task ⅰ correlation analysis results in order to make the forecasting model show better performance the spatial correlation of multiple stations in the study area is firstly explored and they are calculated by using the data at the same time 0 step ahead the spatial correlation coefficient of study area is show in fig 7 where the tributary stations are distinguished by purple wireframes the analysis results are as follows 1 the water level and flow of each station have a strong correlation 2 stations that are close to each other in space are more relevant 3 from tgd to ls on the main stream the correlation shows a decreasing trend indicating that the upstream station flow has an influence on the downstream flow but the influence will gradually weaken this correlation shows transitivity and taking these variables together as the input and output of the forecast model is beneficial to improve the forecast accuracy 4 the flow of the tributary into the station has a certain correlation with the flow of the adjacent stations on the main stream because it is one of the components of the main stream flow flow and water level at tributary stations are also important factors in the forecast input the spatial correlation map of 0 step ahead helps us to obtain the information of the forecast input factors but we cannot use the upstream flows such as tgd q jl q etc at time t to predict ls q at time t because these variables are unknown at the time t therefore it is especially necessary to explore the temporal correlations of these multiple stations at the same time there is a time lag in the propagation of upstream flow to downstream flow analyzing the time lag when the outflow of tgd propagates to key downstream stations is helpful to determine the number of historical 3 d scenarios used for forecasting and the number of forecasted 3 d scenarios the time series correlation diagram of tgd s outflow and flow of key downstream stations zc ss jl ls is show in fig 8 where the blue and purple lines represent the pcc and mic lines for t step ahead t varies from 0 to 16 the green line corresponds to the t of the maximum pcc namely t max in section 3 1 which represents the time lag of the outflow of tgd to the station the grey area represents the interval of high correlation coefficient 0 7 1 namely hcc interval if the pcc or mic of t step ahead within the interval the outflow of tgd at the current time can be used to predict the flow of the station after t time periods the results of the time series correlation analysis in this experiment are as follows 1 the outflow of tgd and zc s flow ss s flow jl s flow and ls s flow reach the maximum value in the 1st 2nd 4th and 12th time periods respectively indicating that the evolution time lag of the flow in the river channel increases with the distance 2 for the study area tgd to ls it takes 12 time periods 12 6 h for the flow from the most upstream station tgd to evolve to the most downstream station ls therefore the largest step ahead of forecasting in this experiment is 12 the number of historical 3 d scenarios for forecasting input is between 24 and 36 and this experiment takes 28 exactly one week the shape of the input and output of this experiment is shown in fig 4 4 3 2 task ii comparison of different forecasting models the forecasting models b cm c3d b cl c3d b cg c3d b c3d and b cm are compared from three aspects deterministic forecasting accuracy comprehensive performance of probabilistic forecasting and training time a comparison of deterministic forecasting accuracy a total of 240 predictions 10 stations 2 types of hydrological variables 12 step ahead are completed for each model in this experiment each prediction result is evaluated by six deterministic prediction metrics and the number of times that each model performs the best in a total of 240 predictions is counted as shown in table 2 the results are analyzed as follows 1 r2 and mae are used to evaluate the average closeness of the predicted series to the true series and the b cm c3d model outperforms the other four models 188 and 191 times on these two metrics respectively the excellent rate is close to 80 2 maxae and minae evaluate the extreme value of the absolute error and the b cm c3d model has more optimal times on these two metrics than the other four models 3 maxvalueae and minvalueae evaluate the absolute errors of the extreme values of the sequence b cm has the best performance on the maxvalueae metric and b cm c3d has the best performance on the minvalueae metric which shows that the convmgm layer proposed in this study can bring higher prediction accuracy overall the hybrid deep learning model b cm c3d proposed in this study has great advantages in deterministic prediction accuracy to further illustrate the deterministic prediction accuracy of the b cm c3d model the r2 metrics of the multi step ahead forecasting results for key hydrological variables are shown in table 3 b cm c3d has the highest prediction accuracy on multi step ahead forecasting results of most variables and most of r2 on these three variables are higher than 0 9 which verifies the prediction accuracy of the proposed model b comparison of probabilistic forecasting comprehensive performance in order to verify the comprehensive performance of the probabilistic forecasting model the crps metrics of the probabilistic forecasting results of each model are calculated as shown in table 4 crps is calculated by the observation value and the predicted pdf which can comprehensively evaluate whether the mean value of the distribution is close to the observation value and whether the shape of the distribution is too high or too low too wide or too narrow the crps metric of the b cm c3d model is lower than the other four models in most cases indicating that the comprehensive performance of the probabilistic forecasting model proposed in this study is better c comparison of training time inspired by the improvement of convgru convmgm further reduces the gate structure in convlstm cell to only one in order to verify the reduced training time advantage brought by convmgm the trainable parameters and training time of the three models b cm c3d b cl c3d b cg c3d in the experiments are listed in table 5 for the fairness of the comparison the b c3d and b cm models do not participate in the comparison because their structures are different from those of the three models convmgm layer reduces the trainable parameters of convlstm layer and convgru layer thereby reducing the trainable parameters and training time of the entire model b cm c3d 4 3 3 task iii comparison of the multi step ahead forecasting results for multiple stations the multi step ahead deterministic forecasting metrics for multiple stations are shown in fig 9 the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 from the perspective of the spatial position relationship of the stations the prediction accuracy of the tributary stations is lower than that of the main stream which is consistent with the conclusion of the spatial correlation analysis in fig 7 2 from the perspective of the length of the forecast period the forecast accuracy of the period farther from the facing period is generally lower 3 from the perspective of the types of hydrological variables the prediction accuracy of flow is lower than that of water level because the fluctuation range of water level is smaller than that of flow 4 3 4 task iv display the single step ahead forecasting results in order to compare the prediction results of each model more intuitively the single step ahead prediction results of key hydrological variables of key stations are selected to display the flood season results in the validation set as shown in fig 10 the validation set spans from 2020 to 01 01 02 00 00 to 2021 01 01 02 00 00 with flood periods 2020 05 30 02 00 00 to 2020 10 02 02 00 00 exactly 500 periods the solid line with color in the figure represents the predictions of each model and the observations the gray interval represents the 90 prediction interval of b cm c3d the green point represents the observation point outside the interval and the purple histogram is the prediction residuals of b cm c3d the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 the prediction line of b cm c3d is closer to the observation line than the prediction results of other models which intuitively verifies the prediction accuracy of the model proposed in this study 2 most of the observations are within the prediction intervals and the interval is wide in the position with large error and narrow in the position with small error which shows that the prediction interval of b cm c3d model is suitable 4 3 5 task v display the multi step ahead forecasting results the multi step ahead prediction results of key hydrological variables of key stations are shown in fig 11 figures a and b select 2020 08 01 20 00 00 and 2020 08 22 08 00 00 as typical time periods respectively the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 the prediction result of the b cm c3d model is closer to the observations which also verifies the prediction accuracy of the model 2 from 1 step ahead to 12 step ahead the results of the b cm c3d model gradually deviate from the observation line the conclusions from the analysis of the figures are the same as those from the analysis of the metrics 4 3 6 task vi display of probability density function the pdf figures of key hydrological variables of key stations are shown in fig 12 it can be seen from these figures that some observations are close to the mean of pdf and the other part is far from the mean of pdf which shows that the predicted pdf is reasonable it is unreliable if all distribution function means are close to the observation or far from the observation at the same time these distribution functions are not too high or too low too wide or too narrow which also shows the rationality of probabilistic forecasting 4 3 7 task vii verify the reliability of the forecast model the pit figures of key hydrological variables of key stations predicted by b cm c3d are shown in fig 13 the pit values are within the kolmogorov 5 significance band indicating that the pit value of the probabilistic forecast results obeys a uniform distribution which further verifies the reliability of probabilistic forecasting 5 conclusions this study focuses on multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables under the background of rbdt first of all the background of rbdt is introduced which in turn describes a 4 d time series scenario for multi station hydrological forecasting then five key problems that need to be addressed in detail are proposed a time series correlation analysis method is proposed to analyze the correlation of upstream and downstream stations over time and to solve the problems of the number of historical scenario inputs and the number of future scenario outputs considered in problem 2 and problem 3 in section 2 next a new deep learning neural network layer convmgm is proposed to reduce the training time of convlstm which can be used to solve problem 4 in section 2 further convmgm and conv3d are combined into a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d for scenario forecasting which solves problem 1 in section 2 to address problem 5 in section 2 a variational bayesian probabilistic forecasting framework is introduced to quantify the forecasting uncertainty of the cm c3d model finally the performance of the model proposed in this study is verified on the case of the yangtze river basin and the six main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the model b cm c3d proposed in this study is superior to other comparative models in terms of deterministic forecast accuracy and probabilistic forecast comprehensive performance with an excellent rate of about 80 2 b cm c3d shortens the training time of b cl c3d by about 43 3 the probabilistic forecasting results of b cm c3d are reliable under kolmogorov s 5 confidence level 4 as the forecast period becomes longer the accuracy of the forecast results decreases 5 the water level prediction results at the same station are higher than the flow prediction results 6 the difference in the accuracy of the prediction results of different stations is basically the same as the difference in the spatial correlation results in the experimental cases of this study observed runoff values at gbzd and lht stations were missing or not collected and water levels at the same stations were used as substitutes the ungauged watershed issue is important because the same situation may be encountered in rbdt applications the suggestions for missing data in this study are as follows 1 for a small number of missing data interpolation is a good processing method 2 for a large number of missing data these data can be abandoned and replaced by other variables with similar characteristics to ensure the overall accuracy credit authorship contribution statement zhendong zhang

2324,the demand for more accurate simulation of physical river basin puts forward higher requirements on the number of hydrological forecast stations types of hydrological variables forecast accuracy forecast period and quantitative uncertainty therefore how to simultaneously obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations is a key issue to be solved in this study firstly the background of river basin digital twin is introduced and the new problems faced by hydrological forecasting in this background are analyzed then the input and output of hydrological forecasting are reconstructed into 4 d tensors next a new hybrid deep learning model b cm c3d based on 3 d convolutional neural network convolutional minimum gate memory neural network and variational bayesian neural network is proposed to obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations finally in order to verify the performance of this model it was compared with four state of the art models in the yangtze river basin the experimental results show that 1 the deterministic prediction accuracy and probabilistic forecasting comprehensive performance of b cm c3d are better than other comparison models in 80 of the results 2 b cm c3d shortens the training time of b cl c3d by 43 and improves the prediction accuracy keywords river basin digital twin hydrological forecasting probabilistic forecasting deep learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction digital twin dt refers to a system that simulates the real world within a virtualized world sookhak lari et al 2022 river basin digital twin rbdt is the mapping of physical river basin in the digital world and ideally it can simulate the running laws of physical river basin rbdt has two key aspects external display and internal driving the former makes rbdt look like a physical river basin and the latter makes rbdt operate according to the laws of the physical river basin in order to simulate the physical river basin more accurately in rbdt it is inseparable from the high precision forecasting model scheduling model flood evolution model and other models zhang et al 2012 this study focuses on hydrological forecasting in the context of rbdt which needs to consider the following four important aspects 1 the flow of downstream stations is affected by the flow of upstream stations 2 the hydrological variables such as flow and water level in the river channel also influence each other 3 multi step ahead forecasting of hydrological variables provide more information than single step ahead forecasting 4 there are uncertainties in hydrological forecasts therefore how to simultaneously obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations under the background of rbdt is the purpose of this study hydrological prediction methods are mainly divided into two categories physical process driven methods and data driven methods liu et al 2018 the physical process driven method is based on principle of hydrology muluye 2011 such as the xin an river model zang et al 2021 due to the strong correlation between rainfall and runoff the numerical weather prediction nwp ming et al 2020 model is also used to assist runoff forecasting usually the nwp model is used to achieve rainfall forecasting and then complete the runoff forecasting zhao et al 2022 the advantage of the physical process driven method is that the model is highly interpretable but the disadvantage is that it requires more basic data complex modeling and time consuming solution papadopoulos et al 2008 data driven methods usually use statistical methods such as machine learning or deep learning to predict hydrological variables based on historical runoff information and meteorological related factors quaghebeur et al 2022 the advantages of the data driven method are that the calculation speed is fast and the prediction accuracy is high the disadvantage is that the forecast model is a black box model and has poor interpretability ghaith et al 2020 common data driven methods can be classified into time series models machine learning or deep learning models and multi method hybrid models zhang et al 2021 the prerequisite for using time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima yan et al 2022 for prediction is that the data satisfy the assumption of stationarity or the assumption of stationarity after differential processing zhang et al 2019a which limits the application scenarios of this type of model in order to deal with the nonlinear and random characteristics of hydrological variables support vector regression svr kalteh 2014 extreme learning machine elm boucher et al 2020 artificial neural network ann ghazvinian et al 2021 and other machine learning models chen et al 2021 are often used for hydrological forecasting in recent years with the vigorous development of computer technology and artificial intelligence deep learning models lecun et al 2015 have been gradually applied in the field of hydrological prediction long short term memory network lstm gers et al 2000 and convolutional neural network cnn liu et al 2020a b are used in hydrology prediction because they are good at time series processing and feature extraction respectively in order to overcome the shortcomings of a single prediction model and take advantage of multiple prediction models at the same time hybrid models have gradually become the mainstream method of hydrological prediction wan et al 2019 such as the combination of time series model and machine learning model arima ann khan et al 2020 the combination of modal decomposition mechanism and deep learning models zuo et al 2020 the combination of lstm and cnn deep learning models barzegar et al 2021 etc at the same time graph neural network gnn began to be used to model the unknown spatial temporal connectivity in river network so as to serve the hydrological forecast sun et al 2021 sun et al 2022 affected by the uncertainty characteristics of hydrological variables krzystofowicz 1999 the deterministic forecasting results provide limited information to dispatch decision makers hydrological probabilistic forecasting is becoming a research hotspot and trend in the field of hydrological forecasting it is one of the ideas to construct predictive intervals corresponding to a certain confidence level khosravi et al 2011 to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological variables more comprehensively the probability prediction model based on bayesian theory huang et al 2019 gaussian process regression gpr kleiber et al 2012 or quantile regression qr zhang et al 2019b combined with kernel density estimation kde benson et al 2021 can be used to obtained the probability density function of hydrological variables which can provide more abundant information for dispatchers the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique is used to reduce parameter uncertainty in a conceptual hydrological modeling application lin et al 2014 the markov chain monte carlo approach uses markov chains to simulate the stochastic process by preserving the state transition probability of the samples wu et al 2019 the bayesian forecasting system is an analysis method applicable to correction of real time streamflow error based on real time rainfall information ajami et al 2007 the existing multi step ahead forecasting methods usually have two ideas one is to use the results of single step ahead forecasting as the input to roll the forecast model multiple times in this way the accumulation of errors is serious and it is easy to appear that the trend is always rising or falling and it is difficult to predict the inflection point in the multi step ahead forecasting results another way is to construct multiple forecasting model by dislocating time series data this method does not consider the hydrological variables of multiple forecast periods as a whole and the multiple single step ahead forecasting models are separated bayesian inference is a probabilistic forecasting framework when it is combined with different deterministic forecast models it is necessary to deduce the formula on the basis of the original framework idea to complete the uncertainty quantification of the deterministic forecast model the training of deep learning models is usually time consuming therefore the key problems to be solved in this study are as follows 1 how to obtain the forecasting results of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations at the same time 2 how does multi step ahead forecasting achieve the overall consideration 3 how to use bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty of the multi step ahead forecasting results of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations 4 how to reduce the training time of the model in this study a probabilistic forecasting hybrid model based on 3 d convolutional neural network conv3d ji et al 2013 convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm and variational bayesian neural network vbnn liu et al 2020a b is proposed to obtain multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables for multiple stations under the background of rbdt the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the time series of multiple hydrological variables for multi stations are rearranged into 4 d tensors 2 a new deep learning neural network layer convmgm is proposed which shortens the training time of the existing convolutional long short term memory network convlstm layer and improves the prediction accuracy 3 conv3d and convmgm are combined into a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d which combines the advantages that conv3d is good at mining features and convmgm is good at processing time series 4 using the variational bayesian framework to quantify the uncertainty of cm c3d a complete new probabilistic forecasting deep learning model b cm c3d is obtained the remaining sections of this paper are as follows the background of rbdt is introduced in section 2 the methods used in this study are described in section 3 a case study to verify the performance of this research is completed in section 4 the last section summarizes the content and conclusions of this study 2 background of river basin digital twin rbdt can be simply understood as building a physical real world river basin in the digital world the two key points in the construction of rbdt are the three dimensional visualization technology and the river basin operation model the former makes rbdt look like a real river basin and the latter enables rbdt to truly map the real river basin by simulating the key hydrological processes of the river basin forecast models reservoir scheduling models and flow evolution models are all important components of the basin operation model the focus of this study is how to simulate or predict the processes of the hydrological variable at multiple key sites in the river channel and quantify the forecasting uncertainty the schematic diagram of rbdt is shown in fig 1 where sub figure a represents the physical real river basin usually a real river will be cut into multiple river segments by reservoirs hydrological stations and other stations these stations and river segments constitute the two dimensional topolopy in the digital world shown as sub figure b there are multiple key hydrological variables at each station such as water level z runoff r and precipitation p the 2 dimensional structure becomes a 3 dimensional scene by taking into account the hydrological variables shown as sub figure c at the same time most of these hydrological elements are time series therefore the complete rbdt is a 4 dimensional time series scenario shown as sub figure d the work of this research is using historical 4 d time series scenarios to predict future 4 d time series scenarios the detailed problems to be solved in this study are as follows 1 how to construct a forecast model with 4 d input and 4 d output 2 how many historical scenarios are suitable for forecasting if the number of historical 3 d scenarios is too small the prediction accuracy will be too low and if the number is too large the model training will be very time consuming 3 it is appropriate to predict how many 3 d scenarios in the future at most if the number of predicted future scenarios is too large the accuracy will be reduced 4 how to improve such a complex forecasting model to increase its forecasting accuracy and reduce training time 5 no model can predict perfectly and there is always uncertainty how to obtain the probability density function pdf of the 4 d scenario is the key problem to be solved in this research 3 methods 3 1 time series correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient pcc busico et al 2020 and maximum information coefficient mic zhang et al 2019c are common correlation analysis methods they usually analyze two groups of variables at the same time but if there is a time lag between the two groups of variables it will affect the analysis results when a flood flows from upstream to downstream in a river channel the upstream runoff is correlated with the downstream runoff at the same time considering the influence of water flow speed it takes a period of time for the upstream flood peak to propagate to the downstream this phenomenon can be characterized by subgraph a and subgraph b in fig 2 if the runoff process between the upstream station and the downstream station at the same time are used to calculate the correlation coefficient the result will be small as shown in area i of sub figure b therefore a time series correlation analysis tsca method is proposed in this study to analyze the correlation of hydrological processes with time lags the formulas for calculating t step ahead pcc and mic are as follows 1 pc c t t 0 t 2 p c c x 1 t t 1 y t t i 1 t t 1 x i x 1 t t 1 y i y t t i 1 t t 1 x i x 1 t t 1 2 i 1 t t 1 y i y t t 2 2 mi c t t 0 t 2 m i c x 1 t t 1 y t t max xy b d i d x 1 t t 1 y t t log 2 min x 1 t t 1 y t t max xy b d max g i d g log 2 min x 1 t t 1 y t t where pc c t and mi c t are t step ahead pcc and mic respectively x 1 t t 1 represents samples of the independent variable indexed from 1 to t t 1 and y t t represents samples of the dependent variable indexed from t to t x 1 t t 1 and y t t are sample means d is a set of ordered pairs for x 1 t t 1 y t t for a grid g d g is the probability distribution induced by the data d on the cells of g i d g denotes mutual information function b n n 0 6 and d is the size of data d t is the total number of samples symbol t stands for time lag and its range is in 0 t 2 the purpose of tsca is to find the lag with the largest correlation coefficient which is t max let t change from 0 to t 2 and calculate the corresponding pc c t and mi c t in turn then find the t corresponding to the largest pc c t and mi c t as t max in subgraph c of fig 2 the time series correlation coefficient radar charts of the runoff process between the upstream station and the upstream station the upstream station and the midstream station and the upstream station and the downstream station are respectively shown from upstream to downstream the solid line with color in the radar chart represents the correlation coefficient corresponding to 0 to n step ahead and the red dotted line represents the step ahead number corresponding to the largest correlation coefficient the closer to the center of the radar chart the smaller the correlation coefficient and vice versa for the upstream station itself pc c 0 is the largest so t max 0 the t max of the midstream station and downstream station are 2 and 4 respectively the farther the upstream and downstream stations are the longer the lag time and the larger the t max tsca is not only conducive to exploring the correlation between upstream and downstream stations but also helps to solve the problems 2 and 3 raised in section 2 the value t max can provide guidance on how many 3 d scenarios are used for input and output in multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting model of multiple hydrological variables since the corresponding to t max is the largest it is not recommended that the longest forecast period exceed t max at the same time the number of historical 3 d scenarios used for forecast input should be greater than t max if the computer performance for training the model is better more historical scenario inputs can be considered 3 or 4 times the value of t max if the computer performance is relatively average the forecasting results with a number of inputs greater than t max or twice as large as t max is acceptable in this study it is recommended to use the number of historical scenarios twice to three times the value of t max as the forecasting model input and the number of scenarios equal to t max as the forecasting output 3 2 convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm lstm is good at processing sequence data while cnn is excellent for mining features in the input convolutional long short term memory neural network convlstm was proposed in 2015 integrating the advantages of both hu et al 2020 convolutional gated recurrent unit neural network convgru yu et al 2022 reduces the structure of three gates input gates forget gates output fates in convlstm to a structure of two gates reset gates update gates which reduces the training time without reducing the prediction accuracy further convolutional minimum gate memory neural network convmgm is proposed in this study reducing the number of gate structures to one it greatly reduces the model parameters and training time improving the prediction accuracy the network structure of convmgm is shown in fig 3 the forward propagation formulas of convmgm are as follows 3 ne t t w h h t 1 w x x t 4 f t σ n e t t σ w h h t 1 w x x t 5 i t 1 f t 6 a t tanh n e t t t a n h w h h t 1 w x x t 7 h t f t h t 1 i t a t where w h and w x are weight tensors h t is the output of convmgm layer in t th period ne t t f t i t and a t are all intermediate variables in the t th period x t denotes the input features in the t th period whose shape is m q a m and q respectively represent the number of rows and columns in the study area after the stations are arranged in a rectangle and a is the number of key hydrological variables also called the channel number of the hidden state in deep learning study the complete inputs are x x 1 x 2 x t whose shape is t m q a t is the number of historical scenarios σ and tanh are sigmoid and tanh activation functions respectively symbols and are matrix multiplication between matrix elements and hadamard product also called the convolution operator respectively convlstm has four sets of weight tensors like w h and w x to train and convgru has three sets convmgm is reduced to a set which greatly reduces the training parameters and time and the prediction accuracy is also improved in the case study convmgm helps to solve the problem 4 raised in section 2 there are some conclusions greff et al 2017 about lstm variants by testing the performance of eight variant models on three typical cases 1 coupling the input and forget gates or removing peephole connections simplified lstm without significantly decreasing performance 2 the forget gate and the output activation function are the most critical components of the lstm block in network structure of convmgm input gates and forget gates are coupled i t 1 f t satisfying the first conclusion activation functions sigmoid and tanh are retained in convmgm satisfying the second conclusion these two points indicate that the design of convmgm is reasonable and has excellent precision 3 3 scenario forecasting model based on convmgm and conv3d cm c3d conv3d is a three dimensional convolutional neural network and its forward propagation formula can be found in ji et al 2013 convmgm has a temporal memory function and conv3d is good at mining the relationship in feature inputs both of which are beneficial for hydrological scenario forecasting the convmgm layer cm has the same input and output format as the conv3d layer c3d therefore combining these two types of layers as part of the hidden layer forms a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d the cm c3d model is a deterministic forecasting model which cannot quantify the forecasting uncertainty the input and output shapes of cm c3d model are both 4 d which solves the problem 1 raised in section 2 3 4 variational bayesian probabilistic forecasting framework 3 4 1 description of neural network probabilistic model probabilistic neural networks panidhapu et al 2020 differ from deterministic neural networks in that their weight variables obey a probabilistic distribution rather than a deterministic single value these probabilistic distributions describe the uncertainty of the weights and can thus be used to quantify the forecasting uncertainty a neural network can be viewed as deterministic model y f x w where x and y are inputs and outputs respectively w is the model weight tensor the deterministic neural network directly trains the model weight w after training w is deterministic value and y can be directly predicted by inputting x however in the neural network probabilistic model the weight w is no longer a deterministic value but obeys a certain probabilistic distribution p w at the same time the forecasting result is no longer a definite single value but a probability density function p y x 8 p y x p y x w p w d w where p y x represents the pdf of the forecast result corresponding to the input x p w is the model weight probabilistic distribution p y x w denotes the conditional probability density of the forecast result given the input x and model weight w 3 4 2 training of neural network probabilistic model given a training dataset d x y in order to obtain the probabilistic forecasting results by the above formula the posterior distribution of the weight needs to be solved first 9 p w d p d w p w p d where p w d is the posterior distribution of the weight w given the training set d p d w and p w are the likelihood and prior respectively p d is not affected by weight w unfortunately an analytical solution for the posterior p w d in neural networks is not tractable because of the intractable multidimensional integrals li et al 2021 therefore a variational distribution q w θ of known functional form whose parameters are need to estimate is used to approximate the true posterior p w d a better variational distribution q w θ is obtained by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence brunetti et al 2020 between q w θ and p w d 10 θ arg min θ k l q w θ p w d where θ represents the parameter with the optimal variational distribution after training kl q w θ p w d is the kl divergence between q w θ and p w d arg min θ is the function to find the corresponding parameter of the minimum kl divergence kl q w θ p w d can not be solved directly it can be deduced as follows 11 kl q w θ p w d q w θ log q w θ p w d d w q w θ log q w θ p d w p w p d d w q w θ log q w θ p w d w q w θ log p d w d w o g p d k l q w θ p w e q w θ log p d w log p d where e q w θ log p d w is called the expected log likelihood log p d does not depend on w minimizing kl q w θ p w d is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound elbo the formula of elbo is as follows 12 elbo e q w θ log p d w k l q w θ p w the first item e q w θ log p d w can be approximated by monte carlo estimation as follow 13 e q w θ log p d w 1 n n 1 n log p y n f x n w n w n q w θ 1 n n 1 n log p y n y n 1 n n 1 n l y n y n where the sample x n y n is sampled from the training set d n is the total number of samples each sample generates a weight w n from variational distribution q w θ y n is the forecast result given the input x n and model weight w n log p y n y n can be understood as a loss function l y n y n that measures the difference between observation y n and prediction y n the first term in the elbo formula is now computable in this study a scale mixture of two gaussians is used as prior distribution 14 p w λ n w 0 σ 1 2 1 λ n w 0 σ 2 2 where λ 0 1 σ 1 and σ 2 are hyper parameters and they are not learned during training liu et al 2020a b n w 0 σ 2 represents gaussian distribution a gaussian distribution is used for the variational posterior parameterized by θ μ σ 15 q w θ n μ σ 16 w μ σ ε ε n 0 1 where weight w is calculated according to the parameters μ σ and ε is a random number that obeys the normal distribution the work of directly training weights w in deterministic neural networks becomes training parameters μ σ of the variational distribution in variational bnn vbnn both p w and q w θ have specific function expressions and parameters therefore kl q w θ p w can also be calculated through the above derivation elbo can already be calculated and the parameters can be trained using gradient like optimization algorithms tsitsiklis et al 1986 3 4 3 forecasting of neural network probabilistic model after training the neural network probabilistic model the parameters of variational distribution are learned and can be used to finish probabilistic forecasting the pdf of forecasting result in eq 8 can be approximated as follows 17 p y x p y f x w q w θ d w although both p y f x w and q w θ are computable the analytical solution of p y x is still difficult to derive by integral derivation monte carlo simulation is used to randomly generate multiple parameters w 1 w 2 w n from q w θ and then obtain multiple predictions y 1 y 2 y n corresponding to the parameters w 1 w 2 w n and input x 18 y 1 y 2 y n f x w 1 w 2 w n w 1 w 2 w n q w θ the pdf of y 1 y 2 y n can be estimated by the kernel density estimation kde method benson et al 2021 3 5 variational bayesian

and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin whose schematic diagram is shown in fig 5 the study area is concentrated on the main stream from the three gorges dam tgd to the luoshan ls hydrological station with the confluence of the qingjiang river and dongting lake dtl in the middle there are three reservoirs and seven hydrological stations in the digital twin scene of the study area and they are rearranged into a 2 5 matrix as shown in fig 6 a in the experiment two key hydrological variables water level and flow are predicted for each station represented by the symbols z and q as shown in fig 6 b the water level and flow of the reservoir refer to the downstream water level and outflow not the upstream water level and inflow considering multiple historical scenes a four dimensional input is formed as shown in fig 6 c the case study is carried out using historical data from 2 00 on january 1 2018 to 2 00 on january 1 2021 the time interval of time series data is 6 h and the total number of samples is 4383 the data from 2 00 on january 1 2018 to 2 00 on january 1 2020 is used as the training set and the data from 2 00 on january 1 2020 to 2 00 on january 1 2021 is used as the validation set the names of each station and the statistical values of hydrological variables are shown in table 1 since the flow data of gaobazhou dam and lianhuatang have not been collected in order to ensure the integrity of the 4 d input the corresponding water level variables are used to fill 4 2 experimental design 4 2 1 aim of experiment in order to verify the performance of the model proposed in this study the following seven tasks need to be completed task ⅰ complete the time series correlation analysis and determine the number of historical 3 d scenarios used for forecasting and the number of forecasted 3 d scenarios task ⅱ verify the performance of b cm c3d model by comparing with the current cutting edge deep learning forecasting model in three aspects deterministic

comparing models and parameters in order to verify the performance of the forecasting model b cm c3d five hybrid forecasting models are compared by combining state of the art neural network layers convlstm convgru conv3d convmgm these layers are abbreviated as cl cg c3d and cm respectively 1 b cm c3d it is a new model proposed by combining cm and c3d and its network structure is abbreviated as i cm 1 cm 2 c3d 1 c3d 2 vbnn o i and o represent the input layer and output layer respectively cm 1 and cm 2 are two different cm layers c3d 1 and c3d 2 are two different c3d layers vbnn is a variational bayesian layer the intuitive network structure diagram of the b cm c3d model and the parameters of each layer are shown in fig 4 2 b cl c3d replacing the cm layer in the b cm c3d model with the cl layer forms the b cl c3d model i cl 1 cl 2 c3d 1 c3d 2 vbnn o 3 b cg c3d replacing the cm layer in the b cm c3d model with the cg layer forms the b cg c3d model i cg 1 cg 2 c3d 1 c3d 2

4 vbnn o the network structure diagrams of b cl c3d b cg c3d b c3d and b cm are similar to those of the b cm c3d model and the parameters of each layer are exactly the same as those of the b cm c3d model for the fairness of the comparison these models are trained by the adam optimizer with 200 epochs they are written in the python 3 8 programming language referencing the keras 2 7 0 and tensorflow 2 7 0 deep learning frameworks the computer configurations on which the experiments were run in this study are xeon w 2255 3 70 ghz cpu and single nvidia quadro p2200 gpu 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 task ⅰ correlation analysis results in order to make the forecasting model show better performance the spatial correlation of multiple stations in the study area is firstly explored and they are calculated by using the data at the same time 0 step ahead the spatial correlation coefficient of study area is show in fig 7 where the tributary stations are distinguished by purple wireframes the analysis results are as follows 1 the water level and flow of each station have a strong correlation 2 stations that are close to each other in space are more relevant 3 from tgd to ls on the main stream the correlation shows a decreasing trend indicating that the upstream station flow has an influence on the downstream flow but the influence will gradually weaken this correlation shows transitivity and taking these variables together as the input and output of the forecast model is beneficial to improve the forecast accuracy 4 the flow of the tributary into the station has a certain correlation with the flow of the adjacent stations on the main stream because it is one of the components of the main stream flow flow and water level at tributary stations are also important factors in the forecast input the spatial correlation map of 0 step ahead helps us to obtain the information of the forecast input factors but we cannot use the upstream flows such as tgd q jl q etc at time t to predict ls q at time t because these variables are unknown at the time t therefore it is especially necessary to explore the temporal correlations of these multiple stations at the same time there is a time lag in the propagation of upstream flow to downstream flow analyzing the time lag when the outflow of tgd propagates to key downstream stations is helpful to determine the number of historical 3 d scenarios used for forecasting and the number of forecasted 3 d scenarios the time series correlation diagram of tgd s outflow and flow of key downstream stations zc ss jl ls is show in fig 8 where the blue and purple lines represent the pcc and mic lines for t step ahead t varies from 0 to 16 the green line corresponds to the t of the maximum pcc namely t max in section 3 1 which represents the time lag of the outflow of tgd to the station the grey area represents the interval of high correlation coefficient 0 7 1 namely hcc interval if the pcc or mic of t step ahead within the interval the outflow of tgd at the current time can be used to predict the flow of the station after t time periods the results of the time series correlation analysis in this experiment are as follows 1 the outflow of tgd and zc s flow ss s flow jl s flow and ls s flow reach the maximum value in the 1st 2nd 4th and 12th time periods respectively indicating that the evolution time lag of the flow in the river channel increases with the distance 2 for the study area tgd to ls it takes 12 time periods 12 6 h for the flow from the most upstream station tgd to evolve to the most downstream station ls therefore the largest step ahead of forecasting in this experiment is 12 the number of historical 3 d scenarios for forecasting input is between 24 and 36 and this experiment takes 28 exactly one week the shape of the input and output of this experiment is shown in fig 4 4 3 2 task ii comparison of different forecasting models the forecasting models b cm c3d b cl c3d b cg c3d b c3d and b cm are compared from three aspects deterministic forecasting accuracy comprehensive performance of probabilistic forecasting and training time a comparison of deterministic forecasting accuracy a total of 240 predictions 10 stations 2 types of hydrological variables 12 step ahead are completed for each model in this experiment each prediction result is evaluated by six deterministic prediction metrics and the number of times that each model performs the best in a total of 240 predictions is counted as shown in table 2 the results are analyzed as follows 1 r2 and mae are used to evaluate the average closeness of the predicted series to the true series and the b cm c3d model outperforms the other four models 188 and 191 times on these two metrics respectively the excellent rate is close to 80 2 maxae and minae evaluate the extreme value of the absolute error and the b cm c3d model has more optimal times on these two metrics than the other four models 3 maxvalueae and minvalueae evaluate the absolute errors of the extreme values of the sequence b cm has the best performance on the maxvalueae metric and b cm c3d has the best performance on the minvalueae metric which shows that the convmgm layer proposed in this study can bring higher prediction accuracy overall the hybrid deep learning model b cm c3d proposed in this study has great advantages in deterministic prediction accuracy to further illustrate the deterministic prediction accuracy of the b cm c3d model the r2 metrics of the multi step ahead forecasting results for key hydrological variables are shown in table 3 b cm c3d has the highest prediction accuracy on multi step ahead forecasting results of most variables and most of r2 on these three variables are higher than 0 9 which verifies the prediction accuracy of the proposed model b comparison of probabilistic forecasting comprehensive performance in order to verify the comprehensive performance of the probabilistic forecasting model the crps metrics of the probabilistic forecasting results of each model are calculated as shown in table 4 crps is calculated by the observation value and the predicted pdf which can comprehensively evaluate whether the mean value of the distribution is close to the observation value and whether the shape of the distribution is too high or too low too wide or too narrow the crps metric of the b cm c3d model is lower than the other four models in most cases indicating that the comprehensive performance of the probabilistic forecasting model proposed in this study is better c comparison of training time inspired by the improvement of convgru convmgm further reduces the gate structure in convlstm cell to only one in order to verify the reduced training time advantage brought by convmgm the trainable parameters and training time of the three models b cm c3d b cl c3d b cg c3d in the experiments are listed in table 5 for the fairness of the comparison the b c3d and b cm models do not participate in the comparison because their structures are different from those of the three models convmgm layer reduces the trainable parameters of convlstm layer and convgru layer thereby reducing the trainable parameters and training time of the entire model b cm c3d 4 3 3 task iii comparison of the multi step ahead forecasting results for multiple stations the multi step ahead deterministic forecasting metrics for multiple stations are shown in fig 9 the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 from the perspective of the spatial position relationship of the stations the prediction accuracy of the tributary stations is lower than that of the main stream which is consistent with the conclusion of the spatial correlation analysis in fig 7 2 from the perspective of the length of the forecast period the forecast accuracy of the period farther from the facing period is generally lower 3 from the perspective of the types of hydrological variables the prediction accuracy of flow is lower than that of water level because the fluctuation range of water level is smaller than that of flow 4 3 4 task iv display the single step ahead forecasting results in order to compare the prediction results of each model more intuitively the single step ahead prediction results of key hydrological variables of key stations are selected to display the flood season results in the validation set as shown in fig 10 the validation set spans from 2020 to 01 01 02 00 00 to 2021 01 01 02 00 00 with flood periods 2020 05 30 02 00 00 to 2020 10 02 02 00 00 exactly 500 periods the solid line with color in the figure represents the predictions of each model and the observations the gray interval represents the 90 prediction interval of b cm c3d the green point represents the observation point outside the interval and the purple histogram is the prediction residuals of b cm c3d the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 the prediction line of b cm c3d is closer to the observation line than the prediction results of other models which intuitively verifies the prediction accuracy of the model proposed in this study 2 most of the observations are within the prediction intervals and the interval is wide in the position with large error and narrow in the position with small error which shows that the prediction interval of b cm c3d model is suitable 4 3 5 task v display the multi step ahead forecasting results the multi step ahead prediction results of key hydrological variables of key stations are shown in fig 11 figures a and b select 2020 08 01 20 00 00 and 2020 08 22 08 00 00 as typical time periods respectively the following results can be analyzed from the figure 1 the prediction result of the b cm c3d model is closer to the observations which also verifies the prediction accuracy of the model 2 from 1 step ahead to 12 step ahead the results of the b cm c3d model gradually deviate from the observation line the conclusions from the analysis of the figures are the same as those from the analysis of the metrics 4 3 6 task vi display of probability density function the pdf figures of key hydrological variables of key stations are shown in fig 12 it can be seen from these figures that some observations are close to the mean of pdf and the other part is far from the mean of pdf which shows that the predicted pdf is reasonable it is unreliable if all distribution function means are close to the observation or far from the observation at the same time these distribution functions are not too high or too low too wide or too narrow which also shows the rationality of probabilistic forecasting 4 3 7 task vii verify the reliability of the forecast model the pit figures of key hydrological variables of key stations predicted by b cm c3d are shown in fig 13 the pit values are within the kolmogorov 5 significance band indicating that the pit value of the probabilistic forecast results obeys a uniform distribution which further verifies the reliability of probabilistic forecasting 5 conclusions this study focuses on multi step ahead probabilistic forecasting of multiple hydrological variables under the background of rbdt first of all the background of rbdt is introduced which in turn describes a 4 d time series scenario for multi station hydrological forecasting then five key problems that need to be addressed in detail are proposed a time series correlation analysis method is proposed to analyze the correlation of upstream and downstream stations over time and to solve the problems of the number of historical scenario inputs and the number of future scenario outputs considered in problem 2 and problem 3 in section 2 next a new deep learning neural network layer convmgm is proposed to reduce the training time of convlstm which can be used to solve problem 4 in section 2 further convmgm and conv3d are combined into a new hybrid deep learning model cm c3d for scenario forecasting which solves problem 1 in section 2 to address problem 5 in section 2 a variational bayesian probabilistic forecasting framework is introduced to quantify the forecasting uncertainty of the cm c3d model finally the performance of the model proposed in this study is verified on the case of the yangtze river basin and the six main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the model b cm c3d proposed in this study is superior to other comparative models in terms of deterministic forecast accuracy and probabilistic forecast comprehensive performance with an excellent rate of about 80 2 b cm c3d shortens the training time of b cl c3d by about 43 3 the probabilistic forecasting results of b cm c3d are reliable under kolmogorov s 5 confidence level 4 as the forecast period becomes longer the accuracy of the forecast results decreases 5 the water level prediction results at the same station are higher than the flow prediction results 6 the difference in the accuracy of the prediction results of different stations is basically the same as the difference in the spatial correlation results in the experimental cases of this study observed runoff values at gbzd and lht stations were missing or not collected and water levels at the same stations were used as substitutes the ungauged watershed issue is important because the same situation may be encountered in rbdt applications the suggestions for missing data in this study are as follows 1 for a small number of missing data interpolation is a good processing method 2 for a large number of missing data these data can be abandoned and replaced by other variables with similar characteristics to ensure the overall accuracy credit authorship contribution statement zhendong zhang
