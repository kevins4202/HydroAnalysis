regarding small plastic particles known as microplastics mps i e plastic particles 5 mm has received a great deal of attention due to their potential pollution risk and threat to aquatic organisms 1 2 mps can be primary and secondary primary mps are manufactured directly and can be used in many personal care and cosmetic products while secondary mps can be formed by the erosion of large plastic debris via exposure to environmental stressors such as water wind and sunlight 3 6 as the production and use of plastic has steadily increased in recent decades as has the occurrence of mps in the environment 4 these new contaminants have now been detected in different aquatic environments including oceans rivers lakes and estuaries 7 mps have been shown to have a harmful effect on different organisms due to their small size and low rate of degradation 8 12 in recent years a large number of papers have reported the presence of mps in our environments especially in aquatic ecosystems 9 13 14 however the sources of mps have neither been adequately studied nor understood and there is a need to evaluate the potential risk they entail municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps have been shown to be a source of various types of mps and one contributor of mps entering aquatic media however few studies have been undertaken on mps in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and even less in their influents 15 this is likewise the case with respect to their removal during the wastewater treatment process 8 this situation is more alarming in the case of industrial wastewater treatment plants iwwtps which have been generally considered potential sources of mps 16 although no information is available for the levels of mps in industrial wastewater or for assessing their contribution to mp contamination 15 all this means that more data and mapping studies are needed worldwide to improve our knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of mps with respect to iwwtps as well as mwwtps this has been the motive for this paper the aim of which is to study mps in the area of cadiz southern spain where no data on mps are available such data are necessary due to the fact that this area is of special interest because it is adjacent to the straits of gibraltar which link the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea allowing the exchange of water and organisms between the two water bodies 17 the area of cadiz has a high degree of marine diversity 18 and is recognized as a marine protected area special protection area and important bird and biodiversity area 19 it should also be noted that there is as yet no legislation for mps at the spanish or european level or in fact at any country level however the new eu regulation regulation eu 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of may 25 2020 relative to the minimum requirements for the reuse of water begins to use the term mps stating that emerging pollutants like microcontaminants and mps will have to be considered when necessary and appropriate to ensure adequate protection of the environment and human and animal health accordingly the present scientific article constitutes a very useful adequate tool for the protection of the environment and human health and animal health the paper investigates the amount size shape and types of mps in the influents and effluents of different wastewater treatment plants in cadiz andalusia spain including both mwwtps which cover 50 of the population of the province and iwwtps a general overview of the transport and fate of the different mps was identified and quantified and an estimation was made of the amount of mps which may be released into the environment by the wastewater treatment plants under study wwtps the results of this paper comprise useful tools to obtain in depth knowledge of mps in different types of wwtps map an important environmental location estimate the amount of mps that are either directly discharged into the medium or that could be present in reusable waters and estimate the amount of mps that could be recovered from the final waste sludge which might constitute an important route for environmental emissions when land application is practised it is the first study to evaluate mps in the southern spain andalusia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the province of cadiz covers an area of approximately 7435 km2 located at the southwestern tip of spain and has a population around 1 250 000 inhabitants the main industries located in the bay of cadiz are related to marine construction ships and offshore platforms and aerospace manufacturing with rapid economic development having contributed to the increasingly serious pollution of ecosystems in this area during holiday periods this part of the coast hosts large numbers of tourists and the population can easily double or triple which inevitably increases the pollutant load discharged into wastewaters in order to establish a representative study of the area seven wwtps in the province of cadiz were analysed these represented a wide range of types of treatment plant both in terms of equivalent population between 500 and 300 000 inhab eq and origin of the wastewater either industrial or municipal the spatial distribution of the wwtps is shown in fig 1 iwwtps in red and mwwtps in black the municipal wastewaters considered in this study represent approximately 50 of the total municipal wastewaters for the area under study the selected representative industries comprised one iwwtp located in a typical local industrial estate iwwtp1 in which a mix of wastewaters from a cheese factory a slaughterhouse a leather goods firm a potato processing plant marble moulding and furniture manufacturing is treated and another iwwtp belonging to one of the most important marine construction firms in europe iwwtp2 table 1 provides a general description of the treatment plants where the research was carried out 2 2 sampling methodology sampling took place during november 2019 preliminary sampling tests were carried out prior to the actual sampling campaign in order to optimize the sampling methods and mitigate potential sample contamination during on site operations the transfer of samples and laboratory analyses influent wastewater samples were collected in the pre treatment section of each plant after coarse screening to avoid larger debris clogging or damaging the equipment used to filter the samples effluent samples were taken before the treated water discharge points after disinfection owing to difficult sampling conditions precise sampling points had to be adapted at some wwtps in this study wastewater samples were collected using a steel bucket and then filtered through a simple stack of three 8 inch diameter stainless steel sieves of various mesh sizes 1000 355 and 100 Î¼m municipal wastewater is characterized by its heterogeneous composition which is related to the population served and sewage system hence the sampled influent volume varied from 5 to 10 l whereas the volume of effluent collected ranged between 20 and 25 l 20 21 the sampled material on the stainless steel screens was rinsed into beakers using distilled water and left to dry in an oven at 75 c 2 3 pretreatment once the samples had been dried the wet peroxide oxidation wpo method was used in the presence of a fe ii catalyst to digest labile organic matter 22 23 twenty ml of aqueous 0 05 m fe ii solution and 20 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were added to the beaker containing the samples and then stirred using a magnetic stir bar at 75 c and 90 rev min for 30 min after oxidation wastewater samples containing mps were transferred for density separation with nacl 5 m aq finally the samples were filtered through a polycarbonate filter with a 45 mm diameter and 0 8 Î¼m pore size and were dried for approximately 24 h at 40 c after organic digestion the microplastics were characterized according to their physical and chemical features 2 4 physical and chemical analysis the physical characterization consisted in visual examination of the samples counting the number of mps collected according to their size and shape abundance for the physical analysis the wastewater filters were examined under a carl zeiss axio imager m1m optical microscope to facilitate particle counting gridded petri dishes with sequentially numbered grids were used to avoid duplicate or missed counts nonetheless visual identification entails miscalculations due to the difficulty in distinguishing samples due to their size chemical characterization comprised identification of the polymers that compose the microplastics chemical analysis was performed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on a perkinelmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer ftir measurements were performed to determine the composition of the mps generating a spectrum for each analysed particle in order to avoid contamination samples were covered using watch glass or aluminium foil plastic materials were avoided during the sampling characterization and determination of the microplastics in wastewater lab coats and gloves were worn during all procedures and all instruments materials and equipment were cleaned with alcohol before use additionally a filter for each wwtp was processed as a blank blanks were left exposed to the air during the visual sorting and identification of the microplastics 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp concentrations and removal efficiencies mps were widely detected in all of the sampled influents their concentrations were highly variable ranging from 1567 iwwtp2 to 264 mps l mwwtp3 mps in the effluents decreased drastically but also varied considerably from 131 iwwtp2 to 39 mps l mwwtp3 table 2 mp l values in the influent were in line with previous studies at mwwtps which usually range between 61 and 900 mps l 15 as regards iwwtps no data are available in the bibliography with which to compare our results this finding has been also highlighted by 15 and is probably due to companies not wanting to reveal or make public their pollution values as this could be detrimental to them and because the number of mwwtps is greater than that of iwwtps as expected higher concentrations were detected in iwwtp influents the marked difference in mps l between iwwtp1 and iwwtp2 is due to the fact that they are very different industries iwwtp1 represents an industrial treatment plant in an industrial estate that has the following activities cheese making a slaughterhouse a leather goods firm a potato processing plant marble moulding and furniture manufacturing whereas iwwtp2 belongs to a major industrial firm that builds and repairs large ships and manufactures offshore wind structures this company uses significant amounts of paint and solvent the high emission of mps from the use of paint can originate both from maintenance work carried out on ships in the shipyards or docks and from work carried out on the exterior and interior of buildings it should also be noted that ship coatings with a high content in mps are usually removed and replaced every 3 5 years via sanding or cleaning with an abrasive 24 and are also discharged to the treatment plant or directly to the environment a summary of the average removal efficiencies at all the mwwtps and iwwtps are presented in table 3 the abundance of mps in the effluents significantly decreased with respect to the influents indicating that mps can be efficiently removed in wwtps all the wwtps applied secondary treatment obtaining removal efficiencies that varied between 92 and 97 except for mwwtp2 where the removal efficacy was 78 the low values of this wwtp could be due to operating problems a situation already observed at this mwwtp in previous years by the regional government 25 however although the value is low compared to the rest of the treatment plants it is in line with those reported in the literature on mps which range between 72 and 99 5 6 15 26 3 2 size and shape the size and shape of mps are studied because they can have impact on the interaction with other contaminants or microorganisms in wastewater 6 representative optical microscopy images are provided in fig 2 although as stated in the previous section a lower abundance of total mps were found in effluents compared to influents the size and shape distribution of mps in the effluents resembled that in the influents fig 3 suggesting that no preferential removal of mps occurred in the mwwtps or iwwtps with respect to shape or size the same findings were also reported in previous studies 15 27 as regards size the majority of mps were less than 355 Î¼m representing around half of the particles detected in the influents of mwwtps as well as iwwtps fig 3 a this trend was also observed in the effluents fig 3 a the greater abundance of smaller plastics was also reported in previous studies in which over 70 of the mps were collected in the 2 smaller sizes 15 28 this abundance sequence may be explained by the potential destruction of larger plastics into smaller fragments with irregular shapes while in the sewer system 23 regarding shape the distribution in the influents and effluents of the mwwtps and iwwtps are shown in fig 3 b as stated above no differences in relative abundance were observed between influents and effluents fibres and fragments comprised the predominant shape 30 40 in the iwwtps and mwwtps flakes films and spheres were detected in a lower proportion with average values of 21 17 10 14 and 0 2 respectively in short fibres and fragments were the main observed shapes whereas films and spheres represented the least common the results obtained in this study are consistent with previous studies 6 7 20 28 31 laundry may be the main source of fibres as their generation occurs during textile washing fragments could stem from the fragmentation of larger plastics and films may be associated with plastic bag degradation spheres however are released into wastewater from personal care products 5 6 3 3 polymer types seventeen types of mps were investigated the relative abundance distribution and amount of common types of plastic being found to be very different in the influents and effluents of the iwwtps and mwwtps table 2 the most common mps in the influents of the mwwtps were polyvinyl chloride pvc high density polyethylene hdpe poly ethyl methacrylate pema polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene pe which have generally been observed in others studies of municipal wastewaters 10 15 32 34 and are commonly used in consumer products as well as packaging 35 as regards iwwtps iwwtp1 and iwwtp2 also exhibited major differences between their influents this is logical given that they are completely different industries as previously explained four types of mps were detected at both plants pvc hdpe pema and pe although no comparative data are available in the bibliography for this kind of wastewater the results seem to be very logical as pvc pe hdpe and pp are the most widely manufactured and demanded microplastics 36 regarding the effluents the results of this study seem to indicate that there may be a significant difference between the types of mps and their removal efficiencies as the distribution of mps in the influents of municipal and industrial wwtps is very different from that observed in the effluents from these plants fig 4 however a solid conclusion cannot be drawn since in order to determine whether there are significant differences between the different types of mps it would be necessary to monitor the influents and effluents of the treatment plants over the long term given that the discharges are likely to be highly variable it is very difficult to ensure that the sampled influent wastewater coincides with that of the effluent even when taking into consideration the hydraulic retention time of the wwtps this is the reason why some types of mps were only detected in the effluents such as polycylohexylenedimethylene terephthalate pct and ps which were detected only in the effluent from iwwtp2 and mwwtp1 respectively 3 4 estimation of microplastic levels in cadiz the mp values of the effluents of each of the treatment plants and their daily flows were considered in order to estimate the levels of mps discharged into the waters of cÃ¡diz the mps that are retained in the treatment plants were considered in order to estimate the mps that might reach the sludge generated at these plants these analyses show that the total amount of mps year in water and sludge from the effluents of the studied wwtps were 8 5 1011 and 1 2 1013 respectively considering that the municipal wastewaters evaluated in this study represent approximately 50 of the municipal wastewaters of the province of cadiz it could be predicted that twice as mps detected in the present paper may be discharged into the environment by treated wastewaters every year in cadiz this is a considerable number of mps especially considering that this area has a high degree of marine diversity 18 and is recognized as a marine protected area special protection area and important bird and biodiversity area 19 and even more so when taking into account the fact that there is an increasing trend in production of mps 15 35 special note should also be taken of the mps that may remain in the sludge as this might constitute an important route for environmental emissions when land application is practised it is important since it is well known that 50 of sewage sludge generated in north america and europe is used in agriculture as fertilizer which means that annually total amounts of 63 000 430 000 and 44 000 300 000 tons of microplastics are released to the soil respectively 37 a recent study 38 has evidenced that sewage sludge application is a vehicle for microplastics they quantification of microplastic pollution in agricultural fields through the application of sewage sludge in eastern spanish agricultural soils for this 16 agricultural fields were sampled soils without addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 930 740 mps kg and a heavy density plastic load of 1100 570 mps kg while soils with addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 2130 950 mps kg and a heavy density plastic load of 3060 1680 mps kg on average soils plastic loads increased by 280 light density mps kg and 430 heavy density mps kg with each successive application of sewage sludge indicating that sewage sludge application results in accumulation of mps in agricultural soils owing to the higher volume of municipal wastewaters regarding to industrial wastewaters the total amount of mps year in water from the effluents of the mwwtps are higher than iwwtps however if we compare mps l of wastewater discharged into the environment industries make a very significant contribution in terms of mps around 50 see fig 5 from this analysis it can be concluded that both types of treatment plants should be evaluated in future research and not only municipal wwtps the literature on wastewater is scarce and even more so for industrial wastewaters although industrial plants have been generally considered potential sources of mps 15 16 a recent paper in which the spatial distribution of mps in surface waters along the coast of korea showed that the mean abundance of mps in urban areas was about 1 5 times higher than in rural areas 31 the importance of the mps emissions in others points of spain has been also recently evidence 39 40 calculated that around 300 million microplastics per day were discharged into the henares river from a wwtp located in madrid center of spain one of the most industrialized areas in the country although a removal efficiency of 93 was achieved during the wastewater treatment process it means that the total amount of mps year in water from the effluents of this madrid wwtp designed to treat 45 000 m3 day were 1 1 1011 and it is line same order of magnitude with the mwwtp1 5 7 1011 and mwwtp 2 4 1011 studied in the present paper designed to treat aprox 49 000 m3 day and 100 000 m3 day respectively ref 40 studied the mps in a conventional mwwtps located in cartagena murcia southeast of spain serving about 210 000 equivalent inhabitants 35 000 m3 day they calculated that around 1 23 m p l are in their final effluents which means around 1 6 1010 mp year were discharged into the environment from cartagena wwtp our results regarding to the most prevalent forms fiber and fragments were also according to these spanish studies regarding the type of polymer although significant differences are evidenced in general pe pp and pema were also one of the most detected polymers in these recent studies 39 40 future studies on the toxicity of mps and their impact on aquatic environments surface and marine waters as well as the impact of mps on agricultural soils will be necessary to evaluate the possible harmful effects of mps 4 conclusions the present paper evidences that mp pollution in municipal and industrial wastewaters constitutes a source of mps discharged into environments mp levels mps l were higher in iwwtps than in mwwtps removal efficiencies were higher than 90 except for mwwtp1 78 the size and shape distribution of mps in

obtaining removal efficiencies that varied between 92 and 97 except for mwwtp2 where the removal efficacy was 78 the low values of this wwtp could be due to operating problems a situation already observed at this mwwtp in previous years by the regional government 25 however although the value is low compared to the rest of the treatment plants it is in line with those reported in the literature on mps which range between 72 and 99 5 6 15 26 3 2 size and shape the size and shape of mps are studied because they can have impact on the interaction with other contaminants or microorganisms in wastewater 6 representative optical microscopy images are provided in fig 2 although as stated in the previous section a lower abundance of total mps were found in effluents compared to influents the size and shape distribution of mps in the effluents resembled that in the influents fig 3 suggesting that no preferential removal of mps occurred in the mwwtps or iwwtps with respect to shape or size the same findings were also reported in previous studies 15 27 as regards size the majority of mps were less than 355 Î¼m representing around half of the particles detected in the influents of mwwtps as well as iwwtps fig 3 a this trend was also observed in the effluents fig 3 a the greater abundance of smaller plastics was also reported in previous studies in which over 70 of the mps were collected in the 2 smaller sizes 15 28 this abundance sequence may be explained by the potential destruction of larger plastics into smaller fragments with irregular shapes while in the sewer system 23 regarding shape the distribution in the influents and effluents of the mwwtps and iwwtps are shown in fig 3 b as stated above no differences in relative abundance were observed between influents and effluents fibres and fragments comprised the predominant shape 30 40 in the iwwtps and mwwtps flakes films and spheres were detected in a lower proportion with average values of 21 17 10 14 and 0 2 respectively in short fibres and fragments were the main observed shapes whereas films and spheres represented the least common the results obtained in this study are consistent with previous studies 6 7 20 28 31 laundry may be the main source of fibres as their generation occurs during textile washing fragments could stem from the fragmentation of larger plastics and films may be associated with plastic bag degradation spheres however are released into wastewater from personal care products 5 6 3 3 polymer types seventeen types of mps were investigated the relative abundance distribution and amount of common types of plastic being found to be very different in the influents and effluents of the iwwtps and mwwtps table 2 the most common mps in the influents of the mwwtps were polyvinyl chloride pvc high density polyethylene hdpe poly ethyl methacrylate pema polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene pe which have generally been observed in others studies of municipal wastewaters 10 15 32 34 and are commonly used in consumer products as well as packaging 35 as regards iwwtps iwwtp1 and iwwtp2 also exhibited major differences between their influents this is logical given that they are completely different industries as previously explained four types of mps were detected at both plants pvc hdpe pema and pe although no comparative data are available in the bibliography for this kind of wastewater the results seem to be very logical as pvc pe hdpe and pp are the most widely manufactured and demanded microplastics 36 regarding the effluents the results of this study seem to indicate that there may be a significant difference between the types of mps and their removal efficiencies as the distribution of mps in the influents of municipal and industrial wwtps is very different from that observed in the effluents from these plants fig 4 however a solid conclusion cannot be drawn since in order to determine whether there are significant differences between the different types of mps it would be necessary to monitor the influents and effluents of the treatment plants over the long term given that the discharges are likely to be highly variable it is very difficult to ensure that the sampled influent wastewater coincides with that of the effluent even when taking into consideration the hydraulic retention time of the wwtps this is the reason why some types of mps were only detected in the effluents such as polycylohexylenedimethylene terephthalate pct and ps which were detected only in the effluent from iwwtp2 and mwwtp1 respectively 3 4 estimation of microplastic levels in cadiz the mp values of the effluents of each of the treatment plants and their daily flows were considered in order to estimate the levels of mps discharged into the waters of cÃ¡diz the mps that are retained in the treatment plants were considered in order to estimate the mps that might reach the sludge generated at these plants these analyses show that the total amount of mps year in water and sludge from the effluents of the studied wwtps were 8 5 1011 and 1 2 1013 respectively considering that the municipal wastewaters evaluated in this study represent approximately 50 of the municipal wastewaters of the province of cadiz it could be predicted that twice as mps detected in the present paper may be discharged into the environment by treated wastewaters every year in cadiz this is a considerable number of mps especially considering that this area has a high degree of marine diversity 18 and is recognized as a marine protected area special protection area and important bird and biodiversity area 19 and even more so when taking into account the fact that there is an increasing trend in production of mps 15 35 special note should also be taken of the mps that may remain in the sludge as this might constitute an important route for environmental emissions when land application is practised it is important since it is well known that 50 of sewage sludge generated in north america and europe is used in agriculture as fertilizer which means that annually total amounts of 63 000 430 000 and 44 000 300 000 tons of microplastics are released to the soil respectively 37 a recent study 38 has evidenced that sewage sludge application is a vehicle for microplastics they quantification of microplastic pollution in agricultural fields through the application of sewage sludge in eastern spanish agricultural soils for this 16 agricultural fields were sampled soils without addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 930 740 mps kg and a heavy density plastic load of 1100 570 mps kg while soils with addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 2130 950 mps kg and a heavy density plastic load of 3060 1680 mps kg on average soils plastic loads increased by 280 light density mps kg and 430 heavy density mps kg with each successive application of sewage sludge indicating that sewage sludge application results in accumulation of mps in agricultural soils owing to the higher volume of municipal wastewaters regarding to industrial wastewaters the total amount of mps year in water from the effluents of the mwwtps are higher than iwwtps however if we compare mps l of wastewater discharged into the environment industries make a very significant contribution in terms of mps around 50 see fig 5 from this analysis it can be concluded that both types of treatment plants should be evaluated in future research and not only municipal wwtps the literature on wastewater is scarce and even more so for industrial wastewaters although industrial plants have been generally considered potential sources of mps 15 16 a recent paper in which the spatial distribution of mps in surface waters along the coast of korea showed that the mean abundance of mps in urban areas was about 1 5 times higher than in rural areas 31 the importance of the mps emissions in others points of spain has been also recently evidence 39 40 calculated that around 300 million microplastics per day were discharged into the henares river from a wwtp located in madrid center of spain one of the most industrialized areas in the country although a removal efficiency of 93 was achieved during the wastewater treatment process it means that the total amount of mps year in water from the effluents of this madrid wwtp designed to treat 45 000 m3 day were 1 1 1011 and it is line same order of magnitude with the mwwtp1 5 7 1011 and mwwtp 2 4 1011 studied in the present paper designed to treat aprox 49 000 m3 day and 100 000 m3 day respectively ref 40 studied the mps in a conventional mwwtps located in cartagena murcia southeast of spain serving about 210 000 equivalent inhabitants 35 000 m3 day they calculated that around 1 23 m p l are in their final effluents which means around 1 6 1010 mp year were discharged into the environment from cartagena wwtp our results regarding to the most prevalent forms fiber and fragments were also according to these spanish studies regarding the type of polymer although significant differences are evidenced in general pe pp and pema were also one of the most detected polymers in these recent studies 39 40 future studies on the toxicity of mps and their impact on aquatic environments surface and marine waters as well as the impact of mps on agricultural soils will be necessary to evaluate the possible harmful effects of mps 4 conclusions the present paper evidences that mp pollution in municipal and industrial wastewaters constitutes a source of mps discharged into environments mp levels mps l were higher in iwwtps than in mwwtps removal efficiencies were higher than 90 except for mwwtp1 78 the size and shape distribution of mps in the effluents resembled that in the influents suggesting that no preferential removal of mps occurred in the mwwtps or iwwtps with respect to shape and size pvc hdpe pema pp ps and pe were the most common mps detected in the influents of the studied wwtps the results of this paper comprise useful tools to obtain in depth knowledge of mps in wastewater treatment plants map an important environmental location cadiz evaluate the annual amount of mps from mwwtps that are either directly discharged into the medium or that could be present in reusable waters and estimate the amount of mps that could be recovered from the final waste sludge which might constitute an important route for environmental emissions when land application is practised declaration of competing interest the

13806,the minimal recycling and large accumulation of dredging sediment has resulted in a range of social and environmental problems to solve the residual sediment disposal problems a series of experiments utilizing the dredging sediment as ceramsite components were performed zeolite and bentonite were introduced as additives in this work the extreme vertices design method was used to determine the optimal proportion of a three component mixture for sintering sediment ceramsite the results showed that the maximum specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g and the largest porosity of 53 93 could be achieved with the optimal contents of 40 30 wt sediment 39 42 wt zeolite and 20 28 wt bentonite the characterizations mineralogical characteristics physical characteristics microstructure characteristics and toxic metal leaching characteristics of the sediment ceramsite were measured the property tests of the sediment ceramsite showed that the dredging sediment played an important role in the sintering process of the ceramsite the heating process can be divided into three stages and the main new crystalline phases of the sediment ceramsite were clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 and quartz sio2 the sediment ceramsite presented a rough surface and had an abundant porous structure with elongated and interconnected pores diameters between 0 05 and 10 Î¼m additionally the sediment ceramsite was verified to meet the standard of lightweight ceramsite bulk density was 0 89 g cm3 and was macroporous the mean pore size was 3 3472 Î¼m nontoxic concentrations of toxic metal leaching were all below the industry standard and suitable for the water treatment system keywords dredging sediment zeolite bentonite extreme vertices design optimized mixture proportion characteristic analysis 1 introduction contaminated sediment is being generating at an increasing rate due to the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization in recent decades 1 these contaminated sediments contain high concentrations of nutrients n and p heavy metals cr zn hg etc and some persistent organic pollutants hexachlorobenzene polychlorinated naphthalene etc that are subsequently released into lakes rivers and reservoirs which have fatal effects on aquatic ecosystems 2 4 among the different restoration techniques sediment dredging has been widely applied to remediate slow flowing water bodies which could fundamentally solve the problem of endogenous pollution 5 however during the process of dredging the annual output of dredging sediment has reached nearly 180 million tons and is growing at a rate of 6 8 per year 6 the direct disposal measures include landfill farmland and forestry applications incineration and sea dumping 7 however landfills require huge amounts of land 8 and other treatment modes may all lead to a series of serious environmental hazards due to the heavy metals pathogens and persistent organic pollutants from the dredging sediment 9 10 with increasing land acquisition costs and the strengthening awareness of environmental protection the utilization of dredging sediment is an alternative with great potential as it will reduce costs and conserve resources 11 hence how to deal with these dredging sediments has become a trending area of research in recent years sediment or similar materials have been used to produce ceramsite 12 13 through the sintering process the pathogens are killed the heavy metals are properly stabilized in ceramsite and the organic pollutants might be volatized out 14 ceramsite has been widely used as the media for wastewater treatment and has been applied in the building field due to its excellent performance characteristics of cheap price high compressive strength and corrosion resistance 15 16 dredging sediment with abundant organic matter maybe more suitable for making a porous ceramsite filter material for use in wastewater treatment however some problems and shortcomings in the existing research still need to be addressed to the best of our knowledge most of the research has focused on the ceramsite filter material s low bulk density and high strength but has neglected the effects of the raw materials on the specific surface area and porosity for water treatment media the high specific surface area and porosity of ceramsite can provide more adsorption sites for contaminants and microorganisms which is crucial for accomplishing the purifying effect 17 taking those deficiencies into account deeper research is required to produce ceramsite with a large surface area and high porosity simultaneously by using dredging sediment with other additives zeolite is well known to have a high specific surface area and unique microporous structure as well as high cation exchange capacity 18 19 using zeolite as an additive could significantly increase the specific surface area and adsorptive property of ceramsite however dredging sediment and zeolite have less kaolinite and montmorillonite than clay 20 which will influence the plasticity of the sediment and zeolite 21 bentonite is a layered aluminosilicate mineral mainly comprised of montmorillonite minerals 22 due to its pozzolanic behavior adding some bentonite as an additional binder could improve the adhesion properties of the raw materials 23 according to riley s research the chemical composition of the mixture must be located inside of the bloating zone of the ternary diagram fig 1 to successfully sinter porous ceramsite 24 and the chemical composition ranges of the raw materials are as follows sio2 between 48 78 al2o3 between 10 25 flux the mixture of fe2o3 cao etc between 13 26 and the ratio of sio2 al2o3 flux the mixture of fe2o3 cao etc between 3 5 10 24 it is important to properly control every component at the optimal levels during the ceramsite production in this study the components of the multivariable system were constricted by both upper and lower boundaries and the feasible region will be some polytope the extreme vertices design was most appropriate for determining the optimal mixture proportion in this situation so that the data obtained can be analyzed objectively 25 therefore the objectives of this study were to i investigate the feasibility of utilizing the dredging sediment as a raw material in ceramsite ii optimize the proportion of the ceramsite raw materials by the extreme vertices design iii analyze the effect of dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite on the specific surface area and porosity of ceramsite and iv characterize the ceramsite in terms of physical properties microstructure mineral phases and metal leaching solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw materials in this study the raw materials used for the preparations of porous ceramsite were dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite the dredging sediment came from the process of dredging and the rectification process of the qinhuai river china zeolite and bentonite were obtained from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china these raw materials were dried for 4 h at 105 c before being poured into a grinder after the drying process the raw materials were crushed into powders and then passed through a 100 mesh sieve for the physical and chemical properties analysis the chemical analysis and the loss on ignition loi of the sediment zeolite and bentonite are presented in table 1 the main chemical compositions of the raw materials of the sediment ceramsite play a very important role during the sintering process therefore they must be determined in detail before sintering the ceramsite the properties of sediment ceramsite are highly influenced by three components including the skeleton component sio2 and al2o3 which are the basic ingredient of sediment ceramsite and form the framework the gas generating composition fe2o3 feo carbonate and carbon contributing to the pore formation and the flux oxides fe2o3 cao mgo and na2o which facilitate the softening and lower the melting point of the liquid phase 26 these contents strongly affect the bloating behavior and crystal formation of ceramsite which in turn are closely related to the characteristics of the sediment ceramsite 14 the main constituents of sediment are 40 73 wt sio2 8 23 wt al2o3 and 14 30 wt flux oxides the sio2 and al2o3 content of the dredging sediment are below the specific requirements of riley s ternary diagram the amount of loi 21 1 wt in dredging sediment is much higher than that in zeolite 0 92 wt and bentonite 3 45 wt which could yield a large amount of carbon during the sintering process 27 therefore the dredging sediment acts as a pore making material in the sediment ceramsite production process zeolite contains a higher proportion of sio2 63 20 wt and al2o3 16 53 wt compared with dredging sediment zeolite can make up for the deficiency of skeleton components of the dredging sediment and increase the strength of the sediment ceramsite the percentage of flux oxides 26 70 wt in bentonite is much higher than that in dredging sediment 14 3 wt and zeolite 11 57 wt which is beneficial to effectively decrease the melting point and increase the flux composition of the sediment ceramsite 2 2 preparation of sediment ceramsite the process flow for preparing sediment ceramsite is shown in fig 2 step 1 according to the results of the extreme vertices design the powdered dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite samples were completely mixed at a specific proportion then the mixture with 8 00 wt of water was placed into the granulator to obtain an approximately 10 mm diameter ceramsite the 10 00 mm diameter sieve was used to filter the raw pellets step 2 before thermal treatment raw pellets were fully dried at 105 c for 3 h to remove moisture which was beneficial to avoid crazing on the surface of the ceramsite step 3 preheating process the dried raw pellets held by crucibles were preheated for 15 min at 400 in a muffle the preheating process was beneficial to release a considerable amount of the gases caused by dehydration or volatilization of organics to prevent pellet blasting 28 step 4 sintering process after the preheating process the heating temperature was increased with a heating rate of 10 min and then sintered at 1100 for 8 min step 5 cooling process the sintered pellets were placed indoors until they cooled to room temperature and the sediment ceramsite was finally obtained 2 3 extreme vertices design in this situation minitab 17 0tm software was used for the extreme vertices design analysis of experimental data and optimization of the proportion of the three component mixture the components of sediment x 1 zeolite x 2 and bentonite x 3 were all constricted by riley s foaming composition range thus it appears as in eq 1 as follows 1 0 48 0 4073 x 1 0 4855 x 2 0 6320 x 3 0 78 0 10 0 0823 x 1 0 1402 x 2 0 1653 x 3 0 25 0 13 0 1430 x 1 0 2670 x 2 0 1021 x 3 0 26 3 5 0 4896 x 1 0 7973 x 2 0 6257 x 3 0 1430 x 1 0 1021 x 2 0 2670 x 3 10 through solving the eq 1 the weight range of x 1 x 2 and x 3 can be calculated as follows 2 0 x 1 0 6333 0 0547 x 2 0 8074 0 2433 x 3 1 where x 1 x 2 x 3 1 and all x i values will be represented in the weight percent wt the minitab 17 0 tm software used the extreme vertices design to produce 13 runs for each formulation where the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area y 1 m2 g and the porosity y 2 were chosen as the responses to optimize the mixture proportion each experiment was repeated at least three times then the mean results were applied for modeling the worksheet defined by the software and the related experimental results are shown in table 2 these design points can be found quite directly as shown in fig 3 the mathematical relationship of the index y j on the mentioned three independent variables x i can be regressed by the least squares method in the form shown in eq 3 3 y j a 0 i 1 3 a i x i a i j x i x j i 1 3 a i i x i 2 where i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 2 4 characteristic analysis of sediment ceramsite the t1 ceramsite was the optimized ceramsite though the extreme vertices design experiment the t2 ceramsite was selected as a control to analyze the function of the dredging sediment which had the minimum specific surface area of 14 60 m2 g specific surface area and the minimum porosity of 8 12 the t1 and t2 ceramsite were produced based on the combined ratios of sediment zeolite bentonite which were 40 30 wt 39 42 wt 20 28 wt and 0 wt 24 33 wt 75 67 wt for t1 and t2 respectively both ratios were selected to characterize the ceramsite 2 4 1 analysis of mineralogical characteristics the crystal structures of the sintered ceramsite were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd model d2 phaser

properties apparent density bulk density the sum of the breaking rate and wear rate silt carrying capacity solubility in hydrochloric acid and void fraction of the sintered ceramsite were examined based on china s standard method of artificial ceramsite filter material for water treatment cj t 299 2008 29 the bet specific surface area of the sintered ceramsite was determined by using an automated bet gas sorptometry analyzer model nova 3000e quantachrome american the zeta potentials with different ph values of sintered ceramsite were tested with a zeta potential and nanometer

thermogravimetric tg and differential scanning calorimetry dsc of the sintered ceramsite were conducted in an air atmosphere by a thermal gravimetric analyzer model sta 449 f3 netzsch germany the two samples were heated at a rate of 10 k min in the range between 25 to 1100 2 4 3 analysis of the microstructure the morphology and the microstructure of the sediment ceramsite were assessed by a scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds model merlin compact 61 78 zeiss germany with a magnification of 1 00 kx times the pore size distributions and the porous nature of the ceramsite were tested with a mercury intrusion porosimeter model poremaster 33 quantachrame american 2 4 4 leaching tests of the sediment ceramsite to simulate the environmental safety of the sediment ceramsite in water a series of leaching toxicity tests were performed on the dredging sediment and the sintered ceramsite in this study the heavy metal leaching tests were performed based on china s identification standards for hazardous wastes gb 5085 3 2007 31 first 100 g of the samples and 1 l of distilled or deionized water were added into a 2 5 l beaker and then the toxicity leaching experiments were implemented in a constant temperature water bath oscillator model cry 2102c easywell china with a constant speed of 120 r min at 30 c for 12 h then 100 ml of lixivium obtained from the supernatant was collected and filtered through 0 22 Î¼m filter membranes the heavy metal elements cu zn pb cr cd hg se and as in the lixivium were examined with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp model 5110 icp oes agilent american 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw material formulation determination 3 1 1 modeling of the extreme vertices design though the extreme vertices mixture design the formulation of ceramsite was defined and a series of experiments were executed through regression ï¬tting at the 95 conï¬dence level the full quadratic models are assumed as eqs 4 and 5 for two responses of specific surface area y 1 and porosity y 2 respectively various statistical data were tested the coefï¬cients of the full quadratic models eqs 4 and 5 and p value are presented in table 3 where the standard error of the coefï¬cient is the standard deviation of the estimate of a regression coefficient which measures how accurately the data can estimate the unknown value of the coefficient 32 its value is always positive and smaller values indicate a more accurate estimate the standard error of a coefficient helps determine whether the predictor has a significant effect on the response 32 dividing the coefficient by its standard error calculates a t value if the p value associated with this t statistic is less than the alpha level it could be concluded that the coefficient is significantly different from zero 33 therefore low p values suggest the corresponding the linear terms and the factor interaction terms are statistically significant the response factors at any regime in the interval of our experimental design can be calculated from eqs 4 and 5 4 y 1 31 54 x 1 70 88 x 2 7 44 x 3 127 83 x 1 x 2 216 0 x 1 x 3 5 y 2 16 56 x 1 14 64 x 2 6 44 x 3 204 17 x 1 x 2 258 13 x 1 x 3 in response to y 1 and y 2 the r sq values were 94 99 and 94 63 while the r sq adj values were 92 48 and 91 95 respectively when degree of freedom was 7 and alpha level was 0 05 the r sq values and the r sq adj values were both bigger than the critical value r 0 6664 of correlation coefficient test which indicates that the regression equation of y 1 and y 2 are statistically significant 34 the r sq pred values of y 1 and y 2 were 81 56 and 79 50 respectively because the r sq pred values were close to the corresponding r sq values and r sq adj values the model of y 1 and y 2 did not appear to be overfit and the predicted values obtained by eqs 4 and 5 would fit the experimental values quite accurately the adjusted mean squares adj ms are calculated by dividing the adjusted sum of squares adj ss by the degrees of freedom 33 according to the analysis of variance anova analysis table 4 mean squares ms are used to determine whether factors are significant dividing the ms team by the ms error gives the f values which follow the f distribution with degrees of freedom for the team and degrees of freedom for the error 35 if the f value is greater than the critical f value that means that the regression equation has statistical significance 35 the p value is used to judge whether the f value is larger than the critical f value 35 the p values of the regressions of y 1 and y 2 were both smaller than 0 05 which indicates that the all terms in the regression equation have a significant correlation with the response variable 3 1 2 effect of the ratio of raw materials on the specific surface area m2 g y 1 and porosity y 1 performance of the sediment ceramsite fig 4 shows the piepel response trace plots of the sediment ceramsite which were plotted based on the predictions from the ï¬tted model figs 5 and 6 reveal the effects of interaction of sediment zeolite and bentonite on the specific surface area and the porosity of sediment ceramsite for a ternary mixture according to these response curves the relationship between the response and the total variable changes can be observed as seen in figs 5 and 6 the specific surface area of sediment ceramsite is mostly affected by the proportion of zeolite added for the maximization of the specific surface area of ceramite the best additive ratio of zeolite was between 56 21 to 94 50 in combination with fig 4a it can be found that with the increase of the proportion of zeolite added the specific surface area of the sediment ceramsite was increased zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate minerals with stacked silica tetrahedron alumina tetrahedron layers which form a stable three dimensional microporous structure with huge specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity 17 wang et al 36 found that the larger the surface area is the more active sites there will be the purification effect of the sediment ceramsite would be significantly promoted due to the zeolite additives as observed in fig 5 and 6 the porosity of the sediment ceramsite is mostly affected by the added proportion of dredging sediment and bentonite when the additive proportion of sediment was between 27 86 to 58 26 and the additive proportion of bentonite was between 5 5 to 47 62 the porosity of sediment ceramsite reached the maximum value between 50 to 60 in combination with fig 4b it can be found that as the content of sediment and bentonite was increased the porosity of sediment ceramsite sharply increased and then decreased substantially appropriate gases and liquid phase at the expansion stage are essential for producing the porous ceramsite 37 38 during the sintering process the organic matter including the dredging sediment is carbonized and reacted with iron oxide to release a large amount of gas which facilitates the production of interconnected pores 37 xu et al 39 described gas producing reactions using sludge as follows 1 oxidation of organic matter 6 c o 2 c o 2 7 c c o 2 2 c o 8 3 c 2 o 2 2 c o c o 2 2 reduction of iron oxide 9 2 f e 2 o 3 c 4 f e o c o 2 10 2 f e 2 o 3 3 c 4 f e 3 c o 2 11 f e 2 o 3 c 2 f e o c o 12 f e 2 o 3 3 c 2 f e 3 c o however when the proportion of dredging sediment was too large it would led to a corresponding increase of residual carbon in the sintering stage which would cause an increase of the expansion gases and eventually crush the ball and reduce the porosity 38 beyond that the formation of the complicated pore structure is also closely related to the viscosity and the quantity of the liquid phase 29 when the bentonite content was more than 32 76 the viscosity of the liquid phase decreased dramatically and the excessive liquid phase filled the voids in the sintered ceramsite which created sintered ceramsite with denser bodies and fewer pores 3 1 3 optimization of the mixture proportions a response optimizer can identify the combination of input variable settings that jointly optimize one or more fitting responses with the use of a response optimizer the optimal mixture proportion was confirmed by using the specific surface area and porosity y 2 and y 2 responses as the assessment indicators under the optimum mixture proportions the maximum specific surface area and porosity of the sediment ceramsite were obtained simultaneously the composite desirability d was usually used to measure whether the joint optimization could satisfy the requirements for all the responses in the set 40 the composite desirability range is from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates the ideal situation and 0 indicates that one or more responses are beyond the acceptable range 40 to predict the optimum mixture proportion we set a target value and a lower bound for the responses to create the optimal plots which are shown in fig 7 here the maximum responses of a specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g with a porosity of 53 93 are achieved through the optimized mixture proportion which contained 40 30 wt sediment 39 42 wt zeolite and 20 28 wt bentonite the composite desirability 0 9587 is fairly close to 1 which demonstrated that the mixture formulation can achieve favorable results for all responses as a whole the average experimental result of three replications in the optimum mixture proportion presented the specific surface area of 49 14 m2 g and the porosity of 51 10 with a relative error of 4 91 and 5 24 for y 1 and y 2 respectively 3 2 characteristic analysis of the sediment ceramsite 3 2 1 analyses of the crystalline phases xrd in this experiment xrd analyses were used to obtain the mineral compositions of the raw materials and sintered ceramsite by comparing the sample xrd patterns with the database of the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds the xrd patterns of the raw material and sintered ceramsite are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a indicates that the crystalline phases in the dredging sediment are quartz sio2 dolomite camg co3 2 kyanite al2sio5 albite ordered naalsi3o8 and margarite caal2 si2al2 o10 oh 2 the major mineralogical compositions in zeolite are clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o and quartz sio2 while the crystal components of bentonite are montmorillonite namgalsio2 oh h2o with small amounts of microcline kalsi3o8 fig 8 b depicts the main crystalline phases of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the most abundant crystalline phases of t1 are clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 and quartz sio2 compared to the raw materials the intensities of the xrd peaks of the quartz sio2 in the t1 ceramsite decrease significantly the observed decrease in the amount of quartz sio2 could be related to the consumption of this mineral during the formation of the glassy phase 41 the glassy surface acts as a capturer of gases causing the sediment ceramsite to bloat and form through 1100 c high heat sintering complex reactions such as decomposition melting have occurred 42 leading to the xrd peaks of dolomite camg co3 2 and margarite caal2 si2al2 o10 oh 2 completely disappearing which generated large amounts of cao cao is a reactive substance 43 and it may react with skeleton material such as microcline to form albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 44 this hypothesis was supported by the absence of kyanite dolomite and margarite in the t1 ceramsite by comparing the xrd data of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the result shows differences between the two the main new crystalline phases of the t2 ceramsite are tridymite sio2 and mullite al6si2o13 the tridymite sio2 is the polymorph of quartz which has a silica mineral crystal structure and mainly forms the dense surface 45 especially the sio2 existing in the t2 ceramsite is much more than that in the t1 ceramsite the result shows that sio2 could not easily form a eutectic mixture with other minerals under this material formulation because the thermal stability of montmorillonite is relatively poor 46 the t2 ceramsite tends to decrease the intensity of the xrd peaks of montmorillonite during the high heat sintering process montmorillonite would be converted into thermostable substances such as mullite 47 according to the previous studies mullite has an important effect on the formation of a high strength microstructure 48 which means that the t2 ceramsite will have a poorer bloating property but higher strength 3 2 2 thermal analysis dsc tga of the sintered ceramsite fig 9 a and 9b depict the curves of the thermal analysis of the t1 and t2 ceramsite for the t1 ceramsite the heating process can be divided into three stages stage 1 from 25 to 108 there was an 11 14 weight loss of t1 ceramsite at this stage the dcs curve had an exothermic peak at 47 which was caused the evaporation of physical adsorbed water 49 stage 2 from 108 to 678 there was an 8 86 weight loss of t1 ceramsite which was mainly caused by the emissions of co co2 formed from the thermal dissociation of dolomite 50 and the decomposition of organic matter 51 the dcs curve had a broad exothermic peak at approximately 494 because the amount of heat from combusting the organic matter exceeded the absorbed heat from the dolomite dissociation stage 3 from 678 to 800 an 1 14 weight loss of t1 ceramsite occurred implying the oxidation of carbon and the reduction of ferric iron to generate co2 o2 in the bloating process 52 the dcs curve has an endothermic peak at approximately 1101 and an exothermic peak at approximately 1151 the endothermic phenomenon that occurred might have been caused by the fusion of the flux which promoted the formation of the molten glass phase 53 when the gases are formed in parallel with the molten glass phase a porous ceramsite will be obtained the exothermic phenomenon that occurred is probably attributed to the formation of the albite calcian ordered crystal 54 for t2 ceramsite there were also three stages during the heating process stage 1 from 25 to 172 the weight loss of the t2 ceramsite was 14 5 which was significantly higher than that of the t1 ceramsite it could be speculated that the amount of bentonite which has a highly absorbent character in the t2 ceramsite was much greater than that in the t1 ceramsite 55 stage 2 from 172 to 650 the weight of the t2 ceramsite was only reduced by 2 7 because the composition of t2 ceramsite does not contain sediment the weight loss of the t2 ceramsite was dramatically lower than that of the t1 ceramsite during the second stage an endothermic peak was observed at 593 corresponding to the emission of the structural water 49 stage 3 from 650 to 1100 the tg curve tended to remain stable the dcs curve showed an endothermic peak and an exothermic peak at 715 and 1026 respectively the endothermic phenomenon was caused by the polymorphic transition of sio2 56 the exothermic phenomenon that occurred mainly contributed to the formation of mullite crystals 54 which means that the t2 ceramsite will be denser than the t1 ceramsite the results of the crystalline phase analyses were verified by thermal analysis 3 2 3 surface morphology and pore size distribution analyses to determine the relationship between the material composition and the microstructure more attention was given to the sem micrographs of the sintering ceramsite fig 10 a depicts the morphology and the microstructure of the t1 ceramsite the t1 ceramsite presents a rough and loose surface and has an abundant porous structure with elongated and interconnected pores diameters between 0 05 and 10 Î¼m the complicated porous structure is caused by the highly viscous liquid phase that prevents produced gas diffusion and then leaves sufficient voids in the ceramsite 57 fig 10 c presents the microstructure and the morphology of the t2 ceramsite it could be observed that the t2 ceramsite exhibits a smooth and densely compacted surface and has few relatively small pores irregularly distributed in the microstructure diameters between 0 05 and 1 Î¼m the t2 ceramsite samples were prepared by mixing zeolite and bentonite without the addition of the dredging sediment the lack of a bloating agent and the excess amounts of flux content caused fewer gases and lower viscosity of the liquid phase in this situation the liquid glass phase blocked the pores on the surface resulting in densification of the ceramsite 58 therefore the microstructure of the ceramsite is significantly influenced by raw materials and the proper mass ratio of the dredging sediment and bentonite plays an especially important role in the formation of a porous structure fig 10 b and 10d present the eds spectra of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the main types of nonmetallic elements and metal elements of the t1 and t2 ceramsite were si al o c p k na ca mg ti fe au etc the alumina silica ratios of both the t1 and t2 ceramsite are relatively lower which means that the sintering ceramsite has greater strength 59 bet gas sorptometry measurements were conducted to examine the porous nature of the sintering ceramsite fig 11 a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the sintering ceramsite the type ii isotherms can be observed in the sintering ceramsite which is characteristic of mesoporous and macropores materials 60 fig 11 b depicts the pore distribution in the t1 and t2 ceramsite the t1 ceramsite mainly consisted of macropores the mean pore size was 3 3472 Î¼m the bet specific surface area of the t1 ceramsite is 51 68 m2 g the single point total volume of pores at p p0 0 99 volume is 0 088738 cm3 g and the porosity of the t1 ceramsite is very high with a maximum of 53 93 table 5 compared with the t1 ceramsite the mean pore size of the t2 ceramsite is 0 5526 Î¼m the bet specific surface area is 14 60 m2 g the single point total volume of pores at p p0 0 99 volume is 0 045754 cm3 g and the porosity of the t2 ceramsite is only 8 12 the adhesion of microbes on the ceramsite is related to the specific surface area on the one hand and the pore structure on the other 61 korotta gamage et al 62 found that because the sizes of most of the environmental bacteria are 0 5 5 Î¼m only macropores and super macropores can provide effective action points for the fixation and growth of microorganisms bao et al 17 further discovered that the bioactivity of the microorganism is closely related to the porous structure of bio ceramsite the extremely high bet specific surface area and rich macropore structure strongly support the fact that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for use as a microbial carrier in the water treatment system 3 2 4 physical characteristics of the sintered ceramsite the physical characteristics of the sintered ceramsite are shown in table 5 based on the comparative analysis only the t1 ceramsite satisfies the china s standard method of artificial ceramsite filter material for water treatment and the standard of lightweight ceramsite bulk density 1 20 gbt17431 1 1998 63 the lower density of the t1 ceramsite is attributed to the presence of a large number of pores as shown in fig 8 in water treatment systems such as a moving bed biofilm reactors the lightweight ceramsite made the reactor easy to operate 64 the phzpc results of the t1 ceramsite indicate that the ceramsite surface is negatively charged in solution when the ph is higher than 4 43 which is beneficial to the adsorption of cations 65 additionally due to its high cec the t1 ceramsite may supply an abundant platform on which to exchange the cations 66 however compared with the t1 ceramsite the t2 ceramsite always has a higher compressive strength which is attributed to the fact that the pores are closed and relatively small larger amounts of tridymite and mullite also improve the strength of the t2 ceramsite 67 taking full account of the characteristics of sintered ceramsite it can be concluded that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for water treatment system applications and t2 is more suitable for construction material use 3 2 5 analysis of heavy metal leaching to simulate the leaching toxicity of heavy metals of sediment ceramsite in the water leaching toxicity tests were carried out as shown in table 6 the heavy metal leaching concentration of the dredging sediment and sintered ceramsite are compared with the official standard the results indicate that the heavy metal leaching concentration of the qinhuai river sediment is far less than china s quality standards for surface water iii gb3838 2002 68 but is below china s identification standards for hazardous wastes which demonstrate that the dredging sediment is an ordinary pollutant and not hazardous waste the heavy metal leaching concentration of the t1 ceramsite is more than that of the t2 ceramsite which indicates that the leachable heavy metals of the sintering ceramsite mostly come from the dredging sediment meanwhile the heavy metal leaching concentration of the t1 ceramsite has not exceeded china s quality standards for surface water iii and is much smaller than that of the dredging sediment of equal quality the reason for this phenomenon may be that some heavy metals such as cu zn pb cr se and as solidify in the aluminosilicate or silicate frameworks at a high temperature sintering process 69 meanwhile some heavy metals such as cd and hg are volatilized 70 in conclusion the leaching toxicity test results suggest that the sintering process is effective in immobilizing heavy metals contained in the raw materials the sediment ceramsite is environmentally friendly and it is less likely to cause secondary pollution in the water treatment system 4 conclusions this research represents the first step to successfully reusing dredging sediment to prepare ceramsite that can achieve not only technical benefits but can also result in good economic and ecological benefits the extreme vertices mixture design was first used in the preparation of ceramsite to model the optimal addition ratio of the three factors of sediment zeolite and bentonite the results show that the maximum specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g and the porosity of 53 93 are accomplished when the optimal mixing proportion of the sediment is 40 30 wt with a zeolite ratio of 39 42 wt and 20 28 wt of bentonite the results show that the addition ratio of zeolite affected the specific surface area of the ceramsite the proper addition ratio of bentonite could lower the viscosity of the glass phase in the ceramsite and promote the generation of the glass phase while the dredging sediment worked as a bloating agent during the sintering process and increased the porosity of ceramsite after analyzing the characteristics of the sintered ceramsite the results of the mineralogical and thermal analysis revealed that the formation of the vitreous phase acts as a capturer of the gases generated during sintering thus causing the ceramsite to bloat compared to the t2 ceramsite the sem and porosimetry results suggest that the rough surface and the macropores are dominant in the t1 ceramsite which means that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for microbial growth furthermore the t1 ceramsite possesses many outstanding attributes such as its physical properties which are in compliance with the china s artificial ceramsite filter material standard and the lightweight ceramsite standards the amount of heavy metal leaching in the t1 ceramsite is far below the limitation of the national standard of china indicating that the sintering process could effectively immobilize the metals and the sintering ceramsite is relatively safe and reliable all these observations will further favor the utilization of dredging sediment ceramsite in water treatment systems and the final intention of treating wastes with wastes will be implemented however the research of the key sintering parameter such as the optimal sintering temperature and sintering time has not been well studied in addition the growth of biofilm in this optimal sediment ceramsite in practical water treatment systems such as the moving bed biofilm reactor should also be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13806,the minimal recycling and large accumulation of dredging sediment has resulted in a range of social and environmental problems to solve the residual sediment disposal problems a series of experiments utilizing the dredging sediment as ceramsite components were performed zeolite and bentonite were introduced as additives in this work the extreme vertices design method was used to determine the optimal proportion of a three component mixture for sintering sediment ceramsite the results showed that the maximum specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g and the largest porosity of 53 93 could be achieved with the optimal contents of 40 30 wt sediment 39 42 wt zeolite and 20 28 wt bentonite the characterizations mineralogical characteristics physical characteristics microstructure characteristics and toxic metal leaching characteristics of the sediment ceramsite were measured the property tests of the sediment ceramsite showed that the dredging sediment played an important role in the sintering process of the ceramsite the heating process can be divided into three stages and the main new crystalline phases of the sediment ceramsite were clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 and quartz sio2 the sediment ceramsite presented a rough surface and had an abundant porous structure with elongated and interconnected pores diameters between 0 05 and 10 Î¼m additionally the sediment ceramsite was verified to meet the standard of lightweight ceramsite bulk density was 0 89 g cm3 and was macroporous the mean pore size was 3 3472 Î¼m nontoxic concentrations of toxic metal leaching were all below the industry standard and suitable for the water treatment system keywords dredging sediment zeolite bentonite extreme vertices design optimized mixture proportion characteristic analysis 1 introduction contaminated sediment is being generating at an increasing rate due to the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization in recent decades 1 these contaminated sediments contain high concentrations of nutrients n and p heavy metals cr zn hg etc and some persistent organic pollutants hexachlorobenzene polychlorinated naphthalene etc that are subsequently released into lakes rivers and reservoirs which have fatal effects on aquatic ecosystems 2 4 among the different restoration techniques sediment dredging has been widely applied to remediate slow flowing water bodies which could fundamentally solve the problem of endogenous pollution 5 however during the process of dredging the annual output of dredging sediment has reached nearly 180 million tons and is growing at a rate of 6 8 per year 6 the direct disposal measures include landfill farmland and forestry applications incineration and sea dumping 7 however landfills require huge amounts of land 8 and other treatment modes may all lead to a series of serious environmental hazards due to the heavy metals pathogens and persistent organic pollutants from the dredging sediment 9 10 with increasing land acquisition costs and the strengthening awareness of environmental protection the utilization of dredging sediment is an alternative with great potential as it will reduce costs and conserve resources 11 hence how to deal with these dredging sediments has become a trending area of research in recent years sediment or similar materials have been used to produce ceramsite 12 13 through the sintering process the pathogens are killed the heavy metals are properly stabilized in ceramsite and the organic pollutants might be volatized out 14 ceramsite has been widely used as the media for wastewater treatment and has been applied in the building field due to its excellent performance characteristics of cheap price high compressive strength and corrosion resistance 15 16 dredging sediment with abundant organic matter maybe more suitable for making a porous ceramsite filter material for use in wastewater treatment however some problems and shortcomings in the existing research still need to be addressed to the best of our knowledge most of the research has focused on the ceramsite filter material s low bulk density and high strength but has neglected the effects of the raw materials on the specific surface area and porosity for water treatment media the high specific surface area and porosity of ceramsite can provide more adsorption sites for contaminants and microorganisms which is crucial for accomplishing the purifying effect 17 taking those deficiencies into account deeper research is required to produce ceramsite with a large surface area and high porosity simultaneously by using dredging sediment with other additives zeolite is well known to have a high specific surface area and unique microporous structure as well as high cation exchange capacity 18 19 using zeolite as an additive could significantly increase the specific surface area and adsorptive property of ceramsite however dredging sediment and zeolite have less kaolinite and montmorillonite than clay 20 which will influence the plasticity of the sediment and zeolite 21 bentonite is a layered aluminosilicate mineral mainly comprised of montmorillonite minerals 22 due to its pozzolanic behavior adding some bentonite as an additional binder could improve the adhesion properties of the raw materials 23 according to riley s research the chemical composition of the mixture must be located inside of the bloating zone of the ternary diagram fig 1 to successfully sinter porous ceramsite 24 and the chemical composition ranges of the raw materials are as follows sio2 between 48 78 al2o3 between 10 25 flux the mixture of fe2o3 cao etc between 13 26 and the ratio of sio2 al2o3 flux the mixture of fe2o3 cao etc between 3 5 10 24 it is important to properly control every component at the optimal levels during the ceramsite production in this study the components of the multivariable system were constricted by both upper and lower boundaries and the feasible region will be some polytope the extreme vertices design was most appropriate for determining the optimal mixture proportion in this situation so that the data obtained can be analyzed objectively 25 therefore the objectives of this study were to i investigate the feasibility of utilizing the dredging sediment as a raw material in ceramsite ii optimize the proportion of the ceramsite raw materials by the extreme vertices design iii analyze the effect of dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite on the specific surface area and porosity of ceramsite and iv characterize the ceramsite in terms of physical properties microstructure mineral phases and metal leaching solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw materials in this study the raw materials used for the preparations of porous ceramsite were dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite the dredging sediment came from the process of dredging and the rectification process of the qinhuai river china zeolite and bentonite were obtained from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china these raw materials were dried for 4 h at 105 c before being poured into a grinder after the drying process the raw materials were crushed into powders and then passed through a 100 mesh sieve for the physical and chemical properties analysis the chemical analysis and the loss on ignition loi of the sediment zeolite and bentonite are presented in table 1 the main chemical compositions of the raw materials of the sediment ceramsite play a very important role during the sintering process therefore they must be determined in detail before sintering the ceramsite the properties of sediment ceramsite are highly influenced by three components including the skeleton component sio2 and al2o3 which are the basic ingredient of sediment ceramsite and form the framework the gas generating composition fe2o3 feo carbonate and carbon contributing to the pore formation and the flux oxides fe2o3 cao mgo and na2o which facilitate the softening and lower the melting point of the liquid phase 26 these contents strongly affect the bloating behavior and crystal formation of ceramsite which in turn are closely related to the characteristics of the sediment ceramsite 14 the main constituents of sediment are 40 73 wt sio2 8 23 wt al2o3 and 14 30 wt flux oxides the sio2 and al2o3 content of the dredging sediment are below the specific requirements of riley s ternary diagram the amount of loi 21 1 wt in dredging sediment is much higher than that in zeolite 0 92 wt and bentonite 3 45 wt which could yield a large amount of carbon during the sintering process 27 therefore the dredging sediment acts as a pore making material in the sediment ceramsite production process zeolite contains a higher proportion of sio2 63 20 wt and al2o3 16 53 wt compared with dredging sediment zeolite can make up for the deficiency of skeleton components of the dredging sediment and increase the strength of the sediment ceramsite the percentage of flux oxides 26 70 wt in bentonite is much higher than that in dredging sediment 14 3 wt and zeolite 11 57 wt which is beneficial to effectively decrease the melting point and increase the flux composition of the sediment ceramsite 2 2 preparation of sediment ceramsite the process flow for preparing sediment ceramsite is shown in fig 2 step 1 according to the results of the extreme vertices design the powdered dredging sediment zeolite and bentonite samples were completely mixed at a specific proportion then the mixture with 8 00 wt of water was placed into the granulator to obtain an approximately 10 mm diameter ceramsite the 10 00 mm diameter sieve was used to filter the raw pellets step 2 before thermal treatment raw pellets were fully dried at 105 c for 3 h to remove moisture which was beneficial to avoid crazing on the surface of the ceramsite step 3 preheating process the dried raw pellets held by crucibles were preheated for 15 min at 400 in a muffle the preheating process was beneficial to release a considerable amount of the gases caused by dehydration or volatilization of organics to prevent pellet blasting 28 step 4 sintering process after the preheating process the heating temperature was increased with a heating rate of 10 min and then sintered at 1100 for 8 min step 5 cooling process the sintered pellets were placed indoors until they cooled to room temperature and the sediment ceramsite was finally obtained 2 3 extreme vertices design in this situation minitab 17 0tm software was used for the extreme vertices design analysis of experimental data and optimization of the proportion of the three component mixture the components of sediment x 1 zeolite x 2 and bentonite x 3 were all constricted by riley s foaming composition range thus it appears as in eq 1 as follows 1 0 48 0 4073 x 1 0 4855 x 2 0 6320 x 3 0 78 0 10 0 0823 x 1 0 1402 x 2 0 1653 x 3 0 25 0 13 0 1430 x 1 0 2670 x 2 0 1021 x 3 0 26 3 5 0 4896 x 1 0 7973 x 2 0 6257 x 3 0 1430 x 1 0 1021 x 2 0 2670 x 3 10 through solving the eq 1 the weight range of x 1 x 2 and x 3 can be calculated as follows 2 0 x 1 0 6333 0 0547 x 2 0 8074 0 2433 x 3 1 where x 1 x 2 x 3 1 and all x i values will be represented in the weight percent wt the minitab 17 0 tm software used the extreme vertices design to produce 13 runs for each formulation where the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area y 1 m2 g and the porosity y 2 were chosen as the responses to optimize the mixture proportion each experiment was repeated at least three times then the mean results were applied for modeling the worksheet defined by the software and the related experimental results are shown in table 2 these design points can be found quite directly as shown in fig 3 the mathematical relationship of the index y j on the mentioned three independent variables x i can be regressed by the least squares method in the form shown in eq 3 3 y j a 0 i 1 3 a i x i a i

ceramsite was selected as a control to analyze the function of the dredging sediment which had the minimum specific surface area of 14 60 m2 g specific surface area and the minimum porosity of 8 12 the t1 and t2 ceramsite were produced based on the combined ratios of sediment zeolite bentonite which were 40 30 wt 39 42 wt 20 28 wt and 0 wt 24 33 wt 75 67 wt for t1 and t2 respectively both ratios were selected to characterize the ceramsite 2 4 1 analysis of mineralogical characteristics the crystal structures of the sintered ceramsite were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd model d2 phaser

sediment ceramsite in water a series of leaching toxicity tests were performed on the dredging sediment and the sintered ceramsite in this study the heavy metal leaching tests were performed based on china s identification standards for hazardous wastes gb 5085 3 2007 31 first 100 g of the samples and 1 l of distilled or deionized water were added into a 2 5 l beaker and then the toxicity leaching experiments were implemented in a constant temperature water bath oscillator model cry 2102c easywell china with a constant speed of 120 r min at 30 c for 12 h then 100 ml of lixivium obtained from

emission spectrometer icp model 5110 icp oes agilent american 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw material formulation determination 3 1 1 modeling of the extreme vertices design though the extreme vertices mixture design the formulation of ceramsite was defined and a series of experiments were executed through regression ï¬tting at the 95 conï¬dence level the full quadratic models are assumed as eqs 4 and 5 for two responses of specific surface area y 1 and porosity y 2 respectively various statistical data were tested the coefï¬cients of the full quadratic models eqs 4 and 5 and p value are presented in table 3 where the standard error of the coefï¬cient is the standard deviation of the estimate of a regression coefficient which measures how accurately the data can estimate the unknown value of the coefficient 32 its value is always positive and smaller values indicate a more accurate estimate the standard error of a coefficient helps determine whether the predictor has a significant effect on the response 32 dividing the coefficient by its standard error calculates a t value if the p value associated with this t statistic is less than the alpha level it could be concluded that the coefficient is significantly different from zero 33 therefore low p values suggest the corresponding the linear terms and the factor interaction terms are statistically significant the response factors at any regime in the interval of our experimental design can be calculated from eqs 4 and 5 4 y 1 31 54 x 1 70 88 x 2 7 44 x 3 127 83 x 1 x 2 216 0 x 1 x 3 5 y 2 16 56 x 1 14 64 x 2 6 44 x 3 204 17 x 1 x 2 258 13 x 1 x 3 in response to y 1 and y 2 the r sq values were 94 99 and 94 63 while the r sq adj values were 92 48 and 91 95 respectively when degree of freedom was 7 and alpha level was 0 05 the r sq values and the r sq adj values were both bigger than the critical value r 0 6664 of correlation coefficient test which indicates that the regression equation of y 1 and y 2 are statistically significant 34 the r sq pred values of y 1 and y 2 were 81 56 and 79 50 respectively because the r sq pred values were close to the corresponding r sq values and r sq adj values the model of y 1 and y 2 did not appear to be overfit and the predicted values obtained by eqs 4 and 5 would fit the experimental values quite accurately the adjusted mean squares adj ms are calculated by dividing the adjusted sum of squares adj ss by the degrees of freedom 33 according to the analysis of variance anova analysis table 4 mean squares ms are used to determine whether factors are significant dividing the ms team by the ms error gives the f values which follow the f distribution with degrees of freedom for the team and degrees of freedom for the error 35 if the f value is greater than the critical f value that means that the regression equation has statistical significance 35 the p value is used to judge whether the f value is larger than the critical f value 35 the p values of the regressions of y 1 and y 2 were both smaller than 0 05 which indicates that the all terms in the regression equation have a significant correlation with the response variable 3 1 2 effect of the ratio of raw materials on the specific surface area m2 g y 1 and porosity y 1 performance of the sediment ceramsite fig 4 shows the piepel response trace plots of the sediment ceramsite which were plotted based on the predictions from the ï¬tted model figs 5 and 6 reveal the effects of interaction of sediment zeolite and bentonite on the specific surface area and the porosity of sediment ceramsite for a ternary mixture according to these response curves the relationship between the response and the total variable changes can be observed as seen in figs 5 and 6 the specific surface area of sediment ceramsite is mostly affected by the proportion of zeolite added for the maximization of the specific surface area of ceramite the best additive ratio of zeolite was between 56 21 to 94 50 in combination with fig 4a it can be found that with the increase of the proportion of zeolite added the specific surface area of the sediment ceramsite was increased zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate minerals with stacked silica tetrahedron alumina tetrahedron layers which form a stable three dimensional microporous structure with huge specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity 17 wang et al 36 found that the larger the surface area is the more active sites there will be the purification effect of the sediment ceramsite would be significantly promoted due to the zeolite additives as observed in fig 5 and 6 the porosity of the sediment ceramsite is mostly affected by the added proportion of dredging sediment and bentonite when the additive proportion of sediment was between 27 86 to 58 26 and the additive proportion of bentonite was between 5 5 to 47 62 the porosity of sediment ceramsite reached the maximum value between 50 to 60 in combination with fig 4b it can be found that as the content of sediment and bentonite was increased the porosity of sediment ceramsite sharply increased and then decreased substantially appropriate gases and liquid phase at the expansion stage are essential for producing the porous ceramsite 37 38 during the sintering process the organic matter including the dredging sediment is carbonized and reacted with iron oxide to release a large amount of gas which facilitates the production of interconnected pores 37 xu et al 39 described gas producing reactions using sludge as follows 1 oxidation of organic matter 6 c o 2 c o 2 7 c c o 2 2 c o 8 3 c 2 o 2 2 c o c o 2 2 reduction of iron oxide 9 2 f e 2 o 3 c 4 f e o c o 2 10 2 f e 2 o 3 3 c 4 f e 3 c o 2 11 f e 2 o 3 c 2 f e o c o 12 f e 2 o 3 3 c 2 f e 3 c o however when the proportion of dredging sediment was too large it would led to a corresponding increase of residual carbon in the sintering stage which would cause an increase of the expansion gases and eventually crush the ball and reduce the porosity 38 beyond that the formation of the complicated pore structure is also closely related to the viscosity and the quantity of the liquid phase 29 when the bentonite content was more than 32 76 the viscosity of the liquid phase decreased dramatically and the excessive liquid phase filled the voids in the sintered ceramsite which created sintered ceramsite with denser bodies and fewer pores 3 1 3 optimization of the mixture proportions a response optimizer can identify the combination of input variable settings that jointly optimize one or more fitting responses with the use of a response optimizer the optimal mixture proportion was confirmed by using the specific surface area and porosity y 2 and y 2 responses as the assessment indicators under the optimum mixture proportions the maximum specific surface area and porosity of the sediment ceramsite were obtained simultaneously the composite desirability d was usually used to measure whether the joint optimization could satisfy the requirements for all the responses in the set 40 the composite desirability range is from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates the ideal situation and 0 indicates that one or more responses are beyond the acceptable range 40 to predict the optimum mixture proportion we set a target value and a lower bound for the responses to create the optimal plots which are shown in fig 7 here the maximum responses of a specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g with a porosity of 53 93 are achieved through the optimized mixture proportion which contained 40 30 wt sediment 39 42 wt zeolite and 20 28 wt bentonite the composite desirability 0 9587 is fairly close to 1 which demonstrated that the mixture formulation can achieve favorable results for all responses as a whole the average experimental result of three replications in the optimum mixture proportion presented the specific surface area of 49 14 m2 g and the porosity of 51 10 with a relative error of 4 91 and 5 24 for y 1 and y 2 respectively 3 2 characteristic analysis of the sediment ceramsite 3 2 1 analyses of the crystalline phases xrd in this experiment xrd analyses were used to obtain the mineral compositions of the raw materials and sintered ceramsite by comparing the sample xrd patterns with the database of the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds the xrd patterns of the raw material and sintered ceramsite are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a indicates that the crystalline phases in the dredging sediment are quartz sio2 dolomite camg co3 2 kyanite al2sio5 albite ordered naalsi3o8 and margarite caal2 si2al2 o10 oh 2 the major mineralogical compositions in zeolite are clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o and quartz sio2 while the crystal components of bentonite are montmorillonite namgalsio2 oh h2o with small amounts of microcline kalsi3o8 fig 8 b depicts the main crystalline phases of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the most abundant crystalline phases of t1 are clinoptilolite na alsi5o12 4h2o albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 and quartz sio2 compared to the raw materials the intensities of the xrd peaks of the quartz sio2 in the t1 ceramsite decrease significantly the observed decrease in the amount of quartz sio2 could be related to the consumption of this mineral during the formation of the glassy phase 41 the glassy surface acts as a capturer of gases causing the sediment ceramsite to bloat and form through 1100 c high heat sintering complex reactions such as decomposition melting have occurred 42 leading to the xrd peaks of dolomite camg co3 2 and margarite caal2 si2al2 o10 oh 2 completely disappearing which generated large amounts of cao cao is a reactive substance 43 and it may react with skeleton material such as microcline to form albite calcian ordered nacaal sial 2o8 44 this hypothesis was supported by the absence of kyanite dolomite and margarite in the t1 ceramsite by comparing the xrd data of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the result shows differences between the two the main new crystalline phases of the t2 ceramsite are tridymite sio2 and mullite al6si2o13 the tridymite sio2 is the polymorph of quartz which has a silica mineral crystal structure and mainly forms the dense surface 45 especially the sio2 existing in the t2 ceramsite is much more than that in the t1 ceramsite the result shows that sio2 could not easily form a eutectic mixture with other minerals under this material formulation because the thermal stability of montmorillonite is relatively poor 46 the t2 ceramsite tends to decrease the intensity of the xrd peaks of montmorillonite during the high heat sintering process montmorillonite would be converted into thermostable substances such as mullite 47 according to the previous studies mullite has an important effect on the formation of a high strength microstructure 48 which means that the t2 ceramsite will have a poorer bloating property but higher strength 3 2 2 thermal analysis dsc tga of the sintered ceramsite fig 9 a and 9b depict the curves of the thermal analysis of the t1 and t2 ceramsite for the t1 ceramsite the heating process can be divided into three stages stage 1 from 25 to 108 there was an 11 14 weight loss of t1 ceramsite at this stage the dcs curve had an exothermic peak at 47 which was caused the evaporation of physical adsorbed water 49 stage 2 from 108 to 678 there was an 8 86 weight loss of t1 ceramsite which was mainly caused by the emissions of co co2 formed from the thermal dissociation of dolomite 50 and the decomposition of organic matter 51 the dcs curve had a broad exothermic peak at approximately 494 because the amount of heat from combusting the organic matter exceeded the absorbed heat from the dolomite dissociation stage 3 from 678 to 800 an 1 14 weight loss of t1 ceramsite occurred implying the oxidation of carbon and the reduction of ferric iron to generate co2 o2 in the bloating process 52 the dcs curve has an endothermic peak at approximately 1101 and an exothermic peak at approximately 1151 the endothermic phenomenon that occurred might have been caused by the fusion of the flux which promoted the formation of the molten glass phase 53 when the gases are formed in parallel with the molten glass phase a porous ceramsite will be obtained the exothermic phenomenon that occurred is probably attributed to the formation of the albite calcian ordered crystal 54 for t2 ceramsite there were also three stages during the heating process stage 1 from 25 to 172 the weight loss of the t2 ceramsite was 14 5 which was significantly higher than that of the t1 ceramsite it could be speculated that the amount of bentonite which has a highly absorbent character in the t2 ceramsite was much greater than that in the t1 ceramsite 55 stage 2 from 172 to 650 the weight of the t2 ceramsite was only reduced by 2 7 because the composition of t2 ceramsite does not contain sediment the weight loss of the t2 ceramsite was dramatically lower than that of the t1 ceramsite during the second stage an endothermic peak was observed at 593 corresponding to the emission of the structural water 49 stage 3 from 650 to 1100 the tg curve tended to remain stable the dcs curve showed an endothermic peak and an exothermic peak at 715 and 1026 respectively the endothermic phenomenon was caused by the polymorphic transition of sio2 56 the exothermic phenomenon that occurred mainly contributed to the formation of mullite crystals 54 which means that the t2 ceramsite will be denser than the t1 ceramsite the results of the crystalline phase analyses were verified by thermal analysis 3 2 3 surface morphology and pore size distribution analyses to determine the relationship between the material composition and the microstructure more attention was given to the sem micrographs of the sintering ceramsite fig 10 a depicts the morphology and the microstructure of the t1 ceramsite the t1 ceramsite presents a rough and loose surface and has an abundant porous structure with elongated and interconnected pores diameters between 0 05 and 10 Î¼m the complicated porous structure is caused by the highly viscous liquid phase that prevents produced gas diffusion and then leaves sufficient voids in the ceramsite 57 fig 10 c presents the microstructure and the morphology of the t2 ceramsite it could be observed that the t2 ceramsite exhibits a smooth and densely compacted surface and has few relatively small pores irregularly distributed in the microstructure diameters between 0 05 and 1 Î¼m the t2 ceramsite samples were prepared by mixing zeolite and bentonite without the addition of the dredging sediment the lack of a bloating agent and the excess amounts of flux content caused fewer gases and lower viscosity of the liquid phase in this situation the liquid glass phase blocked the pores on the surface resulting in densification of the ceramsite 58 therefore the microstructure of the ceramsite is significantly influenced by raw materials and the proper mass ratio of the dredging sediment and bentonite plays an especially important role in the formation of a porous structure fig 10 b and 10d present the eds spectra of the t1 and t2 ceramsite the main types of nonmetallic elements and metal elements of the t1 and t2 ceramsite were si al o c p k na ca mg ti fe au etc the alumina silica ratios of both the t1 and t2 ceramsite are relatively lower which means that the sintering ceramsite has greater strength 59 bet gas sorptometry measurements were conducted to examine the porous nature of the sintering ceramsite fig 11 a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the sintering ceramsite the type ii isotherms can be observed in the sintering ceramsite which is characteristic of mesoporous and macropores materials 60 fig 11 b depicts the pore distribution in the t1 and t2 ceramsite the t1 ceramsite mainly consisted of macropores the mean pore size was 3 3472 Î¼m the bet specific surface area of the t1 ceramsite is 51 68 m2 g the single point total volume of pores at p p0 0 99 volume is 0 088738 cm3 g and the porosity of the t1 ceramsite is very high with a maximum of 53 93 table 5 compared with the t1 ceramsite the mean pore size of the t2 ceramsite is 0 5526 Î¼m the bet specific surface area is 14 60 m2 g the single point total volume of pores at p p0 0 99 volume is 0 045754 cm3 g and the porosity of the t2 ceramsite is only 8 12 the adhesion of microbes on the ceramsite is related to the specific surface area on the one hand and the pore structure on the other 61 korotta gamage et al 62 found that because the sizes of most of the environmental bacteria are 0 5 5 Î¼m only macropores and super macropores can provide effective action points for the fixation and growth of microorganisms bao et al 17 further discovered that the bioactivity of the microorganism is closely related to the porous structure of bio ceramsite the extremely high bet specific surface area and rich macropore structure strongly support the fact that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for use as a microbial carrier in the water treatment system 3 2 4 physical characteristics of the sintered ceramsite the physical characteristics of the sintered ceramsite are shown in table 5 based on the comparative analysis only the t1 ceramsite satisfies the china s standard method of artificial ceramsite filter material for water treatment and the standard of lightweight ceramsite bulk density 1 20 gbt17431 1 1998 63 the lower density of the t1 ceramsite is attributed to the presence of a large number of pores as shown in fig 8 in water treatment systems such as a moving bed biofilm reactors the lightweight ceramsite made the reactor easy to operate 64 the phzpc results of the t1 ceramsite indicate that the ceramsite surface is negatively charged in solution when the ph is higher than 4 43 which is beneficial to the adsorption of cations 65 additionally due to its high cec the t1 ceramsite may supply an abundant platform on which to exchange the cations 66 however compared with the t1 ceramsite the t2 ceramsite always has a higher compressive strength which is attributed to the fact that the pores are closed and relatively small larger amounts of tridymite and mullite also improve the strength of the t2 ceramsite 67 taking full account of the characteristics of sintered ceramsite it can be concluded that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for water treatment system applications and t2 is more suitable for construction material use 3 2 5 analysis of heavy metal leaching to simulate the leaching toxicity of heavy metals of sediment ceramsite in the water leaching toxicity tests were carried out as shown in table 6 the heavy metal leaching concentration of the dredging sediment and sintered ceramsite are compared with the official standard the results indicate that the heavy metal leaching concentration of the qinhuai river sediment is far less than china s quality standards for surface water iii gb3838 2002 68 but is below china s identification standards for hazardous wastes which demonstrate that the dredging sediment is an ordinary pollutant and not hazardous waste the heavy metal leaching concentration of the t1 ceramsite is more than that of the t2 ceramsite which indicates that the leachable heavy metals of the sintering ceramsite mostly come from the dredging sediment meanwhile the heavy metal leaching concentration of the t1 ceramsite has not exceeded china s quality standards for surface water iii and is much smaller than that of the dredging sediment of equal quality the reason for this phenomenon may be that some heavy metals such as cu zn pb cr se and as solidify in the aluminosilicate or silicate frameworks at a high temperature sintering process 69 meanwhile some heavy metals such as cd and hg are volatilized 70 in conclusion the leaching toxicity test results suggest that the sintering process is effective in immobilizing heavy metals contained in the raw materials the sediment ceramsite is environmentally friendly and it is less likely to cause secondary pollution in the water treatment system 4 conclusions this research represents the first step to successfully reusing dredging sediment to prepare ceramsite that can achieve not only technical benefits but can also result in good economic and ecological benefits the extreme vertices mixture design was first used in the preparation of ceramsite to model the optimal addition ratio of the three factors of sediment zeolite and bentonite the results show that the maximum specific surface area of 51 68 m2 g and the porosity of 53 93 are accomplished when the optimal mixing proportion of the sediment is 40 30 wt with a zeolite ratio of 39 42 wt and 20 28 wt of bentonite the results show that the addition ratio of zeolite affected the specific surface area of the ceramsite the proper addition ratio of bentonite could lower the viscosity of the glass phase in the ceramsite and promote the generation of the glass phase while the dredging sediment worked as a bloating agent during the sintering process and increased the porosity of ceramsite after analyzing the characteristics of the sintered ceramsite the results of the mineralogical and thermal analysis revealed that the formation of the vitreous phase acts as a capturer of the gases generated during sintering thus causing the ceramsite to bloat compared to the t2 ceramsite the sem and porosimetry results suggest that the rough surface and the macropores are dominant in the t1 ceramsite which means that the t1 ceramsite is more suitable for microbial growth furthermore the t1 ceramsite possesses many outstanding attributes such as its physical properties which are in compliance with the china s artificial ceramsite filter material standard and the lightweight ceramsite standards the amount of heavy metal leaching in the t1 ceramsite is far below the limitation of the national standard of china indicating that the sintering process could effectively immobilize the metals and the sintering ceramsite is relatively safe and reliable all these observations will further favor the utilization of dredging sediment ceramsite in water treatment systems and the final intention of treating wastes with wastes will be implemented however the research of the key sintering parameter such as the optimal sintering temperature and sintering time has not been well studied in addition the growth of biofilm in this optimal sediment ceramsite in practical water treatment systems such as the moving bed biofilm reactor should also be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13807,the research investigates the treatment of real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater by synergic catalytic ozonation with iron loaded zeolite a fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process in a hybrid reactor the wastewater was characterized by high organic content cod 1220 mg l and turbidity 247 ntu the experiments were conducted in a batch laboratory scale hybrid reactor with ozone spargers metal electrodes and suspended buckets loaded with fe z catalyst the effect of operational parameters of voltage 5 15 v ph 5 9 ozone dose 0 2 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 2 g l on cod and turbidity removal was studied with the mechanism explored the obtained results showed the cod removal efficiency was 85 12 and the turbidity of pharmaceutical wastewater reduced to 78 ntu at optimal conditions of voltage 5 v ph 7 ozone dose 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 5 g l the pharmaceutical removals achieved were 100 for enrofloxacin and 90 for amoxicillin it is therefore concluded that the synergic process was found highly suitable for the effective treatment of veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater in the hybrid reactor as an effective option keywords catalytic ozonation chemical oxygen demand electroflocculation pharmaceutical wastewater 1 introduction water is an important resource in the environment and life is impossible without water a huge amount of fresh water is used in industrial operations that produce wastewater the wastewater produced from different industries has a significant impact on the environment 1 3 due to a rapid increase in the consumption of antibiotics around the globe and consequent discharge in pharmaceutical wastewater a major environmental challenge has emerged 4 when released in wastewater antibiotics cause severe genotoxic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects to plants animals and human life 5 the presence of antibiotics in water bodies may promote the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in human beings causing serious public health concern 6 the antibiotics contain persistent nature and degradation resistance which make those insusceptible to conventional wastewater treatment technologies 7 therefore it is immensely needful to develop effective and efficient treatment technique for pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics the pharmaceutical industries produce toxic wastewater which contains bad odor and intensive color the higher chemical oxygen demand cod and low biological oxygen demand bod are the challenges related to pharmaceutical industries wastewater the real pharmaceutical wastewater has a complex matrix and a variety of organic compounds 8 9 when such type of wastewater directly discharges into the environment it may damage human health and aquatic life to protect the environment and to follow the discharge standards the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is necessary 10 the selection of an appropriate treatment technique is one of the major steps for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater while doing that the information regarding the efficiency of a particular technique is very important many researchers proposed several techniques to treat pharmaceutical wastewater however these techniques are less efficient due to the complex matrix of pharmaceutical wastewater 11 12 various treatment techniques have been applied for the treatment of antibiotics containing wastewater but remain unsuccessful in the complete removal of drugs biological treatment techniques such as activated sludge and trickling filters are although environment friendly but are time consuming and only partially removes the antibiotics constructed wetlands provide efficient performance but require a large area and settling time and cannot remove pharmaceuticals completely physical methods like adsorption offer high pharmaceutical removal but residue management and recycling are major issues membrane filtration is effective but fouling problem and cost is high chemical techniques like ozonation and advanced oxidation processes are highly effective for pharmaceutical removal but energy requirement and cost are high 7 13 14 the limitations in the stand alone processes can be overcome by the application of hybrid treatment techniques hybrid technique provides fast degradation and mineralization of antibiotics with reduced reaction time and operating cost 7 15 in the recent few years advanced oxidation processes aops gained much attention for real wastewater treatment among aops the catalytic ozonation process showed better performance for the treatment of some real wastewaters 8 bio treated textile wastewater was treated by implying iron shavings in the catalytic ozonation process 16 in another study treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was successfully studied by using nano catalyzed ozonation process the cod color and toxicity were removed by using the nanocatalyst o3 nzvi although the investigation showed better performance of the process 17 however the efficiency of the treatment process depends on many parameters such as the nature of the effluents operational parameters and nature of the catalyst some recent studies investigated the efficiency of the hybrid process a combined catalytic ozonation and electrocoagulation process for the treatment of dye basic yellow 28 from wastewater again this study conducted on a synthetic solution and did not check the performance on real wastewater 17 19 the electrocoagulation process has been effectively applied for many industrial effluents such as textile paper paint industry distillery domestic etc treatment 17 this technology uses electro produced coagulants for the treatment of contaminants present in wastewater the anodic oxidation in the electroflocculation process produces in situ electrocoagulants for organics removal in wastewater 18 electrocoagulation has shown effective performance for the elimination of pharmaceutical antibiotics from the wastewater ensano et al 20 reported the treatment of amoxicillin diclofenac and carbamazepine in real municipal wastewater by electrocoagulation process using a conventional electrochemical reactor with an aluminum anode more than 50 removal of antibiotics was achieved at low current density 0 3 ma cm2 and ph 7 but at a high electrolysis time of 3 h mukimin et al 21 applied the hybrid electrochemical advanced oxidation process for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics such as rifampicin complete demineralization and 100 cod removal was achieved in the hybrid process by applying 6 v but using elongated contact time baran et al 22 reported the removal of veterinary antibiotics by the electrocoagulation process 100 removal of doxycycline antibiotic was achieved at ph 6 5 and 7 v voltage this research reported that electrocoagulation caused the oxidative degradation of antibiotic and a reduction in the eco toxicity of the reaction system ahmadzadeh et al 23 reported the removal of ciprofloxacin antibiotic from hospital wastewater by electrocoagulation this study showed sweep coagulation as a dominant mechanism for 88 57 removal of antibiotic at ph 7 78 current density 12 5 ma cm2 after 20 min thereby the author suggests that hybridizing the electrocoagulation process with another technology may further assist in the enhancement of removal efficiency catalytic ozonation has proved to be an effective technique for the abatement of pharmaceutical antibiotics in wastewater sani et al 24 reported the treatment of antibiotic ciprofloxacin using alumina nanoparticles catalytic ozonation process in both synthetic and real pharmaceutical wastewater ciprofloxacin removal of 93 was achieved in synthetic wastewater at ph 9 5 after 60 min however the ciprofloxacin removal in real wastewater was only 41 18 due to the complex matrix of real wastewater and the scavenging effect generated by other wastewater contaminants based on the above research stand alone technology for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater may be insufficient due to the complex mixture of contaminants and the scavenging effect thereby the author suggests that hybrid techniques may be considered for efficient treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater lu et al 25 investigated the application of simultaneous catalytic ozonation and photocatalysis for the treatment of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole tetracycline ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim a high mineralization efficiency with up to 97 8 removal was achieved after 80 min at 0 1 g catalyst dose and 2 mg l ozone concentration shahmahdi et al 26 evaluated the performance of iron shavings in catalytic ozonation for the removal of sulfamethoxazole from municipal wastewater a very quick 99 mineralization of antibiotic was reported within 5 min and 80 cod removal was achieved after 60 min at ph 7 ozone concentration 178 8 mg l and iron amount of 288 46 g l mojiri et al 27 reported the combined ozonation adsorption process for the treatment of pharmaceutical antibiotics like acetaminophen and amoxicillin using cross linked chitosan bentonite complete mineralization of drugs was achieved in the combined process at ph 7 and ozone dose 15 mg l as reported earlier pharmaceutical wastewater often contains complex and persistent organic compounds so a hybrid technique catalytic ozonation in combination with electroflocculation would be the best option for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment the veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater mostly contains two main veterinary drugs of amoxicillin and enrofloxacin these contain the Î² lactam antibiotic which is effective against respiratory digestive tract and urinary bacterial infections these are highly soluble in water and are discharged in wastewaters 28 previous research reveals that the synergy of catalytic ozonation with electrochemical processes opens additional pathways for the rapid generation of oh radicals which readily destructs the organics and efficiency is greatly improved as compared to stand alone processes 1 29 30 moreover the hybrid or synergic processes are more sustainable and feasible provide enhanced treatment efficiency requiring compact reactors with energy savings and thereby reducing the capital cost requirement 31 32 in addition in the synergic process both electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process have significant importance electrocoagulation is quite useful for turbidity reduction and catalytic ozonation for cod removal however the stand alone process may not perform effectively in high turbidity conditions therefore for the treatment of real wastewater the synergic process implying both processes simultaneously may be useful since the turbidity may hinder the catalytic activity in a single process and in the current investigation also the catalyst packing in the bucket assembly may aid the process efficiency current work reports the first research on the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics like enrofloxacin and amoxicillin by synergic catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation process using iron loaded zeolite catalyst in a non conventional hybrid electrochemical reactor with suspended bucket assembly the experimentation was conducted in a hybrid reactor with simultaneous catalytic ozonation and al electrodes electroflocculation process the fe z catalyst was stacked in the rotary buckets suspended in the reactor which provides convenience for the loading and separation of the catalyst after treatment solving a difficult issue of catalyst disengagement conventional batch reactors may have some disadvantages such as loss of catalyst due to mechanical stirring difficult recovery of catalyst mass transfer limitations of solid catalysts 33 and sludge formation in fe based catalysts that may settle in batch reactors and poison the active sites 34 therefore a novel approach was implied in the current investigation where the fe z catalyst was loaded in the twin buckets suspended in the hybrid reactor the bucket assembly is not present in the conventional electrocoagulation reactors reported in the recent research studies 35 36 for the treatment of wastewater these buckets are removable which provide the convenience in catalyst loading in the reactor and recovery of the catalyst after application the advantageous installation and removability of the buckets after each catalytic run offers easy disengagement of the catalyst moreover in the current study the effects of various operational parameters such as voltage ph ozone dose and catalyst dose were studied for cod and turbidity reduction from veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater with the mechanism explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater was taken from the sundar estate veterinary pharmaceutical company located in lahore pakistan after collection the wastewater was transported to the lab on the same day and was immediately stored at 4 c the sample was characterized before the treatment technique the initial characterization of veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater is given in table 1 the reagents and chemicals that were used for the determination of cod are sulfuric acid potassium iodide silver sulfate sodium thiosulphate mercury sulfate starch ferrous ammonium sulfate and potassium dichromate 17 19 all the chemicals and reagents were analytical grade 2 2 catalyst preparation the zeolite a was purchased from sigma aldrich usa the catalyst was prepared according to the method given in the literature 38 in this method 6 0 g of iron salt fe so4 7h2o was dissolved in 20 ml ultrapure deionized water then 10 g of zeolite a were placed in the salt solution the solution was stirred at 100 c 120 rpm until the water was evaporated afterward the iron impregnated zeolite was dried overnight at 102 c then the catalyst was calcined at 550 c for 6 h 38 after calcination the dried catalyst was rinsed in 0 1 m nitric acid for 1 day then washed with distilled water until a constant ph of the water and finally drying at 110 c was done 18 2 3 experimental setup procedure the experimental setup used in current research is shown in fig 1 the hybrid reactor consisted of a rectangular pyrex glass tank composed of two aluminum flat electrodes with 41 23 cm2 as an effective area with a 20 cm gap and two plexiglass buckets carrying the fe z catalyst the ozone from the ozone generator was bubbled through the spargers at the base of the reactor the electric current was supplied by the dc power supply for each run 1 l wastewater sample was poured in the reactor ph was set the desired voltage and ozone dose was adjusted and the samples were taken for the analysis after fixed time intervals the buckets were rotated continuously by the attached motor assembly 2 4 analytical methods the wastewater ph was determined by a ph meter hanna hi 9811 bod was measured by the winkler standard method of analysis the turbidity was measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu using a turbidity unit hach 2100 p by standard method 2 5 ozone dose the inlet ozone dose supply to the reactor was measured by using the standards method 18 the ozone gas produced from the ozone generator was passed through gas wash bottles containing 2 ki solution for a fixed time 30 min after that the solution was quenched with 2 n h2so4 solution in the next step it was titrated with 0 005 n sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 by using a starch indicator the following formula was used to calculate the ozone dose 18 o z o n e d o s e m g m i n n v 24 t v volume of the titrant used n normality of na2s2o3 t time for

behrotest digestion system behr technik germany using the kjeldahl method 0 025 m na2co3 was used for quenching wastewater samples after collection for the elimination of left over ozone 2 8 analysis of pharmaceuticals the pharmaceuticals were quantified by using the hplc system hitachi elite lachrom l 2130 associated with the c18 4 6 250 mm column poroshell 120 the composition of the mobile phase was 50 50 acetonitrile phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m kh2po4 and 0 2 m naoh in ultra pure deionized water the wavelength was fixed to 254 nm and the injection volume was 10 Î¼l and the flow rate was

and 60 Î¼g l for amoxicillin and 34 Î¼g l 130 Î¼g l for enrofloxacin respectively the percentage removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals were determined from the peak area in the wastewater sample and

wastewater 40 in that results of studied catalyst zeolite a were presented for various characterization techniques the ftir analysis fig 2 before and after iron impregnation clearly shows the iron incorporation on zeolites a new peak at 1 442 34 cm 1 was observed due to iron loading that corresponds to feoh stretching vibrations 40 3 2 effect of voltage the performance of the electroflocculation process highly depends on the applied voltage the effect of voltage on the cod and turbidity abatement of real pharmaceutical wastewater was studied at levels of 5 v 10 v and 15 v fig 3 shows the results of voltage on the cod and turbidity reduction with the time of electrolysis and the applied voltage both the cod and turbidity reduction increased significantly the cod removals of 75 3 72 4 and 67 9 were achieved after 40 min at 15 v 10 v and 5 v respectively similarly an abrupt decrease in the turbidity with the voltage was observed the turbidity values reached 96 ntu 101 ntu and 125 ntu after 40 min at applied voltages of 15 v 10 v and 5 v respectively the reason may be that with the enhanced applied voltage the ion generation by the dissolution of electrode increases which produces various species of metal hydroxides causing charge neutralization of the organic compounds present in the pharmaceutical wastewater decreasing electrostatic repulsion and predominating van der wall s attraction to cause the sweep coagulation flocculation and ultimate removal 17 the results presented in fig 3 show that the cod removal efficiency 60 min was not significantly higher at 15 v and 10 v as compared to 5 v therefore due the reason that in an electrochemical process the specific energy consumption greatly enhances with the increase in applied voltage 41 and due to economic aspects 5 v was selected as optimum voltage as more than 80 cod and turbidity reduction was achieved after 60 min although the increase in the voltage in the presence of ozone offers an increase in the production of oh radicals by o2 reduction leading to the generation of h2o2 which promotes the o3 conversion to oh radicals thereby enhancing the organics abatement 3 3 effect of ph the ph of synergic catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation process highly influences the organics reaction pathway since the electroflucculation is a self ph neutralizing process in which the ph initially enhances to the basic range due to the water electrolysis and production of oh ions and h2 evolution the neutral ph stability in the electroflocculation process is achieved due to the ultimate conversion of al species and formation of insoluble al oh 3 in the range 6 8 19 similarly the ozonation is a ph driven process favoring the radical mechanism by producing oh radicals in alkaline ph and the direct o3 oxidation of organics in the acidic ph range 18 28 39 the catalyst surface charges highly govern the reaction kinetics in the catalytic ozonation process for the abatement of the organics the levels of ph 5 7 and 9 were studied for the cod and turbidity abatement of real pharmaceutical wastewater the results shown in fig 4 reveal significantly enhanced reductions of cod and turbidity with the ph the cod reduction reached up to 88 5 85 2 and 78 7 after 60 min at ph 9 7 and 5 respectively while the turbidity values of 72 ntu 80 1 ntu and 103 2 ntu were achieved the highest reductions achieved at ph 9 indicate the presence of highly positively charged organic pollutants in the wastewater at alkaline ph 9 the synergic effect of catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation greatly enhanced the organics abatement at ph level 9 the generation of a l o h 4 is the most dominant species in the electroflocculation process 20 42 the ozone enhanced self decomposition to give oh radicals which promptly degrade organics by radical mechanism 28 41 and the predominancy of negatively charges on the catalyst surface are all the factors that contribute to the enhanced organics degradation at ph 9 as compared to other studied ph levels moreover at higher ph the synergic dual effect of the fine h2 bubbles generation in the electroflocculation with the ozonation bubbling in the system significantly induces turbulence mixing and gas solid liquid interfacial contact with enhanced ionic mobility causing a rapid organic degradation and removal in the present study the maximum cod reduction of 88 5 was achieved at ph 9 fig 4 while at ph 7 85 2 cod reduction was obtained since the real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater was received at ph 7 therefore the experiments were performed at real conditions without changing ph since for practical applications changing the ph of wastewater before treatment at a larger scale may not be economical therefore in current investigation ph 7 was selected as an optimal ph 3 4 effect of catalyst dose the catalyst plays a special role in the electroflocculation catalytic ozonation synergic process due to severe adsorption capacity and kinetics for the abatement of organics in the real pharmaceutical wastewater the applied fe z catalytic activity was studied in the synergic process by varying the catalytic dose in the range 1 2 g l and noting the reductions in the cod and turbidity of the wastewater the results shown in fig 5 confirm the catalytic activity by revealing a positive effect of catalyst dose on cod and turbidity reductions the cod removal increased from 75 6 to 88 9 and turbidity values reduced to 81 ntu and 76 ntu by maximizing the fe z dose from 1 g l to 2 g l respectively the catalyst dose provides the available surface area for the quick adsorption of organics but also provides a platform to trigger the radical chain reactions which promptly attack the organics 19 28 the catalytic activity enhances at higher catalyst dose to provide more efficient organic removal a catalyst dose of 1 5 g l was selected as optimum as more than 85 cod removal was achieved 3 5 catalyst reuse performance the catalytic reuse performance was evaluated by reusing the catalyst after washing and drying in four consecutive runs a reduction in cod removal efficiency up to 11 and turbidity removal up to 8 2 was observed in the 4th cyclic run fig 6 which may be due to the catalyst porous surface coverage by the organics in the electroflocculation catalytic ozonation synergic process the catalyst surface is continuously auto regenerated due to hybrid mechanisms of electrochemical oxidation ozone oxidation or the in situ generated radicals oxidation thereby maintaining the catalyst adsorption capacity and enhancing the catalyst life and replacement needs the slight iron leach out of fe z catalyst in reuse cyclic runs may cause a little decrease in the catalytic activity moreover the leached fe may interact with continuously produced oh ions in the solution to form fe oh 3 which also acts as a coagulant and may have a positive effect on the treatment efficiency the generation of al oh 3 acts as a prime coagulant in the reactor due to the al electrodes while only negligible amount fe oh 3 may be formed the fe leach out analysis of catalyst was performed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer aanalyst 800 perkin elmer usa the results indicate that even after four runs only a minute quantity of iron was leached out 0 04 mg l this further suggested that studied catalyst may be stable in real conditions in wastewater it is important to mention here that after each batch experimental run a slight layer of sludge appears at the surface which contains the electro coagulated al oh 3 flocs floated to the surface by the o2 generated at anode and due to the ozone effect the surface sludge was scraped and removed 3 6 effect of ozone dose ozone dose enhances the ozone oxygen mixture concentration in the solution to trigger the generation of oxidants in the synergic electroflocculation ozonation process which highly improves the treatment efficiency the ozone dose significantly enhanced the cod and turbidity reduction for real pharmaceutical wastewater as shown in fig 7 the cod removals of 81 6 85 2 and 87 4 were achieved at ozone dosages of 0 2 mg min 0 4 mg min and 0 6 mg min respectively the turbidity also decreased and reached to levels 84 ntu 78 ntu and 73 ntu respectively the increase in the ozone gas concentration directly enhances the diffusion through the gas liquid interface hence the dissolved ozone concentration increases to readily attack the organics 24 43 44 the accelerated rates of radical based reactions occurring at the catalyst surface at higher ozone doses significantly enhance the organics removal 45 3 7 comparison of various processes the results presented in fig 8 a show that cod removal was the highest in the case of the synergic process as compared with other studied processes the order of removal efficiency was synergic process catalytic ozonation ozonation and electroflocculation process this may be because ozonation based processes at studied ph ph 7 promote to generate hydroxyl radicals that have high degradation rate as compared to oxidant oo 2 generated in electroflocculataion process 40 in the case of turbidity reduction although the synergic process was found to be highly efficient as compared to others fig 8b however interestingly processes involve electroflocculation were shown high turbidity reduction as compared to others synergic electroflocculation o3 electroflocculation catalytic ozonation ozonation this may be because electroflocculation involves al oh 3 flocs that adsorbed suspended particles in wastewater 40 therefore the results further confirm that the synergic process may be a better option to treat wastewater in real conditions 3 8 removal of pharmaceuticals the results presented in fig 9 clearly indicate that both the identified pharmaceuticals were significantly removed from wastewater by using studied synergic process the removal efficiency was found to be the highest in the case of enrofloxacin as compared with amoxicillin for example the removal efficiency was about 100 for enrofloxacin and was 90 was amoxicillin this may be due to the nature of pharmaceuticals their reactivity and adsorption on the catalyst 46 the results presented in table 1 clearly suggest that the effluents are well within the range of national environmental quality parameters neqs for the wastewater to be discharged into waste streams it is important to mention here that for wastewater recycling the utility of wastewater for recycling purposes is important and it should meet standards accordingly for example for irrigation purposes irrigation standards may apply with some additional parameters such as salinity of the water the focus of the current investigation was to investigate the effectiveness of the synergic process in a hybrid reactor and it was found that treated veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater is well within the neqs with respect to studied parameters table 1 3 9 proposed mechanism the proposed mechanism of organic mineralization by synergic catalytic ozonation with fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process is shown in fig 10 the results prove the synergy between the catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation processes for the degradation of organics the optimum removal of organics at ph 7 suggests that in the hybrid reactor the side by side mechanisms of oxidation by catalytic ozonation and sweep coagulation by electroflocculation occur simultaneously the in situ oxidation at anode facilitates the generation of o2 and metal ions while reduction at cathode generates oh ions 11 and facilitates h2o2 generation leading to oh radicals 47 the al flocs are produced in the reactor which captures the organics by destabilization and neutralization 48 at ph 7 both the direct and radical oxidation mechanism of ozonation may take place 49 the zeolite provides the platform for the fast generation of organics killer oh radicals in the solution by several possible mechanisms like zeolite catalyzed reductions of o3 to o3 and o2 generation of h2o2 all leading to mineralization of organics by oh 43 50 the synergic mechanism significantly improves the organics degradation in pharmaceutical wastewater 4 conclusions the current research has shown that the synergic catalytic ozonation with the fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process is a promising technique for the reduction of organics in veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater using a hybrid reactor with advantageous easy removal of the catalyst for its reuse after treatment as compared to other conventional reactors the obtained results revealed that at optimal conditions of voltage 5 v ph 7 ozone dose 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 5 g l cod removal efficiency of 85 12 was achieved and turbidity was reduced to 78 ntu after 60 min the results also show the synergic mechanisms taking place in the reactor like sweep coagulation and faster oxidation of pollutants due to significantly enhanced production of oh radicals greatly improves the organics reduction the pharmaceutical removal was 100 for enrofloxacin and was 90 for amoxicillin at optimum conditions the results show the suitability of synergic catalytic ozonation with zeolite a catalyst and electroflocculation

13807,the research investigates the treatment of real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater by synergic catalytic ozonation with iron loaded zeolite a fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process in a hybrid reactor the wastewater was characterized by high organic content cod 1220 mg l and turbidity 247 ntu the experiments were conducted in a batch laboratory scale hybrid reactor with ozone spargers metal electrodes and suspended buckets loaded with fe z catalyst the effect of operational parameters of voltage 5 15 v ph 5 9 ozone dose 0 2 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 2 g l on cod and turbidity removal was studied with the mechanism explored the obtained results showed the cod removal efficiency was 85 12 and the turbidity of pharmaceutical wastewater reduced to 78 ntu at optimal conditions of voltage 5 v ph 7 ozone dose 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 5 g l the pharmaceutical removals achieved were 100 for enrofloxacin and 90 for amoxicillin it is therefore concluded that the synergic process was found highly suitable for the effective treatment of veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater in the hybrid reactor as an effective option keywords catalytic ozonation chemical oxygen demand electroflocculation pharmaceutical wastewater 1 introduction water is an important resource in the environment and life is impossible without water a huge amount of fresh water is used in industrial operations that produce wastewater the wastewater produced from different industries has a significant impact on the environment 1 3 due to a rapid increase in the consumption of antibiotics around the globe and consequent discharge in pharmaceutical wastewater a major environmental challenge has emerged 4 when released in wastewater antibiotics cause severe genotoxic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects to plants animals and human life 5 the presence of antibiotics in water bodies may promote the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in human beings causing serious public health concern 6 the antibiotics contain persistent nature and degradation resistance which make those insusceptible to conventional wastewater treatment technologies 7 therefore it is immensely needful to develop effective and efficient treatment technique for pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics the pharmaceutical industries produce toxic wastewater which contains bad odor and intensive color the higher chemical oxygen demand cod and low biological oxygen demand bod are the challenges related to pharmaceutical industries wastewater the real pharmaceutical wastewater has a complex matrix and a variety of organic compounds 8 9 when such type of wastewater directly discharges into the environment it may damage human health and aquatic life to protect the environment and to follow the discharge standards the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is necessary 10 the selection of an appropriate treatment technique is one of the major steps for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater while doing that the information regarding the efficiency of a particular technique is very important many researchers proposed several techniques to treat pharmaceutical wastewater however these techniques are less efficient due to the complex matrix of pharmaceutical wastewater 11 12 various treatment techniques have been applied for the treatment of antibiotics containing wastewater but remain unsuccessful in the complete removal of drugs biological treatment techniques such as activated sludge and trickling filters are although environment friendly but are time consuming and only partially removes the antibiotics constructed wetlands provide efficient performance but require a large area and settling time and cannot remove pharmaceuticals completely physical methods like adsorption offer high pharmaceutical removal but residue management and recycling are major issues membrane filtration is effective but fouling problem and cost is high chemical techniques like ozonation and advanced oxidation processes are highly effective for pharmaceutical removal but energy requirement and cost are high 7 13 14 the limitations in the stand alone processes can be overcome by the application of hybrid treatment techniques hybrid technique provides fast degradation and mineralization of antibiotics with reduced reaction time and operating cost 7 15 in the recent few years advanced oxidation processes aops gained much attention for real wastewater treatment among aops the catalytic ozonation process showed better performance for the treatment of some real wastewaters 8 bio treated textile wastewater was treated by implying iron shavings in the catalytic ozonation process 16 in another study treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater was successfully studied by using nano catalyzed ozonation process the cod color and toxicity were removed by using the nanocatalyst o3 nzvi although the investigation showed better performance of the process 17 however the efficiency of the treatment process depends on many parameters such as the nature of the effluents operational parameters and nature of the catalyst some recent studies investigated the efficiency of the hybrid process a combined catalytic ozonation and electrocoagulation process for the treatment of dye basic yellow 28 from wastewater again this study conducted on a synthetic solution and did not check the performance on real wastewater 17 19 the electrocoagulation process has been effectively applied for many industrial effluents such as textile paper paint industry distillery domestic etc treatment 17 this technology uses electro produced coagulants for the treatment of contaminants present in wastewater the anodic oxidation in the electroflocculation process produces in situ electrocoagulants for organics removal in wastewater 18 electrocoagulation has shown effective performance for the elimination of pharmaceutical antibiotics from the wastewater ensano et al 20 reported the treatment of amoxicillin diclofenac and carbamazepine in real municipal wastewater by electrocoagulation process using a conventional electrochemical reactor with an aluminum anode more than 50 removal of antibiotics was achieved at low current density 0 3 ma cm2 and ph 7 but at a high electrolysis time of 3 h mukimin et al 21 applied the hybrid electrochemical advanced oxidation process for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics such as rifampicin complete demineralization and 100 cod removal was achieved in the hybrid process by applying 6 v but using elongated contact time baran et al 22 reported the removal of veterinary antibiotics by the electrocoagulation process 100 removal of doxycycline antibiotic was achieved at ph 6 5 and 7 v voltage this research reported that electrocoagulation caused the oxidative degradation of antibiotic and a reduction in the eco toxicity of the reaction system ahmadzadeh et al 23 reported the removal of ciprofloxacin antibiotic from hospital wastewater by electrocoagulation this study showed sweep coagulation as a dominant mechanism for 88 57 removal of antibiotic at ph 7 78 current density 12 5 ma cm2 after 20 min thereby the author suggests that hybridizing the electrocoagulation process with another technology may further assist in the enhancement of removal efficiency catalytic ozonation has proved to be an effective technique for the abatement of pharmaceutical antibiotics in wastewater sani et al 24 reported the treatment of antibiotic ciprofloxacin using alumina nanoparticles catalytic ozonation process in both synthetic and real pharmaceutical wastewater ciprofloxacin removal of 93 was achieved in synthetic wastewater at ph 9 5 after 60 min however the ciprofloxacin removal in real wastewater was only 41 18 due to the complex matrix of real wastewater and the scavenging effect generated by other wastewater contaminants based on the above research stand alone technology for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater may be insufficient due to the complex mixture of contaminants and the scavenging effect thereby the author suggests that hybrid techniques may be considered for efficient treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater lu et al 25 investigated the application of simultaneous catalytic ozonation and photocatalysis for the treatment of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole tetracycline ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim a high mineralization efficiency with up to 97 8 removal was achieved after 80 min at 0 1 g catalyst dose and 2 mg l ozone concentration shahmahdi et al 26 evaluated the performance of iron shavings in catalytic ozonation for the removal of sulfamethoxazole from municipal wastewater a very quick 99 mineralization of antibiotic was reported within 5 min and 80 cod removal was achieved after 60 min at ph 7 ozone concentration 178 8 mg l and iron amount of 288 46 g l mojiri et al 27 reported the combined ozonation adsorption process for the treatment of pharmaceutical antibiotics like acetaminophen and amoxicillin using cross linked chitosan bentonite complete mineralization of drugs was achieved in the combined process at ph 7 and ozone dose 15 mg l as reported earlier pharmaceutical wastewater often contains complex and persistent organic compounds so a hybrid technique catalytic ozonation in combination with electroflocculation would be the best option for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment the veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater mostly contains two main veterinary drugs of amoxicillin and enrofloxacin these contain the Î² lactam antibiotic which is effective against respiratory digestive tract and urinary bacterial infections these are highly soluble in water and are discharged in wastewaters 28 previous research reveals that the synergy of catalytic ozonation with electrochemical processes opens additional pathways for the rapid generation of oh radicals which readily destructs the organics and efficiency is greatly improved as compared to stand alone processes 1 29 30 moreover the hybrid or synergic processes are more sustainable and feasible provide enhanced treatment efficiency requiring compact reactors with energy savings and thereby reducing the capital cost requirement 31 32 in addition in the synergic process both electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process have significant importance electrocoagulation is quite useful for turbidity reduction and catalytic ozonation for cod removal however the stand alone process may not perform effectively in high turbidity conditions therefore for the treatment of real wastewater the synergic process implying both processes simultaneously may be useful since the turbidity may hinder the catalytic activity in a single process and in the current investigation also the catalyst packing in the bucket assembly may aid the process efficiency current work reports the first research on the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics like enrofloxacin and amoxicillin by synergic catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation process using iron loaded zeolite catalyst in a non conventional hybrid electrochemical reactor with suspended bucket assembly the experimentation was conducted in a hybrid reactor with simultaneous catalytic ozonation and al electrodes electroflocculation process the fe z catalyst was stacked in the rotary buckets suspended in the reactor which provides convenience for the loading and separation of the catalyst after treatment solving a difficult issue of catalyst disengagement conventional batch reactors may have some disadvantages such as loss of catalyst due to mechanical stirring difficult recovery of catalyst mass transfer limitations of solid catalysts 33 and sludge formation in fe based catalysts that may settle in batch reactors and poison the active sites 34 therefore a novel approach was implied in the current investigation where the fe z catalyst was loaded in the twin buckets suspended in the hybrid reactor the bucket assembly is not present in the conventional electrocoagulation reactors reported in the recent research studies 35 36 for the treatment of wastewater these buckets are removable which provide the convenience in catalyst loading in the reactor and recovery of the catalyst after application the advantageous installation and removability of the buckets after each catalytic run offers easy disengagement of the catalyst moreover in the current study the effects of various operational parameters such as voltage ph ozone dose and catalyst dose were studied for cod and turbidity reduction from veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater with the mechanism explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater was taken from the sundar estate veterinary pharmaceutical company located in lahore pakistan after collection the wastewater was transported to the lab on the same day and was immediately stored at 4 c the sample was characterized before the treatment technique the initial characterization of veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater is given in table 1 the reagents and chemicals that were used for the determination of cod are sulfuric acid potassium iodide silver sulfate sodium thiosulphate mercury sulfate starch ferrous ammonium sulfate and potassium dichromate 17 19 all the chemicals and reagents were analytical grade 2 2 catalyst preparation the zeolite a was purchased from sigma aldrich usa the catalyst was prepared according to the method given in the literature 38 in this method 6 0 g of iron salt fe so4 7h2o was dissolved in 20 ml ultrapure deionized water then 10 g of zeolite a were placed in the salt solution the solution was stirred at 100 c 120 rpm until the water was evaporated afterward the iron impregnated zeolite was dried overnight at 102 c then the catalyst was calcined at 550 c for 6 h 38 after calcination the dried catalyst was rinsed in 0 1 m nitric acid for 1 day then washed with distilled water until a constant ph of the water and finally drying at 110 c was done 18 2 3 experimental setup procedure the experimental setup used in current research is shown in fig 1 the hybrid reactor consisted of a rectangular pyrex glass tank composed of two aluminum flat electrodes with 41 23 cm2 as an effective area with a 20 cm gap and two plexiglass buckets carrying the fe z catalyst the ozone from the ozone generator was bubbled through the spargers at the base of the reactor the electric current was supplied by the dc power supply for each run 1 l wastewater sample was poured in the reactor ph was set the desired voltage and ozone dose was adjusted and the samples were taken for the analysis after fixed time intervals the buckets were rotated continuously by the attached motor assembly 2 4 analytical methods the wastewater ph was determined by a ph meter hanna hi 9811 bod was measured by the winkler standard method of analysis the turbidity was measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu using a turbidity unit hach 2100 p by standard method 2 5 ozone dose the inlet ozone dose supply to the reactor was measured by using the standards method 18 the ozone gas produced from the ozone generator was passed through gas wash bottles containing 2 ki solution for a fixed time 30 min after that the solution was quenched with 2 n h2so4 solution in the next step it was titrated with 0 005 n sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 by using a starch indicator the following formula was used to calculate the ozone dose 18 o z o n e d o s e m g m i n n v 24 t v volume of the titrant used n normality of na2s2o3 t time for ozonation 2 6 chemical oxygen demand cod the cod of samples before treatment and after treatment process was measured by using the standard method 18 the samples were filtered with the help of filter

behrotest digestion system behr technik germany using the kjeldahl method 0 025 m na2co3 was used for quenching wastewater samples after collection for the elimination of left over ozone 2 8 analysis of pharmaceuticals the pharmaceuticals were quantified by using the hplc system hitachi elite lachrom l 2130 associated with the c18 4 6 250 mm column poroshell 120 the composition of the mobile phase was 50 50 acetonitrile phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m kh2po4 and 0 2 m naoh in ultra pure deionized water the wavelength was fixed to 254 nm and the injection volume was 10 Î¼l and the flow rate was 1 ml min the unknown pharmaceuticals were detected from veterinary wastewater by an internal standard method the limit of detections and quantifications were quantified and were found to be 18 Î¼g l and 60 Î¼g l for amoxicillin and 34 Î¼g l 130 Î¼g l for enrofloxacin respectively the percentage removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals were determined from the peak area in the wastewater sample and peak area after treatment by the following formula p h a r m a c e u t i c a l r e m o v a l a o a t a o x 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the characterization of catalyst fe z is given in table 2 the surface area and pore size of the catalyst were studied by the bet method using micromeritics usa asap 2020 analyzer the pore size of the catalyst was 6 Ã¥ the isoelectric point was calculated by using the mass transfer method and it was 6 9 0 4 39 the catalyst elemental analysis of fe z was performed by using sem edx using tescan uk vega lmu the results presented in table 2 indicate that iron coated on zeolite was 8 2 it confirms the iron impregnation of zeolite a this study is the continuation of the authors previous study on applications of zeolite a in wastewater 40 in that results of studied catalyst zeolite a were presented for various characterization techniques the ftir analysis fig 2 before and after iron impregnation clearly shows the iron incorporation on zeolites a new peak at 1 442 34 cm 1 was observed due to iron loading that corresponds to feoh stretching vibrations 40 3 2 effect of voltage the performance of the electroflocculation process highly depends on the applied voltage the effect of voltage on the cod and turbidity abatement of real pharmaceutical wastewater was studied at levels of 5 v 10 v and 15 v fig 3 shows the results of voltage on the cod and turbidity reduction with the time of electrolysis and the applied voltage both the cod and turbidity reduction increased significantly the cod removals of 75 3 72 4 and 67 9 were achieved after 40 min at 15 v 10 v and 5 v respectively similarly an abrupt decrease in the turbidity with the voltage was observed the turbidity values reached 96 ntu 101 ntu and 125 ntu after 40 min at applied voltages of 15 v 10 v and 5 v respectively the reason may be that with the enhanced applied voltage the ion generation by the dissolution of electrode increases which produces various species of metal hydroxides causing charge neutralization of the organic compounds present in the pharmaceutical wastewater decreasing electrostatic repulsion and predominating van der wall s attraction to cause the sweep coagulation flocculation and ultimate removal 17 the results presented in fig 3 show that the cod removal efficiency 60 min was not significantly higher at 15 v and 10 v as compared to 5 v therefore due the reason that in an electrochemical process the specific energy consumption greatly enhances with the increase in applied voltage 41 and due to economic aspects 5 v was selected as optimum voltage as more than 80 cod and turbidity reduction was achieved after 60 min although the increase in the voltage in the presence of ozone offers an increase in the production of oh radicals by o2 reduction leading to the generation of h2o2 which promotes the o3 conversion to oh radicals thereby enhancing the organics abatement 3 3 effect of ph the ph of synergic catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation process highly influences the organics reaction pathway since the electroflucculation is a self ph neutralizing process in which the ph initially enhances to the basic range due to the water electrolysis and production of oh ions and h2 evolution the neutral ph stability in the electroflocculation process is achieved due to the ultimate conversion of al species and formation of insoluble al oh 3 in the range 6 8 19 similarly the ozonation is a ph driven process favoring the radical mechanism by producing oh radicals in alkaline ph and the direct o3 oxidation of organics in the acidic ph range 18 28 39 the catalyst surface charges highly govern the reaction kinetics in the catalytic ozonation process for the abatement of the organics the levels of ph 5 7 and 9 were studied for the cod and turbidity abatement of real pharmaceutical wastewater the results shown in fig 4 reveal significantly enhanced reductions of cod and turbidity with the ph the cod reduction reached up to 88 5 85 2 and 78 7 after 60 min at ph 9 7 and 5 respectively while the turbidity values of 72 ntu 80 1 ntu and 103 2 ntu were achieved the highest reductions achieved at ph 9 indicate the presence of highly positively charged organic pollutants in the wastewater at alkaline ph 9 the synergic effect of catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation greatly enhanced the organics abatement at ph level 9 the generation of a l o h 4 is the most dominant species in the electroflocculation process 20 42 the ozone enhanced self decomposition to give oh radicals which promptly degrade organics by radical mechanism 28 41 and the predominancy of negatively charges on the catalyst surface are all the factors that contribute to the enhanced organics degradation at ph 9 as compared to other studied ph levels moreover at higher ph the synergic dual effect of the fine h2 bubbles generation in the electroflocculation with the ozonation bubbling in the system significantly induces turbulence mixing and gas solid liquid interfacial contact with enhanced ionic mobility causing a rapid organic degradation and removal in the present study the maximum cod reduction of 88 5 was achieved at ph 9 fig 4 while at ph 7 85 2 cod reduction was obtained since the real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater was received at ph 7 therefore the experiments were performed at real conditions without changing ph since for practical applications changing the ph of wastewater before treatment at a larger scale may not be economical therefore in current investigation ph 7 was selected as an optimal ph 3 4 effect of catalyst dose the catalyst plays a special role in the electroflocculation catalytic ozonation synergic process due to severe adsorption capacity and kinetics for the abatement of organics in the real pharmaceutical wastewater the applied fe z catalytic activity was studied in the synergic process by varying the catalytic dose in the range 1 2 g l and noting the reductions in the cod and turbidity of the wastewater the results shown in fig 5 confirm the catalytic activity by revealing a positive effect of catalyst dose on cod and turbidity reductions the cod removal increased from 75 6 to 88 9 and turbidity values reduced to 81 ntu and 76 ntu by maximizing the fe z dose from 1 g l to 2 g l respectively the catalyst dose provides the available surface area for the quick adsorption of organics but also provides a platform to trigger the radical chain reactions which promptly attack the organics 19 28 the catalytic activity enhances at higher catalyst dose to provide more efficient organic removal a catalyst dose of 1 5 g l was selected as optimum as more than 85 cod removal was achieved 3 5 catalyst reuse performance the catalytic reuse performance was evaluated by reusing the catalyst after washing and drying in four consecutive runs a reduction in cod removal efficiency up to 11 and turbidity removal up to 8 2 was observed in the 4th cyclic run fig 6 which may be due to the catalyst porous surface coverage by the organics in the electroflocculation catalytic ozonation synergic process the catalyst surface is continuously auto regenerated due to hybrid mechanisms of electrochemical oxidation ozone oxidation or the in situ generated radicals oxidation thereby maintaining the catalyst adsorption capacity and enhancing the catalyst life and replacement needs the slight iron leach out of fe z catalyst in reuse cyclic runs may cause a little decrease in the catalytic activity moreover the leached fe may interact with continuously produced oh ions in the solution to form fe oh 3 which also acts as a coagulant and may have a positive effect on the treatment efficiency the generation of al oh 3 acts as a prime coagulant in the reactor due to the al electrodes while only negligible amount fe oh 3 may be formed the fe leach out analysis of catalyst was performed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer aanalyst 800 perkin elmer usa the results indicate that even after four runs only a minute quantity of iron was leached out 0 04 mg l this further suggested that studied catalyst may be stable in real conditions in wastewater it is important to mention here that after each batch experimental run a slight layer of sludge appears at the surface which contains the electro coagulated al oh 3 flocs floated to the surface by the o2 generated at anode and due to the ozone effect the surface sludge was scraped and removed 3 6 effect of ozone dose ozone dose enhances the ozone oxygen mixture concentration in the solution to trigger the generation of oxidants in the synergic electroflocculation ozonation process which highly improves the treatment efficiency the ozone dose significantly enhanced the cod and turbidity reduction for real pharmaceutical wastewater as shown in fig 7 the cod removals of 81 6 85 2 and 87 4 were achieved at ozone dosages of 0 2 mg min 0 4 mg min and 0 6 mg min respectively the turbidity also decreased and reached to levels 84 ntu 78 ntu and 73 ntu respectively the increase in the ozone gas concentration directly enhances the diffusion through the gas liquid interface hence the dissolved ozone concentration increases to readily attack the organics 24 43 44 the accelerated rates of radical based reactions occurring at the catalyst surface at higher ozone doses significantly enhance the organics removal 45 3 7 comparison of various processes the results presented in fig 8 a show that cod removal was the highest in the case of the synergic process as compared with other studied processes the order of removal efficiency was synergic process catalytic ozonation ozonation and electroflocculation process this may be because ozonation based processes at studied ph ph 7 promote to generate hydroxyl radicals that have high degradation rate as compared to oxidant oo 2 generated in electroflocculataion process 40 in the case of turbidity reduction although the synergic process was found to be highly efficient as compared to others fig 8b however interestingly processes involve electroflocculation were shown high turbidity reduction as compared to others synergic electroflocculation o3 electroflocculation catalytic ozonation ozonation this may be because electroflocculation involves al oh 3 flocs that adsorbed suspended particles in wastewater 40 therefore the results further confirm that the synergic process may be a better option to treat wastewater in real conditions 3 8 removal of pharmaceuticals the results presented in fig 9 clearly indicate that both the identified pharmaceuticals were significantly removed from wastewater by using studied synergic process the removal efficiency was found to be the highest in the case of enrofloxacin as compared with amoxicillin for example the removal efficiency was about 100 for enrofloxacin and was 90 was amoxicillin this may be due to the nature of pharmaceuticals their reactivity and adsorption on the catalyst 46 the results presented in table 1 clearly suggest that the effluents are well within the range of national environmental quality parameters neqs for the wastewater to be discharged into waste streams it is important to mention here that for wastewater recycling the utility of wastewater for recycling purposes is important and it should meet standards accordingly for example for irrigation purposes irrigation standards may apply with some additional parameters such as salinity of the water the focus of the current investigation was to investigate the effectiveness of the synergic process in a hybrid reactor and it was found that treated veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater is well within the neqs with respect to studied parameters table 1 3 9 proposed mechanism the proposed mechanism of organic mineralization by synergic catalytic ozonation with fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process is shown in fig 10 the results prove the synergy between the catalytic ozonation and electroflocculation processes for the degradation of organics the optimum removal of organics at ph 7 suggests that in the hybrid reactor the side by side mechanisms of oxidation by catalytic ozonation and sweep coagulation by electroflocculation occur simultaneously the in situ oxidation at anode facilitates the generation of o2 and metal ions while reduction at cathode generates oh ions 11 and facilitates h2o2 generation leading to oh radicals 47 the al flocs are produced in the reactor which captures the organics by destabilization and neutralization 48 at ph 7 both the direct and radical oxidation mechanism of ozonation may take place 49 the zeolite provides the platform for the fast generation of organics killer oh radicals in the solution by several possible mechanisms like zeolite catalyzed reductions of o3 to o3 and o2 generation of h2o2 all leading to mineralization of organics by oh 43 50 the synergic mechanism significantly improves the organics degradation in pharmaceutical wastewater 4 conclusions the current research has shown that the synergic catalytic ozonation with the fe z catalyst and electroflocculation process is a promising technique for the reduction of organics in veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater using a hybrid reactor with advantageous easy removal of the catalyst for its reuse after treatment as compared to other conventional reactors the obtained results revealed that at optimal conditions of voltage 5 v ph 7 ozone dose 0 4 mg min and catalyst dose 1 5 g l cod removal efficiency of 85 12 was achieved and turbidity was reduced to 78 ntu after 60 min the results also show the synergic mechanisms taking place in the reactor like sweep coagulation and faster oxidation of pollutants due to significantly enhanced production of oh radicals greatly improves the organics reduction the pharmaceutical removal was 100 for enrofloxacin and was 90 for amoxicillin at optimum conditions the results show the suitability of synergic catalytic ozonation with zeolite a catalyst and electroflocculation

13808,the utilization of waste polyvinyl chloride pvc as a membrane substrate and its hydrophilicity enhancement by incorporation of a sustainable biopolymer gum arabic ga for natural organic matter nom removal in water was studied in this research phase transformation method was used for membrane preparation by varying the percentage of ga interactions between waste pvc and ga at different loadings 1 5 wt were analyzed using various analytical techniques for morphology and evaluation studies field emission scanning electron microscopy thermogravimetric analysis fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy equilibrium water content contact angle porosity water flux and compaction factor were assessed furthermore the assessment of nom removal from water was also studied it was found that blending of waste pvc with ga enhanced its hydrophilicity by 25 improved its water permeation from 51 to 98 l m2h with a flux recovery ratio of around 80 and a rejection of around 96 the onset degradation temperature was also improved by 30 c and the mechanical strength was enhanced by 1 2 mpa the present study depicts the outcome of the incorporation of ga as a green alternative additive for enhancing the performance of waste pvc based membranes in water treatment applications keywords waste polyvinyl chloride gum arabic hydrophilicity natural organic matter biopolymer membrane 1 introduction surface water is assiduously contaminated by natural organic matter nom from various sources like the chemical microbiological anthropogenic and phytochemical transformation of flora and fauna 1 2 nom are those complex heterogeneous organic substances resulting from terrestrial and marine origins that affect the quality purity appearance and other physicochemical parameters of water 2 3 these problems are generally compounded when the water source is purified by a conventional method during chlorination for drinking water treatment the complex substances can react and produce health threatening compounds like trihalomethanes thms 4 5 humic acid ha is a category of nom which exists in surface and river water the presence of ha in water can result in bad odor color alteration absorption of metals and an increase in turbidity and microbial activities 1 6 therefore ha has to be removed to produce safe water for public utility coagulation is one of the traditional methods of nom removal but coagulants have to be purchased repeatedly to sustain the process 5 moreover ha may combine with coagulants to hinder the overall process and generate sludge that requires additional removal 4 7 adsorption is another established technique that can remove nom from water however the adsorbent is required to be regenerated and separated from the water system every time 4 similarly ion exchange is another viable method for the removal of nom nevertheless this requires resin and resin revival the handling of which involves additional operational and disposal costs 8 likewise during chlorination the phenolic hydroxyl moiety of the ha may react with the disinfectant chlorine and produce trihalomethanes 1 3 membrane filtration has proven to be an efficient process for nom removal to make water usable 9 however the major challenge of this separation process is its high cost and membrane fouling 3 8 10 this article is focused on the preparation of low cost hydrophilic membranes to address the above discussed challenges the application of the prepared membrane was confirmed by applying it for nom removal from synthetic wastewater waste plastic was used to reduce membrane cost and to protect the environment as well the pressure poised by waste plastic on the environment is enormous suitable discarding of post consumer plastic is a challenge 11 to manage this challenge many waste management and treatment approaches like burying combustion and incineration have been established but which are unfavorable to ecological progressions due to the release of poisonous gases leading to contamination of air and water bodies 12 13 hence waste plastic reprocessing and reuse are consequently considered the best environmental methods of getting rid of waste plastic 14 accordingly scholars across the world are continuously exploring the potentials of reprocessing waste plastic as a substance for the fabrication of membrane 13 14 waste recycling is a primary aim of the world program of global sustainability because of its combined benefits of economic and environmental conservation 12 polyvinyl chloride pvc is the second largest thermoplastic manufactured in the world in terms of quantity after polyethylene 11 13 this could be linked to its collective physical chemical and enduring properties which make it a versatile polymer having various applications 15 10 its multipurpose applications lead to the generation of a high quantity of waste pvc with disposal and management problems however pvc can dissolve in various organic solvents and it has a film forming ability these characteristics of pvc has rendered it suitable to be used as a membrane precursor 13 16 the virgin version of pvc has been established as membrane material by researchers with a drawback of hydrophobicity 15 17 19 hydrophobic surfaces are susceptible to fouling which can be controlled by incorporating hydrophilic additives 20 membrane fouling results in higher operating pressure hinders the membrane permeability selectivity reduces its lifecycle affects its productivity induces frequent washing and deteriorates its permeate quality 1 3 21 22 this can be managed by the incorporation of suitable additive to improve membrane hydrophilicity 13 23 researchers have published that films with hydrophilic characteristics are more resistant to fouling by organic materials and microbes owing to the dealings among the organic materials and the film interface 17 21 24 thus integrating hydrophilic additives in membrane fabrication to enhance its hydrophilicity and fouling mitigation by incorporating enhancers has been of great interest polymers like polyethylene glycol 25 26 polyethylene glycol methyl ether 27 and polyvinylpyrrolidone 18 28 19 have been used as traditional additives nevertheless the problem of membrane fouling continues to hinder the operation of membranes during water treatment and its inhibition remains a focus of study 22 29 recently biopolymers have been gaining attention as membrane modifiers due to their hydrophilic moieties environmental friendliness sustainability and other inherent properties padil et al 30 used gum karayana and its consequential effects on the properties and characterization of electrospun polyvinyl alcohol membranes asim et al 31 investigated the role of acacia exudate conjugated cellulose nanocrystals for their antibacterial and chlorine resistance effect on polyvinyl alcohol membranes kumar et al 1 used xanthan gum to improve the properties of polyethersulfone membranes for the effective separation of humic acid sabri et al 32 studied the antibacterial effects of arabic gum in the polysulfone membranes many amphiphilic polymers like tween 33 and pluronic 34 35 have been used for the enhancement of hydrophilicity amphiphilic polymers have a propensity to isolate the film surface with hydrophilic parts while the hydrophobic fragments firmly attaches to the membrane matrix 34 36 gum arabic ga was used for membrane modification to improve its antibacterial ability 31 32 ga contains oh groups which has the potential to enhance hydrophilicity 21 however enhancement of hydrophilicity fouling mitigation and removal of nom in water is scant for the ga modified membrane contrary to the use of expensive polymers this work explores the use of waste pvc as a membrane precursor that addresses the environmental problem and the economy of the membrane process as well the novelty of this work was also enhanced by increasing the hydrophilicity of the prepared waste plastic based membranes by using gum arabic ga as a biopolymer therefore the objectives of the study are to utilize an environmental pollutant waste plastic i e waste pvc to tackle another environmental issue water treatment by fabrication of membrane using waste pvc and improving its hydrophilicity through the incorporation of gum arabic ga which is a sustainable biopolymer as a green alternative waste pvc was chosen as an alternate source of membrane precursor in this study because of its dual benefits of reduction in membrane cost as well as reduction of adverse effects on the environment thus waste pvc incorporated ga based membranes were made up through the non solvent stimulated phase transformation process the interactions between the waste pvc ga at different loadings were analyzed using various analytical techniques and subsequently it was used for natural organic matter humic acid removal from water the outcome delivered environmental benefits conforming to the circular sustainability policy 2 experimental 2 1 materials the main polymer utilized in the dope solution was waste polyvinyl chloride which was collected from the premises of iit guwahati india the waste pvc pipes were thoroughly washed to remove any adhered impurities and then cut into smaller sizes for easy dissolution in the solvents gum arabic which was incorporated as a green additive was supplied by sigma aldrich india the solvent n methyl pyrrolidone nmp reagent grade purity was also supplied by sigma aldrich india deionized di water was obtained from the millipore system and was used as the non solvent in the coagulation bath humic acid ha was obtained from otto chemie private limited india 2 2 membrane preparation the preparation of membranes was done by the most common phase inversion method induced by di water as the non solvent various membranes with dissimilar compositions as depicted in table 1 were fabricated by dissolving the materials in nmp in borosilicate glass followed by overnight heating in a mantle at 60 5 c at an agitation speed of 500 rpm the solution was later degassed by keeping in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 25 c after 5 min of sonication the sonication was performed at 300 w with a frequency of 40 khz lastly the solution was casted on a glass tray with a thickness of about 190 200 Î¼m and then dipped in a 4 l water bath at 25 c for the phase inversion transformation to take place after the phase inversion process the membranes were immersed in di water for 24 h for stabilization before its characterization and performance evaluation 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 morphological study the surface morphology of all the prepared films was studied via field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem sigma 300 zeiss usa preceding the scanning the membranes were dried in a hot air oven 40 c for 24 h and then were fixed to the stub with double faced carbon tape and glazed with gold 26 the morphologies of the samples were scanned and images of each of the membranes surfaces were observed 2 3 2 permeation study an amicon millipore cell filtration cell having a volume of 300 ml was used to assess the pure water flux pwf and compaction factor cf the membranes were fitted into the module by cutting them into circular forms with an effective membrane area of 38 10 4 m2 the cell was loaded with di water and pressurized by an inert gas the cf was calculated based on the first and the last steady water flux ratio 36 while the flux was estimated based on eq 1 1 j w v a t where jw was the flux l m2h v was the amount of permeate l a was the membrane area m2 and t was the period for permeation in hour h 2 3 3 equilibrium water content ewc study the ewc specifies the extent of porosity and water affinity of a membrane 36 it is also interrelated to the absorptivity of a membrane the prepared films were sized into a 1 cm2 piece to create a uniform shape for the analysis the membranes were saturated in di water for 24 h and then mobbed with tissue paper and their weights wet weight were noted afterwards they were retained in a vacuum oven for a day 24 h at 60 c and their weights dry weight were again recorded based on the recorded weights the ewc was estimated based on eq 2 2 w a t e r c o n t e n t w w w d w w 100 where ww and wd represented the wet weight and dry weight of the membrane respectively 2 3 4 hydrophilicity study to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membrane samples the static water contact angle was measured the contact angle was inspected by a goniometer dsa 25 kruss india 13 the films were stored for 1 h in a hot air oven at 40 c the membranes were then cut and placed on the equipment afterwards di water was released by a syringe in the form of drops 2 0 Î¼l on the surface of the membrane samples the drops were made in triplicate positions and the static water angle was calculated based on the average values 25 2 3 5 porosity and pore size studies membrane sponginess is an important parameter that dictates the permeation of the membranes while the pore size determines the selectivity retention capability of the membranes thus the porosity was estimated based on eq 3 3 p o r o s i t y Îµ w w w d Ï a Î´ 100 where a was the membrane area m2 Ï kg m3 was the density of water at standard temperature and pressure stp Î´ was the thickness of the membrane m and ww and wd were the wet weight and the dry weight of the membrane kg respectively the average pore size of the membranes was computed based on the porosity values and water filtration values generally the pore radius rm is considered to be an approximation of the exact pore dimension of a membrane 9 regular pore range can be estimated via the guerout elford ferry equation eq 4 15 37 4 r m 2 9 1 75 Îµ 8 Î¼ Î´ q Îµ a Î´ p where Î¼ was the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 in pa s and q was the water flow and Î´p was the operational pressure 2 3 6 rejection study one of the known natural organic substance contaminants in the surface water is humic acid ha hence for the determination of the applicability of the fabricated membranes ha rejection studies were carried out by using a 100 mg l ha feed solution the filtration set up that was used for the permeability study was also used in this study the removal level of ha was estimated by analyzing the feed and permeate concentration using an ultra violet uv visible spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa at a wavelength of 254 nm and the rejections were computed using eq 5 38 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where r was the percentage retention cp was the concentration of the permeate and cf was the feed concentration respectively 2 3 7 flux recovery and fouling ratio studies the flux recovery and other related ratios were investigated using ha as the model solute initially the pure water flux pwf fw1 was noted thereafter the ha with a feed concentration of 100 mg l was permeated for 90 min and the permeate flux fha was recorded the membranes were washed by immersing in di water and ultrasonicated in the water bath for 20 min and then backwashed afterwards the pwf fw2 was again noted finally the fouling behavior was examined based on the following equations eqs 6 9 13 6 t f r f w 1 f h a f w 1 7 r f r f w 2 f h a f w 1 8 i f r f w 1 f w 2 f w 1 9 f r r f w 2 f w 1 where tfr was the total fouling ratio rfr was the reversible fouling ratio ifr was the irreversible fouling ratio and frr was the flux recovery ratio 2 3 8 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopic study the ftir analysis of the membranes was done using a perkin elmer spectrophotometer frontier perkin elmer usa prior to the investigation the samples were oven dried at 50 c for 1 h subsequently they were examined via the atr transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 3500 700 cm 1 and their ftir spectrum was recorded 2 3 9 thermal studies the effect of additive on the thermal behavior of the films was studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga tga 4000 perkin elmer usa the system was set in the range of 30 600 c at a heating rate of 10 c min to maintain an inert environment nitrogen gas flow at the rate of 20 ml min was sustained at a pressure of about 1 7 bars 2 3 10 mechanical studies the mechanical test can predict the durability and pressure capability of a membrane an electromechanical universal testing machine utm z005tn zwick rowell usa with a motorized screw mechanism was used for this purpose the membranes were cut into pre determined dimensions of 5 mm by 100 mm using a special cutter with a calibrated cutting mat the samples were clutched between the upper and the lower arm of the utm with a 50 mm gauge the test was done by applying a 1 k n pressure at 2 mm min the tensile strength and percentage elongation were recorded in triplicates and their average values were reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological study the surface and the cross section fesem images of the membranes are displayed in fig 1 it was observed that the ga incorporated membranes had better pore formation than the unincorporated one mg0 this could be ascribed to the hydrophilic moieties of the polysaccharides that influence the phase inversion process the sponginess and pore dimensions tend to be suppressed when the loading of ga was improved in the dope solution from 3 to 5 percent it could be seen that the surface of mg0 was smooth while the porosity was enhanced by the increment of ga from 1 wt and 3 wt nevertheless the porosity was repressed when the concentration of ga was amplified to 5 wt the macro void formation was noticeable at 3 wt loading of the ga the task of the biopolymer ga in the development of the membrane porosity is clearly like other macromolecular additives that are identified to influence the subtle stability of thermodynamics and kinetics in a dope solution 39 28 subsequently a permeable film structure with a finely spongy skin layer was obtained similar morphology was reported when other biopolymers were added as pore formers by other researchers 1 39 3 2 ftir study the ftir atr spectra of the prepared films mg0 mg1 mg3 and mg5 are depicted in fig 2 the spectrum of the ga powder and the waste pvc ga blended membranes were generated via an upper and lower wavenumber gap of 3500 to 650 cm 1 the lower region of the wavenumber is credited to the unique fingerprint of the materials thus the wavenumber at 864 cm 1 might be credited to the presence of c cl due to the waste pvc layer which existed in both the incorporated and non ga incorporated waste pvc membranes the wavenumber at 1013 cm 1 which implied the presence of ch band was observed representing the presence of polysaccharides the characteristic band of cc stretch for both the aliphatic and aromatic galactoproteins of ga was seen at around 1602 cm 1 40 and its corresponding appearance was also noted in the blend this might be due to the synergistic interaction between the waste pvc and the biopolymer ga the band at 2916 cm 1 indicated c h stretching vibrations the characteristic band in the wavenumber section of 3000 3500 cm 1 for the amino group was concealed by the wide absorption peak at 3234 cm 1 for oh group 30 41 this could be one of the reasons for the hydrophilicity enhancement within the membrane 3 3 thermal studies the heat stability of the membranes was analyzed using tga the result is displayed in fig 3 all the samples showed three degradation stages which confirmed that the waste material utilized was pvc pvc normally has 3 levels of degradation 17 the first stage represents dehydrochlorination and the other two are chain elimination and decomposition char formation these segments have been appropriately demarcated in the thermogram fig 3 the onset degradation temperature for the unmodified waste pvc based membranes mg0 was seen at 230 c whereas the films incorporated with different concentrations of ga showed an improved onset decomposition temperature of around 260 c this rise in temperature could be attributed to the addition of ga as it is known that the onset degradation temperature for polysaccharide gums is about 260 c 41 this signified that ga incorporated membranes had satisfactory heat stability hence they could also be applied in hot streams apart from the water filtration units 3 4 mechanical studies the mechanical test helps in predicting the durability and pressure capability of the membranes an electromechanical universal testing machine utm with a motorized screw mechanism was employed to determine the tensile strength and percentage elongation of the membranes the outcomes are revealed in fig 4 the incorporation of ga into the membrane solution affected the mechanical properties of the samples the membrane mg0 which was prepared without the addition of ga had about 3 mpa tensile strength incorporation of ga improved its tensile strength to 3 6 mpa at 1 wt and 3 4 mpa at 3 wt loading the slight decrease of the mechanical strength and elongation for the mg3 membrane could be ascribed to the enhanced porosity of the membrane similar behavior was reported in another study where the membrane with loose porous structure displayed lower mechanical properties 42 at 5 wt loading of ga into the solution the membrane demonstrated the highest tensile strength of 4 2 mpa this phenomenon could be attributed to its suppressed porous nature at higher loading as explained in section 3 1 suppressed micro voids tend to increase tensile strength 37 likewise the elongation also enhanced as the ga concentration was amplified from 0 wt to 5 wt within the waste pvc casting solution the elongation of around 23 8 was recorded for the mg5 membrane as against 14 2 for the mg0 membrane this improvement could be attributed to its plasticizing effect and the amphiphilic moieties of the gum arabic interacting with the hydrophobic backbone of waste pvc a similar scenario was reported in another study 43 nevertheless the mg3 membrane showed a low percent elongation of 17 compared to the mg1 membrane this was due to the formation of micro voids and its corresponding relatively highest porosity of 67 as elucidated in the subsequent section however mg5 had a higher voidage and better mechanical strength than mg1 this was because of the fact that it had a higher percentage of ga which created a plasticizing effect resulting in improved mechanical strength therefore the incorporation of ga not only improved the permeation parameters but also the mechanical characteristics which could be beneficial for the mechanical and pressure durability of the membranes in real life applications 3 5 ewc study percentage of water content is one of the important parameters that is closely linked with pure water flux and porosity in membrane characterization it is also termed as equilibrium water content ewc 13 the results of the ewc is presented in fig 5 the percentage of water content increased from 60 to 73 when ga incorporation increased from 0 wt to 5 wt increasing the ga percentage in the casting solution enhanced the ewc significantly this was credited to the hydrophilic amphiphilic characteristics of ga however ewc is closely linked with membrane porosity which by extension relates to pure water flux again pure water flux is mutually related to surface hydrophilicity 36 the improved hydrophilicity was also evident from the contact angle and porosity results as discussed in the subsequent section this outcome also agreed with the results of pure water flux and porosity as described in subsequent sections 3 6 hydrophilicity study contact angle measurement is an analytical technique for determining the hydrophilicity of membranes 20 the ewc and the water contact angle is shown in fig 5 the figure illustrated that the hydrophilicity of the samples was boosted by the incorporation of ga into the membranes due to its affinity with water the mg0 membrane showed the highest static water contact angle swca of 86 2 1 7 signifying the least hydrophilicity owing to the hydrophobic behavior of the base polymer incorporation of ga reduced the swca to 77 7 1 9 mg1 70 4 1 6 mg3 and 65 1 1 4 mg5 respectively this translated to a reduction in contact angle thereby indicating improved hydrophilicity 27 the reason behind the drop might be ascribed to the polysaccharides fragments of ga which hydrophilized the membrane surface 43 thus the hydrophobic polypeptide chain could link to the hydrophobic backbone of the waste pvc exposing the hydrophilic polysaccharide moieties to the surface so enhancing the hydrophilicity of the membranes fig 6 34 this outcome was supported by the data of ewc and pure water flux improvement of hydrophilicity would enhance the membrane characteristics especially in water flux and fouling mitigation 3 7 porosity and pore size studies porosity and pore size are significant factors in determining membrane performance 25 the membrane sponginess and pore radius are presented in table 2 the porosity showed an increasing trend from 43 1 1 1 mg0 to 66 6 1 3 mg3 as the fraction of ga augmented from 0 to 3 wt this rise in sponginess might be credited to the hydrophilic moieties of ga this outcome was also in agreement with the results of ewc as discussed in the previous section as the pores inclined to accommodate the water molecules nevertheless when the concentration of ga incorporation was amplified to 5 wt the porosity dropped by 7 mg5 this could be clarified based on the fact that an intensification in viscosity of dope solutions reduces the de mixing progression and as a consequence a membrane with lesser penetrability could be made 28 similarly the pore radius improved as ga was supplemented in the waste plastic dope solution about 33 pore size variation was noted the pore radius decreased by around 10 when 5 wt of ga was introduced this happened because increasing the polymer concentration wt while keeping the solvent constant leads to an increase in solution viscosity hence delayed de mixing happens and suppressed void formation is obtained due to thermodynamic instability this phenomenon has been explained by other researchers also 26 44 the membrane pore size varied between 22 1 3 3 1 6 nm which falls within the range of 2 100 nm and so the membranes could be classified as ultrafiltration membranes 3 8 permeation study the permeation abilities of the films were determined by using eq 1 and the outcome is presented in table 2 the advantage of the integration of ga into the membrane matrix was evident from the outcomes of pwf the flux increased from 51 l m2h to 93 l m2h as the percentage of ga was augmented up to 3 wt this could be ascribed to the hydrophilicity and porosity enhancement by the biopolymer ga as explained in the previous sections a similar outcome was reported by others on integrating xanthan gum into polyethersulfone membranes 1 however flux decrease was noted when ga loading was increased further this was expected as 5 wt loading showed a slight reduction in sponginess and skewed pore size due to the increase in viscosity of dope solution rising the polymer concentration wt leads to an increase in solution viscosity which reduces the de mixing progression mg3 had the highest pure water flux due to greater surface pore size and porosity apart from the membrane surface hydrophilicity porosity and pore radius are the important factors influencing membrane permeation 39 the membrane compaction was evaluated using the initial and the final stable pwf the influence of compaction on the membrane s flux is represented in fig 7 all the membranes showed some decline in flux at the initial onset and reached flux stability at around one hour of pure water permeation because of compaction c f this was due to the suppression and reorientation of the pores because of the applied transmembrane pressure 36 the membranes prepared from both the components displayed a similar compaction rate 3 9 rejection study the samples mg0 mg1 mg3 and mg5 were applied for the rejection of humic acid and the outcome is presented in fig 8 the mg0 membrane had a rejection of around 81 whereas the incorporation of ga increased the ha rejection by up to 96 a similar improvement was also noted in the water flux although during the permeation of ha a decline of flux was noted due to fouling the effect was studied in the subsequent section the molecular weight of ha is up to 500 kda hence the membrane with the pore size range of 22 33 nm would be able to reject the molecules based on the size exclusion mechanism even though size exclusion is not the only mechanism in this process the carboxyl group of ga has a negative charge 43 and ha contains acidic functional groups 31 deprotonation would cause the molecule to exhibit negative surface charges generating charge repulsion 45 hence under this condition electrostatic repulsion of ha molecules between the surface and the solute might increase the rate of rejection of the natural organic matter thus mg5 had the highest rejection 96 owing to its pore dimensions porosity and surface chemistry because of ga incorporation while mg0 with no ga had the least rejection this indicated that the biopolymer ga is an effective additive for ha mitigation and hydrophilicity enhancement in the waste pvc based membrane for the removal of nom in water 3 10 flux recovery and fouling ratio study the pure water flux fw1 flux during filtration of ha fha solution and the second cycle of pure water flux fw2 after ha filtration are shown in fig 9 the pure water flux of 51 l m2h mg0 85 l m2h mg1 98 l m2h mg3 and 93 l m2h mg5 were observed the flux during permeation of ha were 11 l m2h mg0 23 l m2h mg1 31 l m2h mg3 and 32 l m2h mg5 respectively the decline in the flux was noted due to membrane fouling during the permeation of the ha solution thereafter the membrane was cleaned using di water as described in section 2 3 7 and the second cycle of pure water permeation was carried out with the following flux of 31 l m2h mg0 62 l m2h mg1 76 l m2h mg3 and 74 l m2h mg5 these variations in flux were used to study the fouling and flux recovery ratios of the membranes the fouling properties of the membranes were estimated by the different fouling ratios and the flux recovery ratio frr the total fouling ratio tfr is the summation of the reversible fouling ratio rfr and the irreversible fouling ratio ifr 36 these parameters were calculated based on the permeation of the ha fha and the corresponding pure water fluxes fw1 and fw2 the outcomes of the ratios are shown in fig 10 the tfr of mg0 was 79 indicating a substantial decrease in flux the tfr decreased to 73 with the incorporation of 1 wt ga into the waste pvc dope solution subsequently 68 and 66 tfr were recorded for mg3 and mg5 respectively the total fouling ratio is an index of membrane flux loss the reduction of tfr from 73 to 66 showed an improvement in the antifouling effect of the membranes hence the lesser the tfr the better the membrane another beneficial aspect was the pattern observed for the rfr and the ifr the rfr increased from 40 to 46 while the ifr decreased from 40 to 20 as the loading of ga increased from 0 wt to 5 wt respectively this meant that the blended membranes could easily be washed to reverse their flux the flux recovery rate frr is an indicator of membrane durability and the rate of recovery after hydraulic cleaning 9 the frr of the membranes improved significantly as the ga wt was increased the frr of 60 mg0 73 mg1 77 mg3 and 80 mg5 were observed this showed an enhancement of about 32 frr at 5 wt ga loading this was credited to the hydrophilic behavior of the additive which inhibited the hydrophobic moieties of the waste pvc it also agreed with the outcomes of the contact angle as explained in section 3 6 higher frr signifies better antifouling property 38 this indicated that the incorporation of the biopolymer ga into the backbone of the waste pvc improved the antifouling behavior of the prepared membrane 3 11 performance comparison with existing work the performance of the prepared membranes was compared with some articles that reported the removal of humic acid the compared parameters are presented in table 3 it can be envisaged that the result of the current work relates well with the reported works 10 46 membrane permeability and selectivity are two outstanding membrane parameters that determine performance 21 hence the flux 98 l m2h and rejection 96 in this work compared positively with the other cited reports 47 48 thus this indicates that the incorporation of a biopolymer ga into the waste pvc enhances the parameters and performance judiciously furthermore most of the cited literature has a similar range in weight concentration 15 of base polymer for membrane fabrication although the material used for the fabrication in this work is not pristine this has shown that the precursor is of low cost compared to the existing literature as no cost was expended on the base polymer signifying economic and environmental benefits thereby conforming to the circular sustainability policy of the world 4 conclusion waste plastic incorporated gum arabic base membranes were fabricated and their properties were assessed in this study the biopolymer incorporation improved the hydrophilicity as it reduced the contact angle from 86 to 65 and in turn improved the water flux from 51 l m2h to 93 l m2h the outcome infers that gum arabic ga is a good hydrophilicity enhancer and fouling mitigator as it decreased the fouling ratio by 18 and can thus act as a green alternative for membrane improvement the ftir spectroscopy revealed wavenumbers conforming to c cl oh and ch2 which indicated the different components of the films the outcome of tga also confirmed that the waste material used is polyvinyl chloride pvc as three degradation stages were observed with an improved t onset of 30 c due to ga incorporation porosity was enhanced to around 35 although suppressed porosity 10 and pore radius were observed at higher loading a substantial amount of natural organic matter ha was removed in water and an improved flux recovery ratio 80 was noted in short this investigation showed that ga is a promising substance that can be utilized for improving waste plastic based ultrafiltration membranes with enhanced parameters for the

13808,the utilization of waste polyvinyl chloride pvc as a membrane substrate and its hydrophilicity enhancement by incorporation of a sustainable biopolymer gum arabic ga for natural organic matter nom removal in water was studied in this research phase transformation method was used for membrane preparation by varying the percentage of ga interactions between waste pvc and ga at different loadings 1 5 wt were analyzed using various analytical techniques for morphology and evaluation studies field emission scanning electron microscopy thermogravimetric analysis fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy equilibrium water content contact angle porosity water flux and compaction factor were assessed furthermore the assessment of nom removal from water was also studied it was found that blending of waste pvc with ga enhanced its hydrophilicity by 25 improved its water permeation from 51 to 98 l m2h with a flux recovery ratio of around 80 and a rejection of around 96 the onset degradation temperature was also improved by 30 c and the mechanical strength was enhanced by 1 2 mpa the present study depicts the outcome of the incorporation of ga as a green alternative additive for enhancing the performance of waste pvc based membranes in water treatment applications keywords waste polyvinyl chloride gum arabic hydrophilicity natural organic matter biopolymer membrane 1 introduction surface water is assiduously contaminated by natural organic matter nom from various sources like the chemical microbiological anthropogenic and phytochemical transformation of flora and fauna 1 2 nom are those complex heterogeneous organic substances resulting from terrestrial and marine origins that affect the quality purity appearance and other physicochemical parameters of water 2 3 these problems are generally compounded when the water source is purified by a conventional method during chlorination for drinking water treatment the complex substances can react and produce health threatening compounds like trihalomethanes thms 4 5 humic acid ha is a category of nom which exists in surface and river water the presence of ha in water can result in bad odor color alteration absorption of metals and an increase in turbidity and microbial activities 1 6 therefore ha has to be removed to produce safe water for public utility coagulation is one of the traditional methods of nom removal but coagulants have to be purchased repeatedly to sustain the process 5 moreover ha may combine with coagulants to hinder the overall process and generate sludge that requires additional removal 4 7 adsorption is another established technique that can remove nom from water however the adsorbent is required to be regenerated and separated from the water system every time 4 similarly ion exchange is another viable method for the removal of nom nevertheless this requires resin and resin revival the handling of which involves additional operational and disposal costs 8 likewise during chlorination the phenolic hydroxyl moiety of the ha may react with the disinfectant chlorine and produce trihalomethanes 1 3 membrane filtration has proven to be an efficient process for nom removal to make water usable 9 however the major challenge of this separation process is its high cost and membrane fouling 3 8 10 this article is focused on the preparation of low cost hydrophilic membranes to address the above discussed challenges the application of the prepared membrane was confirmed by applying it for nom removal from synthetic wastewater waste plastic was used to reduce membrane cost and to protect the environment as well the pressure poised by waste plastic on the environment is enormous suitable discarding of post consumer plastic is a challenge 11 to manage this challenge many waste management and treatment approaches like burying combustion and incineration have been established but which are unfavorable to ecological progressions due to the release of poisonous gases leading to contamination of air and water bodies 12 13 hence waste plastic reprocessing and reuse are consequently considered the best environmental methods of getting rid of waste plastic 14 accordingly scholars across the world are continuously exploring the potentials of reprocessing waste plastic as a substance for the fabrication of membrane 13 14 waste recycling is a primary aim of the world program of global sustainability because of its combined benefits of economic and environmental conservation 12 polyvinyl chloride pvc is the second largest thermoplastic manufactured in the world in terms of quantity after polyethylene 11 13 this could be linked to its collective physical chemical and enduring properties which make it a versatile polymer having various applications 15 10 its multipurpose applications lead to the generation of a high quantity of waste pvc with disposal and management problems however pvc can dissolve in various organic solvents and it has a film forming ability these characteristics of pvc has rendered it suitable to be used as a membrane precursor 13 16 the virgin version of pvc has been established as membrane material by researchers with a drawback of hydrophobicity 15 17 19 hydrophobic surfaces are susceptible to fouling which can be controlled by incorporating hydrophilic additives 20 membrane fouling results in higher operating pressure hinders the membrane permeability selectivity reduces its lifecycle affects its productivity induces frequent washing and deteriorates its permeate quality 1 3 21 22 this can be managed by the incorporation of suitable additive to improve membrane hydrophilicity 13 23 researchers have published that films with hydrophilic characteristics are more resistant to fouling by organic materials and microbes owing to the dealings among the organic materials and the film interface 17 21 24 thus integrating hydrophilic additives in membrane fabrication to enhance its hydrophilicity and fouling mitigation by incorporating enhancers has been of great interest polymers like polyethylene glycol 25 26 polyethylene glycol methyl ether 27 and polyvinylpyrrolidone 18 28 19 have been used as traditional additives nevertheless the problem of membrane fouling continues to hinder the operation of membranes during water treatment and its inhibition remains a focus of study 22 29 recently biopolymers have been gaining attention as membrane modifiers due to their hydrophilic moieties environmental friendliness sustainability and other inherent properties padil et al 30 used gum karayana and its consequential effects on the properties and characterization of electrospun polyvinyl alcohol membranes asim et al 31 investigated the role of acacia exudate conjugated cellulose nanocrystals for their antibacterial and chlorine resistance effect on polyvinyl alcohol membranes kumar et al 1 used xanthan gum to improve the properties of polyethersulfone membranes for the effective separation of humic acid sabri et al 32 studied the antibacterial effects of arabic gum in the polysulfone membranes many amphiphilic polymers like tween 33 and pluronic 34 35 have been used for the enhancement of hydrophilicity amphiphilic polymers have a propensity to isolate the film surface with hydrophilic parts while the hydrophobic fragments firmly attaches to the membrane matrix 34 36 gum arabic ga was used for membrane modification to improve its antibacterial ability 31 32 ga contains oh groups which has the potential to enhance hydrophilicity 21 however enhancement of hydrophilicity fouling mitigation and removal of nom in water is scant for the ga modified membrane contrary to the use of expensive polymers this work explores the use of waste pvc as a membrane precursor that addresses the environmental problem and the economy of the membrane process as well the novelty of this work was also enhanced by increasing the hydrophilicity of the prepared waste plastic based membranes by using gum arabic ga as a biopolymer therefore the objectives of the study are to utilize an environmental pollutant waste plastic i e waste pvc to tackle another environmental issue water treatment by fabrication of membrane using waste pvc and improving its hydrophilicity through the incorporation of gum arabic ga which is a sustainable biopolymer as a green alternative waste pvc was chosen as an alternate source of membrane precursor in this study because of its dual benefits of reduction in membrane cost as well as reduction of adverse effects on the environment thus waste pvc incorporated ga based membranes were made up through the non solvent stimulated phase transformation process the interactions between the waste pvc ga at different loadings were analyzed using various analytical techniques and subsequently it was used for natural organic matter humic acid removal from water the outcome delivered environmental benefits conforming to the circular sustainability policy 2 experimental 2 1 materials the main polymer utilized in the dope solution was waste polyvinyl chloride which was collected from the premises of iit guwahati india the waste pvc pipes were thoroughly washed to remove any adhered impurities and then cut into smaller sizes for easy dissolution in the solvents gum arabic which was incorporated as a green additive was supplied by sigma aldrich india the solvent n methyl pyrrolidone nmp reagent grade purity was also supplied by sigma aldrich india deionized di water was obtained from the millipore system and was used as the non solvent in the coagulation bath humic acid ha was obtained from otto chemie private limited india 2 2 membrane preparation the preparation of membranes was done by the most common phase inversion method induced by di water as the non solvent various membranes with dissimilar compositions as depicted in table 1 were fabricated by dissolving the materials in nmp in borosilicate glass followed by overnight heating in a mantle at 60 5 c at an agitation speed of 500 rpm the solution was later degassed by keeping in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 25 c after 5 min of sonication the sonication was performed at 300 w with a frequency of 40 khz lastly the solution was casted on a glass tray with a thickness of about 190 200 Î¼m and then dipped in a 4 l water bath at 25 c for the phase inversion transformation to take place after the phase inversion process the membranes were immersed in di water for 24 h for stabilization before its characterization and performance evaluation 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 morphological study the surface morphology of all the prepared films was studied via field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem sigma 300 zeiss usa preceding the scanning the membranes were dried in a hot air oven 40 c for 24 h and then were fixed to the stub with double faced carbon tape and glazed with gold 26 the morphologies of the samples were scanned and images of each of the membranes surfaces were observed 2 3 2 permeation study an amicon millipore cell filtration cell having a volume of 300 ml was used to assess the pure water flux pwf and compaction factor cf the membranes were fitted into the module by cutting them into circular forms with an effective membrane area of 38 10 4 m2 the cell was loaded with di water and pressurized by an inert gas the cf was calculated based on the first and the last steady water flux ratio 36 while the flux was estimated based on eq 1 1 j w v a t where jw was the flux l m2h v was the amount of permeate l a was the membrane area m2 and t was the period for permeation in hour h 2 3 3 equilibrium water content ewc study the ewc specifies the extent of porosity and water affinity of a membrane 36 it is also interrelated to the absorptivity of a membrane the prepared films were sized into a 1 cm2 piece to create a uniform shape for the analysis the membranes were saturated in di water for 24 h and then mobbed with tissue paper and their weights wet weight were noted afterwards they were retained in a vacuum oven for a day 24 h at 60 c and their weights dry weight were again recorded based on the recorded weights the ewc was estimated based on eq 2 2 w a t e r c o n t e n t w w w d w w 100 where ww and wd represented the wet weight and dry weight of the membrane respectively 2 3 4 hydrophilicity study to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membrane samples the static water contact angle was measured the contact angle was inspected by a goniometer dsa 25 kruss india 13 the films were stored for 1 h in a hot air oven at 40 c the membranes were then cut and placed on the equipment afterwards di water was released by a syringe in the form of drops 2 0 Î¼l on the surface of the membrane samples the drops were made in triplicate positions and the static water angle was calculated based on the average values 25 2 3 5 porosity and pore size studies membrane sponginess is an important parameter that dictates the permeation of the membranes while the pore size determines the selectivity retention capability of the membranes thus the porosity was estimated based on eq 3 3 p o r o s i t y Îµ w w w d Ï a Î´ 100 where a was the membrane area m2 Ï kg m3 was the density of water at standard temperature and pressure stp Î´ was the thickness of the membrane m and ww and wd were the wet weight and the dry weight of the membrane kg respectively the average pore size of the membranes was computed based on the porosity values and water filtration values generally the pore radius rm is considered to be an approximation of the exact pore dimension of a membrane 9 regular pore range can be estimated via the guerout elford ferry equation eq 4 15 37 4 r m 2 9 1 75 Îµ 8 Î¼ Î´ q Îµ a Î´ p where Î¼ was the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 in pa s and q was the water flow and Î´p was the operational pressure 2 3 6 rejection study one of the known natural organic substance contaminants in the surface water is humic acid ha hence for the determination of the applicability of the fabricated membranes ha rejection studies were carried out by using a 100 mg l ha feed solution the filtration set up that was used for the permeability study was also used in this study the removal level of ha was estimated by analyzing the feed and permeate concentration using an ultra violet uv visible spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa at a wavelength of 254 nm and the rejections were computed using eq 5 38 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where r was the percentage retention cp was the concentration of the permeate and cf was the feed concentration respectively 2 3 7 flux recovery and fouling ratio studies the flux recovery and other related ratios were investigated using ha as the model solute initially the pure water flux pwf fw1 was noted thereafter the ha with a feed concentration of 100 mg l was permeated for 90 min and the permeate flux fha was recorded the membranes were washed by immersing in di water and ultrasonicated in the water bath for 20 min and then backwashed afterwards the pwf fw2 was again noted finally the fouling behavior was examined based on the following equations eqs 6 9 13 6 t f r f w 1 f h a f w 1 7 r f r f w 2 f h a f w 1 8 i f r f w 1 f w 2 f w 1 9 f r r f w 2 f w 1 where tfr was the total fouling ratio rfr was the reversible fouling ratio ifr was the irreversible fouling ratio and frr was the flux recovery ratio 2 3 8 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopic study the ftir analysis of the membranes was done using a perkin elmer spectrophotometer frontier perkin elmer usa prior to the investigation the samples were oven dried at 50 c for 1 h subsequently they were examined via the atr transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 3500 700 cm 1 and their ftir spectrum was recorded 2 3 9 thermal studies the effect of additive on the thermal behavior of the films was studied by thermogravimetric analysis tga tga 4000 perkin elmer usa the system was set in the range of 30 600 c at a heating rate of 10 c min to maintain an inert environment nitrogen gas flow at the rate of 20 ml min was sustained at a pressure of about 1 7 bars 2 3 10 mechanical studies the mechanical test can predict the durability and pressure capability of a membrane an electromechanical universal testing machine utm z005tn zwick rowell usa with a motorized screw mechanism was used for this purpose the membranes were cut into pre determined dimensions of 5 mm by 100 mm using a special cutter with a calibrated cutting mat the samples were clutched between the upper and the lower arm of the utm with a 50 mm gauge the test was done by applying a 1 k n pressure at 2 mm min the tensile strength and percentage elongation were recorded in triplicates and their average values were reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological study the surface and the cross section fesem images of the membranes are displayed in fig 1 it was observed that the ga incorporated membranes had better pore formation than the unincorporated one mg0 this could be ascribed to the hydrophilic moieties of the polysaccharides that influence the phase inversion process the sponginess and pore dimensions tend to be suppressed when the loading of ga was improved in the dope solution from 3 to 5 percent it could be seen that the surface of mg0 was smooth while the porosity was enhanced by the increment of ga from 1 wt and 3 wt nevertheless the porosity was repressed when the concentration of ga was amplified to 5 wt the macro void formation was noticeable at 3 wt loading of the ga the task of the biopolymer ga in the development of the membrane porosity is clearly like other macromolecular additives that are identified to influence the subtle stability of thermodynamics and kinetics in a dope solution 39 28 subsequently a permeable film structure with a finely spongy skin layer was obtained similar morphology was reported when other biopolymers were added as pore formers by other researchers 1 39 3 2 ftir study the ftir atr spectra of the prepared films mg0 mg1 mg3 and mg5 are depicted in fig 2 the spectrum of the ga powder and the waste pvc ga blended membranes were generated via an upper and lower wavenumber gap of 3500 to 650 cm 1 the lower region of the wavenumber is credited to the unique fingerprint of the materials thus the wavenumber at 864 cm 1 might be credited to the presence of c cl due to the waste pvc layer which existed in both the incorporated and non ga incorporated waste pvc membranes the wavenumber at 1013 cm 1 which implied the presence of ch band was observed representing the presence of polysaccharides the characteristic band of cc stretch for both the aliphatic and aromatic galactoproteins of ga was seen at around 1602 cm 1 40 and its corresponding appearance was also noted in the blend this might be due to the synergistic interaction between the waste pvc and the biopolymer ga the band at 2916 cm 1 indicated c h stretching vibrations the characteristic band in the wavenumber section of 3000 3500 cm 1 for the amino group was concealed by the wide absorption peak at 3234 cm 1 for oh group 30 41 this could be one of the reasons for the hydrophilicity enhancement within the membrane 3 3 thermal studies the heat stability of the membranes was analyzed using tga the result is displayed in fig 3 all the samples showed three degradation stages which confirmed that the waste material utilized was pvc pvc normally has 3 levels of degradation 17 the first stage represents dehydrochlorination and the other two are chain elimination and decomposition char formation these segments have been appropriately demarcated in the thermogram fig 3 the onset degradation temperature for the unmodified waste pvc based membranes mg0 was seen at 230 c whereas the films incorporated with different concentrations of ga showed an improved onset decomposition temperature of around 260 c this rise in temperature could be attributed to the addition of ga as it is known that the onset degradation temperature for polysaccharide gums is about 260 c 41 this signified that ga incorporated membranes had satisfactory heat stability hence they could also be applied in hot streams apart from the water filtration units 3 4 mechanical studies the mechanical test helps in predicting the durability and pressure capability of the membranes an electromechanical universal testing machine utm with a motorized screw mechanism was employed to determine the tensile strength and percentage elongation of the membranes the outcomes are revealed in fig 4 the incorporation of ga into the membrane solution affected the mechanical properties of the samples the membrane mg0 which was prepared without the addition of ga had about 3 mpa tensile strength incorporation of ga improved its tensile strength to 3 6 mpa at 1 wt and 3 4 mpa at 3 wt loading the slight decrease of the mechanical strength and elongation for the mg3 membrane could be ascribed to the enhanced porosity of the membrane similar behavior was reported in another study where the membrane with loose porous structure displayed lower mechanical properties 42 at 5 wt loading of ga into the solution the membrane demonstrated the highest tensile strength of 4 2 mpa this phenomenon could be attributed to its suppressed porous nature at higher loading as explained in section 3 1 suppressed micro voids tend to increase tensile strength 37 likewise the elongation also enhanced as the ga concentration was amplified from 0 wt to 5 wt within the waste pvc casting solution the elongation of around 23 8 was recorded for the mg5 membrane as against 14 2 for the mg0 membrane this improvement could be attributed to its plasticizing effect and the amphiphilic moieties of the gum arabic interacting with the hydrophobic backbone of waste pvc a similar scenario was reported in another study 43 nevertheless the mg3 membrane showed a low percent elongation of 17 compared to the mg1 membrane this was due to the formation of micro voids and its corresponding relatively highest porosity of 67 as elucidated in the subsequent section however mg5 had a higher voidage and better mechanical strength than mg1 this was because of the fact that it had a higher percentage of ga which created a plasticizing effect resulting in improved mechanical strength therefore the incorporation of ga not only improved the permeation parameters but also the mechanical characteristics which could be beneficial for the mechanical and pressure durability of the membranes in real life applications 3 5 ewc study percentage of water content is one of the important parameters that is closely linked with pure water flux and porosity in membrane characterization it is also termed as equilibrium water content ewc 13 the results of the ewc is presented in fig 5 the percentage of water content increased from 60 to 73 when ga incorporation increased from 0 wt to 5 wt increasing the ga percentage in the casting solution enhanced the ewc significantly this was credited to the hydrophilic amphiphilic characteristics of ga however ewc is closely linked with membrane porosity which by extension relates to pure water flux again pure water flux is mutually related to surface hydrophilicity 36 the improved hydrophilicity was also evident from the contact angle and porosity results as discussed in the subsequent section this outcome also agreed with the results of pure water flux and porosity as described in subsequent sections 3 6 hydrophilicity study contact angle measurement is an analytical technique for determining the hydrophilicity of membranes 20 the ewc and the water contact angle is shown in fig 5 the figure illustrated that the hydrophilicity of the samples was boosted by the incorporation of ga into the membranes due to its affinity with water the mg0 membrane showed the highest static water contact angle swca of 86 2 1 7 signifying the least hydrophilicity owing to the hydrophobic behavior of the base polymer incorporation of ga reduced the swca to 77 7 1 9 mg1 70 4 1 6 mg3 and 65 1 1 4 mg5 respectively this translated to a reduction in contact angle thereby indicating improved hydrophilicity 27 the reason behind the drop might be ascribed to the polysaccharides fragments of ga which hydrophilized the membrane surface 43 thus the hydrophobic polypeptide chain could link to the hydrophobic backbone of the waste pvc exposing the hydrophilic polysaccharide moieties to the surface so enhancing the hydrophilicity of the membranes fig 6 34 this outcome was supported by the data of ewc and pure water flux improvement of hydrophilicity would enhance the membrane characteristics especially in water flux and fouling mitigation 3 7 porosity and pore size studies porosity and pore size are significant factors in determining membrane performance 25 the membrane sponginess and pore radius are presented in table 2 the porosity showed an increasing trend from 43 1 1 1 mg0 to 66 6 1 3 mg3 as the fraction of ga augmented from 0 to 3 wt this rise in sponginess might be credited to the hydrophilic moieties of ga this outcome was also in agreement with the results of ewc as discussed in the previous section as the pores inclined to accommodate the water molecules nevertheless when the concentration of ga incorporation was amplified to 5 wt the porosity dropped by 7 mg5 this could be clarified based on the fact that an intensification in viscosity of dope solutions reduces the de mixing progression and as a consequence a membrane with lesser penetrability could be made 28 similarly the pore radius improved as ga was supplemented in the waste plastic dope solution about 33 pore size variation was noted the pore radius decreased by around 10 when 5 wt of ga was introduced this happened because increasing the polymer concentration wt while keeping the solvent constant leads to an increase in solution viscosity hence delayed de mixing happens and suppressed void formation is obtained due to thermodynamic instability this phenomenon has been explained by other researchers also 26 44 the membrane pore size varied between 22 1 3 3 1 6 nm which falls within the range of 2 100 nm and so the membranes could be classified as ultrafiltration membranes 3 8 permeation study the permeation abilities of the films were determined by using eq 1 and the outcome is presented in table 2 the advantage of the integration of ga into the membrane matrix was evident from the outcomes of pwf the flux increased from 51 l m2h to 93 l m2h as the percentage of ga was augmented up to 3 wt this could be ascribed to the hydrophilicity and porosity enhancement by the biopolymer ga as explained in the previous sections a similar outcome was reported by others on integrating xanthan gum into polyethersulfone membranes 1 however flux decrease was noted when ga loading was increased further this was expected as 5 wt loading showed a slight reduction in sponginess and skewed pore size due to the increase in viscosity of dope solution rising the polymer concentration wt leads to an increase in solution viscosity which reduces the de mixing progression mg3 had the highest pure water flux due to greater surface pore size and porosity apart from the membrane surface hydrophilicity porosity and pore radius are the important factors influencing membrane permeation 39 the membrane compaction was evaluated using the initial and the final stable pwf the influence of compaction on the membrane s flux is represented in fig 7 all the membranes showed some decline in flux at the initial onset and reached flux stability at around one hour of pure water permeation because of compaction c f this was due to the suppression and reorientation of the pores because of the applied transmembrane pressure 36 the membranes prepared from both the components displayed a similar compaction rate 3 9 rejection study the samples mg0 mg1 mg3 and mg5 were applied for the rejection of humic acid and the outcome is presented in fig 8 the mg0 membrane had a rejection of around 81 whereas the incorporation of ga increased the ha rejection by up to 96 a similar improvement was also noted in the water flux although during the permeation of ha a decline of flux was noted due to fouling the effect was studied in the subsequent section the molecular weight of ha is up to 500 kda hence the membrane with the pore size range of 22 33 nm would be able to reject the molecules based on the size exclusion mechanism even though size exclusion is not the only mechanism in this process the carboxyl group of ga has a negative charge 43 and ha contains acidic functional groups 31 deprotonation would cause the molecule to exhibit negative surface charges generating charge repulsion 45 hence under this condition electrostatic repulsion of ha molecules between the surface and the solute might increase the rate of rejection of the natural organic matter thus mg5 had the highest rejection 96 owing to its pore dimensions porosity and surface chemistry because of ga incorporation while mg0 with no ga had the least rejection this indicated that the biopolymer ga is an effective additive for ha mitigation and hydrophilicity enhancement in the waste pvc based membrane for the removal of nom in water 3 10 flux recovery and fouling ratio study the pure water flux fw1 flux during filtration of ha fha solution and the second cycle of pure water flux fw2 after ha filtration are shown in fig 9 the pure water flux of 51 l m2h mg0 85 l m2h mg1 98 l m2h mg3 and 93 l m2h mg5 were observed the flux during permeation of ha were 11 l m2h mg0 23 l m2h mg1 31 l m2h mg3 and 32 l m2h mg5 respectively the decline in the flux was noted due to membrane fouling during the permeation of the ha solution thereafter the membrane was cleaned using di water as described in section 2 3 7 and the second cycle of pure water permeation was carried out with the following flux of 31 l m2h mg0 62 l m2h mg1 76 l m2h mg3 and 74 l m2h mg5 these variations in flux were used to study the fouling and flux recovery ratios of the membranes the fouling properties of the membranes were estimated by the different fouling ratios and the flux recovery ratio frr the total fouling ratio tfr is the summation of the reversible fouling ratio rfr and the irreversible fouling ratio ifr 36 these parameters were calculated based on the permeation of the ha fha and the corresponding pure water fluxes fw1 and fw2 the outcomes of the ratios are shown in fig 10 the tfr of mg0 was 79 indicating a substantial decrease in flux the tfr decreased to 73 with the incorporation of 1 wt ga into the waste pvc dope solution subsequently 68 and 66 tfr were recorded for mg3 and mg5 respectively the total fouling ratio is an index of membrane flux loss the reduction of tfr from 73 to 66 showed an improvement in the antifouling effect of the membranes hence the lesser the tfr the better the membrane another beneficial aspect was the pattern observed for the rfr and the ifr the rfr increased from 40 to 46 while the ifr decreased from 40 to 20 as the loading of ga increased from 0 wt to 5 wt respectively this meant that the blended membranes could easily be washed to reverse their flux the flux recovery rate frr is an indicator of membrane durability and the rate of recovery after hydraulic cleaning 9 the frr of the membranes improved significantly as the ga wt was increased the frr of 60 mg0 73 mg1 77 mg3 and 80 mg5 were observed this showed an enhancement of about 32 frr at 5 wt ga loading this was credited to the hydrophilic behavior of the additive which inhibited the hydrophobic moieties of the waste pvc it also agreed with the outcomes of the contact angle as explained in section 3 6 higher frr signifies better antifouling property 38 this indicated that the incorporation of the biopolymer ga into the backbone of the waste pvc improved the antifouling behavior of the prepared membrane 3 11 performance comparison with existing work the performance of the prepared membranes was compared with some articles that reported the removal of humic acid the compared parameters are presented in table 3 it can be envisaged that the result of the current work relates well with the reported works 10 46 membrane permeability and selectivity are two outstanding membrane parameters that determine performance 21 hence the flux 98 l m2h and rejection 96 in this work compared positively with the other cited reports 47 48 thus this indicates that the incorporation of a biopolymer ga into the waste pvc enhances the parameters and performance judiciously furthermore most of the cited literature has a similar range in weight concentration 15 of base polymer for membrane fabrication although the material used for the fabrication in this work is not pristine this has shown that the precursor is of low cost compared to the existing literature as no cost was expended on the base polymer signifying economic and environmental benefits thereby conforming to the circular sustainability policy of the world 4 conclusion waste plastic incorporated gum arabic base membranes were fabricated and their properties were assessed in this study the biopolymer incorporation improved the hydrophilicity as it reduced the contact angle from 86 to 65 and in turn improved the water flux from 51 l m2h to 93 l m2h the outcome infers that gum arabic ga is a good hydrophilicity enhancer and fouling mitigator as it decreased the fouling ratio by 18 and can thus act as a green alternative for membrane improvement the ftir spectroscopy revealed wavenumbers conforming to c cl oh and ch2 which indicated the different components of the films the outcome of tga also confirmed that the waste material used is polyvinyl chloride pvc as three degradation stages were observed with an improved t onset of 30 c due to ga incorporation porosity was enhanced to around 35 although suppressed porosity 10 and pore radius were observed at higher loading a substantial amount of natural organic matter ha was removed in water and an improved flux recovery ratio 80 was noted in short this investigation showed that ga is a promising substance that can be utilized for improving waste plastic based ultrafiltration membranes with enhanced parameters for the

potential of algal bacterial symbiosis for biogas purification has been already studied and demonstrated in open photobioreactors however few studies have focused on the implementation of this process in closed photobioreactors which offer higher photosynthetic efficiencies enhanced biomass productivities a limited n2 contamination and improved co2 mass transfer in this study the influence of alkalinity inorganic carbon concentrations from 200 to 1700 mg l 1 and nitrogen n deprivation strategies 24 or 48 h limitation on both biomethane quality and biomass composition has been evaluated and optimized in a closed tubular photobioreactor tpbr interconnected to a mixing chamber and a biogas absorption column total working volume of 132 l the increase in the alkalinity of the cultivation broth mediated an increase in the upgrading performance of the tpbr reaching co2 removals of 96 3 0 8 and a complete h2s abatement resulting in an enhanced biomethane composition ch4 97 2 0 9 moreover process operation under n deprivation did not affect the quality of biomethane which complied with standards required for injection into natural gas grids or use as vehicle fuel n deprivation promoted the continuous storage of intracellular carbohydrates 29 0 4 4 compared with 14 3 2 1 obtained under n excess a maximum biomass productivity obtained was of 15 8 4 3 g m 2 d 1 during n excess vs 11 2 3 3 g m 2 d 1 during n deprivation at 26 8 d of hydraulic retention time during the n feast famine cycles the cyanobacterial species pseudanabaena sp was dominant over green algae keywords alkalinity biogas upgrading biomethane carbohydrates production closed photobioreactor 1 introduction biogas is obtained from the anaerobic digestion of organic feedstock and can be used as an energy vector to produce electricity and heat in industrial and domestic applications thus contributing to the reduction of the world dependence on fossil fuels 1 in this context the global installed biogas capacity reached 17 7 gw in 2018 of which 12 3 gw corresponded to europe 2 nevertheless a preliminary purification stage is strongly recommended prior energy use of this renewable energy source since raw biogas contains not only methane ch4 40 75 but also other gas pollutants such as carbon dioxide co2 15 60 hydrogen sulfide h2s 0 005 3 nitrogen n2 0 2 oxygen o2 0 1 siloxanes 0 0 02 volatile organic compounds voc 0 6 ammonia nh3 1 or carbon monoxide co 0 6 3 in this sense the removal of co2 and h2s is typically performed in order to increase the calorific value of biogas and to reduce transportation costs besides minimizing toxicity and preventing corrosion in piping or compressors 4 moreover if the upgraded biogas is intended to be injected into the natural gas grid or to be used as a vehicle fuel a more stricter purification is required in order to fulfill with international biomethane standards typically ch4 90 95 co2 2 4 o2 1 and negligible amounts of h2s 3 5 in this context physical chemical biogas upgrading technologies have been developed and commercialized at industrial scale water scrubbing and membrane separation being nowadays the market leading technologies worldwide despite their high energy consumption operating costs and environmental impacts 6 7 photosynthetic biogas upgrading in algal bacterial photobioreactors has been consistently proven as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for the simultaneous removal of co2 and h2s from raw biogas in a single stage process this technology is based on the fixation of co2 by microalgae via photosynthesis and the concomitant release of oxygen to the cultivation broth which is subsequently used by sulfur oxidizing bacteria for the oxidation of h2s to so4 2 both gases are transferred from the raw biogas to the cultivation broth in an absorption column ac interconnected to the photobioreactor 5 8 several authors have evidenced the efficiency of this technology indoors and outdoors at both laboratory and pilot scale and the most relevant operating parameters of this technology have been optimized in order to maximize the quality of the final biomethane 9 11 for instance rodero et al 12 demonstrated the key role of the alkalinity of the cultivation broth to ensure a satisfactory biomethane quality 98 of ch4 at inorganic carbon concentrations ic 1500 mg l 1 similarly the influence of gas liquid flow ratio l g and configuration in the ac has been thoroughly assessed with optimum values of 0 5 under co current operation 13 nevertheless the economic viability of the energy valorization of biogas is often limited by the high costs of combined heat and power production gas engines and the current reductions of fiscal incentives 14 similarly the costly purification required for injection of the upgraded biomethane into natural gas grids or use as vehicle fuel renders it uncompetitive compared with natural gas in this context photosynthetic biogas upgrading offers not only a low cost alternative for biogas upgrading but also the possibility to further valorize the algal biomass generated when implemented in closed tubular photobioreactors tpbr thus increasing the economic sustainability of the technology under nutrient deprivation conditions microalgae and cyanobacteria can accumulate intracellular energy reserves such as biopolymers carbohydrates starch in microalgae and glycogen in cyanobacteria lipids proteins or pigments among others 15 17 unfortunately the potential of biogas upgrading has been mainly investigated and demonstrated in open photobioreactors such as high rate algal ponds hraps due to their simple design construction operation easy scale up and lower investment cost 18 in contrast this configuration offers a lower biomass productivity as a result of the reduced light photosynthetic efficiency compared to closed photobioreactors 19 20 therefore photosynthetic biogas upgrading combined with algal biomass valorization in closed photobioreactors constitutes a promising cost efficient and sustainable alternative that integrates a reduction in the costs of biogas upgrading within a model of circular economy however there is a lack of studies devoted to assess and optimize the long term performance of this technology in this study the biogas upgrading performance of a tpbr interconnected to an external ac was evaluated for 395 days systematically assessing the influence of the alkalinity of the cultivation broth on the biomethane quality moreover the effect of nitrogen n deprivation cycles on biogas upgrading and on the chemical composition of the algal biomass were determined in order to validate biomass valorization 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum

purchased from cofarcas s a burgos spain at a concentration that varied depending on the operational stage 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of a tpbr interconnected to a mixing chamber and an ac with a total working volume of 132 l fig 1 the tpbr was composed of 12 tubes of 6 cm of inner diameter and 94 cm of length with a total volume of 45 6 l an illuminated area of 2 2 m2 and a total footprint of 0 3 m2 two sets of high intensity led pcbs were placed at both sides of the tpbr to provide a photosynthetic active radiation par of 883 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 using 12 12 h light dark periods the mixing chamber 50 cm height 48 cm width and 35 cm length had a working volume of 84 l and the ac 2 m height with an internal diameter of 4 5 cm was operated with 1 73 m of water column and a working volume of 2 6 l the cultivation broth was recirculated using a centrifugal pump dwo e 300 ebara italy at a linear velocity of 0 5 m s 1 through the tpbr and the mixing chamber flue gas or biogas was supplied to the ac through a stainless steel diffuser of 2 Î¼m pore size located at the bottom of the column co currently with the cultivation broth from the mixing chamber 2 3 operational procedure 2 3 1 influence of ic concentration on photosynthetic biogas upgrading the system was inoculated with the microalgae bacteria consortium at a volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 1 6 g l 1 and initially operated in continuous mode for 39 days for inoculum acclimation during this initial period 3 1 l of the cultivation broth were daily exchanged with fresh mineral salt medium until reaching a steady biomass productivity of 13 0 0 6 g m 2 d 1 calculated according to footprint 19 neither flue gas nor biogas were supplemented to the ac during the acclimation period afterwards the system was operated for 395 days at a cultivation broth exchange rate of 5 l d 1 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 26 8 d during stage 0 synthetic flue gas co2 30 and n2 70 v v abellÃ³ linde spain was used as carbon source for the growth of microalgae from days 0 14 synthetic flue gas was fed at 10 ml min 1 subsequently increasing the flow rate to 20 ml min 1 for 53 days from day 67 onwards a synthetic biogas mixture ch4 70 co2 29 5 and h2s 0 5 v v abellÃ³ linde spain was fed at 20 ml min 1 corresponding to a l g ratio of 0 5 in order to test the influence of cultivation broth alkalinity on biomethane quality the ic concentration was increased from 218 8 5 1 429 5 47 6 and 1707 3 52 8 mg l 1 by addition of nahco3 and na2co3 in stages i ii and iii respectively table 1 during stages iv to vi the ic concentration was maintained constant at 1347 9 54 4 mg l 1 2 3 2 influence of the cyclic n deprivation on biomass composition during stages 0 i ii and iii 529 5 mg n d 1 corresponding to 1 g nh4 2so4 l 1 were added with the fresh mineral medium in order to maintain a total nitrogen tn concentration of 87 2 11 9 mg l 1 in the cultivation broth by day 191 stage iv fresh mineral medium without n was supplemented in order to decrease the tn concentration to 6 mg l 1 by day 216 starting afterwards the n feast famine cycles during stages iv and v 24 and 48 hs feast famine cycles were implemented respectively consisting of the exchange of n supplemented medium by day 1 of the cycle n free medium by day 2 and no medium exchange by day 3 in stage v n concentration in the n supplemented mineral medium was adjusted to provide 324 mg n d 1 during the feast periods 0 6 g nh4 2so4 l 1 to ensure a biomass productivity of 13 g m 2 d 1 finally by day 283 stage vi n supplementation was restored and 529 5 mg n d 1 were added with the fresh mineral medium to reach a tn concentration of 81 8 4 5 mg l 1 in the cultivation

13 7 ml min 1 2 4 2 chemical biomass composition characterization quantitative determination of the carbohydrates was carried out by adapting the phenol sulfuric acid method 21 aliquots of 1 5 ml of

result by a factor 5 95 glass tubes containing 100 mg samples of dry biomass 25 ml of distilled water kjeldahl catalyst cu 0 3 in cuso4 5h2o and 6 ml of h2so4 97 purity were placed in a ktn digestion

the relation of the volume of h2so4 required to neutralize and the dry weight of algal biomass 22 aliquots of 100 mg of biomass 100 mg al2o3 and 2 ml of a solution of chloroform in methanol 2 1 v v

performance stages i iii by day 34 after system inoculation co2 removal efficiencies res of 74 0 4 9 were recorded during flue gas feeding stage 0 at an inorganic carbon concentration in the cultivation broth of 217 1 29 3 mg l 1 when biogas was supplemented to the ac average co2 res increased from 77 7 3 9 85 4 3 3 and 96 3 0 8 at ic concentrations of 200 400 and 1700 mg l 1 in stages i ii and iii respectively fig 2 a during these stages almost a complete h2s removal h2s res 99 fig 2a was achieved due to the higher aqueous solubility of h2s compared to that of co2 according to henry s law constants at 20 c hh2s 2 13 and hco2 0 71 dimensionless 28 this removal was attributed to the activity of sulfide oxidizing bacteria using the oxygen from the photosynthetic activity as supported by the values of sulfate concentration recorded throughout the experimental period 890 0 5 7 mg so4 2 l 1 the ph of the cultivation broth remained at 8 9 0 2 9 2 0 2 and 9 3 0 1 during stages i ii and iii respectively the positive effect of alkalinity on the removal of both acidic gases has been widely demonstrated in hraps both at laboratory and pilot scales however a higher ph 9 4 is commonly required to achieve co2 res as high as those observed in this study while process operation at a ph 9 typically results in a lower abatement performance res 90 29 similarly rodero et al 12 observed co2 res of 50 6 3 0 when working at an ic concentration of 500 mg l 1 in the cultivation broth in an open photobioreactor considerably below the abatement performance of the closed system here studied moreover h2s res from 96 to 100 have been reported in open systems at 1500 mg l 1 however lower ic concentrations 500 mg l 1 only supported h2s res of 66 94 9 10 12 30 the high alkalinity of the cultivation broth promotes the mass transfer of the acidic gases co2 and h2s from the biogas to the liquid phase in the ac since the presence of carbonate bicarbonate increases the ph of the cultivation broth the average co2 content in the upgraded biogas was 6 2 1 8 4 6 1 1 and 1 1 0 2 during stages i ii and iii respectively while no h2s was detected in the biomethane during these operating stages fig 2b consequently an average ch4 concentration of 90 8 1 5 93 3 1 3 and 97 2 0 9 stages i ii and iii respectively was achieved on the other hand the average n2 concentration in the biomethane was 1 7 0 8 2 0 0 5 and 1 6 0 4 with an o2 content of 0 8 0 3 0 5 0 2 and 0 4 0 3 during stages i ii and iii respectively hence the optimum biomethane composition was recorded during stage iii working at 1700 mg l 1 which indeed complied with most international regulations for biogas injection into natural gas grids or use as autogas ch4 95 co2 2 5 4 h2s 5 mg nm 3 and o2 1 5 previous research on photosynthetic biogas upgrading in open photobioreactors has found n2 and o2 concentrations in the upgraded biogas ranging from 1 to 13 and from 0 7 to 7 respectively 9 31 32 thus in open systems the high photosynthetic activity results in high do concentrations and a subsequent increase in the o2 content in the biomethane 33 in contrast in our tpbr the limited stripping from the cultivation broth in the ac allowed achieving satisfactory o2 contents in the upgraded biogas in spite of the high photosynthetic activity and the concomitant high do levels stages i to iii do 17 mg l 1 3 1 2 biomass production stages i iii a high photosynthetic activity was recorded regardless of the operating stage with do concentrations in the cultivation broth ranging from 17 to 20 mg o2 l 1 it is important to stress that no inhibition of the microalgae growth associated to this elevated oxygen concentration was observed which has been reported as one of the possible drawbacks of closed photobioreactors do 30 mg o2 l 1 34 35 the low dilution rate set during stages i iii resulted in a low biomass productivity and vss concentration in the tpbr in stage i 10 8 2 0 g m 2 d 1 and 569 0 106 3 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 which slightly increased to 13 4 1 8 and 12 1 2 7 g m 2 d 1 during stages ii and iii respectively vss concentrations of 711 3 95 6 and 697 5 60 8 mg l 1 similar biomass concentrations have been recorded in open systems devoted to biogas upgrading 29 for instance rodero et al 12 reported biomass concentrations of 200 500 mg l 1 depending on the ic concentration in the cultivation broth of a hrap ranging from 100 to 1500 mg l 1 on the contrary biomass productivities from 5 up to 16 9 g m 2 d 1 have been obtained in hraps working at lower hrts compared to that of the present study hrt 4 7 4 vs 26 8 days 9 12 36 in this regard it is important to highlight that volumetric g l 1 d 1 instead of areal productivities g m 2 d 1 should be reported for closed photobioreactors to allow for a fair comparison between both configurations 19 37 thus volumetric productivities of 0 08 0 07 g l 1 d 1 were obtained in stages ii and iii at the high end of those commonly achieved in open systems ranging from 0 015 to 0 1 g l 1 d 1 38 finally n nh4 was completely oxidized into nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in stages i and ii table 1 indeed n no3 concentrations of 112 1 12 8 102 3 20 8 and 85 6 11 3 mg l 1 were recorded in stages i ii and iii respectively negligible n no2 concentrations of 2 9 3 9 mg n no2 l 1 were detected in the cultivation broth of the tpbr during stage iii 3 2 effect of cyclic n deprivation on the system performance stages iv to vi 3 2 1 biogas upgrading performance during stages iv to vi the ic concentration in the cultivation broth remained constant at 1300 mg l 1 while a slightly higher ph was recorded compared to that of n supplementation stages with average values of 9 8 0 1 9 6 0 1 and 9 4 0 1 in stages iv v and vi respectively this higher ph concomitant with the lower do concentrations present in the tpbr 11 2 3 5 14 0 5 3 and 11 3 4 4 mg l 1 in stages iv v and vi respectively was likely due to the absence of a significant nitrification during stages iv and v indeed nh4 nitrification is a biological process that decreases the ph of the cultivation broth as a result of proton release and ic consumption under these operational conditions no h2s was detected in the biomethane and co2 res of 97 3 0 5 97 0 0 8 and 94 5 0 8 were recorded in stages iv v and vi respectively the superior co2 removals observed during n deprivation were in agreement with the more alkaline ph required for an effective mass transfer of this contaminant from biogas into the cultivation broth in this context an enhanced upgraded biogas composition was obtained ch4 97 7 1 0 co2 1 0 0 4 h2s 0 0 0 0 o2 0 2 0 1 and n2 1 3 0 8 fig 2b 3 2 2 biomass production during the operation of the tpbr under n deprivation conditions a biomass productivity of 12 4 1 7 and 11 2 3 3 g m 2 d 1 was recorded in stages iv and v respectively corresponding to a vss concentration of 654 2 90 2 and 590 4 176 8 mg vss l 1 table 2 this decrease in biomass concentration was in accordance with the reduction in the n load to the photobioreactor on the other hand a recovery in the biomass productivity and vss concentration up to values of 15 8 4 3 g m 2 d 1 and 779 3 307 3 mg l 1 was observed when the nitrogen feed was restored stage vi 529 5 mg n d 1 nevertheless the photosynthetic performance of microalgae was not negatively affected as shown by the do concentration of the cultivation broth which was maintained within the optimal growth range 10 mg l 1 the ability of microalgae to accumulate energy storage compounds under different nutrient availability conditions can contribute to the economic viability of the photosynthetic upgrading process in this context a highly variable composition of proteins 40 60 lipids 5 20 carbohydrates 20 30 and ashes 5 15 can be obtained depending on the microalgae species 17 as expected the microalgae consortium of the tpbr exhibited a higher protein content under n excess compared to that observed under n limitation 33 37 dcw in stages iv and v vs 48 5 dcw in stage vi table 2 besides previous studies have demonstrated an enhanced nitrogen uptake associated with an increased protein production when increasing the inorganic carbon concentration available for microalgae growth 39 regarding lipids accumulation values of 10 4 1 5 and 9 7 3 1 dcw were obtained during n deprivation in stages iv and v respectively unexpectedly increasing to 17 0 1 2 dcw in the last operating stage when n was supplemented in excess the lipid yield here obtained was significantly low compared to the typical ranges of lipid content commonly found in microalgae from 20 up to 70 dcw and therefore not suitable for further valorization 17 40 similarly posadas et al 41 obtained a lipid content ranging from 2 9 11 2 dcw in microalgae grown in a hrap devoted to biogas upgrading in this context it is important to highlight that the ic contained in the cultivation broth is not only an essential parameter regulating photosynthesis and microalgae growth but it might also influence the biochemical composition of the biomass in this sense some authors have reported an increased carbohydrates or lipids accumulation depending on the microalgae strain when n deprivation occurs under excess of carbon source 39 42 43 in our particular study n deprivation mediated an increase in the accumulation of carbohydrates in the microalgae biomass achieving values up to 2 0 times higher 29 0 4 4 dcw in stage v than those obtained under regular nutritional conditions this might support alternative chemical or biological valorization strategies for this biomass therefore the synthesis of lipids typically reported under n limitation was here diverted to carbohydrates synthesis during co2 fixation in the calvin bassham benson cycle cbb the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate g3p produced through the cbb cycle can either be used for the synthesis of pyruvate via the glycolytic pathway which is the precursor for the synthesis of amino acids lipids pigments and proteins or for the synthesis of pigments or carbohydrates fig 4 44 45 in brief the results here obtained demonstrated the possibility of tailoring the biochemical composition of microalgae by implementing operational strategies based on sequential n limitations nevertheless the adaptation of the microalgae population to the environmental conditions as discussed in the next section plays a key role and hinders a proper control of the productivity of the target bioproduct 3 3 microalgae population structure the tpbr was inoculated with a cyanobacteria microalgae consortium composed of aphanothece sp chlorella sp chlorella vulgaris mayamaea sp chlorella homosphaera and pseudanabaena sp with a share of 21 24 6 12 2 and 27 n cells respectively fig 5 interestingly biogas upgrading at the lowest inorganic carbon concentration supported the dominance of chlorella species during stage i nevertheless the stepwise increase in ic during stages ii and iii mediated a shift in microalgae structure decreasing the abundance of the green algae chlorella sp and chlorella homosphaera from 79 to 52 and from 17 to 13 nÂº cells respectively concomitant with an increase in the abundance of the cyanobacterium pseudanabaena sp of 22 and 32 nÂº cells in stages ii and iii respectively the contribution of this cyanobacterium increased in subsequent operational stages being the dominant species in stages v 64 nÂº cells and vi 79 nÂº cells pseudanabaena sp is commonly found during wastewater treatment at low n concentrations competing with species from the genus chlorella 46 interestingly tetracoccus sp a sulfur oxidizing phototrophic bacteria typically found in wastewater treatment processes was retrieved in stages iv vi with an abundance of up to 6 n cells 47 overall the low microalgae diversity found in this study was attributed to the high alkalinity and the n deprivation conditions 3 4 perspectives and practical applications as demonstrated in this study the biomethane obtained from photosynthetic biogas upgrading complies with most international regulations for injection into the natural grid or use as vehicle fuel nevertheless the determination of the cost benefit ratio and the techno economic feasibility is necessary prior full scale implementation of this technology in this context biogas upgrading in a closed algal bacterial photobioreactor coupled with an external ac offers a low energy consumption of 0 08 kw h nm 3 of treated raw biogas in contrast with the energy consumption of conventional physical chemical technologies which ranges from 0 2 up to 1 kw h nm 3 of treated raw biogas 48 moreover this process allows for the simultaneous biogas upgrading co2 and h2s removal in one stage algal biomass valorization and wastewater treatment which could play a crucial role in a circular economy model on the contrary the investment costs of photosynthetic biogas upgrading are 2 times higher than those of the market leading technologies for biogas upgrading 48 49 currently european commission projects such as incover https incover project eu or urbiofin https www urbiofin eu are validating the potential of this biogas upgrading technology at semi industrial scale outdoors integrating the process in an wastewater treatment plant and an urban solid waste treatment facility respectively 49 on the other hand the feasibility of this biological technology could be boosted by increasing the algal biomass economic value through the accumulation of high added value bioproducts 50 in this sense the algal biomass with an enhanced content of carbohydrates obtained in this research during the n feast famine cycles could be used as a feedstock to produce bioethanol however the biomass recovery step which depends on factors such as cell type density and size alongside with the downstream processing requirements and the final value of the product must be carefully assessed in order to ensure the viability of the process 51 for example the extraction of carbohydrates lipids and proteins was studied in a pilot scale membrane filtration system at swansea university resulting in an energy consumption of 0 90 kw h m 3 per 0 05 kg microalgae 1 52 similarly a research group from plymouth university implemented a

13809,photosynthetic biogas upgrading in microalgae photobioreactors constitutes a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology for the simultaneous removal of co2 and h2s from raw biogas the potential of algal bacterial symbiosis for biogas purification has been already studied and demonstrated in open photobioreactors however few studies have focused on the implementation of this process in closed photobioreactors which offer higher photosynthetic efficiencies enhanced biomass productivities a limited n2 contamination and improved co2 mass transfer in this study the influence of alkalinity inorganic carbon concentrations from 200 to 1700 mg l 1 and nitrogen n deprivation strategies 24 or 48 h limitation on both biomethane quality and biomass composition has been evaluated and optimized in a closed tubular photobioreactor tpbr interconnected to a mixing chamber and a biogas absorption column total working volume of 132 l the increase in the alkalinity of the cultivation broth mediated an increase in the upgrading performance of the tpbr reaching co2 removals of 96 3 0 8 and a complete h2s abatement resulting in an enhanced biomethane composition ch4 97 2 0 9 moreover process operation under n deprivation did not affect the quality of biomethane which complied with standards required for injection into natural gas grids or use as vehicle fuel n deprivation promoted the continuous storage of intracellular carbohydrates 29 0 4 4 compared with 14 3 2 1 obtained under n excess a maximum biomass productivity obtained was of 15 8 4 3 g m 2 d 1 during n excess vs 11 2 3 3 g m 2 d 1 during n deprivation at 26 8 d of hydraulic retention time during the n feast famine cycles the cyanobacterial species pseudanabaena sp was dominant over green algae keywords alkalinity biogas upgrading biomethane carbohydrates production closed photobioreactor 1 introduction biogas is obtained from the anaerobic digestion of organic feedstock and can be used as an energy vector to produce electricity and heat in industrial and domestic applications thus contributing to the reduction of the world dependence on fossil fuels 1 in this context the global installed biogas capacity reached 17 7 gw in 2018 of which 12 3 gw corresponded to europe 2 nevertheless a preliminary purification stage is strongly recommended prior energy use of this renewable energy source since raw biogas contains not only methane ch4 40 75 but also other gas pollutants such as carbon dioxide co2 15 60 hydrogen sulfide h2s 0 005 3 nitrogen n2 0 2 oxygen o2 0 1 siloxanes 0 0 02 volatile organic compounds voc 0 6 ammonia nh3 1 or carbon monoxide co 0 6 3 in this sense the removal of co2 and h2s is typically performed in order to increase the calorific value of biogas and to reduce transportation costs besides minimizing toxicity and preventing corrosion in piping or compressors 4 moreover if the upgraded biogas is intended to be injected into the natural gas grid or to be used as a vehicle fuel a more stricter purification is required in order to fulfill with international biomethane standards typically ch4 90 95 co2 2 4 o2 1 and negligible amounts of h2s 3 5 in this context physical chemical biogas upgrading technologies have been developed and commercialized at industrial scale water scrubbing and membrane separation being nowadays the market leading technologies worldwide despite their high energy consumption operating costs and environmental impacts 6 7 photosynthetic biogas upgrading in algal bacterial photobioreactors has been consistently proven as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for the simultaneous removal of co2 and h2s from raw biogas in a single stage process this technology is based on the fixation of co2 by microalgae via photosynthesis and the concomitant release of oxygen to the cultivation broth which is subsequently used by sulfur oxidizing bacteria for the oxidation of h2s to so4 2 both gases are transferred from the raw biogas to the cultivation broth in an absorption column ac interconnected to the photobioreactor 5 8 several authors have evidenced the efficiency of this technology indoors and outdoors at both laboratory and pilot scale and the most relevant operating parameters of this technology have been optimized in order to maximize the quality of the final biomethane 9 11 for instance rodero et al 12 demonstrated the key role of the alkalinity of the cultivation broth to ensure a satisfactory biomethane quality 98 of ch4 at inorganic carbon concentrations ic 1500 mg l 1 similarly the influence of gas liquid flow ratio l g and configuration in the ac has been thoroughly assessed with optimum values of 0 5 under co current operation 13 nevertheless the economic viability of the energy valorization of biogas is often limited by the high costs of combined heat and power production gas engines and the current reductions of fiscal incentives 14 similarly the costly purification required for injection of the upgraded biomethane into natural gas grids or use as vehicle fuel renders it uncompetitive compared with natural gas in this context photosynthetic biogas upgrading offers not only a low cost alternative for biogas upgrading but also the possibility to further valorize the algal biomass generated when implemented in closed tubular photobioreactors tpbr thus increasing the economic sustainability of the technology under nutrient deprivation conditions microalgae and cyanobacteria can accumulate intracellular energy reserves such as biopolymers carbohydrates starch in microalgae and glycogen in cyanobacteria lipids proteins or pigments among others 15 17 unfortunately the potential of biogas upgrading has been mainly investigated and demonstrated in open photobioreactors such as high rate algal ponds hraps due to their simple design construction operation easy scale up and lower investment cost 18 in contrast this configuration offers a lower biomass productivity as a result of the reduced light photosynthetic efficiency compared to closed photobioreactors 19 20 therefore photosynthetic biogas upgrading combined with algal biomass valorization in closed photobioreactors constitutes a promising cost efficient and sustainable alternative that integrates a reduction in the costs of biogas upgrading within a model of circular economy however there is a lack of studies devoted to assess and optimize the long term performance of this technology in this study the biogas upgrading performance of a tpbr interconnected to an external ac was evaluated for 395 days systematically assessing the influence of the alkalinity of the cultivation broth on the biomethane quality moreover the effect of nitrogen n deprivation cycles on biogas upgrading and on the chemical composition of the algal biomass were determined in order to validate biomass valorization 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum

purchased from cofarcas s a burgos spain at a concentration that varied depending on the operational stage 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of a tpbr interconnected to a mixing chamber and an ac with a total working volume of 132 l fig 1 the tpbr was composed of 12 tubes of 6 cm of inner diameter and 94 cm of length with a total volume of 45 6 l an illuminated area of 2 2 m2 and a total footprint of 0 3 m2 two sets of high intensity led pcbs were placed at both sides of the tpbr to provide a photosynthetic active radiation par of 883 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 using 12 12 h light dark periods the mixing chamber 50 cm height 48 cm width and 35 cm length had a working volume of 84 l and the ac 2 m height with an internal diameter of 4 5 cm was operated with 1 73 m of water column and a working volume of 2 6 l the cultivation broth was recirculated using a centrifugal pump dwo e 300 ebara italy at a linear velocity of 0 5 m s 1 through the tpbr and the mixing chamber flue gas or biogas was supplied to the ac through a stainless steel diffuser of 2 Î¼m pore size located at the bottom of the column co currently with the cultivation broth from the mixing chamber 2 3 operational procedure 2 3 1 influence of ic concentration on photosynthetic biogas upgrading the system was inoculated with the microalgae bacteria consortium at a volatile suspended solids vss

acclimation period afterwards the system was operated for 395 days at a cultivation broth exchange rate of 5 l d 1 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 26 8 d during stage 0 synthetic flue gas co2 30 and n2 70 v v abellÃ³ linde spain was used as carbon source for the growth of microalgae from days 0 14 synthetic flue gas was fed at 10 ml min 1 subsequently increasing the flow rate

test the influence of cultivation broth alkalinity on biomethane quality the ic concentration was increased from 218 8 5 1 429 5 47 6 and 1707 3 52 8 mg l 1 by addition of nahco3 and na2co3 in stages i ii and iii respectively table 1 during stages iv to vi the ic concentration was maintained constant at 1347 9 54 4 mg l 1 2 3 2 influence of the cyclic n deprivation on biomass composition during stages 0 i ii and iii 529 5 mg n d 1 corresponding to 1 g nh4 2so4 l 1 were added with the fresh mineral medium in order to maintain a total nitrogen tn concentration of 87 2 11 9 mg l 1 in the cultivation broth by day 191 stage iv fresh mineral medium without n was supplemented in order to decrease the tn concentration to 6 mg l 1 by day 216 starting afterwards the n feast famine cycles during stages iv and v 24 and 48 hs feast famine cycles were implemented respectively consisting of the exchange of n supplemented medium by day 1 of the cycle n free medium by day 2 and no medium exchange by day 3 in stage v n concentration in the n supplemented mineral medium was adjusted to provide 324 mg n d 1 during the feast periods 0 6 g nh4 2so4 l 1 to ensure a biomass productivity of

performance stages i iii by day 34 after system inoculation co2 removal efficiencies res of 74 0 4 9 were recorded during flue gas feeding stage 0 at an inorganic carbon concentration in the cultivation broth of 217 1 29 3 mg l 1 when biogas was supplemented to the ac average co2 res increased from 77 7 3 9 85 4 3 3 and 96 3 0 8 at ic concentrations of 200 400 and 1700 mg l 1 in stages i ii and iii respectively fig 2 a during these stages almost a complete h2s removal h2s res 99 fig 2a was achieved due to the higher aqueous solubility of h2s compared to that of co2 according to henry s law constants at 20 c hh2s 2 13 and hco2 0 71 dimensionless 28 this removal was attributed to the activity of sulfide oxidizing bacteria using the oxygen from the photosynthetic activity as supported by the values of sulfate concentration recorded throughout the experimental period 890 0 5 7 mg so4 2 l 1 the ph of the cultivation broth remained at 8 9 0 2 9 2 0 2 and 9 3 0 1 during stages i ii and iii respectively the positive effect of alkalinity on the removal of both acidic gases has been widely demonstrated in hraps both at laboratory and pilot scales however a higher ph 9 4 is commonly required to achieve co2 res as high as those observed in this study while process operation at a ph 9 typically results in a lower abatement performance res 90 29 similarly rodero et al 12 observed co2 res of 50 6 3 0 when working at an ic concentration of 500 mg l 1 in the cultivation broth in an open photobioreactor considerably below the abatement performance of the closed system here studied moreover h2s res from 96 to 100 have been reported in open systems at 1500 mg l 1 however lower ic concentrations 500 mg l 1 only supported h2s res of 66 94 9 10 12 30 the high alkalinity of the cultivation broth promotes the mass transfer of the acidic gases co2 and h2s from the biogas to the liquid phase in the ac since the presence of carbonate bicarbonate increases the ph of the cultivation broth the average co2 content in the upgraded biogas was 6 2 1 8 4 6 1 1 and 1 1 0 2 during stages i ii and iii respectively while no h2s was detected in the biomethane during these operating stages fig 2b consequently an average ch4 concentration of 90 8 1 5 93 3 1 3 and 97 2 0 9 stages i ii and iii respectively was achieved on the other hand the average n2 concentration in the biomethane was 1 7 0 8 2 0 0 5 and 1 6 0 4 with an o2 content of 0 8 0 3 0 5 0 2 and 0 4 0 3 during stages i ii and iii respectively hence the optimum biomethane composition was recorded during stage iii working at 1700 mg l 1 which indeed complied with most international regulations for biogas injection into natural gas grids or use as autogas ch4 95 co2 2 5 4 h2s 5 mg nm 3 and o2 1 5 previous research on photosynthetic biogas upgrading in open photobioreactors has found n2 and o2 concentrations in the upgraded biogas ranging from 1 to 13 and from 0 7 to 7 respectively 9 31 32 thus in open systems the high photosynthetic activity results in high do concentrations and a subsequent increase in the o2 content in the biomethane 33 in contrast in our tpbr the limited stripping from the cultivation broth in the ac allowed achieving satisfactory o2 contents in the upgraded biogas in spite of the high photosynthetic activity and the concomitant high do levels stages i to iii do 17 mg l 1 3 1 2 biomass production stages i iii a high photosynthetic activity was recorded regardless of the operating stage with do concentrations in the cultivation broth ranging from 17 to 20 mg o2 l 1 it is important to stress that no inhibition of the microalgae growth associated to this elevated oxygen concentration was observed which has been reported as one of the possible drawbacks of closed photobioreactors do 30 mg o2 l 1 34 35 the low dilution rate set during stages i iii resulted in a low biomass productivity and vss concentration in the tpbr in stage i 10 8 2 0 g m 2 d 1 and 569 0 106 3 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 which slightly increased to 13 4 1 8 and 12 1 2 7 g m 2 d 1 during stages ii and iii respectively vss concentrations of 711 3 95 6 and 697 5 60 8 mg l 1 similar biomass concentrations have been recorded in open systems devoted to biogas upgrading 29 for instance rodero et al 12 reported biomass concentrations of 200 500 mg l 1 depending on the ic concentration in the cultivation broth of a hrap ranging from 100 to 1500 mg l 1 on the contrary biomass productivities from 5 up to 16 9 g m 2 d 1 have been obtained in hraps working at lower hrts compared to that of the present study hrt 4 7 4 vs 26 8 days 9 12 36 in this regard it is important to highlight that volumetric g l 1 d 1 instead of areal productivities g m 2 d 1 should be reported for closed photobioreactors to allow for a fair comparison between both configurations 19 37 thus volumetric productivities of 0 08 0 07 g l 1 d 1 were obtained in stages ii and iii at the high end of those commonly achieved in open systems ranging from 0 015 to 0 1 g l 1 d 1 38 finally n nh4 was completely oxidized into nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in stages i and ii table 1 indeed n no3 concentrations of 112 1 12 8 102 3 20 8 and 85 6 11 3 mg l 1 were recorded in stages i ii and iii respectively negligible n no2 concentrations of 2 9 3 9 mg n no2 l 1 were detected in the cultivation broth of the tpbr during stage iii 3 2 effect of cyclic n deprivation on the system performance stages iv to vi 3 2 1 biogas upgrading performance during stages iv to vi the ic concentration in the cultivation broth remained constant at 1300 mg l 1 while a slightly higher ph was recorded compared to that of n supplementation stages with average values of 9 8 0 1 9 6 0 1 and 9 4 0 1 in stages iv v and vi respectively this higher ph concomitant with the lower do concentrations present in the tpbr 11 2 3 5 14 0 5 3 and 11 3 4 4 mg l 1 in stages iv v and vi respectively was likely due to the absence of a significant nitrification during stages iv and v indeed nh4 nitrification is a biological process that decreases the ph of the cultivation broth as a result of proton release and ic consumption under these operational conditions no h2s was detected in the biomethane and co2 res of 97 3 0 5 97 0 0 8 and 94 5 0 8 were recorded in stages iv v and vi respectively the superior co2 removals observed during n deprivation were in agreement with the more alkaline ph required for an effective mass transfer of this contaminant from biogas into the cultivation broth in this context an enhanced upgraded biogas composition was obtained ch4 97 7 1 0 co2 1 0 0 4 h2s 0 0 0 0 o2 0 2 0 1 and n2 1 3 0 8 fig 2b 3 2 2 biomass production during the operation of the tpbr under n deprivation conditions a biomass productivity of 12 4 1 7 and 11 2 3 3 g m 2 d 1 was recorded in stages iv and v respectively corresponding to a vss concentration of 654 2 90 2 and 590 4 176 8 mg vss l 1 table 2 this decrease in biomass concentration was in accordance with the reduction in the n load to the photobioreactor on the other hand a recovery in the biomass productivity and vss concentration up to values of 15 8 4 3 g m 2 d 1 and 779 3 307 3 mg l 1 was observed when the nitrogen feed was restored stage vi 529 5 mg n d 1 nevertheless the photosynthetic performance of microalgae was not negatively affected as shown by the do concentration of the cultivation broth which was maintained within the optimal growth range 10 mg l 1 the ability of microalgae to accumulate energy storage compounds under different nutrient availability conditions can contribute to the economic viability of the photosynthetic upgrading process in this context a highly variable composition of proteins 40 60 lipids 5 20 carbohydrates 20 30 and ashes 5 15 can be obtained depending on the microalgae species 17 as expected the microalgae consortium of the tpbr exhibited a higher protein content under n excess compared to that observed under n limitation 33 37 dcw in stages iv and v vs 48 5 dcw in stage vi table 2 besides previous studies have demonstrated an enhanced nitrogen uptake associated with an increased protein production when increasing the inorganic carbon concentration available for microalgae growth 39 regarding lipids accumulation values of 10 4 1 5 and 9 7 3 1 dcw were obtained during n deprivation in stages iv and v respectively unexpectedly increasing to 17 0 1 2 dcw in the last operating stage when n was supplemented in excess the lipid yield here obtained was significantly low compared to the typical ranges of lipid content commonly found in microalgae from 20 up to 70 dcw and therefore not suitable for further valorization 17 40 similarly posadas et al 41 obtained a lipid content ranging from 2 9 11 2 dcw in microalgae grown in a hrap devoted to biogas upgrading in this context it is important to highlight that the ic contained in the cultivation broth is not only an essential parameter regulating photosynthesis and microalgae growth but it might also influence the biochemical composition of the biomass in this sense some authors have reported an increased carbohydrates or lipids accumulation depending on the microalgae strain when n deprivation occurs under excess of carbon source 39 42 43 in our particular study n deprivation mediated an increase in the accumulation of carbohydrates in the microalgae biomass achieving values up to 2 0 times higher 29 0 4 4 dcw in stage v than those obtained under regular nutritional conditions this might support alternative chemical or biological valorization strategies for this biomass therefore the synthesis of lipids typically reported under n limitation was here diverted to carbohydrates synthesis during co2 fixation in the calvin bassham benson cycle cbb the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate g3p produced through the cbb cycle can either be used for the synthesis of pyruvate via the glycolytic pathway which is the precursor for the synthesis of amino acids lipids pigments and proteins or for the synthesis of pigments or carbohydrates fig 4 44 45 in brief the results here obtained demonstrated the possibility of tailoring the biochemical composition of microalgae by implementing operational strategies based on sequential n limitations nevertheless the adaptation of the microalgae population to the environmental conditions as discussed in the next section plays a key role and hinders a proper control of the productivity of the target bioproduct 3 3 microalgae population structure the tpbr was inoculated with a cyanobacteria microalgae consortium composed of aphanothece sp chlorella sp chlorella vulgaris mayamaea sp chlorella homosphaera and pseudanabaena sp with a share of 21 24 6 12 2 and 27 n cells respectively fig 5 interestingly biogas upgrading at the lowest inorganic carbon concentration supported the dominance of chlorella species during stage i nevertheless the stepwise increase in ic during stages ii and iii mediated a shift in microalgae structure decreasing the abundance of the green algae chlorella sp and chlorella homosphaera from 79 to 52 and from 17 to 13 nÂº cells respectively concomitant with an increase in the abundance of the cyanobacterium pseudanabaena sp of 22 and 32 nÂº cells in stages ii and iii respectively the contribution of this cyanobacterium increased in subsequent operational stages being the dominant species in stages v 64 nÂº cells and vi 79 nÂº cells pseudanabaena sp is commonly found during wastewater treatment at low n concentrations competing with species from the genus chlorella 46 interestingly tetracoccus sp a sulfur oxidizing phototrophic bacteria typically found in wastewater treatment processes was retrieved in stages iv vi with an abundance of up to 6 n cells 47 overall the low microalgae diversity found in this study was attributed to the high alkalinity and the n deprivation conditions 3 4 perspectives and practical applications as demonstrated in this study the biomethane obtained from photosynthetic biogas upgrading complies with most international regulations for injection into the natural grid or use as vehicle fuel nevertheless the determination of the cost benefit ratio and the techno economic feasibility is necessary prior full scale implementation of this technology in this context biogas upgrading in a closed algal bacterial photobioreactor coupled with an external ac offers a low energy consumption of 0 08 kw h nm 3 of treated raw biogas in contrast with the energy consumption of conventional physical chemical technologies which ranges from 0 2 up to 1 kw h nm 3 of treated raw biogas 48 moreover this process allows for the simultaneous biogas upgrading co2 and h2s removal in one stage algal biomass valorization and wastewater treatment which could play a crucial role in a circular economy model on the contrary the investment costs of photosynthetic biogas upgrading are 2 times higher than those of the market leading technologies for biogas upgrading 48 49 currently european commission projects such as incover https incover project eu or urbiofin https www urbiofin eu are validating the potential of this biogas upgrading technology at semi industrial scale outdoors integrating the process in an wastewater treatment plant and an urban solid waste treatment facility respectively 49 on the other hand the feasibility of this biological technology could be boosted by increasing the algal biomass economic value through the accumulation of high added value bioproducts 50 in this sense the algal biomass with an enhanced content of carbohydrates obtained in this research during the n feast famine cycles could be used as a feedstock to produce bioethanol however the biomass recovery step which depends on factors such as cell type density and size alongside with the downstream processing requirements and the final value of the product must be carefully assessed in order to ensure the viability of the process 51 for example the extraction of carbohydrates lipids and proteins was studied in a pilot scale membrane filtration system at swansea university resulting in an energy consumption of 0 90 kw h m 3 per 0 05 kg microalgae 1 52 similarly a research group from plymouth university implemented a process consisting of auto flocculation coupled with passive capillary dewatering for the extraction of bioactive compounds from cyanobacteria reaching a lower energy consumption 0 01 kw h m 3 per 0 16 kg microalgae 1 52 in brief the selection of the optimal harvesting technology must be performed on a case by case basis taking into account microalgae species high end added value products and energy demand 52 according to toledo cervantes et al 48 algal biomass valorization can outweigh the high investment costs of photosynthetic biogas upgrading finally the european political initiatives for climate change protection and promotion of renewable energies support current growing trend of biomethane production with annual estimated values of 1072 tw h at 57 mwh 1 by 2050 according to the gas for climate a path to 2050 report 1 53 moreover the use of wastes as substrates biogas from anaerobic digestion and wastewater together with the production of valuable bioproducts from the algal biomass generated from co2 capture during photosynthetic biogas upgrading fosters circular economy and resource efficiency 4 conclusions the potential of photosynthetic biogas upgrading coupled with the production of tailored algal biomass has been demonstrated in a tpbr interconnected to external ac the influence of alkalinity and n deprivation in the cultivation broth on biomethane quality and biomass composition was assessed and optimized for 395 days of continuous operation an alkalinity of 1700 mg l 1 ensured a biomethane composition complying with international regulations for methane injection into natural gas grids or use as autogas 96 of ch4 moreover the implementation of n feast famine cycles did not result in a detrimental effect on the biomethane quality maintaining co2 res of 97 and a complete removal of h2s regardless of the cycle duration n limitation during 24 and 48 h induced an increase in the carbohydrate content of the harvested biomass up to 29 dcw process operation at high alkalinities and n limitation mediated the low microalgae diversity observed in the tpbr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
