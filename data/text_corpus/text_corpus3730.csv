18650,anammox granules are advantageous because of their relatively higher nitrogen removal rate nrr and biomass retention capacity in ammonia containing wastewater treatment however little attention has been paid to granule rheological intensity and size evolution especially under low temperature and substrate concentration conditions in this study the size evolution and variations in rheological properties associated with biochemical characteristics of anammox granules were investigated at decreasing temperatures 35 13 c and influent substrate concentrations 300 50 mg nh4 n l 1 both the specific anammox activities saa and yield stress τc or storage modulus g which reflected granules intensity decreased with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration an exponential correlation was found between saa and τc or g granule size strongly decreased at low temperature 13 c and influent substrate concentration 50 mg nh4 n l 1 despite slight variations in τc or g a threshold τc or g that is closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force in the reactor may exist for the anammox granules once the τc or g of the anammox granules was lower than this threshold value τc 10 13 15 63 kpa granules that could not endure hydrodynamic shear forces would disintegrate and their size would decrease substantially candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus in the expanded granular sludge bed reactor reaching a minimum abundance of 14 6 at 16 c because of the low temperature shock but increasing in abundance to 57 0 at 13 c indicating it has a competitive advantage at low temperatures this contributed to achieving a high reactor nitrogen loading rate 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 even at 13 c or with 50 mg nh4 n l 1 influent overall the results of this study will facilitate management of anammox bioreactors that run at various temperatures and influent substrate concentrations by clarifying the correlation between rheological intensity and anammox granule sludge activity and identifying the τc or g threshold graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granule size yield stress rheology temperature and influent substrate concentration extracellular polymer substance 1 introduction the anammox process combined with partial nitrification has been implemented in various full scale applications for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater because of its low oxygen demand and lack of requirement for organic carbon star et al 2007 the advantages of applying granular sludges to anammox wastewater treatment have been widely recognized liu et al 2009 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 for example a relatively higher nitrogen removal rate nrr biomass retention capacity and shock resistance were achieved by anammox granules than by anammox flocs tang et al 2011 however the nitrogen removal performance of anammox granules depends greatly on their physicochemical properties such as granule size and intensity lin and wang 2017 zhu et al 2018 size is an important parameter impacting the stability of anammox granules and the efficient operation of the bioreactors peng et al 2013 when particle size is too large e g 4 mm lu et al 2013 a dead zone forms in the granules which could result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 this can further reduce the efficiency of mass transfer between anammox granular sludge and pollutants however it is difficult to increase the biomass and activity of anammox sludge when the particle size is too small e g 0 2 mm zhu et al 2018 moreover the size of the anammox granules may be affected by environmental shifts such as in temperature and influent substrate concentration however how the evolution of anammox granule size is affected by these shifts remains unclear intensity is another key parameter influencing robust anammox granules pereboom 1997 low intensity granules are unable to endure frequent hydrodynamic shear forces in reactors and might disintegrate resulting in granule size evolution and biomass loss whereas high intensity granules might not be disturbed by the hydrodynamic shear stress and could increase in size but are prone to floating chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 rheology which is the science of the flow and deformation behavior of a material is used to explore the correlations between deformation shear stress and time lin et al 2013 mulder and alexander 2001 which describe the material intensity the storage modulus g and loss modulus g are the amounts of energy stored and dissipated during deformation or the real and imaginary parts respectively of the dynamic complex modulus g and yield stress τc are direct indicators of the mechanical strength of a material a higher g or τc generally represents a stronger structure thus rheological parameters have been introduced to profile anammox granules in prior studies lin and wang 2017 shi et al 2017 by using a controlled stress and strain rheometer with selective enzymatic hydrolysis lin and wang 2017 verified the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the formation and stabilization of anammox granules they showed that α polysaccharides and proteins were the backbones of anammox granules contributing greatly to their excellent intensity in their study the τc of granular sludge in an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr at 33 c was determined to be 16 kpa however there is little information available in the current literature regarding the effects of temperature and influent substrate concentrations on the rheological properties and granule size of anammox granules shi et al 2017 and xing et al 2015 studied the effects of temperature on the apparent viscosity of anammox granules but did not consider more detailed rheological parameters such as g and τc reflecting the intensity of the granules to the best of our knowledge the correlation between intensity and activity of anammox granules has not been elucidated even though this information would deepen the understanding of anammox granule properties in this study we investigated the effects of temperature and influent substrate concentration variations on the nitrogen removal performance of an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor as well as the rheological properties and effects of particle size of anammox granules by combining laser particle size and rheological analyses the specific objectives of this study were i to explore the physicochemical morphological and microbiological evolution of anammox granules along with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration and ii to identify the relationships between anammox activities and granule sizes and granule intensities the results presented herein provide valuable information that will guide the design and operation of anammox granular sludge reactors at various temperatures and influent substrate concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a lab scale egsb reactor working volume 2 17 l diameter 50 mm height to diameter ratio 21 2 was established for anammox granular sludge culture and covered with black cloth to prevent the penetration of light van der star et al 2007 the inoculated biomass about 1 3l was taken from a lab scale anammox sbr reactor wang et al 2016 in which candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus accounting for 81 9 of the total microbial population based on fluorescence in situ hybridization the reactor was operated in a continuous flow mode with effluent recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j china and temperature controlled by thermostatic water baths hhs dc 0506 china connected to the double wall of the reactor during the startup period 160 days the nitrogen loading rate nlr was gradually increased by increasing the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations or shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt the liquid upflow velocity ufv was controlled at 2 67 m h 1 to maintain a good fluidization in the 16 days before day 1 formal experiment the anammox egsb reactor achieved stable nitrogen removal performance nlr 4 80 0 31 kg n m 3 d 1 nrr 4 18 0 23 kg n m 3 d 1 after which it was operated under various conditions including decreasing temperatures 35 25 20 16 13 c phase i ii iii iv v respectively and influent substrate concentrations 300 150 50 mg nh4 n l 1 phase iii vi vii respectively in sequence the hrt remained at 2 18 h for the operational period except at 13 c hrt 3 79 h the operational parameters of the egsb reactor during various operation phases are shown in table 1 ammonium and nitrite were added to a mineral medium in the form of nh4cl and nano2 respectively specifically the mineral medium was composed of the following g l 1 nahco3 1 25 kh2po4 0 025 cacl2 0 3 mgso4 7h2o 0 3 feso4 7h2o 0 00625 and na2edta 0 00625 as well as 0 5 ml l 1 of trace elements solution prepared according to wang et al 2016 the influent ph was kept in the range of 7 0 7 5 by adding 3 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid 2 2 analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n levels were measured using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics5000 usa temperature and ph were monitored with a portable digital thermometer apuhua tm 902c china and a portable detection instrument wtw multimate 350i germany respectively the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1998 experimental granular sludge samples of all phases were collected on day 55 150 265 324 365 396 and 431 2 3 eps and saa assays the method described by li and yang 2007 was employed for eps extraction the extracellular proteins were determined with a bca protein assay kit wang et al 2016 and the polysaccharide content was analyzed by the anthrone method using glucose as the standard jing et al 2009 specific anammox activity saa characterizes the rate of substrate consumed per biomass via the anammox pathway to investigate the long term effects of temperature and influent substrate concentration on saa the in situ saa of the granules was determined by batch tests in the closed reactor the experimental temperature was consistent with the temperature 13 35 c of the corresponding phase he et al 2018 the initial nh4 n and no2 n were both controlled at about 100 mg l 1 by adding the concentrated substrate solution and the ph was set at approximately 7 5 the saa was calculated from the slope of the decrease curve of the substrate concentration the sum of nh4 n and no2 n during the reaction time and related to the biomass concentration in the reactor expressed as n g 1 vss d 1 2 4 rheological properties rheological measurements were performed on a controlled stress and strain rheometer anton paar mcr 102 austria at ambient temperature with a slight normal force the sludge sample pretreatment and rheological measurements were conducted as described by lin and wang 2017 dynamic oscillatory shear measurements were performed by applying a time t dependent strain of γ t γ 0 sin ω t where ω is the oscillation frequency γ 0 denotes the maximum strain amplitude and the resultant shear stress is σ t γ 0 g sin ω t g cos ω t where g and g are the storage and loss modulus respectively the g of anammox granules was determined as a parameter reflecting the mechanical strength of the material with an oscillatory amplitude sweep performed from about 0 05 to 150 strain amplitude γ at a fixed angular frequency ω of 5 rad s 1 to avoid reducing the duration of the experiment because of high frequencies lin et al 2013 2 5 granule size and sludge morphological characteristics granule size was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 uk the microbial morphology and structure of the granules were observed using a stereoscopic microscope szx16 japan and scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s4800 japan for the sem observations the sludge samples were first fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for one night at 4 c then rinsed three times with 0 1 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 after fixing with 1 osmic acid solution for 1 2 h the samples were rinsed three times with 0 1 mm phosphate buffer subsequently the samples were dehydrated through a series of ethanolic solutions 50 70 80 90 and 95 15 min per step after rinsing twice with ethanol for 20 min each the sludge samples were treated with a mixture of absolute ethanol and isoamyl acetate 1 1 for 30 min then infiltrated with isoamyl acetate for 1 2 h and dried with a critical point drier before being sputter coated with gold 2 6 16s rrna gene sequencing the

similarity cutoff were clustered using usearch v9 2 64 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2010 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 3 results 3 1 long term performance of the anammox egsb reactor with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentrations 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance from day 1 38 the nlr and nrr of the anammox egsb reactor remained at 4 74 0 61 kg n m 3 d 1 and 4 26 0 55 kg n m 3 d 1 respectively with nh4 n and no2 n almost completely consumed fig 1 a b d and table 1 on day 39 phase i the nlr was elevated by decreasing the hrt from 3 21 to 2 18 h after which it remained unchanged except for phase v hrt 3 79 h on day 58 a sudden power outage in the laboratory caused the breakdown of the peristaltic pump used for recirculation while on day 66 the recirculation tube was squashed by the peristaltic pump these two accidents both caused the interruption of the recirculation system without the dilution of effluent recirculation the anammox activity was inhibited by the high influent substrate concentration on day 58 63 and day 66 69 fig 1a b c and d after being diluted by the low substrate concentration water the performance of the egsb reactor recovered rapidly on day 70 73 by increasing the influent substrate concentration from 135 4 to 333 9 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 1a b c and d gradually considering that the anammox activity was not irreversibly inhibited by short term exposure to the high concentration substrate in the egsb reactor the temperature was decreased to 25 c on day 77 table 1 as shown in fig 1d and table 1 as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c in phases i iv the egsb reactor achieved a high nitrogen removal capacity with an nrr 6 0 kg n m 3 d 1 and a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of approximately 85 in phase v as the temperature continued to decrease to 13 c the anammox activity was negatively affected by low temperature on day 343 the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentration reached 190 0 mg l 1 and 227 9 mg l 1 respectively fig 1a and b indicating that the egsb reactor was no longer able to withstand the previous nlr fig 1d accordingly to prevent further negative effects of low temperature on reactor performance the hrt was increased from 2 18 h to 3 79 h on day 351 while the nlr and nrr were decreased to 4 05 0 10 kg n m 3 d 1 and 3 54 0 09 kg n m 3 d 1 table 1 respectively during phases vi vii the operational temperature was returned to 20 c for the egsb reactor from day 380 phase vi and the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased to approximately 150 mg nh4 n l 1 and 180 mg no2 n l 1 in phase vi and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 and 60 mg no2 n l 1 in phase vii respectively fig 1a and b and table 1 specifically in phase vii the nre slightly decreased to 80 3 3 4 because of the decreased influent substrate concentration and residual effluent ammonium fig 1d and table 1 nevertheless the ratios of no2 n nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n were generally similar to the theoretical values of the anammox reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 respectively during both phase vi and vii fig 1c 3 1 2 biomass concentration and specific anammox activities the biomass concentration of the egsb reactor was 10 g mlvss l 1 throughout the operational period table 1 specifically it gradually increased from 11 85 g mlvss l 1 in phase i to 16 62 g mlvss l 1 in phase iv then decreased to 15 69 14 14 and 13 72 g mlvss l 1 in phases v vi and vii respectively table 1 decreases in both temperature and influent substrate concentration also led to decreased saa fig 2 a when the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c phases i iv the saa decreased at about 0 004 g n g 1 vss d 1 c 1 while further decreases from 16 c to 13 c phase v resulted in the saa decreasing at a high rate of 0 028 g n g 1 vss d 1 c 1 fig 2a the saa at 13 c phase v decreased by about 24 compared with that at 16 c phase iv fig 2a this was also reflected in the variation of nrr during the reactor operation process table 1 during which the nlr had to be decreased to 13 c phase v to prevent further deterioration of performance fig 1d a similar phenomenon was observed by sobotka et al 2016 who found substantially different temperature coefficients θ in the arrhenius equation for two temperature ranges 1 07 15 30 c and 1 65 11 15 c additionally the anammox activity decreased significantly when the temperature was below 15 c with saa values of 0 41 g n g 1 vss d 1 0 27 g n g 1 vss d 1 and 0 09 g n g 1 vss d 1 being observed at 20 15 and 13 c respectively the mass transfer resistance resulting from the low influent substrate concentration could be another factor leading to the decreased saa although the initial substrate concentrations were the same in all saa batch tests long term starvation still affected the anammox activity xing et al 2016 indeed the saa decreased to a low rate of about 0 0008 g n g 1 vss d 1 mg nh4 n l 1 1 with decreasing influent substrate concentration phase iii vi and vii and reached the lowest value of 0 21 g n g 1 vss d 1 in phase vii fig 2a 3 1 3 microbial structure evolution of anammox bacteria and denitrifiers the 16s rdna high throughput sequencing showed that candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox bacteria at the genus level in the egsb reactor during all operational phases fig 2b as the temperature decreased phase i iv the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia was maintained at about 50 except for at 16 c phase iv during which it decreased remarkably to 14 6 fig 2b after the temperature decreased further to 13 c phase v the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia rapidly increased to 57 0 fig 2b similar results were observed in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor he et al 2018 where candidatus kuenenia was more abundant 55 2 in the microbial community at 13 c it has also been reported that candidatus kuenenia is more adaptable to low temperatures than other genera such as candidatus brocadia de cocker et al 2018 as the influent substrate concentration decreased phases iii vi and vii the relative abundances of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 43 0 to 33 2 and 27 8 respectively because of the weaker selection inhibitory effects of low ammonium and nitrite concentration on candidatus kuenenia than on other microorganisms zhang et al 2014 fig 2b another nitrogen conversion bacterium in the anammox system relates to denitrifiers which compete for nitrite with anammox bacteria fig 2b such as haliangium chen et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2016 and norank f caldilineaceae cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 the relative abundances of haliangium increased from 1 2 to 4 7 as temperature decreased from 20 c phase iii to 16 c phase iv fig 2b norank f caldilineaceae can use organic compounds in the dead biomass and metabolites of anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 li et al 2009 and its relative abundance reached its highest value of 2 8 at 16 c which may have been associated with the highest content of eps being present at 16 c fig 2c specifically the increased eps could be used as a carbon source by norank f caldilineaceae favoring their growth it is worth noting that denitratisoma fahrbach et al 2006 was the second most abundant bacteria fig 2b however there was no obvious relationship between denitratisoma variation and decreasing temperature fig 2b and further studies are needed to investigate this 3 2 rheological characteristics of anammox granules 3 2 1 linear viscoelastic regimes as shown in fig 3 a g the storage modulus g of anammox granules had a relatively constant value with low strains γ 2 in all operational phases suggesting that anammox granules had linear viscoelastic regimes lve lin and wang 2017 this property was consistent with the dynamic mechanical behavior of physical gels ayol et al 2006 raghavan and khan 1995 anammox granules which have a relatively constant g within a certain range of shear strain fig 3a g until reaching a critical strain level γc wang et al 2011 showed yield stress fluid characteristics in all phases lin and wang 2017 it should be noted that τc τ c g γ c can be used to characterize the intensity of anammox granules lin et al 2013 mori et al 2006 wang et al 2011 when the shear stress is below the τc value only elastic deformation occurs for anammox granules otherwise plastic deformation occurs and this strain increases without further increases in stress yang et al 2009 thus this mechanical properties of anammox granules was considered to resemble that of hydrogels consisting of an extracellular polysaccharide interacting with peptides lin and wang 2017 3 2 2 τc and g variation the τc and g of anammox granular sludges during different operation phases were determined fig 3h the mechanical properties of anammox granular sludge were greatly affected by the influent substrate concentration and temperature with the decrease in temperatures phases i v and influent substrate concentrations phases iii vi and vii the g and τc of anammox granular sludges decreased fig 3h taking τc as an example as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c phase i iv the τc steadily decreased at a rate of about 1 82 kpa c 1 however when the temperature further decreased from 16 c to 13 c phase iv v the τc rapidly decreased at a rate of 6 55 kpa c 1 table 1 and fig 3h in the decreasing influent substrate concentrations period phases iii vi and vii the τc steadily decreased at 0 12 kpa mg nh4 n l 1 1 and a similar decrease trend was obtained for g variation fig 3h it should be noted that the τc of anammox granular sludges reached 64 31 kpa in phase i and decreased to 10 13 kpa and 8 64 kpa in phases v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 respectively fig 3h these τc values of anammox granules were much higher than those of aerobic granules 950 pa seviour et al 2009 anaerobic digestion sludge 420 pa jiang et al 2014 and copolymer hydrogels 23 pa yamaguchi et al 2005 the high τc reflects the high mechanical intensity of anammox granular sludge 3 2 3 shear thinning behavior of anammox granules the aforementioned rheological experiments were performed on a constant angular frequency ω 5 rad s 1 to deepen our understanding of the mechanical properties of anammox granules the frequency dependences of dynamic modulus were measured by varying ω from approximately 1 to 100 rad s 1 at a fixed strain of 1 in which g and g were virtually independent of ω figs s1a g the anammox granules displayed a shear thinning behavior as reflected by the clear decline in complex viscosity η η g i g ω as ω increased fig s1h griskey 1995 zare et al 2019 thus the anammox granules can be classified as polymer gels lin and wang 2017 additionally the change in the intercept of the curve log ω log η was consistent with the changes in temperature and influent substrate concentration but the slope of the curve did not vary fig s1h in other words the changes in temperature and influent substrate concentration could affect the log η of anammox granules but not the change rate of log η with log ω suggesting that the shear thinning behavior characteristics of anammox granules was almost unchanged with variations in temperature and influent substrate concentration 3 3 anammox granule size and morphological characteristics as shown in fig 4 and table 2 the granule size decreased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing influent substrate concentrations 300 50 mg nh4 n l 1 but did not always significantly decrease with decreasing temperature 35 13 c for example there was no significant difference p 0 05 in d 4 3 values as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 20 c phase iii however when the temperature further decreased to 16 c phase iv d 4 3 significantly 0 01 p 0 05 decreased to 767 13 μm table 2 after the temperature decreased to 13 c phase v d 4 3 decreased significantly p 0 01 to 569 10 μm table 2 moreover as shown in fig 4a anammox granules with sizes 2 mm were not detected in phase v 13 c notably the d 4 3 values in both phase v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 were significantly p 0 01 lower than those in other phases table 2 these findings suggest that most of the anammox granules especially the large granules 2 mm disintegrated in these two phases phases v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 which were primarily influenced by low temperature and low strength ammonium loading the morphological characteristics of anammox granules in the egsb reactor revealed that they mainly appeared as iron red cauliflowers during the operational process fig s2a indicating a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria enriched in the reactor the voids on the surface of large particles may be because of aggregation of relatively small sludge particles lu et al 2012 as shown in fig s2b the surface of granular sludges was mainly covered by cocci with few bacilli and filamentous bacterium the cocci were speculated to be anammox bacteria which are reportedly coccoid with an average size ranging between 800 and 1100 nm laura and jetten 2012 cavities in granular sludge were considered to be the channels that transferred substrates into the particles and the generated metabolites and gas out of particles muda et al 2010 subramanyam and mishra 2008 additionally a large amount of eps were observed on the surface of granular sludges indicating their importance in granular sludge lu et al 2012 3 4 eps content and composition variations the contents of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps of anammox granules were determined and proteins were identified as the main component of eps pn ps radio 3 4 0 5 fig 2c the eps content decreased as the influent substrate concentration decreased phases iii vi and vii and decreased significantly p 0 05 to the lowest value 98 1 mg g 1 vss in phase vii which was mainly reflected by the decrease in protein content fig 2c this may have been because the microbial metabolic activity was inhibited by the limited substrate availability ma et al 2017 and lower mass transfer efficiency in the lower substrate concentration which decreased the eps production of anammox bacteria he et al 2018 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in eps content as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 20 c phase iii as the temperature further decreased to 16 c phase iv the eps content increased significantly p 0 01 to the maximum value 150 0 mg g 1 vss fig 2c after the temperature ultimately decreased to 13 c phase v the eps decreased significantly p 0 01 to 118 8 mg g 1 vss fig 2c a similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous study he et al 2018 in which the eps increased to a maximum value 131 9 mg g 1 vss at 18 c this was attributed to the protective responses of anammox biomass under the stress of low temperature at 13 c the eps decreased to 118 8 mg g 1 vss because of decreasing cell secretions resulting from low anammox activities he et al 2018 4 discussion the remarkable advantages of anammox granules such as good settleability high activity and shock resistance have been widely recognized for application in biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2009 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 studies of the characteristics of anammox granule sludge at low temperatures cao et al 2016 he et al 2018 and low strength ammonium loading lotti et al 2014 ma et al 2013 have become increasingly important in wastewater nutrient removal as anammox technology can save a large amount of energy and carbon sources if applied in mainstream wastewater treatment plants however maintaining the anammox activity anammox granule size and intensity of granule sludges represent major challenges for anammox technology in mainstream wastewater treatment especially from a long term steady operation perspective dosta et al 2008 guo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 thus characterization of anammox granules with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration is needed to enable optimum control of granules and provide robust anammox reactions 4 1 characteristics of anammox granules affected by decreasing temperature to explore the intensity and size evolution of anammox granules we comprehensively analyzed variations in the anammox granule characteristics in response to decreasing temperature in phases 35 c 16 c 13 c as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 16 c phase iv both the saa and τc or g of the anammox granules decreased gently figs 2a and 3h however the granule size distribution showed little variation fig 4a the maximum eps contents of the anammox granules was reached at 16 c phase iv fig 2c which could be a protective response of anammox biomass to this low temperature shi et al 2017 however because eps can serve as a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria an increased eps amount may stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which have a higher yield rate and could compete with anammox bacteria for substrate and living space chen et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2016 the combination of increased eps and low temperature shock caused the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia to decrease to the lowest value of 14 6 in phase iv 16 c fig 2b when the temperature decreased further to 13 c both saa and τc or g decreased remarkably figs 2a and 3h the granule size decreased significantly p 0 01 at 13 c phase v which was accompanied by biomass loss and decreased mlvss fig 4a tables 1 and 2 similar results were also reported by xing et al 2015 who observed lower annamox activities sizes and intensities of anammox granules in a uasb reactor at ambient temperatures of 9 25 c than at 35 2 c the disintegration of granules induced by low temperature led to a portion of saa being exhausted for small granules which then lowered the nitrogen removal capacity of the egsb reactor table 1 moreover the eps content reached the lowest value of 118 8 mg g 1 vss at 13 c fig 2c α polysaccharides and proteins are considered to be the backbones of anammox granules contributing greatly to their intensity lin and wang 2017 and polysaccharides play important roles in maintaining the eps structure zhu et al 2018 the eps content might play an important role in maintenance of intensity and size of anammox granules however in this study the maximum eps contents occurred at 16 c and did not increase the anammox granule intensity or size fig 2c thus besides eps contents temperature itself or other factors may have a comprehensive effect on anammox granule intensity and size at 13 c the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased instead indicating that candidatus kuenenia might have a competitive advantage for low temperature compared with other bacteria de cocker et al 2018 therefore a critical temperature threshold of saa τc or g and size of anammox granules might exist between 13 c phase v and 16 c phase iv it was previously shown that 15 c was a critical temperature threshold for changes in anammox granule activities in an anammox granule system sobotka et al 2016 4 2 characteristics of anammox granules affected by influent substrate concentration variations in saa fig 2a τc or g fig 3h and granule size fig 4b and table 2 of anammox granules with decreasing influent substrate concentrations of 300 to 150 and 50 mg l 1 nh4 n in phases iii vi and vii were similar to those of decreasing temperature scenario the decrease in saa and τc or g of granules with decreasing influent substrate concentration figs 2a and 3h can be attributed to the starvation and or lower mass transfer by the low substrate availability ma et al 2017 xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the decrease in eps fig 2c could increase the porosity and permeability of anammox granules xing et al 2015 which might lead to decreased granule intensity and the disintegration of large granules fig 4b and table 2 moreover the mlvss of the egsb decreased in phases vi and vii table 1 which was partially attributed to the lower growth rate of anammox bacteria under the limited substrate as well as the biomass loss caused by the granule disintegration among anammox bacteria the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased to 33 2 and 27 8 in phases vi and vii fig 2b respectively therefore the competitive advantage of anammox bacteria declined in low strength ammonium wastewater zhang et al 2014 compared with other microorganisms which then negatively impacted the egsb reactor performance for example although the nrr was inevitably limited by low influent substrate concentrations and nlr the nre of 80 3 3 4 in phase vii was significantly lower than that of other phases p 0 05 fig 1d and table 1 the decrease in relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia also led to a decrease in saa fig 2a notably the anammox granule characteristics in phase vi might have been affected by the low temperature 13 c in phase v although the data from phase iii vi and vii could reflect the regular effects of influent substrate concentration on anammox granule characteristics the effects of temperature in the previous phase phase v on biomass might still exist accordingly future studies to investigate the effects of influent substrate concentration are warranted 4 3 relationship of granule size and intensity with anammox activity relationships of g and τc with saa were established for the studied egsb anammox system when decreasing the temperature and influent substrate concentration based on this an exponential dependence r 2 0 94 of τc and g on the saa of anammox granules was obtained fig 5 a a higher granule intensity was associated with higher anammox activities and was regulated by both temperature and influent substrate concentration moreover the degree of the decrease in the τc or g of the anammox granule decreased as saa decreased for example the τc decreased by 26 72 kpa when the saa decreased from 0 44 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase i 35 c to 0 41 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase iii 20 c but only decreased by 6 99 kpa when saa decreased from 0 33 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase vi 150 ng nh4 n l 1 to 0 21 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 5a in addition the majority of the relatively high saa values 0 35 g n g 1 vss d 1 occurred in the decreasing temperature period phases i iv fig 2a these findings indicate that temperature variations had a greater impact on granule intensity than variations in influent substrate concentration nevertheless both saa τc and g decreased steadily as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c while they decreased substantially when the temperature decreased to 13 c figs 2a and 3h therefore when compared with temperature the saa might have a stronger association with the intensity of anammox granules when the saa was less than approximately 0 3 g n g 1 vss d 1 the effects of saa variation on the intensity of anammox granules was not obvious fig 5a and the τc or g of anammox granules tended to be stable our findings indicate future studies focusing on anammox granule intensity evolution with anammox activity variation under other conditions are needed the relationship among anammox granule size τc or g and hydrodynamic shear force was also investigated the average particle volume diameters d 4 3 in both phase v 569 μm and phase vii 624 μm were much lower than those in other phases 793 26 μm even though the τc or g of 10 13 kpa in phase v and 8 66 kpa in phase vii were both close to that of 15 63 kpa in phase vi table 2 and fig 5b it has been reported that the selection pressure for granulation depends on the ufv which affects the hydrodynamic shear force imposed on the biomass jin et al 2013 thus the fixed ufv 2 67 m h 1 in this study indicated that the hydrodynamic shear force of the investigated egsb reactor was basically unchanged based on this hypothesis we identified a threshold value of the τc or g between 10 13 kpa phase v and 15 63 kpa phase vi fig 5b in the present study which was closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force in the reactor when the τc or g of anammox granules decreases to below this value or range granules that cannot stand the hydrodynamic shear forces in the system will disintegrate leading to a significant decrease in granule size 4 4 design and operation optimization of the granular anammox reactors based on rheological parameters our findings regarding anammox granule activity intensity and size evolution with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration are favorable for the optimum control of anammox granules and anammox performance in particular a lower granular intensity being associated with lower anammox activities was elucidated for the first time our results reveal that the saa and τc or g values of anammox granules were significantly influenced by temperature and influent substrate concentration therefore the hydrodynamic shear force associated with the threshold value of τc or g is the key parameter that should be controlled appropriately during wastewater treatment with low strength ammonia influent at low temperature based on these findings the disintegration and wastage of low intensity granules in response to hydrodynamic shear forces produced in the system might be avoidable to some extent conversely high hydrodynamic shear forces in the reactor can be applied to high temperature and high strength ammonium treatment processes in such cases the issue of anammox biomass loss resulting from granules floatation should be considered carefully chen et al 2010 previous studies have reported that the severe problem of granules especially large size granules 4 mm lu et al 2013 floatation and wastage occurred in reactors with high nrr and anammox activities dapena mora et al 2004 jianwei et al 2010 lu et al 2012 additionally the volume of gas pockets increased with increasing anammox granule size leading to decreased density and floatation of anammox granules lu et al 2012 therefore we speculate that granules with high saa and intensity beyond the critical values of τc or g may grow continually and be almost unaffected by hydrodynamic shear stress eventually floating up nevertheless floatation of the anammox granules could be effectively prevented by adjusting the liquid velocity to maintain a shear rate of more than 0 778 s 1 in a uasb reactor with about 280 mg l 1 nh4 n or no2 n at 35 1 c chen et al 2014 in other words properly increasing the threshold value of τc or g by adjusting the hydrodynamic shear forces e g the ufv can effectively prevent excessively large granules with a high τc or g from forming and floating up therefore further studies are required to accurately identify this threshold value of τc or g of anammox granules under different reactor operating conditions to better guide the design and operation of anammox granule sludge reactors 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration on anammox granule activity rheological intensity and size evolution and analyzed the biochemical characteristics of anammox biomass in a granular egsb the following conclusions can be drawn from this study candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus in the studied egsb and its relative abundance was maintained at 57 0 and 27 8 at 13 c and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 respectively this contributed to achievement of a high nlr 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 of the anammox egsb reactor at low temperature and influent substrate concentration anammox granules had excellent mechanical intensity the lowest τc value 8 64 kpa of anammox granules at 20 c with 50 mg nh4 n l 1 in influent was still much higher than that of the aerobic granules 950 pa both the saa and τc or g of the anammox granules decreased with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration with the lowest values occurring at 13 c or in the 50 mg nh4 n l 1 influent phases additionally the exponential dependence of τc and g on the saa of anammox granules was elucidated granule size decreased significantly at low temperature 13 c and low influent substrate concentration 50 mg nh4 n l 1 despite slight variations in τc or g values a threshold value of τc or g that was closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force was identified for the studied anammox granules 10 13 15 63 kpa declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18650,anammox granules are advantageous because of their relatively higher nitrogen removal rate nrr and biomass retention capacity in ammonia containing wastewater treatment however little attention has been paid to granule rheological intensity and size evolution especially under low temperature and substrate concentration conditions in this study the size evolution and variations in rheological properties associated with biochemical characteristics of anammox granules were investigated at decreasing temperatures 35 13 c and influent substrate concentrations 300 50 mg nh4 n l 1 both the specific anammox activities saa and yield stress τc or storage modulus g which reflected granules intensity decreased with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration an exponential correlation was found between saa and τc or g granule size strongly decreased at low temperature 13 c and influent substrate concentration 50 mg nh4 n l 1 despite slight variations in τc or g a threshold τc or g that is closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force in the reactor may exist for the anammox granules once the τc or g of the anammox granules was lower than this threshold value τc 10 13 15 63 kpa granules that could not endure hydrodynamic shear forces would disintegrate and their size would decrease substantially candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus in the expanded granular sludge bed reactor reaching a minimum abundance of 14 6 at 16 c because of the low temperature shock but increasing in abundance to 57 0 at 13 c indicating it has a competitive advantage at low temperatures this contributed to achieving a high reactor nitrogen loading rate 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 even at 13 c or with 50 mg nh4 n l 1 influent overall the results of this study will facilitate management of anammox bioreactors that run at various temperatures and influent substrate concentrations by clarifying the correlation between rheological intensity and anammox granule sludge activity and identifying the τc or g threshold graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granule size yield stress rheology temperature and influent substrate concentration extracellular polymer substance 1 introduction the anammox process combined with partial nitrification has been implemented in various full scale applications for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater because of its low oxygen demand and lack of requirement for organic carbon star et al 2007 the advantages of applying granular sludges to anammox wastewater treatment have been widely recognized liu et al 2009 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 for example a relatively higher nitrogen removal rate nrr biomass retention capacity and shock resistance were achieved by anammox granules than by anammox flocs tang et al 2011 however the nitrogen removal performance of anammox granules depends greatly on their physicochemical properties such as granule size and intensity lin and wang 2017 zhu et al 2018 size is an important parameter impacting the stability of anammox granules and the efficient operation of the bioreactors peng et al 2013 when particle size is too large e g 4 mm lu et al 2013 a dead zone forms in the granules which could result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 this can further reduce the efficiency of mass transfer between anammox granular sludge and pollutants however it is difficult to increase the biomass and activity of anammox sludge when the particle size is too small e g 0 2 mm zhu et al 2018 moreover the size of the anammox granules may be affected by environmental shifts such as in temperature and influent substrate concentration however how the evolution of anammox granule size is affected by these shifts remains unclear intensity is another key parameter influencing robust anammox granules pereboom 1997 low intensity granules are unable to endure frequent hydrodynamic shear forces in reactors and might disintegrate resulting in granule size evolution and biomass loss whereas high intensity granules might not be disturbed by the hydrodynamic shear stress and could increase in size but are prone to floating chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 rheology which is the science of the flow and deformation behavior of a material is used to explore the correlations between deformation shear stress and time lin et al 2013 mulder and alexander 2001 which describe the material intensity the storage modulus g and loss modulus g are the amounts of energy stored and dissipated during deformation or the real and imaginary parts respectively of the dynamic complex modulus g and yield stress τc are direct indicators of the mechanical strength of a material a higher g or τc generally represents a stronger structure thus rheological parameters have been introduced to profile anammox granules in prior studies lin and wang 2017 shi et al 2017 by using a controlled stress and strain rheometer with selective enzymatic hydrolysis lin and wang 2017 verified the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the formation and stabilization of anammox granules they showed that α polysaccharides and proteins were the backbones of anammox granules contributing greatly to their excellent intensity in their study the τc of granular sludge in an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr at 33 c was determined to be 16 kpa however there is little information available in the current literature regarding the effects of temperature and influent substrate concentrations on the rheological properties and granule size of anammox granules shi et al 2017 and xing et al 2015 studied the effects of temperature on the apparent viscosity of anammox granules but did not consider more detailed rheological parameters such as g and τc reflecting the intensity of the granules to the best of our knowledge the correlation between intensity and activity of anammox granules has not been elucidated even though this information would deepen the understanding of anammox granule properties in this study we investigated the effects of temperature and influent substrate concentration variations on the nitrogen removal performance of an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor as well as the rheological properties and effects of particle size of anammox granules by combining laser particle size and rheological analyses the specific objectives of this study were i to explore the physicochemical morphological and microbiological evolution of anammox granules along with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration and ii to identify the relationships between anammox activities and granule sizes and granule intensities the results presented herein provide valuable information that will guide the design and operation of anammox granular sludge reactors at various temperatures and influent substrate concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a lab scale egsb reactor working volume 2 17 l diameter 50 mm height to diameter ratio 21 2 was established for anammox granular sludge culture and covered with black cloth to prevent the penetration of light van der star et al 2007 the inoculated biomass about 1 3l was taken from a lab scale anammox sbr reactor wang et al 2016 in which candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus accounting for 81 9 of the total microbial population based on fluorescence in situ hybridization the reactor was operated in a continuous flow mode with effluent recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j china and temperature controlled by thermostatic water baths hhs dc 0506 china connected to the double wall of the reactor during the startup period 160 days the nitrogen loading rate nlr was gradually increased by increasing the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations or shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt the liquid upflow velocity ufv was controlled at 2 67 m h 1 to maintain a good fluidization in the 16 days before day 1 formal experiment the anammox egsb reactor achieved stable nitrogen removal performance nlr 4 80 0 31 kg n m 3 d 1 nrr 4 18 0 23 kg n m 3 d 1 after which it was operated under various conditions including decreasing temperatures 35 25 20 16 13 c phase i ii iii iv v respectively and influent substrate concentrations 300 150 50 mg nh4 n l 1 phase iii vi vii respectively in sequence the hrt remained at 2 18 h for the operational period except at 13 c hrt 3 79 h the operational parameters of the egsb reactor during various operation phases are shown in table 1 ammonium and nitrite were added to a mineral medium in the form of nh4cl and nano2 respectively specifically the mineral medium was composed of the following g l 1 nahco3 1 25 kh2po4 0 025 cacl2 0 3 mgso4 7h2o 0 3 feso4 7h2o 0 00625 and na2edta 0 00625 as well as 0 5 ml l 1 of trace elements solution prepared according to wang et al 2016 the influent ph was kept in the range of 7 0 7 5 by adding 3 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid 2 2 analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n levels were measured using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics5000 usa temperature and ph were monitored with a portable digital thermometer apuhua tm 902c china and a portable detection instrument wtw multimate 350i germany respectively the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1998 experimental granular sludge samples of all phases were collected on day 55 150 265 324 365 396 and 431 2 3 eps and saa assays the method described by li and yang 2007 was employed for eps extraction the extracellular proteins were determined with a bca protein assay kit wang et al 2016 and the polysaccharide content was analyzed by the anthrone method using glucose as the standard jing et al 2009 specific anammox activity saa characterizes the rate of substrate consumed per biomass via the anammox pathway to investigate the long term effects of temperature and influent substrate concentration on saa the in situ saa of the granules was determined by batch tests in the closed reactor the experimental temperature was consistent with the temperature 13 35 c of the corresponding phase he et al 2018 the initial nh4 n and no2 n were both controlled at about 100 mg l 1 by adding the concentrated substrate solution and the ph was set at approximately 7 5 the saa was calculated from the slope of the decrease curve of the substrate concentration the sum of nh4 n and no2 n during the reaction time and related to the biomass concentration in the reactor expressed as n g 1 vss d 1 2 4 rheological properties rheological measurements were performed on a controlled stress and strain rheometer anton paar mcr 102 austria at ambient temperature with a slight normal force the sludge sample pretreatment and rheological measurements were conducted as described by lin and wang 2017 dynamic oscillatory shear measurements were performed by applying a time t dependent strain of γ t γ 0 sin ω t where ω is the oscillation frequency γ 0 denotes the maximum strain amplitude and the resultant shear stress is σ t γ 0 g sin ω t g cos ω t where g and g are the storage and loss modulus respectively the g of anammox granules was determined as a parameter reflecting the mechanical strength of the material with an oscillatory amplitude sweep performed from about 0 05 to 150 strain amplitude γ at a fixed angular frequency ω of 5 rad s 1 to avoid reducing the duration of the experiment because of high frequencies lin et al 2013 2 5 granule size and sludge morphological characteristics granule size was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 uk the microbial morphology and structure of the granules were observed using a stereoscopic microscope szx16 japan and scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s4800 japan for the sem observations the sludge samples were first fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for one night at 4 c then rinsed three times with 0 1 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 after fixing with 1 osmic acid solution for 1 2 h the samples were rinsed three times with 0 1 mm phosphate buffer subsequently the samples were dehydrated through a series of ethanolic solutions 50 70 80 90 and 95 15 min per step after rinsing twice with ethanol for 20 min each the sludge samples were treated with a mixture of absolute

similarity cutoff were clustered using usearch v9 2 64 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2010 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 3 results 3 1 long term performance of the anammox egsb reactor with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentrations 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance from day 1 38 the nlr and nrr of the anammox egsb reactor remained at 4 74 0 61 kg n m 3 d 1 and 4 26 0 55 kg n m 3 d 1 respectively with nh4 n and no2 n almost completely consumed fig 1 a b d and table 1 on day 39 phase i the nlr was elevated by decreasing the hrt from 3 21 to 2 18 h after which it remained unchanged except for phase v hrt 3 79 h on day 58 a sudden power outage in the laboratory caused the breakdown of the peristaltic pump used for recirculation while on day 66 the recirculation tube was squashed by the peristaltic pump these two accidents both caused the interruption of the recirculation system without the dilution of effluent recirculation the anammox activity was inhibited by the high influent substrate concentration on day 58 63 and day 66 69 fig 1a b c and d after being diluted by the low substrate concentration water the performance of the egsb reactor recovered rapidly on day 70 73 by increasing the influent substrate concentration from 135 4 to 333 9 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 1a b c and d gradually considering that the anammox activity was not irreversibly inhibited by short term exposure to the high concentration substrate in the egsb reactor the temperature was decreased to 25 c on day 77 table 1 as shown in fig 1d and table 1 as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c in phases i iv the egsb reactor achieved a high nitrogen removal capacity with an nrr 6 0 kg n m 3 d 1 and a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of approximately 85 in phase v as the temperature continued to decrease to 13 c the anammox activity was negatively affected by low temperature on day 343 the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentration reached 190 0 mg l 1 and 227 9 mg l 1 respectively fig 1a and b indicating that the egsb reactor was no longer able to withstand the previous nlr fig 1d accordingly to prevent further negative effects of low temperature on reactor performance the hrt was increased from 2 18 h to 3 79 h on day 351 while the nlr and nrr were decreased to 4 05 0 10 kg n m 3 d 1 and 3 54 0 09 kg n m 3 d 1 table 1 respectively during phases vi vii the operational temperature was returned to 20 c for the egsb reactor from day 380 phase vi and the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased to approximately 150 mg nh4 n l 1 and 180 mg no2 n l 1 in phase vi and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 and 60 mg no2 n l 1 in phase vii respectively fig 1a and b and table 1 specifically in phase vii the nre slightly decreased to 80 3 3 4 because of the decreased influent substrate concentration and residual effluent ammonium fig 1d and table 1 nevertheless the ratios of no2 n nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n were generally similar to the theoretical values of the anammox reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 respectively during both phase vi and vii fig 1c 3 1 2 biomass concentration and specific anammox activities the biomass concentration of the egsb reactor was 10 g mlvss l 1 throughout the operational period table 1 specifically it gradually increased from 11 85 g mlvss l 1 in phase i to 16 62 g mlvss l 1 in phase iv then decreased to 15 69 14 14 and 13 72 g mlvss l 1 in phases v vi and vii respectively table 1 decreases in both temperature and influent substrate concentration also led to decreased saa fig 2 a when the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c phases i iv the saa decreased at about 0 004 g n g 1 vss d 1 c 1 while further decreases from 16 c to 13 c phase v resulted in the saa decreasing at a high rate of 0 028 g n g 1 vss d 1 c 1 fig 2a the saa at 13 c phase v decreased by about 24 compared with that at 16 c phase iv fig 2a this was also reflected in the variation of nrr during the reactor operation process table 1 during which the nlr had to be decreased to 13 c phase v to prevent further deterioration of performance fig 1d a similar phenomenon was observed by sobotka et al 2016 who found substantially different temperature coefficients θ in the arrhenius equation for two temperature ranges 1 07 15 30 c and 1 65 11 15 c additionally the anammox activity decreased significantly when the temperature was below 15 c with saa values of 0 41 g n g 1 vss d 1 0 27 g n g 1 vss d 1 and 0 09 g n g 1 vss d 1 being observed at 20 15 and 13 c respectively the mass transfer resistance resulting from the low influent substrate concentration could be another factor leading to the decreased saa although the initial substrate concentrations were the same in all saa batch tests long term starvation still affected the anammox activity xing et al 2016 indeed the saa decreased to a low rate of about 0 0008 g n g 1 vss d 1 mg nh4 n l 1 1 with decreasing influent substrate concentration phase iii vi and vii and reached the lowest value of 0 21 g n g 1 vss d 1 in phase vii fig 2a 3 1 3 microbial structure evolution of anammox bacteria and denitrifiers the 16s rdna high throughput sequencing showed that candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox bacteria at the genus level in the egsb reactor during all operational phases fig 2b as the temperature decreased phase i iv the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia was maintained at about 50 except for at 16 c phase iv during which it decreased remarkably to 14 6 fig 2b after the temperature decreased further to 13 c phase v the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia rapidly increased to 57 0 fig 2b similar results were observed in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor he et al 2018 where candidatus kuenenia was more abundant 55 2 in the microbial community at 13 c it has also been reported that candidatus kuenenia is more adaptable to low temperatures than other genera such as candidatus brocadia de cocker et al 2018 as the influent substrate concentration decreased phases iii vi and vii the relative abundances of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 43 0 to 33 2 and 27 8 respectively because of the weaker selection inhibitory effects of low ammonium and nitrite concentration on candidatus kuenenia than on other microorganisms zhang et al 2014 fig 2b another nitrogen conversion bacterium in the anammox system relates to denitrifiers which compete for nitrite with anammox bacteria fig 2b such as haliangium chen et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2016 and norank f caldilineaceae cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 the relative abundances of haliangium increased from 1 2 to 4 7 as temperature decreased from 20 c phase iii to 16 c phase iv fig 2b norank f caldilineaceae can use organic compounds in the dead biomass and metabolites of anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 li et al 2009 and its relative abundance reached its highest value of 2 8 at 16 c which may have been associated with the highest content of eps being present at 16 c fig 2c specifically the increased eps could be used as a carbon source by norank f caldilineaceae favoring their growth it is worth noting that denitratisoma fahrbach et al 2006 was the second most abundant bacteria fig 2b however there was no obvious relationship between denitratisoma variation and decreasing temperature fig 2b and further studies are needed to investigate this 3 2 rheological characteristics of anammox granules 3 2 1 linear viscoelastic regimes as shown in fig 3 a g the storage modulus g of anammox granules had a relatively constant value with low strains γ 2 in all operational phases suggesting that anammox granules had linear viscoelastic regimes lve lin and wang 2017 this property was consistent with the dynamic mechanical behavior of physical gels ayol et al 2006 raghavan and khan 1995 anammox granules which have a relatively constant g within a certain range of shear strain fig 3a g until reaching a critical strain level γc wang et al 2011 showed yield stress fluid characteristics in all phases lin and wang 2017 it should be noted that τc τ c g γ c can be used to characterize the intensity of anammox granules lin et al 2013 mori et al 2006 wang et al 2011 when the shear stress is below the τc value only elastic deformation occurs for anammox granules otherwise plastic deformation occurs and this strain increases without further increases in stress yang et al 2009 thus this mechanical properties of anammox granules was considered to resemble that of hydrogels consisting of an extracellular polysaccharide interacting with peptides lin and wang 2017 3 2 2 τc and g variation the τc and g of anammox granular sludges during different operation phases were determined fig 3h the mechanical properties of anammox granular sludge were greatly affected by the influent substrate concentration and temperature with the decrease in temperatures phases i v and influent substrate concentrations phases iii vi and vii the g and τc of anammox granular sludges decreased fig 3h taking τc as an example as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c phase i iv the τc steadily decreased at a rate of about 1 82 kpa c 1 however when the temperature further decreased from 16 c to 13 c phase iv v the τc rapidly decreased at a rate of 6 55 kpa c 1 table 1 and fig 3h in the decreasing influent substrate concentrations period phases iii vi and vii the τc steadily decreased at 0 12 kpa mg nh4 n l 1 1 and a similar decrease trend was obtained for g variation fig 3h it should be noted that the τc of anammox granular sludges reached 64 31 kpa in phase i and decreased to 10 13 kpa and 8 64 kpa in phases v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 respectively fig 3h these τc values of anammox granules were much higher than those of aerobic granules 950 pa seviour et al 2009 anaerobic digestion sludge 420 pa jiang et al 2014 and copolymer hydrogels 23 pa yamaguchi et al 2005 the high τc reflects the high mechanical intensity of anammox granular sludge 3 2 3 shear thinning behavior of anammox granules the aforementioned rheological experiments were performed on a constant angular frequency ω 5 rad s 1 to deepen our understanding of the mechanical properties of anammox granules the frequency dependences of dynamic modulus were measured by varying ω from approximately 1 to 100 rad s 1 at a fixed strain of 1 in which g and g were virtually independent of ω figs s1a g the anammox granules displayed a shear thinning behavior as reflected by the clear decline in complex viscosity η η g i g ω as ω increased fig s1h griskey 1995 zare et al 2019 thus the anammox granules can be classified as polymer gels lin and wang 2017 additionally the change in the intercept of the curve log ω log η was consistent with the changes in temperature and influent substrate concentration but the slope of the curve did not vary fig s1h in other words the changes in temperature and influent substrate concentration could affect the log η of anammox granules but not the change rate of log η with log ω suggesting that the shear thinning behavior characteristics of anammox granules was almost unchanged with variations in temperature and influent substrate concentration 3 3 anammox granule size and morphological characteristics as shown in fig 4 and table 2 the granule size decreased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing influent substrate concentrations 300 50 mg nh4 n l 1 but did not always significantly decrease with decreasing temperature 35 13 c for example there was no significant difference p 0 05 in d 4 3 values as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 20 c phase iii however when the temperature further decreased to 16 c phase iv d 4 3 significantly 0 01 p 0 05 decreased to 767 13 μm table 2 after the temperature decreased to 13 c phase v d 4 3 decreased significantly p 0 01 to 569 10 μm table 2 moreover as shown in fig 4a anammox granules with sizes 2 mm were not detected in phase v 13 c notably the d 4 3 values in both phase v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 were significantly p 0 01 lower than those in other phases table 2 these findings suggest that most of the anammox granules especially the large granules 2 mm disintegrated in these two phases phases v 13 c and vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 which were primarily influenced by low temperature and low strength ammonium loading the morphological characteristics of anammox granules in the egsb reactor revealed that they mainly appeared as iron red cauliflowers during the operational process fig s2a indicating a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria enriched in the reactor the voids on the surface of large particles may be because of aggregation of relatively small sludge particles lu et al 2012 as shown in fig s2b the surface of granular sludges was mainly covered by cocci with few bacilli and filamentous bacterium the cocci were speculated to be anammox bacteria which are reportedly coccoid with an average size ranging between 800 and 1100 nm laura and jetten 2012 cavities in granular sludge were considered to be the channels that transferred substrates into the particles and the generated metabolites and gas out of particles muda et al 2010 subramanyam and mishra 2008 additionally a large amount of eps were observed on the surface of granular sludges indicating their importance in granular sludge lu et al 2012 3 4 eps content and composition variations the contents of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps of anammox granules were determined and proteins were identified as the main component of eps pn ps radio 3 4 0 5 fig 2c the eps content decreased as the influent substrate concentration decreased phases iii vi and vii and decreased significantly p 0 05 to the lowest value 98 1 mg g 1 vss in phase vii which was mainly reflected by the decrease in protein content fig 2c this may have been because the microbial metabolic activity was inhibited by the limited substrate availability ma et al 2017 and lower mass transfer efficiency in the lower substrate concentration which decreased the eps production of anammox bacteria he et al 2018 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in eps content as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 20 c phase iii as the temperature further decreased to 16 c phase iv the eps content increased significantly p 0 01 to the maximum value 150 0 mg g 1 vss fig 2c after the temperature ultimately decreased to 13 c phase v the eps decreased significantly p 0 01 to 118 8 mg g 1 vss fig 2c a similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous study he et al 2018 in which the eps increased to a maximum value 131 9 mg g 1 vss at 18 c this was attributed to the protective responses of anammox biomass under the stress of low temperature at 13 c the eps decreased to 118 8 mg g 1 vss because of decreasing cell secretions resulting from low anammox activities he et al 2018 4 discussion the remarkable advantages of anammox granules such as good settleability high activity and shock resistance have been widely recognized for application in biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2009 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 studies of the characteristics of anammox granule sludge at low temperatures cao et al 2016 he et al 2018 and low strength ammonium loading lotti et al 2014 ma et al 2013 have become increasingly important in wastewater nutrient removal as anammox technology can save a large amount of energy and carbon sources if applied in mainstream wastewater treatment plants however maintaining the anammox activity anammox granule size and intensity of granule sludges represent major challenges for anammox technology in mainstream wastewater treatment especially from a long term steady operation perspective dosta et al 2008 guo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 thus characterization of anammox granules with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration is needed to enable optimum control of granules and provide robust anammox reactions 4 1 characteristics of anammox granules affected by decreasing temperature to explore the intensity and size evolution of anammox granules we comprehensively analyzed variations in the anammox granule characteristics in response to decreasing temperature in phases 35 c 16 c 13 c as the temperature decreased from 35 c phase i to 16 c phase iv both the saa and τc or g of the anammox granules decreased gently figs 2a and 3h however the granule size distribution showed little variation fig 4a the maximum eps contents of the anammox granules was reached at 16 c phase iv fig 2c which could be a protective response of anammox biomass to this low temperature shi et al 2017 however because eps can serve as a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria an increased eps amount may stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which have a higher yield rate and could compete with anammox bacteria for substrate and living space chen et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2016 the combination of increased eps and low temperature shock caused the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia to decrease to the lowest value of 14 6 in phase iv 16 c fig 2b when the temperature decreased further to 13 c both saa and τc or g decreased remarkably figs 2a and 3h the granule size decreased significantly p 0 01 at 13 c phase v which was accompanied by biomass loss and decreased mlvss fig 4a tables 1 and 2 similar results were also reported by xing et al 2015 who observed lower annamox activities sizes and intensities of anammox granules in a uasb reactor at ambient temperatures of 9 25 c than at 35 2 c the disintegration of granules induced by low temperature led to a portion of saa being exhausted for small granules which then lowered the nitrogen removal capacity of the egsb reactor table 1 moreover the eps content reached the lowest value of 118 8 mg g 1 vss at 13 c fig 2c α polysaccharides and proteins are considered to be the backbones of anammox granules contributing greatly to their intensity lin and wang 2017 and polysaccharides play important roles in maintaining the eps structure zhu et al 2018 the eps content might play an important role in maintenance of intensity and size of anammox granules however in this study the maximum eps contents occurred at 16 c and did not increase the anammox granule intensity or size fig 2c thus besides eps contents temperature itself or other factors may have a comprehensive effect on anammox granule intensity and size at 13 c the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased instead indicating that candidatus kuenenia might have a competitive advantage for low temperature compared with other bacteria de cocker et al 2018 therefore a critical temperature threshold of saa τc or g and size of anammox granules might exist between 13 c phase v and 16 c phase iv it was previously shown that 15 c was a critical temperature threshold for changes in anammox granule activities in an anammox granule system sobotka et al 2016 4 2 characteristics of anammox granules affected by influent substrate concentration variations in saa fig 2a τc or g fig 3h and granule size fig 4b and table 2 of anammox granules with decreasing influent substrate concentrations of 300 to 150 and 50 mg l 1 nh4 n in phases iii vi and vii were similar to those of decreasing temperature scenario the decrease in saa and τc or g of granules with decreasing influent substrate concentration figs 2a and 3h can be attributed to the starvation and or lower mass transfer by the low substrate availability ma et al 2017 xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the decrease in eps fig 2c could increase the porosity and permeability of anammox granules xing et al 2015 which might lead to decreased granule intensity and the disintegration of large granules fig 4b and table 2 moreover the mlvss of the egsb decreased in phases vi and vii table 1 which was partially attributed to the lower growth rate of anammox bacteria under the limited substrate as well as the biomass loss caused by the granule disintegration among anammox bacteria the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased to 33 2 and 27 8 in phases vi and vii fig 2b respectively therefore the competitive advantage of anammox bacteria declined in low strength ammonium wastewater zhang et al 2014 compared with other microorganisms which then negatively impacted the egsb reactor performance for example although the nrr was inevitably limited by low influent substrate concentrations and nlr the nre of 80 3 3 4 in phase vii was significantly lower than that of other phases p 0 05 fig 1d and table 1 the decrease in relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia also led to a decrease in saa fig 2a notably the anammox granule characteristics in phase vi might have been affected by the low temperature 13 c in phase v although the data from phase iii vi and vii could reflect the regular effects of influent substrate concentration on anammox granule characteristics the effects of temperature in the previous phase phase v on biomass might still exist accordingly future studies to investigate the effects of influent substrate concentration are warranted 4 3 relationship of granule size and intensity with anammox activity relationships of g and τc with saa were established for the studied egsb anammox system when decreasing the temperature and influent substrate concentration based on this an exponential dependence r 2 0 94 of τc and g on the saa of anammox granules was obtained fig 5 a a higher granule intensity was associated with higher anammox activities and was regulated by both temperature and influent substrate concentration moreover the degree of the decrease in the τc or g of the anammox granule decreased as saa decreased for example the τc decreased by 26 72 kpa when the saa decreased from 0 44 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase i 35 c to 0 41 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase iii 20 c but only decreased by 6 99 kpa when saa decreased from 0 33 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase vi 150 ng nh4 n l 1 to 0 21 g n g 1 vss d 1 phase vii 50 mg nh4 n l 1 fig 5a in addition the majority of the relatively high saa values 0 35 g n g 1 vss d 1 occurred in the decreasing temperature period phases i iv fig 2a these findings indicate that temperature variations had a greater impact on granule intensity than variations in influent substrate concentration nevertheless both saa τc and g decreased steadily as the temperature gradually decreased from 35 c to 16 c while they decreased substantially when the temperature decreased to 13 c figs 2a and 3h therefore when compared with temperature the saa might have a stronger association with the intensity of anammox granules when the saa was less than approximately 0 3 g n g 1 vss d 1 the effects of saa variation on the intensity of anammox granules was not obvious fig 5a and the τc or g of anammox granules tended to be stable our findings indicate future studies focusing on anammox granule intensity evolution with anammox activity variation under other conditions are needed the relationship among anammox granule size τc or g and hydrodynamic shear force was also investigated the average particle volume diameters d 4 3 in both phase v 569 μm and phase vii 624 μm were much lower than those in other phases 793 26 μm even though the τc or g of 10 13 kpa in phase v and 8 66 kpa in phase vii were both close to that of 15 63 kpa in phase vi table 2 and fig 5b it has been reported that the selection pressure for granulation depends on the ufv which affects the hydrodynamic shear force imposed on the biomass jin et al 2013 thus the fixed ufv 2 67 m h 1 in this study indicated that the hydrodynamic shear force of the investigated egsb reactor was basically unchanged based on this hypothesis we identified a threshold value of the τc or g between 10 13 kpa phase v and 15 63 kpa phase vi fig 5b in the present study which was closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force in the reactor when the τc or g of anammox granules decreases to below this value or range granules that cannot stand the hydrodynamic shear forces in the system will disintegrate leading to a significant decrease in granule size 4 4 design and operation optimization of the granular anammox reactors based on rheological parameters our findings regarding anammox granule activity intensity and size evolution with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration are favorable for the optimum control of anammox granules and anammox performance in particular a lower granular intensity being associated with lower anammox activities was elucidated for the first time our results reveal that the saa and τc or g values of anammox granules were significantly influenced by temperature and influent substrate concentration therefore the hydrodynamic shear force associated with the threshold value of τc or g is the key parameter that should be controlled appropriately during wastewater treatment with low strength ammonia influent at low temperature based on these findings the disintegration and wastage of low intensity granules in response to hydrodynamic shear forces produced in the system might be avoidable to some extent conversely high hydrodynamic shear forces in the reactor can be applied to high temperature and high strength ammonium treatment processes in such cases the issue of anammox biomass loss resulting from granules floatation should be considered carefully chen et al 2010 previous studies have reported that the severe problem of granules especially large size granules 4 mm lu et al 2013 floatation and wastage occurred in reactors with high nrr and anammox activities dapena mora et al 2004 jianwei et al 2010 lu et al 2012 additionally the volume of gas pockets increased with increasing anammox granule size leading to decreased density and floatation of anammox granules lu et al 2012 therefore we speculate that granules with high saa and intensity beyond the critical values of τc or g may grow continually and be almost unaffected by hydrodynamic shear stress eventually floating up nevertheless floatation of the anammox granules could be effectively prevented by adjusting the liquid velocity to maintain a shear rate of more than 0 778 s 1 in a uasb reactor with about 280 mg l 1 nh4 n or no2 n at 35 1 c chen et al 2014 in other words properly increasing the threshold value of τc or g by adjusting the hydrodynamic shear forces e g the ufv can effectively prevent excessively large granules with a high τc or g from forming and floating up therefore further studies are required to accurately identify this threshold value of τc or g of anammox granules under different reactor operating conditions to better guide the design and operation of anammox granule sludge reactors 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration on anammox granule activity rheological intensity and size evolution and analyzed the biochemical characteristics of anammox biomass in a granular egsb the following conclusions can be drawn from this study candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus in the studied egsb and its relative abundance was maintained at 57 0 and 27 8 at 13 c and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 respectively this contributed to achievement of a high nlr 1 0 kg n m 3 d 1 of the anammox egsb reactor at low temperature and influent substrate concentration anammox granules had excellent mechanical intensity the lowest τc value 8 64 kpa of anammox granules at 20 c with 50 mg nh4 n l 1 in influent was still much higher than that of the aerobic granules 950 pa both the saa and τc or g of the anammox granules decreased with decreasing temperature and influent substrate concentration with the lowest values occurring at 13 c or in the 50 mg nh4 n l 1 influent phases additionally the exponential dependence of τc and g on the saa of anammox granules was elucidated granule size decreased significantly at low temperature 13 c and low influent substrate concentration 50 mg nh4 n l 1 despite slight variations in τc or g values a threshold value of τc or g that was closely related to the hydrodynamic shear force was identified for the studied anammox granules 10 13 15 63 kpa declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18651,due to the climate change and human activity the frequency and intensity of algal blooms have increased significantly recent studies have shown that during the bloom event evaluated levels of cyanobacteria could infiltrate the drinking water treatment process and emerge in the filtered and disinfected water thus threatening the safety of the drinking water supply among these concerned cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most commonly detected species that cause algal bloom in a fresh water body the present work was designed to investigate the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in a packed column to resolve the mechanisms that drive the transport behaviour of microcystis under various operational conditions the results showed that lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa could effectively break through the packed column regardless of ionic strength media size or flow rate as well as the presence of dissolved organic matter in the water under the conditions investigated such behaviour significantly contradicts those of fluorescent microspheres which are commonly considered as ideal colloids in addition the combined impacts of pre oxidation technologies and filtration on microcystis aeruginosa removal were tested systematically it was found that even the cells have been lysed oxidized no significant improvement of cell removals were observed in packed column this paper provides a significant and comprehensive record of transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media the results found herein suggest that in addition to the effort preventing toxin release exposure during bloom events in source water engineers and researchers should also pay attention to the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa and other algal cells in filters to minimize the risk of breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells in the drinking water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords filtration microcystis ionic strength oxidation breakthrough water treatment 1 introduction global climate change and extensive nutrient loads caused by human activity have been regarded as the main reasons for enhanced frequency and intensity of the algal blooms across different continents chapra et al 2017 ndlela et al 2016 during and after the bloom events toxins which are released from toxin producers in water such as i e anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and pseudanabaena can seriously jeopardize human health causing ailments such as liver damage neurotoxic effects gastroenteritis cytotoxicity hepatotoxicity and neurotoxic effects etc preece et al 2017 zurawell et al 2005 janssen 2019 among those fatal toxins the mc lrs that produced from anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and pseudanabaena etc have been regarded as one of the most common toxins grabow et al 1982 qu et al 2018 and microcystis is the most common cyanobacteria blooms species that been detected in freshwater ecosystems globally merel et al 2013 shi et al 2016 guan et al 2018 rigorous regulations imposed by regulatory authorities around the world have been implemented to protect human health the world health organization who suggested that the maximum accepted concentration mac of mc lr for drinking water supply should be lower than 1 5 μg l who 2011 merel et al 2013 other than mac of toxin two warning levels of algae cells for effective management of drinking water treatment process entitled alert level 1 and 2 2000 and 100 000 cells ml were proposed respectively chorus and bartram 1999 who 2011 the chinese ministry of ecology and environments implemented a more restrictive maximum accepted concentration of toxin at 1 μg l for water supply jin et al 2006 other countries have also introduced a supplementary action level of cell concentration for water intake of drinking water facilities dwf aiming to provide practical guides for effective management i e 10 000 and 20 000 cells ml for quebec canada zamyadi et al 2012a in addition to the health concern the presence of toxic cyanobacteria could cause operational challenges for dwf including taste and odour outbreak shorter filter runtime higher frequency of backwashing reduced qualified finished water increased chemical dosage for coagulation and more sludge for sedimentation etc jia et al 2018 qi et al 2018 choo et al 2019 in response to the potential outbreak of toxin as well these operational challenges various treatment processes have been introduced including enhanced coagulation flocculation dissolved air flotation ozonation chlorination chloramination uv radiation adsorption and membrane processes naceradska et al 2017 chang et al 2018 cong et al 2018 for example coagulation flocculation and sedimentation could remove up to 95 of cyanobacteria but they are sensitive to water quality and chemical dosing protocol pivokonsky et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2016 different pre and post oxidation process including uv ozone chlorine potassium permanganate and chlorine dioxide are often used to oxidize the cell such advanced processes however might result cell lysing additional toxin release disinfection byproducts formation owing to the extensive usage of oxidants that react with doc and other materials in the water intake ma et al 2014 rositano et al 2001 zamyadi et al 2015 qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 among the different available technologies the filtration system is still one the most efficient and cost effective engineering technique removing the algae cells from the water intake without introducing additional toxin release janssen 2019 thus strategies ensuring effective filtration performance are one of the most practical and executable solutions for drinking water treatment facilities to eliminate the risk of toxin outbreak and ensure safe water supply integrated with coagulation and sedimentation it was generally believed that algal cells could be effectively removed after filtration zamyadi et al 2012a however several recent full scale investigations have shown that the algal cells could breakthrough filters resulting the formation of scrum over filters and clarifiers during the bloom events ndlela et al 2016 pazouki et al 2016 the penetrated cells could accumulate within the sludge bed of clarifiers and filters and even present in finished water which might introduce additional risk of toxin release after disinfection zamyadi et al evaluated the performance of cyanobacteria removal by different water treatment processes and found that during the bloom events extensive cyanobacteria species accumulated within the filter and interrupted facility operations zamyadi et al 2013a the performance of removal was species dependent that some species aphanizomenon could pass though the filter but others might not microcystis anabaena and pseudanabaena zamyadi et al also observed that cells counts were elevated in the finished water 4 7 106 cells ml and a concerned total level of microcystin concentration of 2 47 μg l was detected in the chlorinated water zamyadi et al 2016 among those toxins up to 82 were provided from microcystis almuhtaram et al studied the removal of microcystis and taste odour compounds at full scale treatment facility in china and found elevated cells counts and toxin levels after filtration and disinfection as well almuhtaram et al 2018 pazouki et al studied the removal of cyanobacteria in well water using bank filtration during the bloom events and found that cyanobacterial species could breakthrough the bank filtration pazouki et al 2016 the detected species were most closely related to species found in the nearby lake during the bloom events harvey et al conducted field scale

water jin et al 2017 zhong et al 2017 donath et al 2019 up to date comprehensive studies that elucidates the impacts of the operational conditions on algal cell removal including flow rate ionic strength and pre treatment process with a focus on the syngeneic relationship of these factors were still limited the majority of reported work were pilot or full scale observations during the bloom events which had limited insights of the driving mechanisms that governing the transport behaviour of microcystis or other algal species in packed media thus the confounding factors that are commonly encountered in the full scale tests were not easily decoupled preventing thorough understanding of fundamental mechanisms large number of studies focused on the investigation of understanding the transport behaviour of toxin or chlorophyll in the dwf other than the cells zamyadi et al 2013a 2013b pazouki et al 2016 alternatively surrogates with similar size and morphology i e fluorescent microsphere spores were used to conduct experiments to speculate the driving mechanisms and calculated the dlvo interaction under the framework of classic filtration theory cft to qualitatively explain the transport behaviour tong et al 2012 shen et al 2015 it must be noted that although dlvo theory and investigation using surrogates achieved great success in evaluating the performance of filtration the transport behaviour of microcystis and other concerned algae could not be quantified or predicted owing to their unique surface structures yet the overall objective of this work is to study the fate and transport of the most common cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa using bench scale column test in particular focusing on the transport mechanisms that drive the behaviour of microcystis under various operational conditions the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in packed filters under different flow rates 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 ml min media sizes media a 710 850 μm and media b 355 425 μm at different ionic strength conditions 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl 2 compare the transport behaviour of carboxylated fluorescent dyed microspheres whose size and shape are similar to studied microcystis aeruginosa 3 study the impacts of nutrient residual and oxidation process on removal performance that could be encountered in realistic treatment process 4 elucidate the mechanisms that drive interfere with the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media this paper provide a significant and comprehensive record of deposition behaviour of microcystis under various operational conditions but also insight into the mechanisms governing the fate of studied microcystis in packed columns this study also demonstrates the behavioral difference between microcystis and commonly used surrogate microsphere and identifies the future research need for minimizing the risk of breakthrough of cyanobacterial cells in drinking water treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcystis aeruginosa and colloidal particles the inoculum of microcystis aeruginosa pcc7806 was obtained from tianjin university china and cultivated at 25 c in an axenic bg11 medium illumination intensity was 2000 lux with a light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h microcystis aeruginosa were grown to the exponential phase and then used for filtration experiments since 680 nm is the maximal absorbance band of microcystis aeruginosa cell suspensions zamyadi et al 2016 the cell concentration was measured by a spectrophotometer uv 765 shanghai science instrument company limited china at this wavelength the concentration of algae used for column test in this study was about 2 107 cells ml polystyrene microsphere 4 5 μm in diameter fluoresbrite yg microspheres polysciences inc warrington pa was selected for the column experiments the stock suspension of 4 5 μm microspheres contained 4 55 108 particles ml prior to seeding the microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa into the filtration column stock suspensions were diluted to achieve influent concentrations c0 of 2 0 106 particles ml with ph of 7 0 8 0 which is close to the concentration during algal blooms almuhtaram et al 2018 the microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa cells were suspended in 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl suspension thereby creating unfavorable and favourable conditions for deposition the colloid suspensions were sonicated in a water bath before and during the experiment to prevent aggregation this was confirmed using epifluorescence microscopy before and after the experiments all the suspensions were prepared at room temperature 22 23 c without addition of surfactant 2 2 granular porous media two sizes of glass beads class v mo sci corporation rolla mo were used as model collectors the beads were size fractioned with nylon sieves u s standard size of 20 25 and 40 45 and had diameters of 0 707 0 841 mm medium a and 0 354 0 420 mm medium b the bulk density of the glass beads is around 2 5 g cm3 and the surface were relatively smooth under the examination of microscopy in the present study mono size glass beads were used aiming to exclude confounding impacts that could interfere the retention behaviour including uniformity chemical heterogeneity surface roughness and hydrophobicity etc thus d 10 d 60 and uniform coefficient were not measured and used to characterize the media herein which is consistent to large numbers of publications kim et al 2008 logan et al 2001 shellenberger and logan 2002 theses selected media were thoroughly rinsed before and after each experiments rigorous data quality experiments were conducted to verify the reproducibility using the media section 3 2 2 3 characterisation of colloidal particles and collectors microelectrophoresis zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk was used to characterize the electrokinetic properties of the polystyrene microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa cells in the background electrolyte solution 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl respectively the electrophoretic mobility was measured in triplicate at 22 1 c using particle suspensions of 2 0 106 for 4 5 μm particles ml and 2 0 106 for microcystis aeruginosa cells ml ph value 2 0 11 0 respectively zeta potentials were calculated from the measured electrophoretic motilities using smoluchowski s equation as below 1 v e o ε ε 0 μ ξ e z where ez is the applied electric field strength v eo average velocity of an electro osmotic flow μ is the viscosity of the fluid and ε and ε 0 are the relative dielectric constant and electrical permittivity in vacuum and ξ is the zeta potential hunter 2013 sze et al 2003 column test using microsphere under same operational conditions were conducted for microsphere for comparison the ph for microcystis and microsphere for the column tests were ranged from 8 5 to 9 2 without adding surfactants this is because microsphere has been commonly used as ideal surrogate for waterborne microorganisms and natural contaminates to explore the transport mechanisms in porous media quantitative comparison between the two could facilitate the mechanistic investigation for microcystis aeruginosa cleaned glass beads were wet packed at a bed depth of 3 cm within the column for testing it was rinsed extensively with di water and then equilibrated with desired background electrolyte solution detailed procedures for preparation and measurements protocols can be found in previous work jin et al 2015b 2 4 pre oxidation process commonly used pre oxidation processes including using o3 h2o2 bourgin et al 2017 uv nh2cl chuang et al 2017 uv naclo zhang et al 2018 uv h2o2 zhang et al 2015 and electrocatalysis feng and li 2003 in water treatment process have been used herein to mimic the realistic situation prior to each experiment the cultured suspension of microcystis aeruginosa was first concentrated 8000 rpm 5min and then rinse with di water three times stock solution was diluted to desired concentration 2 106 cells ml with a 2 mm pbs buffer solution at ph of 7 3 0 1 uv related experiments were completed in a 100 ml magnetically stirred cylindrical quartz reactor with a 4 w low pressure uv lamp philips co netherlands at wavelength of 254 nm the concentrations for naclo and h2o2 were set as 0 3 mm for these tests bourgin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the chloramine was prepared using sodium hypochlorite 0 3 mm and ammonium chloride 0 6 mm in di water and adjust the ph at 8 with 0 3 mm of sodium hydroxide commercial available dsa anode ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode and ti cathode with a separation distance of 10 mm between two electrode plates were used after 10 min of applying 8 volts of dc 3 mm of na2so4 solution was added into the suspension feng and li 2003 2 5 packed column tests lab scale column tests were carried out by injecting the colloidal particle suspensions using a peristaltic pump bt 100 leifu china through an adjustable height glass chromatography column c16 20 tongxing china with an inner diameter of 1 6 cm the prepared suspensions were fed into the columns at flow rates of 1 2 5 and 5 ml min which corresponding to the superficial velocity of 0 3 0 75 and 1 5 m h respectively the column was vibrated during packing while the glass beads were wet packed to a height of 15 0 0 1 cm in order to maximize compaction and minimize air entrapment the porosities of the packed media measured via using a standard gravimetric method were 0 38 and 0 36 for medium a and b respectively 30 pore volumes of particle free suspension were pumped through the packed bed at a constant loading rate to mature the system the condition tested in this work were consistent to majority of column tests reported in the literature bradford et al 2017 jin et al 2017 kim et al 2008 yang et al 2016 the ratio between column and particle diameter were carefully calculated 3200 1 for this study no significant wall effect should exist thus can be used to effectively evaluate the deposition of concerned microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres in porous media bradford et al 2007 he et al 2018 jin et al 2015b kau and lawler 1995 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 after the column was stable and saturated 6 pore volumes of the prepared suspension with microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres at the desired electrolyte solution were feed into the column after the seeding period another 6 pore volumes of particle free suspension were pumped through the column 30 effluent samples were collected for quantification using the uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 680 nm and 280 nm for microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres where the mass balance were checked manually similar methods were also used by other researchers to quantify the concentration of m aeruginosa and other algae cells in water jin et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013b rigorous qa qc tests with good regression coefficient for the calibration curves measuring the microcystis aeruginosa concentration were conducted in the present work figure s 1 calibration curves were also conducted for individual experiment through the study initial concentration were always manually quantified three times per experiments to make sure the initial concentration per experiments were similar to each other tables s 1 2 6 calculation of extended dlvo interaction energy figure s 2 is the schematic of particle approaching surface used for interaction energy calculation the extended dlvo theory which evaluates electric double layer edl and van der waals vdw forces as well as lewis acid base interaction was used to calculate the interaction energies between approaching particles and contact surfaces at different aquatic conditions detailed of calculation can be found in previous work li et al 2019 the approach for calculating retarded vdw particle to surface interaction energy derived for small separation distances can be expressed as 2 u p s v d w a a p 6 h 1 1 14 h λ i f h λ 2 π where h is the surface to surface distance and a is the hamaker constant between particle and surface and λ 0 1 μm is the characteristic

exp κ h 1 exp κ h ψ p 2 ψ s 2 ln 1 exp 2 κ h ψ i and ψ j are the respective zeta potentials and h is the dimensionless surface to surface distance κ is the reciprocal of debye hückel length the lewis acid base interaction could be approximated as 4 δ u h 0 a b δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 h λ where h 0 0 158 nm is the minimum separation distance δ g h 0 a b is the acid base free energy per unit area 2 7 calculation of deposition rate and attachment efficiency for a given physic chemical condition the attachment efficiency in dimensionless form which describes the efficiency of collision between suspended colloid and collector surface can be expressed as 5 α 2 d c 3 1 ε l η 0 ln c c 0 where α is the attachment efficiency ε is the porosity of the medium d c is the collector diameter η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency derived from te equation c c 0 is the normalized effluent concentration at the plateau of breakthrough curves during the initial stage of filtration process and l is the bed depth the corresponding deposition rate coefficient k d s 1 during filtration could be represented as 6 k d 3 2 1 ε d c u α η 0 where u is the darcy velocity jin et al 2015a b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 zeta potential and contact angle the measured zeta potential of studied microcystis aeruginosa and microcystis size microsphere 4 5 μm under different ionic strength as a function of ph are presented in fig 1 it can be seen the impact of ph on both colloids were analogous to each other while the ph of suspension increased from 2 to 11 the measured zeta potential of both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres decreased and then levelled off the is had negative impact on zeta potential of both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres while is increased the zeta potential decreased moving toward a more negative domain while the is of the background suspension was at 100 mm kcl the zeta potential for both were similar to each other ranging from 10 mv to 20 mv as the is decreased the trends for both started to separate is had a more profound influence on the zeta potential for microspheres as compared to microcystis cells while the is was at 1 mm kcl the zeta potential of the microspheres decreased to approximately 100 mv while that of microcystis was approximately 40 mv factors like ph and is could concurrently influence the measured zeta potential for both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres while the ph was low ph 4 the difference in the zeta potential owing to the changes in is were minimized while ph increased the impacts of is on the difference started to increase while the ph reached 11 the difference in the zeta potential due to changes of ionic strength achieved the largest degree however the zeta potential of microspheres was more sensitive to changes in is and ph as compared to microcystis in the aquatic conditions investigated in the present study both particles and filtration media were negatively charged tables s 1 the measurement zeta potential and the contact angles of filtration media for both size were listed in table 1 both particles were in the negative domain which might introduce repulsive energy barrier between approaching colloids to the contact surface according to the cft higher ionic strength could compress the thickness of electric double layer and favoring particle deposition in porous media it should be noted that the tested ph and is were chosen for mechanistic exploration other than representing the environmental relevant scenarios the measured contact angles of both were also significantly different to each other the microcystis aeruginosa were less hydrophobic as compared to microsphere verified by the raman surface spectrophotometer figure s 3 it was found that the raman shift spectrum of microcystis and fluorescent microsphere are different from each other for example the surface of microcystis aeruginosa had three strong peaks around 1004 1156 and 1518 cm 1 whereas the microsphere had one strong peak around 1001 cm 1 only combined with the examination under fluorescent microscopy it was concluded that although the morphology feature i e size shape between the lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres were similar to each other surface chemistry especially the dominant functional groups on the surfaces might be different thus resulting in different retention behaviours in a packed column to further investigate the mechanisms driving the colloids transport behaviours the interaction energy between the microcystis microsphere and media were calculated using the x dlvo theory and is discussed in the latter part of this paper it should be noted that the cultured microcystis aeruginosa cell did not aggregated together under the conditions applied the cells were mostly isolated cells in contrast to the colonized structure during the natural bloom events the present study was designed to quantify the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration after the coagulation and sedimentation it was generally believed that after the coagulation and sedimentation the majority of the colonized cells and contaminates were effectively removed zamyadi et al 2016 cong et al 2018 it can be reasonably assumed that only the microcystis aeruginosa cells that were not aggregated and settled in clarifier could enter into the filters in drinking water facilities such assumptions are reasonable and can echo the experimental observation from field and full scale studies zamyadi et al 2012a zamyadi et al 2013a preece et al 2017 accordingly studies focused on the transport of colonized microcystis aeruginosa or filamentous structures anabaena sp aphanizomenon or synechococcus is not the main objective of current wosssrk and will be explored in the subsequent work 3 2 deposition rate and reproducibility to quantify the deposition behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media bench scale column tests were conducted the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 and mass retained profiles within the column were used to calculate the deposition rates figure s 4 is the representative breakthrough curve during the seeding and washing process jin et al 2015b 2017 triplicated experiments using microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere were conducted prior to this study good reproducibility as well as mass recovery of these was achieved tables s 1 documents all the experimental results in this work including mass recovery normalized concentration determined deposition rate and attachment efficiency it should be noted that all the conducted experiments achieved good mass recovery ranging from 76 to 105 the observation obtained from the measurement concentrations of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere can be reasonably matched and confirmed by the mass profile within the column these rigorous efforts have been completed to ensure the quality of the results discovered in this work these above mentioned results suggest that the operational conditions measurement protocols and standard curves for concentration determination were all valid and effective thus they can be used to quantify their transport and retention behaviours in packed column in addition experiments conducted in this study mostly exhibited a flat plateau after the feeding period such results suggest that no significant dual deposition detachment or re attachment occurs in the packed column under the condition investigated accordingly the results from this work could be used to mimic the conditions under initial deposition conditions during the clean bed period to better visualize the transport behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere k d as well as attachment efficiency α were used for comparison in the latter part of this work 3 3 impact of ionic strength fig 2 systematically describes the impacts of is on the deposition of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere in response to different operational conditions the deposition behaviors were significantly different between microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres although the two have similar morphology features i e shape size according to classic filtration theory is should have a positive impact on deposition pattern for both while the is increased the deposition rate k d should be increased it was found that the deposition behaviour of microsphere was sensitive to the changes of is whereas the changes of is could barely influence the retention of microcystis aeruginosa in addition the increase of k d in response to the changes of is were quite different while the is increased from 1 to 100 mm on media b under flow rate of 5 ml min the k d of microcystis aeruginosa did not increase significantly whereas k d for microsphere increased 52 times it should be noted that although the mean values of deposition rates of microcystis aeruginosa from triplicates increased in response to the changes of is the absolute increments of k d were indeed small without statistical significance using the current method 1 for c c 0 results under higher flow rate were more sensitive to the changes of is under the flow rate of 1 0 ml min the deposition rates for both were increased 200 while is increased from 1 to 100 mm kcl similar trends were observed for microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere under different operational conditions the detailed increase of deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere for media a and media b can be found in figure s 5 the mass balance results as well as the mass retained profile support the same conclusions tables s 1 coupled with flow rate and media size is could interfere the retention behaviour in a positive way that higher the is larger the deposition rates accordingly the results under lowest and highest is conditions 1 and 100 mm kcl delimit the lower and upper boundaries of deposition rates for both no apparent non monotonic relationship due to the changes of is were observed these observations are in good agreement of classic filtration theory qualitatively fig 3 describes the calculated interaction energy for both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres in response to the changes in is the interaction energy profiles for both are similar to each other while the is increased from unfavorable to favourable condition the height of energy barriers decreased significantly and the distance of the energy barrier were pushed closer to the contact surface fig 3 under favourable condition 100 mm kcl the interaction energy between microsphere and media are more attractive than those of microcystis aeruginosa according to x dlvo theory the increased ionic strength could result in greater deposition of studied colloids in porous media the microcystis aeruginosa should experience more repulsive force resulting in less retention in the packed column higher the ionic strength the thinner κ 1 and the less repulsive interaction should be thus more deposition however experimental results did not match the prediction from x dlvo theory and shown that microcystis aeruginosa could breakthrough the filtration system regardless of the changes of is such experimental observation somehow represent the breakthrough behaviour of algae cell at full scale dwf pazouki et al 2016 zamyadi et al 2012a it can be speculated that under the condition investigated herein interfacial forces driven by only vdw electric double layer and lewis acid base forces might not be the dominant mechanisms other driving forces from chemical heterogeneity hydrophobicity hydration forces might play a more important role alternatively deposition within secondary minima surface rolling and a shear lift force that could retain cells in a dynamic manner should be considered more closely on the other side deposition results of microspheres qualitatively match the trend from the calculated interaction energy in response to the changes in is which are in good agreement with previously published works johnson et al 2018 jin et al 2017 3 4 impact of media size and flow rate on deposition fig 4 describes the impact of media size and flow rate on the deposition rates and attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres respectively it is widely believed that smaller media at higher flow rates favour the deposition of colloids in porous media jin et al 2015b under the same operational conditions the deposition rate k d s 1 of both particles on media b are consistently higher than those for media a fig 4 higher flow rates resulted in more consistent deposition owing to the increased flux introduced by enhanced hydrodynamics the deposition rates of the microspheres were more sensitive to the changes in media size as compared to those of microcystis aeruginosa fig 4 the determined deposition rate of microspheres changed from 0 002 to 0 045 s 1 the largest increases of k d in response to media size were achieved on media b under a flow rate of 5 0 ml min in contrast the deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa did not fluctuate with the changes in media size and flow rate extensively the majority of which only ranged from 7 10 5 to 8 10 4 s 1 the attachment efficiencies of all microcystis aeruginosa fig 4 c were under 0 15 the media size flow rate and ionic strength concurrently impacted the α the highest attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa was achieved under a higher flow rate at high is on bigger media media a 5 ml min 100 mm kcl and the smallest one was achieved on smaller media but lower flow rate at unfavorable condition media b 1 0 ml min 1 mm kcl the attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa under 1 mm conditions consistently reached the lowest levels while ionic strength increased α increased interestingly the values of α microcystis aeruginosa of under 1 mm conditions were similar to each other regardless of media size and flow rate in contrast the attachment efficiency for microspheres fig 4 d under different operational conditions were relatively similar to each other the ionic strength had a positive impact on α such that the higher is the larger the α was other than a few results under 100 mm kcl conditions the majority of the calculated attachment efficiency for microspheres were close to unity which is in good agreement with the prediction from x dlvo theory and other previously published work johnson et al 2018 there was no strong systematic trend of α owing to the changes in media size and flow rate for microsphere the behaviour of the attachment efficacy for microspheres was in good agreement with cft whereas that for microcystis aeruginosa was not such results suggested that current knowledge could reasonably explain the mechanisms governing the transport of an idealized surrogate of waterborne microorganisms but not microcystis aeruginosa other mechanisms such as chemical heterogeneity rasmuson et al 2017 hydrophobicity rijnaarts et al 1996 roughness jin et al 2015a 2015b eps tong et al 2010 and hydration elimelech and o melia 1990 should be considered to better describe the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media 3 5 impact of background suspension the above mentioned transport and retention pattern of microcystis aeruginosa demonstrate that the lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa could breakthrough packed column irrespective of operational conditions media size ionic strength flow rate such results were different than the microspheres and cannot be well explained by x dlvo theory it was found that the total organic carbon toc level of nutrient residual from cell culture could reach up to 63 4 1 5 mg l in the diluted suspension therefore it was hypothesized that the residual chemical from the microcystis aeruginosa culture might alter the surface chemistry of cell and thus interfere with the governing mechanisms of transport and retention under the condition applied to further decouple the impacts of background suspension the microcystis aeruginosa cell were separated from the background nutrient suspension using 0 45 μm membrane filtration and then feed through the columns separately the same nutrient residual were also mixed with microsphere to conduct additional column tests under 1 and 100 mm kcl conditions for both media a and b fig 5 shows that the presence of the nutrient residual has no significant impacts on the retention of microcystis aeruginosa in packed column regardless of media size or ionic strength the determined attachment efficiency for all conditions were relatively low 0 15 suggesting that the driving mechanisms that govern the retention of microcystis aeruginosa are more likely determined by the surface of the cells rather than the characteristics of filtration media or aquatic suspension in contrast the presence of a nutrient residual could interfere with the retention behaviour of microspheres significantly under favourable conditions 100 mm kcl but had limited influence under unfavourable conditions 1 mm this is because while the negatively charged nutrient residual was added into favourable suspension the interfacial forces between microspheres and media became more negative resulting in decreased removal in contrast under unfavourable conditions the repulsive forces between the approaching particle and media were already strong and cannot be enhanced it is noted that the attachment efficiency after adding the nutrient residual under favourable conditions was almost identical to that under 1 mm kcl conditions which indirectly verifies the above mentioned mechanisms such behaviour is in good agreement with the most reported studies regarding the impact of nom in the water for contaminant transport in porous media yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 3 6 impacts of pre oxidation in drinking water treatment facilities oxidation technologies such as uv ozone or naclo were commonly used as pre treatment to destabilize the cell and oxidize the chemical and waterborne microorganisms for better removal rice et al 1981 it was generally believed that changing the cell s chemical and physical integrity i e rougher surface should result in enhanced removal because of the reduced repulsive force and increased favourable sites for deposition due to irregularly of morphology and chemical composition jin et al 2016 johnson et al 2018 in this section aiming to investigate combined effectiveness of oxidation and filtration on the cell retention different oxidation processes have been used to react with microcystis aeruginosa first and then the cells were feed though packed column such experiments could mimic the realistic operational conditions that was experienced in drinking water treatment plants conditions that achieved the highest deposition rates 5 0 ml min for media b at is of 1 mm kcl were selected for testing herein before and after naclo oxidation process the images of microcystis aeruginosa were recorded figure s 6 treatment from naclo could lysis the cell and significantly changed the morphology of microcystis aeruginosa i e rougher surface the figure s 7 also shown that with the increase of contact time under 10 mg l naclo fluorescent fl3 fl4 area of microcystis aeruginosa were changed indicating that the cells have been successfully deactivated fig 6 documents the deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa after different advanced oxidation processes and compared to no treatment results as negative control surprisingly all the deposition rates after oxidation treatments were small and similar to each other 0 0002 0 0005 s 1 the performance under uv 0 3 mm chloramines were slightly lower than other conditions different concentrations of reagent ranging from 0 0013 to 0 134 mm of naclo were also tested no significant improvement was observed as well figure s 8 to verify these results and decouple the potential confounding impacts caused by oxidation on the detection method all these results were also examined manually these above mentioned results suggest that although the pre treatment process could effectively deactivate the microcystis aeruginosa but those deactivated cells could still breakthrough packed column regardless of operational conditions combining the results above it is suggested that if one aimed to enhance the removal of microcystis aeruginosa efforts should be made to aggregate the cells effectively and then remove from the water prior to filtration and disinfection morphology changes introduced by pre oxidation might have a limited impact on the removal enhancement in filtration 4 conclusions for the first time this work comprehensively investigated the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa in a packed column which is representative algal mostly detected in fresh water during bloom events as a surrogate of waterborne microorganisms microspheres which have similar size and morphology features to the cultured cells were used for theoretical exploration different flow rates 1 0 and 5 0 ml min media sizes media a and b ionic strengths 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl were selected as representative operational conditions for testing the impact of nutrient residual used to culture microcystis aeruginosa and different oxidation processes including uv chloramines o3 h2o2 uv naclo uv h2o2 electrocatalysis were tested systemically we found that the studied microcystis aeruginosa could effectively breakthrough the packed column regardless of operational conditions the attachment efficiencies of microcystis aeruginosa were consistently lower than 0 15 and not sensitive to the changes of ionic strength the oxidation process could effective deactivate the microcystis aeruginosa and alter the surface characteristics however such changes did not improve the removal of microcystis aeruginosa in the packed column these observations cannot be explained by existing x dlvo theory and contradict the transport and retention behaviour of most studied microorganisms johnson et al 2018 li et al 2019 the experiment conducted here was aimed at simulating the transport and retention behaviours of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration the lab cultured cells used herein were mostly isolated cells rather than aggregated or colonized cells as presented during the realistic bloom events different morphology characteristics might have an impact on the performance of retention in filtration it should be noted that even during the bloom event there are still significant portion of cells that were isolated or grouped in small units researchers have even noticed that the filamentous cell of aphanizomenon and anabaena could break through the filtration and be identified in the chlorinated water at levels above who alert level 1 the results found herein suggest that in addition to the effort of preventing toxin release during bloom events in the drinking water supply engineers and researchers should also pay attention to the breakthrough of microcystis aeruginosa and other algal cells such breakthrough results not only indicated elevated effluent turbidity 0 4 ntu and doc of chlorinated water but also introduced taste and odour components as the major distribution issues kommineni et al 2009 it is also possible to generate additional toxin after the disinfection process and release into the finished water thus jeopardizing the safety of the finished water while they migrate to the water tank or other storage places it is also possible to trigger local algal blooms or cell over growth thus it is critical and necessary to further elucidate the transport and retention mechanisms of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration to minimize the risk of toxic algal exposure to human being in addition early warning monitoring systems that could identify and quantify the species and numbers of bloom algal cells might be necessary for the wtp to better manage their facilities and implement effective engineering solutions to encounter the operational challenging zamyadi et al 2012a the following conclusions can be reached 1 microcystis aeruginosa could break through the packed column regardless of operational conditions this work represented the first systematic demonstration of this phenomena which could reasonably explain the breakthrough of algal cells in full scale observations in drinking water treatment plants driving mechanisms that govern the retention of microcystis aeruginosa are more likely from the surface of cells rather than media properties and aquatic suspension 2 microspheres might not be a good surrogate to study the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa the transport and retention behaviour of microspheres were sensitive to the changes in ionic strength flow rate media size and presence of nutrient residual the changes due to the presence of nutrient residual had a more pronounced impact under high ionic strength conditions but a relatively small influence at low ionic strength 3 x dlvo theory could qualitatively explain the transport behaviour of microspheres but was not suitable to interpret the retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa mechanisms that drive the breakthrough of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration should be further investigated 4 efforts should be made to closely monitor the transport of algal cells and effectively aggregate the cells and then remove them prior to filtration and disinfection within drinking water treatment facilities notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments we acknowledge the

18651,due to the climate change and human activity the frequency and intensity of algal blooms have increased significantly recent studies have shown that during the bloom event evaluated levels of cyanobacteria could infiltrate the drinking water treatment process and emerge in the filtered and disinfected water thus threatening the safety of the drinking water supply among these concerned cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most commonly detected species that cause algal bloom in a fresh water body the present work was designed to investigate the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in a packed column to resolve the mechanisms that drive the transport behaviour of microcystis under various operational conditions the results showed that lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa could effectively break through the packed column regardless of ionic strength media size or flow rate as well as the presence of dissolved organic matter in the water under the conditions investigated such behaviour significantly contradicts those of fluorescent microspheres which are commonly considered as ideal colloids in addition the combined impacts of pre oxidation technologies and filtration on microcystis aeruginosa removal were tested systematically it was found that even the cells have been lysed oxidized no significant improvement of cell removals were observed in packed column this paper provides a significant and comprehensive record of transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media the results found herein suggest that in addition to the effort preventing toxin release exposure during bloom events in source water engineers and researchers should also pay attention to the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa and other algal cells in filters to minimize the risk of breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells in the drinking water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords

2019 in response to the potential outbreak of toxin as well these operational challenges various treatment processes have been introduced including enhanced coagulation flocculation dissolved air flotation ozonation chlorination chloramination uv radiation adsorption and membrane processes naceradska et al 2017 chang et al 2018 cong et al 2018 for example coagulation flocculation and sedimentation could remove up to 95 of cyanobacteria but they are sensitive to water quality and chemical dosing protocol pivokonsky et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2016 different pre and post oxidation process including uv ozone chlorine potassium permanganate and chlorine dioxide are often used to oxidize the cell such advanced processes however might result cell lysing additional toxin release

2016 zhang et al 2017 among the different available technologies the filtration system is still one the most efficient and cost effective engineering technique removing the algae cells from the water intake without introducing additional toxin release janssen 2019 thus strategies ensuring effective filtration performance are one of the most practical and executable solutions for drinking water treatment facilities to eliminate the risk of toxin outbreak and ensure safe water supply integrated with coagulation and sedimentation it was generally believed that algal cells could be effectively removed after filtration zamyadi et al 2012a however several recent full scale investigations have shown that the algal cells could breakthrough filters resulting the formation of scrum over filters and clarifiers during the bloom events ndlela et al 2016 pazouki et al 2016 the penetrated cells could accumulate within the sludge bed of clarifiers and filters and even present in finished water which might introduce additional risk of toxin release after disinfection zamyadi et al evaluated the performance of cyanobacteria removal by different water treatment processes and found that during the bloom events extensive cyanobacteria species accumulated within the filter and interrupted facility operations zamyadi et al 2013a the performance of removal was species dependent that some species aphanizomenon could pass though the filter but others might not microcystis anabaena and pseudanabaena zamyadi et al also observed that cells counts were elevated in the finished water 4 7 106 cells ml and a concerned total level of microcystin concentration of 2 47 μg l was detected in the chlorinated water zamyadi et al 2016 among those toxins up to 82 were provided from microcystis

strength and pre treatment process with a focus on the syngeneic relationship of these factors were still limited the majority of reported work were pilot or full scale observations during the bloom events which had limited insights of the driving mechanisms that governing the transport behaviour of microcystis or other algal species in packed media thus the confounding factors that are commonly encountered in the full scale tests were not easily decoupled preventing thorough understanding of fundamental mechanisms large number of studies focused on the investigation of understanding the transport behaviour of toxin or chlorophyll in the dwf other than the cells zamyadi et al 2013a 2013b pazouki et al 2016 alternatively surrogates with similar size and morphology i e fluorescent microsphere spores were used to conduct experiments to speculate the driving mechanisms and calculated the dlvo interaction under the framework of classic filtration theory cft to qualitatively explain the transport behaviour tong et al 2012 shen et al 2015 it must be noted that although dlvo theory and investigation using surrogates achieved great success in evaluating the performance of filtration the transport behaviour of microcystis and other concerned algae could not be quantified or predicted owing to their unique surface structures yet the overall objective of this work is to study the fate and transport of the most common cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa using bench scale column test in particular focusing on the transport mechanisms that drive the behaviour of microcystis under various operational conditions the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in packed filters under

the risk of breakthrough of cyanobacterial cells in drinking water treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcystis aeruginosa and colloidal particles the inoculum of microcystis aeruginosa pcc7806 was obtained from tianjin university china and cultivated at 25 c in an axenic bg11 medium illumination intensity was 2000 lux with a light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h microcystis aeruginosa were grown to the exponential phase and then used for filtration experiments since 680 nm is the maximal absorbance band of microcystis aeruginosa cell suspensions zamyadi et al 2016 the cell concentration was measured by a spectrophotometer uv 765 shanghai science instrument company limited china at this wavelength the concentration of algae used for column test in this study was about 2 107 cells ml polystyrene microsphere 4 5 μm in diameter fluoresbrite yg microspheres polysciences inc warrington pa was selected for the column experiments the stock suspension of 4 5 μm microspheres contained 4 55 108 particles ml prior to seeding the microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa into the filtration column stock suspensions were diluted to achieve influent concentrations c0 of 2 0 106 particles ml with ph of 7 0 8 0 which is close to the concentration during algal blooms almuhtaram et al 2018 the microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa cells were suspended in 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl suspension thereby creating unfavorable and favourable conditions for deposition the colloid suspensions were sonicated in a water bath before and during the experiment to prevent aggregation this was confirmed using epifluorescence microscopy before and after the experiments all the suspensions were prepared at room temperature 22 23 c without addition of surfactant 2 2 granular porous media two sizes of glass beads class v mo sci corporation rolla mo were used as model collectors the beads were size fractioned with nylon sieves u s standard size of 20 25 and 40 45 and had diameters of 0 707 0 841 mm medium a and 0 354 0 420 mm medium b the bulk density of the glass beads is around 2 5 g cm3 and the surface were relatively smooth under the examination of microscopy in the present study mono size glass beads were used aiming to exclude confounding impacts that could interfere the retention behaviour including uniformity chemical heterogeneity surface roughness and hydrophobicity etc thus d 10 d 60 and uniform coefficient were not measured and used to characterize the media herein which is consistent to large numbers of publications kim et al 2008 logan et al 2001 shellenberger and logan 2002 theses selected media were thoroughly rinsed before and after each experiments rigorous data quality experiments were conducted to verify the reproducibility using the media section 3 2 2 3 characterisation of colloidal particles and collectors microelectrophoresis zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk was used to characterize the electrokinetic properties of the polystyrene microspheres and microcystis aeruginosa cells in the background electrolyte solution 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl respectively the electrophoretic mobility was measured in triplicate at 22 1 c using particle suspensions of 2 0 106 for 4 5 μm particles ml and 2 0 106 for microcystis aeruginosa cells ml ph value 2 0 11 0 respectively zeta potentials were calculated from the measured electrophoretic motilities using smoluchowski s equation as below 1 v e o ε ε 0 μ ξ e z where ez is the applied electric field strength v eo average velocity of an electro osmotic flow μ is the viscosity of the fluid and ε and ε 0 are the relative dielectric constant and electrical permittivity in vacuum and ξ is the zeta potential hunter 2013 sze et al 2003 column test using microsphere under same operational conditions were conducted for microsphere for comparison the ph for microcystis and microsphere for the column tests were ranged from 8 5 to 9 2 without adding surfactants this is because microsphere has been commonly used as ideal surrogate for waterborne microorganisms and natural contaminates to explore the transport mechanisms in porous media quantitative comparison between the two could facilitate the mechanistic investigation for microcystis aeruginosa cleaned glass beads were wet packed at a bed depth of 3 cm within the column for testing it was rinsed extensively with di water and then equilibrated with desired background electrolyte solution detailed procedures for preparation and measurements protocols can be found in previous work jin et al 2015b 2 4 pre oxidation process commonly used pre oxidation processes including using o3 h2o2 bourgin et al 2017 uv nh2cl chuang et al 2017 uv naclo zhang et al 2018 uv h2o2 zhang et al 2015 and electrocatalysis feng and li 2003 in water treatment process have been used herein to mimic the realistic situation prior to each experiment the cultured suspension of microcystis aeruginosa was first concentrated 8000 rpm 5min and then rinse with di water three times stock solution was diluted to desired concentration 2 106 cells ml with a 2 mm pbs buffer solution at ph of 7 3 0 1 uv related experiments were completed in a 100 ml magnetically stirred cylindrical quartz reactor with a 4 w low pressure uv lamp philips co netherlands at wavelength of 254 nm the concentrations for naclo and h2o2 were set as 0 3 mm for these tests bourgin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the chloramine was prepared using sodium hypochlorite 0 3 mm and ammonium chloride 0 6 mm in di water and adjust the ph at 8 with 0 3 mm of sodium hydroxide commercial available dsa anode ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode and ti cathode with a separation distance of 10 mm between two electrode plates were used after 10 min of applying 8 volts of dc 3 mm of na2so4 solution was added into the suspension feng and li 2003 2 5 packed column tests lab scale column tests were carried out by injecting the colloidal particle suspensions using a peristaltic pump bt 100 leifu china through an adjustable height glass chromatography column c16 20 tongxing china with an inner diameter of 1 6 cm the prepared suspensions were fed into the columns at flow rates of 1 2 5 and 5 ml min which corresponding to the superficial velocity of 0 3 0 75 and 1 5 m h respectively the column was vibrated during packing while the glass beads were wet packed to a height of 15 0 0 1 cm in order to maximize compaction and minimize air entrapment the porosities of the packed media measured via using a standard gravimetric method were 0 38 and 0 36 for medium a and b respectively 30 pore volumes of particle free suspension were pumped through the packed bed at a constant loading rate to mature the system the condition tested in this work were consistent to majority of column tests reported in the literature bradford et al 2017 jin et al 2017 kim et al 2008 yang et al 2016 the ratio between column and particle diameter were carefully calculated 3200 1 for this study no significant wall effect should exist thus can be used to effectively evaluate the deposition of concerned microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres in porous media bradford et al 2007 he et al 2018 jin et al 2015b kau and lawler 1995 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 after the column was stable and saturated 6 pore volumes of the prepared suspension with microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres at the desired electrolyte solution were feed into the column after the seeding period another 6 pore volumes of particle free suspension were pumped through the column 30 effluent samples were collected for quantification using the uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 680 nm and 280 nm for microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres where the mass balance were checked manually similar methods were also used by other researchers to quantify the concentration of m aeruginosa and other algae cells in water jin et al 2018 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013b rigorous qa qc tests with good regression coefficient for the calibration curves measuring the microcystis aeruginosa concentration were conducted in the present work figure s 1 calibration curves were also conducted for individual experiment through the study initial concentration were always manually quantified three times per experiments to make sure the initial concentration per experiments were similar to each other tables s 1 2 6 calculation of extended dlvo interaction energy figure s 2 is the schematic of particle approaching surface used for interaction energy calculation the extended dlvo theory which evaluates electric double layer edl and van der waals vdw forces as well as lewis acid base interaction was used to calculate the interaction energies between approaching particles and contact surfaces at different aquatic conditions detailed of calculation can be found in previous work li et al 2019 the approach for calculating retarded vdw particle to surface interaction energy derived for small separation distances can be expressed as 2 u p s v d w a a p 6 h 1 1 14 h λ i f h λ 2 π where h is the surface to surface distance and a is the hamaker constant between particle and surface and λ 0 1 μm is the characteristic

exp κ h 1 exp κ h ψ p 2 ψ s 2 ln 1 exp 2 κ h ψ i and ψ j are the respective zeta potentials and h is the dimensionless surface to surface distance κ is the reciprocal of debye hückel length the lewis acid base interaction could be approximated as 4 δ u h 0 a b δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 h λ where h 0 0 158 nm is the minimum separation distance δ g h 0 a b is the acid base free energy per unit area 2 7 calculation of deposition rate and attachment efficiency for a given physic chemical condition the attachment efficiency in dimensionless form which describes the efficiency of collision between suspended colloid and collector surface can be expressed as 5 α 2 d c 3 1 ε l η 0 ln c c 0 where α is the attachment efficiency ε is the porosity of the medium d c is the collector diameter η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency derived from te equation c c 0 is the normalized effluent concentration at the plateau of breakthrough curves during the initial stage of filtration process and l is the bed depth the corresponding deposition rate coefficient k d s 1 during filtration could be represented as 6 k d 3 2 1 ε d c u α η 0 where u is the darcy velocity jin et al 2015a b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 zeta potential and contact angle the measured zeta potential of studied microcystis aeruginosa and microcystis size microsphere 4 5 μm under different ionic strength as a function of ph are presented in fig 1 it can be seen the impact of ph on both colloids were analogous to each other while the ph of suspension increased from 2 to 11 the measured zeta potential of both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres decreased and then levelled off the is had negative impact on zeta potential of both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres while is increased the zeta potential decreased moving toward a more negative domain while the is of the background suspension was at 100 mm kcl the zeta potential for both were similar to each other ranging from 10 mv to 20 mv as the is decreased the trends for both started to separate is had a more profound influence on the zeta potential for microspheres as compared to microcystis cells while the is was at 1 mm kcl the zeta potential of the microspheres decreased to approximately 100 mv while that of microcystis was approximately 40 mv factors like ph and is could concurrently influence the measured zeta potential for both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres while the ph was low ph 4 the difference in the zeta potential owing to the changes in is were minimized while ph increased the impacts of is on the difference started to increase while the ph reached 11 the difference in the zeta potential due to changes of ionic strength achieved the largest degree however the zeta potential of microspheres was more sensitive to changes in is and ph as compared to microcystis in the aquatic conditions investigated in the present study both particles and filtration media were negatively charged tables s 1 the measurement zeta potential and the contact angles of filtration media for both size were listed in table 1 both particles were in the negative domain which might introduce repulsive energy barrier between approaching colloids to the contact surface according to the cft higher ionic strength could compress the thickness of electric double layer and favoring particle deposition in porous media it should be noted that the tested ph and is were chosen for mechanistic exploration other than representing the environmental relevant scenarios the measured contact angles of both were also significantly different to each other the microcystis aeruginosa were less hydrophobic as compared to microsphere verified by the raman surface spectrophotometer figure s 3 it was found that the raman shift spectrum of microcystis and fluorescent microsphere are different from each other for example the surface of microcystis aeruginosa had three strong peaks around 1004 1156 and 1518 cm 1 whereas the microsphere had one strong peak around 1001 cm 1 only combined with the examination under fluorescent microscopy it was concluded that although the morphology feature i e size shape between the lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres were similar to each other surface chemistry especially the dominant functional groups on the surfaces might be different thus resulting in different retention behaviours in a packed column to further investigate the mechanisms driving the colloids transport behaviours the interaction energy between the microcystis microsphere and media were calculated using the x dlvo theory and is discussed in the latter part of this paper it should be noted that the cultured microcystis aeruginosa cell did not aggregated together under the conditions applied the cells were mostly isolated cells in contrast to the colonized structure during the natural bloom events the present study was designed to quantify the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration after the coagulation and sedimentation it was generally believed that after the coagulation and sedimentation the majority of the colonized cells and contaminates were effectively removed zamyadi et al 2016 cong et al 2018 it can be reasonably assumed that only the microcystis aeruginosa cells that were not aggregated and settled in clarifier could enter into the filters in drinking water facilities such assumptions are reasonable and can echo the experimental observation from field and full scale studies zamyadi et al 2012a zamyadi et al 2013a preece et al 2017 accordingly studies focused on the transport of colonized microcystis aeruginosa or filamentous structures anabaena sp aphanizomenon or synechococcus is not the main objective of current wosssrk and will be explored in the subsequent work 3 2 deposition rate and reproducibility to quantify the deposition behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media bench scale column tests were conducted the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 and mass retained profiles within the column were used to calculate the deposition rates figure s 4 is the representative breakthrough curve during the seeding and washing process jin et al 2015b 2017 triplicated experiments using microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere were conducted prior to this study good reproducibility as well as mass recovery of these was achieved tables s 1 documents all the experimental results in this work including mass recovery normalized concentration determined deposition rate and attachment efficiency it should be noted that all the conducted experiments achieved good mass recovery ranging from 76 to 105 the observation obtained from the measurement concentrations of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere can be reasonably matched and confirmed by the mass profile within the column these rigorous efforts have been completed to ensure the quality of the results discovered in this work these above mentioned results suggest that the operational conditions measurement protocols and standard curves for concentration determination were all valid and effective thus they can be used to quantify their transport and retention behaviours in packed column in addition experiments conducted in this study mostly exhibited a flat plateau after the feeding period such results suggest that no significant dual deposition detachment or re attachment occurs in the packed column under the condition investigated accordingly the results from this work could be used to mimic the conditions under initial deposition conditions during the clean bed period to better visualize the transport behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere k d as well as attachment efficiency α were used for comparison in the latter part of this work 3 3 impact of ionic strength fig 2 systematically describes the impacts of is on the deposition of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere in response to different operational conditions the deposition behaviors were significantly different between microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres although the two have similar morphology features i e shape size according to classic filtration theory is should have a positive impact on deposition pattern for both while the is increased the deposition rate k d should be increased it was found that the deposition behaviour of microsphere was sensitive to the changes of is whereas the changes of is could barely influence the retention of microcystis aeruginosa in addition the increase of k d in response to the changes of is were quite different while the is increased from 1 to 100 mm on media b under flow rate of 5 ml min the k d of microcystis aeruginosa did not increase significantly whereas k d for microsphere increased 52 times it should be noted that although the mean values of deposition rates of microcystis aeruginosa from triplicates increased in response to the changes of is the absolute increments of k d were indeed small without statistical significance using the current method 1 for c c 0 results under higher flow rate were more sensitive to the changes of is under the flow rate of 1 0 ml min the deposition rates for both were increased 200 while is increased from 1 to 100 mm kcl similar trends were observed for microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere under different operational conditions the detailed increase of deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa and microsphere for media a and media b can be found in figure s 5 the mass balance results as well as the mass retained profile support the same conclusions tables s 1 coupled with flow rate and media size is could interfere the retention behaviour in a positive way that higher the is larger the deposition rates accordingly the results under lowest and highest is conditions 1 and 100 mm kcl delimit the lower and upper boundaries of deposition rates for both no apparent non monotonic relationship due to the changes of is were observed these observations are in good agreement of classic filtration theory qualitatively fig 3 describes the calculated interaction energy for both microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres in response to the changes in is the interaction energy profiles for both are similar to each other while the is increased from unfavorable to favourable condition the height of energy barriers decreased significantly and the distance of the energy barrier were pushed closer to the contact surface fig 3 under favourable condition 100 mm kcl the interaction energy between microsphere and media are more attractive than those of microcystis aeruginosa according to x dlvo theory the increased ionic strength could result in greater deposition of studied colloids in porous media the microcystis aeruginosa should experience more repulsive force resulting in less retention in the packed column higher the ionic strength the thinner κ 1 and the less repulsive interaction should be thus more deposition however experimental results did not match the prediction from x dlvo theory and shown that microcystis aeruginosa could breakthrough the filtration system regardless of the changes of is such experimental observation somehow represent the breakthrough behaviour of algae cell at full scale dwf pazouki et al 2016 zamyadi et al 2012a it can be speculated that under the condition investigated herein interfacial forces driven by only vdw electric double layer and lewis acid base forces might not be the dominant mechanisms other driving forces from chemical heterogeneity hydrophobicity hydration forces might play a more important role alternatively deposition within secondary minima surface rolling and a shear lift force that could retain cells in a dynamic manner should be considered more closely on the other side deposition results of microspheres qualitatively match the trend from the calculated interaction energy in response to the changes in is which are in good agreement with previously published works johnson et al 2018 jin et al 2017 3 4 impact of media size and flow rate on deposition fig 4 describes the impact of media size and flow rate on the deposition rates and attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa and microspheres respectively it is widely believed that smaller media at higher flow rates favour the deposition of colloids in porous media jin et al 2015b under the same operational conditions the deposition rate k d s 1 of both particles on media b are consistently higher than those for media a fig 4 higher flow rates resulted in more consistent deposition owing to the increased flux introduced by enhanced hydrodynamics the deposition rates of the microspheres were more sensitive to the changes in media size as compared to those of microcystis aeruginosa fig 4 the determined deposition rate of microspheres changed from 0 002 to 0 045 s 1 the largest increases of k d in response to media size were achieved on media b under a flow rate of 5 0 ml min in contrast the deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa did not fluctuate with the changes in media size and flow rate extensively the majority of which only ranged from 7 10 5 to 8 10 4 s 1 the attachment efficiencies of all microcystis aeruginosa fig 4 c were under 0 15 the media size flow rate and ionic strength concurrently impacted the α the highest attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa was achieved under a higher flow rate at high is on bigger media media a 5 ml min 100 mm kcl and the smallest one was achieved on smaller media but lower flow rate at unfavorable condition media b 1 0 ml min 1 mm kcl the attachment efficiency of microcystis aeruginosa under 1 mm conditions consistently reached the lowest levels while ionic strength increased α increased interestingly the values of α microcystis aeruginosa of under 1 mm conditions were similar to each other regardless of media size and flow rate in contrast the attachment efficiency for microspheres fig 4 d under different operational conditions were relatively similar to each other the ionic strength had a positive impact on α such that the higher is the larger the α was other than a few results under 100 mm kcl conditions the majority of the calculated attachment efficiency for microspheres were close to unity which is in good agreement with the prediction from x dlvo theory and other previously published work johnson et al 2018 there was no strong systematic trend of α owing to the changes in media size and flow rate for microsphere the behaviour of the attachment efficacy for microspheres was in good agreement with cft whereas that for microcystis aeruginosa was not such results suggested that current knowledge could reasonably explain the mechanisms governing the transport of an idealized surrogate of waterborne microorganisms but not microcystis aeruginosa other mechanisms such as chemical heterogeneity rasmuson et al 2017 hydrophobicity rijnaarts et al 1996 roughness jin et al 2015a 2015b eps tong et al 2010 and hydration elimelech and o melia 1990 should be considered to better describe the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa in porous media 3 5 impact of background suspension the above mentioned transport and retention pattern of microcystis aeruginosa demonstrate that the lab cultured microcystis aeruginosa could breakthrough packed column irrespective of operational conditions media size ionic strength flow rate such results were different than the microspheres and cannot be well explained by x dlvo theory it was found that the total organic carbon toc level of nutrient residual from cell culture could reach up to 63 4 1 5 mg l in the diluted suspension therefore it was hypothesized that the residual chemical from the microcystis aeruginosa culture might alter the surface chemistry of cell and thus interfere with the governing mechanisms of transport and retention under the condition applied to further decouple the impacts of background suspension the microcystis aeruginosa cell were separated from the background nutrient suspension using 0 45 μm membrane filtration and then feed through the columns separately the same nutrient residual were also mixed with microsphere to conduct additional column tests under 1 and 100 mm kcl conditions for both media a and b fig 5 shows that the presence of the nutrient residual has no significant impacts on the retention of microcystis aeruginosa in packed column regardless of media size or ionic strength the determined attachment efficiency for all conditions were relatively low 0 15 suggesting that the driving mechanisms that govern the retention of microcystis aeruginosa are more likely determined by the surface of the cells rather than the characteristics of filtration media or aquatic suspension in contrast the presence of a nutrient residual could interfere with the retention behaviour of microspheres significantly under favourable conditions 100 mm kcl but had limited influence under unfavourable conditions 1 mm this is because while the negatively charged nutrient residual was added into favourable suspension the interfacial forces between microspheres and media became more negative resulting in decreased removal in contrast under unfavourable conditions the repulsive forces between the approaching particle and media were already strong and cannot be enhanced it is noted that the attachment efficiency after adding the nutrient residual under favourable conditions was almost identical to that under 1 mm kcl conditions which indirectly verifies the above mentioned mechanisms such behaviour is in good agreement with the most reported studies regarding the impact of nom in the water for contaminant transport in porous media yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 3 6 impacts of pre oxidation in drinking water treatment facilities oxidation technologies such as uv ozone or naclo were commonly used as pre treatment to destabilize the cell and oxidize the chemical and waterborne microorganisms for better removal rice et al 1981 it was generally believed that changing the cell s chemical and physical integrity i e rougher surface should result in enhanced removal because of the reduced repulsive force and increased favourable sites for deposition due to irregularly of morphology and chemical composition jin et al 2016 johnson et al 2018 in this section aiming to investigate combined effectiveness of oxidation and filtration on the cell retention different oxidation processes have been used to react with microcystis aeruginosa first and then the cells were feed though packed column such experiments could mimic the realistic operational conditions that was experienced in drinking water treatment plants conditions that achieved the highest deposition rates 5 0 ml min for media b at is of 1 mm kcl were selected for testing herein before and after naclo oxidation process the images of microcystis aeruginosa were recorded figure s 6 treatment from naclo could lysis the cell and significantly changed the morphology of microcystis aeruginosa i e rougher surface the figure s 7 also shown that with the increase of contact time under 10 mg l naclo fluorescent fl3 fl4 area of microcystis aeruginosa were changed indicating that the cells have been successfully deactivated fig 6 documents the deposition rate of microcystis aeruginosa after different advanced oxidation processes and compared to no treatment results as negative control surprisingly all the deposition rates after oxidation treatments were small and similar to each other 0 0002 0 0005 s 1 the performance under uv 0 3 mm chloramines were slightly lower than other conditions different concentrations of reagent ranging from 0 0013 to 0 134 mm of naclo were also tested no significant improvement was observed as well figure s 8 to verify these results and decouple the potential confounding impacts caused by oxidation on the detection method all these results were also examined manually these above mentioned results suggest that although the pre treatment process could effectively deactivate the microcystis aeruginosa but those deactivated cells could still breakthrough packed column regardless of operational conditions combining the results above it is suggested that if one aimed to enhance the removal of microcystis aeruginosa efforts should be made to aggregate the cells effectively and then remove from the water prior to filtration and disinfection morphology changes introduced by pre oxidation might have a limited impact on the removal enhancement in filtration 4 conclusions for the first time this work comprehensively investigated the transport and retention of microcystis aeruginosa in a packed column which is representative algal mostly detected in fresh water during bloom events as a surrogate of waterborne microorganisms microspheres which have similar size and morphology features to the cultured cells were used for theoretical exploration different flow rates 1 0 and 5 0 ml min media sizes media a and b ionic strengths 1 10 50 and 100 mm kcl were selected as representative operational conditions for testing the impact of nutrient residual used to culture microcystis aeruginosa and different oxidation processes including uv chloramines o3 h2o2 uv naclo uv h2o2 electrocatalysis were tested systemically we found that the studied microcystis aeruginosa could effectively breakthrough the packed column regardless of operational conditions the attachment efficiencies of microcystis aeruginosa were consistently lower than 0 15 and not sensitive to the changes of ionic strength the oxidation process could effective deactivate the microcystis aeruginosa and alter the surface characteristics however such changes did not improve the removal of microcystis aeruginosa in the packed column these observations cannot be explained by existing x dlvo theory and contradict the transport and retention behaviour of most studied microorganisms johnson et al 2018 li et al 2019 the experiment conducted here was aimed at simulating the transport and retention behaviours of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration the lab cultured cells used herein were mostly isolated cells rather than aggregated or colonized cells as presented during the realistic bloom events different morphology characteristics might have an impact on the performance of retention in filtration it should be noted that even during the bloom event there are still significant portion of cells that were isolated or grouped in small units researchers have even noticed that the filamentous cell of aphanizomenon and anabaena could break through the filtration and be identified in the chlorinated water at levels above who alert level 1 the results found herein suggest that in addition to the effort of preventing toxin release during bloom events in the drinking water supply engineers and researchers should also pay attention to the breakthrough of microcystis aeruginosa and other algal cells such breakthrough results not only indicated elevated effluent turbidity 0 4 ntu and doc of chlorinated water but also introduced taste and odour components as the major distribution issues kommineni et al 2009 it is also possible to generate additional toxin after the disinfection process and release into the finished water thus jeopardizing the safety of the finished water while they migrate to the water tank or other storage places it is also possible to trigger local algal blooms or cell over growth thus it is critical and necessary to further elucidate the transport and retention mechanisms of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration to minimize the risk of toxic algal exposure to human being in addition early warning monitoring systems that could identify and quantify the species and numbers of bloom algal cells might be necessary for the wtp to better manage their facilities and implement effective engineering solutions to encounter the operational challenging zamyadi et al 2012a the following conclusions can be reached 1 microcystis aeruginosa could break through the packed column regardless of operational conditions this work represented the first systematic demonstration of this phenomena which could reasonably explain the breakthrough of algal cells in full scale observations in drinking water treatment plants driving mechanisms that govern the retention of microcystis aeruginosa are more likely from the surface of cells rather than media properties and aquatic suspension 2 microspheres might not be a good surrogate to study the transport and retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa the transport and retention behaviour of microspheres were sensitive to the changes in ionic strength flow rate media size and presence of nutrient residual the changes due to the presence of nutrient residual had a more pronounced impact under high ionic strength conditions but a relatively small influence at low ionic strength 3 x dlvo theory could qualitatively explain the transport behaviour of microspheres but was not suitable to interpret the retention behaviour of microcystis aeruginosa mechanisms that drive the breakthrough of microcystis aeruginosa in filtration should be further investigated 4 efforts should be made to closely monitor the transport of algal cells and effectively aggregate the cells and then remove them prior to filtration and disinfection within drinking water treatment facilities notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments we acknowledge the

18652,freshwater ecosystems can experience harmful algal blooms which negatively impact recreational uses aesthetics taste and odor in drinking water cyanobacterial toxins can have dire repercussions on aquatic wildlife and human health and the most ubiquitous worldwide are the hepatotoxic compounds known as microcystins the factors that influence the occurrence and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms and toxin production vary in space and time and remain poorly understood it is within this context that we present a suite of statistical models parameterized with bayesian inference techniques to link the retrospective analysis of important environmental factors with the probability of exceedance of threshold microcystin levels our modelling framework is applied to the bay of quinte lake ontario canada a system with a long history of eutrophication problems collectively 16 1 of the samples of the system collected during the study period 2003 2016 exceeded the drinking water guideline of 1 5 μgl 1 while approximately 3 of recorded values exceeded the recommended recreational threshold of 20 μgl 1 using a segmented regression model with a stochastic breakpoint of microcystin concentrations estimated at 0 54 μg l 1 we demonstrate that the environmental conditions associated with increased probability of exceedance of the drinking water standard are chlorophyll a concentration 7 μg l 1 water temperature 20 c ammonium concentration 40 μgl 1 total phosphorus concentration 25 μg l 1 and wind speed 37 km h 1 considering the multitude of factors that can influence the ambient levels of toxins our study argues that the adoption of probabilistic water quality criteria offers a pragmatic approach to accommodate the associated uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of violations in this context we present a framework to evaluate the confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of microcystin threshold

composition and methylation mcs comprise 90 variants with varying levels of toxicity the most toxic of which are mc lr and mc la sivonen and jones 1999 mcs are highly resistant to degradation and can persist in the water column several weeks after a visible cyanobacterial bloom zastepa et al 2014 conventional drinking water treatment methods i e chlorination coagulation boil water advisories are often ineffective in eliminating mcs and therefore costs for additional water purification measures can be significantly increased zamyadi et al 2012 mcs pose human and animal health risks through ingestion of contaminated drinking water or consumption of contaminated fish shellfish watson et al 2015 many regulatory bodies have implemented water quality guidelines for mc concentrations mostly based on the specific variant mc lr to protect human and animal health ranging from 0 3 to 1 6 μg l 1 for drinking water who 2011 u s epa 2015 hc 2017 and 20 μg l 1 for recreational uses hc 2017 research into the environmental factors that influence cyanotoxin production has intensified over the past decade heisler et al 2008 pick 2016 similar to the ambient conditions influencing cyanobacterial blooms i e nutrients light temperature water column stability grazing pressure frequently identified environmental factors co varying with ambient toxin levels have included alone or in combination elevated cyanobacterial particularly microcystis biomass chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations surface water temperature wind speed and or direction francy et al 2016 harris and graham 2017 jacoby et al 2000 kotak et al 2000 wood et al 2017 likewise total nitrogen to total phosphorus tn tp ratio has been hypothesized to be a significant regulatory factor orihel et al 2012 scott et al 2013 jacoby et al 2015 and so has the relative abundance of different nitrogen n species that may also modulate the toxicity of mc variants produced monchamp et al 2014 scott et al 2014 nonetheless despite all the active research the causal relationships and mechanisms leading to high mc events still remain elusive scholz et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 the dynamic response of cyanobacteria to changes in environmental conditions results in blooms that are highly variable in space and time stumpf et al 2012 it has also been reported that the genetic capacity of cyanobacteria to produce toxins varies among taxa or even within strains of the same species rinta kanto et al 2009 while both toxic and non toxic genotypes can coexist within the same population and actively compete for the same natural resources kardinaal et al 2007 understanding the site specific mechanisms that drive the variability of mc concentrations is important to the water quality assessment process and ultimately to the development of effective water management policies in this context a major challenge is to interpret the data from a limited amount of samples and determine whether an apparent violation of toxin threshold levels warrants classifying a system as impaired or actions taken to address water quality degradation have brought about the desired improvements smith et al 2001 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 considering the multitude of factors that can modulate the ambient levels of toxins the adoption of probabilistic criteria offers a pragmatic approach to accommodate the associated uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of violations that is a system in question will be classified as impaired only if more than 10 of the samples collected exceed a critical toxin concentration another important step to establish an operational procedure is the coupling of predictive models with uncertainty analysis that will allow a shift in the focus from the mean model predictions to the tails of the derived error distributions in doing so we can draw predictive statements about the fraction of mc events that exceed a pre specified critical risk level borsuk et al 2002 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 ramin et al 2011 to date less than a handful of studies have attempted to connect the prevailing environmental conditions with the likelihood of violations of water quality guidelines for mc threshold concentrations yuan et al 2014 hollister and kreakie 2016 taranu et al 2017 it is within this context that we present a bayesian modelling framework to identify thresholds of environmental factors influencing high mc events while providing a probabilistic assessment of the risk of encountering violations our analysis aims to shed light on the nature of the relationships between mcs and several potentially important predictor variables accounting for the nutrient concentrations temperature and meteorological conditions special emphasis is given to the chlorophyll a concentration which is a frequently used surrogate variable of total phytoplankton biomass and is considered one of the most reliable predictors of toxin concentrations we also illustrate a methodological framework to evaluate the confidence of compliance with candidate probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of potential mc thresholds with different sample sizes and prior beliefs based on our empirical knowledge fig 1 to showcase this modelling framework we used data collected from the bay of quinte lake ontario ontario canada a system that has been experiencing water quality issues and where the elimination of chabs represents one of the major challenges of eutrophication management arhonditsis et al 2016 2 materials and methods study site and probabilistic standards the bay of quinte is a z shaped embayment located on the northeastern shore of lake ontario ontario canada fig 1 surrounded by a 18000 km2 watershed the bay of quinte has a total surface area of 254 km2 that is divided into three segments the upper bay is large and shallow 136 km2 mean and maximum depth of 3 5 m and 8 m respectively the middle bay is smaller but deeper 49 km2 mean depth 5 2 m maximum depth 17 m and represents an intermediate zone between the upper and lower bay which is a deep and fjord like system 72 km2 mean depth 24 4 m maximum depth 66 m directly connected with lake ontario as a result of decades of cultural eutrophication the bay of quinte has been experiencing significant water quality problems including the frequent occurrence of spatially extensive algal blooms and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria most notably the emergence of the mc producing microcystis aeruginosa after the invasion of zebra dreissena polymorpha and quagga d bugensis mussels in the mid 1990s nicholls et al 2002 consequently eutrophication management in the area has primarily focused on the eradication of harmful algal blooms and restoration of optimal water quality conditions through reduction of external nutrient loading nonetheless recent empirical and modelling evidence highlighted internal recycling as another key factor that shapes phosphorus dynamics in the bay of quinte kim et al 2013 doan et al 2018 while the flow from trent river is the predominant driver of water quality in the innermost area of the system fig 2 the sediments in the upper and middle bay release a significant amount of phosphorus and the corresponding fluxes are modulated by the macrophyte and dreissenid activity kim et al 2013 from a management perspective the presence of an active nutrient regeneration mechanism suggests that the benefits of additional reductions of the external point and non point loading may not be realized within a reasonable time frame i e 5 10 years in fact arhonditsis et al 2016 showed that the restoration pace of the system could be slow with no clear evidence of an establishment of an alternative stable state janse et al 2010 even if the riverine total phosphorus concentrations reach levels significantly lower than their contemporary values 25 μg tp l 1 water quality targets are based on an aggregated spatiotemporal i e seasonal and system wide scale and are currently set at 30 μg l 1 and 10 12 μg l 1 for total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a hereafter chl a concentrations respectively arhonditsis et al 2016 however the adequacy of the coarse scale selected to establish water quality standards has been challenged since it neither captures the intra annual variability in the upper bay nor does it represent the dynamics in nearshore areas of high public exposure e g beaches kim et al 2013 2018 arhonditsis et al 2016 a single valued water quality standard monitored in a few offshore sampling stations is unlikely to reflect the entire range of conditions experienced in time and space including episodic events such as excessively high end of summer ambient tp levels or chabs kim et al 2013 instead it has been advocated that the water quality targets should revolve around extreme and not average values of variables of management interest and must explicitly accommodate all the sources of uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of standard violations namely arhonditsis et al 2016 have proposed the critical threshold tp level should be set at a value of 40 μg l 1 which cannot be exceeded in more than 10 15 of the samples collected from selected monitoring sites during the growing may october season based on empirical evidence that the tp concentrations in the bay of quinte follow a log normal distribution and that tp values 15 μg l 1 are typically registered in only 10 of the collected samples 10 15 exceedances of the 40 μg tp l 1 level are approximately equivalent to a targeted seasonal average of 25 28 μg tp l 1 similar probabilistic criteria to more comprehensively monitor the progress of the prevailing conditions with chabs in the bay have not been proposed dataset description we compiled concurrent mc water quality and meteorological data from several monitoring programs the bay of quinte harmful algal blooms bqhabs initiative and environment and climate change canada eccc have monitored water quality since 2003 watson et al 2011 the bay of quinte algae watch bqaw program intensively sampled mcs and selected chemical and physical parameters over the course of a 4 year period 2010 2013 under these programs water samples water column profiles total mcs and related site data were collected from various locations throughout the bay of quinte i e beaches embayments offshore waters downstream sites of wastewater treatment plant discharges macrophyte beds and river mouths for all programs total mcs were analyzed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa and protein phosphatase inhibition assay ppia watson et al 2007 a suite of water quality parameters were measured from selected water samples and analyzed following standard methods at the national laboratory for environmental testing in burlington ontario watson et al 2007 2011 data collected from the bqhabs bqaw and eccc surveys were combined with information from the drinking water surveillance program dwsp https www ontario ca data drinking water surveillance program for the belleville drinking water system plant operated by the province of ontario s ministry of the environment and climate change moecc in partnership with municipalities the dwsp is a voluntary program that monitors water quality at selected municipal drinking water systems in order to gather information on drinking water quality in ontario raw water samples were collected on a weekly basis from june to november 2011 2013 from inside the water treatment plant prior to addition of treatment chemicals and thus the samples represent the water at the source a series of microbiological inorganic and organic chemical parameters water temperature emerging complex contaminants were monitored by drinking water systems staff and analyzed with standard methods at the moecc laboratory services branch moe 2010 additional data for chl a for the belleville drinking water system plant were reported under the great lakes intake program https www ontario ca data lake water quality drinking water intakes we compiled meteorological data from the eccc digital archive of canadian climatological data http climate weather gc ca we accessed publicly available data from trenton a weather station climate id 6158875 which is the closest 25 km to the majority of the monitoring sites shown in fig 2 with consistent records throughout our study period the first hypothesis examined was the presence of a lagged relationship between meteorological forcing and dominance of microcystis in the summer algal assemblage or microcystin production we examined a number of expressions that connected the microcystin ambient levels with the antecedent meteorological conditions e g wind speed wind direction precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration such as moving time windows that averaged each of the weather related variables for up to ten days prior to the measured microcystin concentrations none of the tested permutations outperformed the models that considered contemporaneous values of the meteorological predictors given the large number of environmental water quality and meteorological predictors available we chose to retain a subset based on three criteria i those that had been found to influence mc concentrations in previous studies on freshwater systems ii those that are used as primary indicators of local ecosystem conditions munawar et al 2012 and iii data availability thus our mc statistical models are based on the following predictors tp and ammonium nh4 concentrations wind speed water temperature and chl a concentrations in the absence of water column stratification records we used wind speed measured as the maximum instantaneous gust recorded over an elapsed time of 3 5 s during the day km h 1 as a proxy measure of water column stability assuming that gustier days correspond to greater water column mixing and lower water column stability kann and welch 2005 it is also important to note that the consideration of multiple predictors for our statistical models reduced the total sample size i e n 186 across all the locations monitored over the course of our study and the data used were mainly based on offshore waters and less so on beaches embayments macrophyte beds and river mouths bayesian modelling framework our first statistical model bernoulli model examines the likelihood exceedance of an established drinking water standard for mc equal to 1 5 μg l 1 given different combinations of environmental conditions hc 2017 this model postulates that the violation of a mc standard resembles a bernoulli process such that the collected samples represent a sequence of independent identically distributed bernoulli trials mahmood et al 2014 shimoda et al 2016 for every sample collected the model calculates the likelihood of violating the mc threshold level independently from the previous or subsequent samples while the probability p of a certain mc violation is determined by a series of potentially important causal factors such as nutrient concentrations water temperature or meteorological conditions the causal relationship between the probability of violation occurrence of the 1 5 μg mc l 1 threshold and environmental conditions was modeled using logistic regression m c e x c e e d a n c e i p i β 0 β x x i b e r n o u l l i p i l o g i t p i β 0 β x ln x i β 0 β x n 0 10000 i 1 μ x n h 4 w t w i n d t p c h l a where mc exceedance i denotes the violation or not of the mc threshold 1 or 0 in the i th sample x i corresponds to the value of each of the predictors in the same sample and β 0 and β x are the regression coefficients which were assigned flat or diffuse normal prior distributions with mean 0 and variance 10000 and m 186 is the size of our dataset our second model aimed to examine the strength and monotonicity of the relationship between total mc and chl a concentrations within the domain delineated by our dataset in particular we use segmented or piecewise simple regression to identify a breakpoint in which the independent variable is partitioned into two intervals and then fit separate linear equations within each interval thus the model can be summarized as follows l n m c m o d i β 0 β 1 j ln c h l a i ln c h l a b r e a k p o i n t ε i j 1 if c h l a i c h l a b r e a k p o i n t j 2 if c h l a i c h l a b r e a k p o i n t ln c h l a b r e a k p o i n t u 1 6 2 3 β 0 β 1 j n 0 10000 ε i n 0 σ ε 2 σ ε 2 g 0 001 0 001 i 1 μ where ln mc modi represents the natural log transformed predicted mc concentration in sample i β 0 is the intercept term β 1j denotes the slope terms for the two segments determined by the chl a concentration breakpoint or chla breakpoint u 1 6 2 3 is the log uniform prior distribution assigned to chla breakpoint with lower and upper bounds of 1 6 and 2 3 ln μg chl a l 1 or 5 and 10 μg chl a l 1 respectively ε i represents the model error term which is a draw from a normal distribution with a mean equal to zero and error variance σ ε 2 n 0 10000 is the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 10000 and g 0 001 0 001 is the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters of 0 001 these prior distributions are considered non informative or vague our third statistical formulation employs a segmented multiple regression model with a stochastic breakpoint set on the response variable specifically this formulation dissects the multivariate data into two subsets on the basis of their mc concentrations within which two linear equations are being estimated in doing so we can examine to what extent the nature of the relationship of the individual predictors changes against low or high mc values and subsequently examine if there are approximate thresholds for each predictor variable that increases the likelihood of violations of the drinking water guidelines the third statistical model can be summarized as follows l n m c m o d i β 0 j β x j ln x i ε i j 1 if m c i m c b r e a k p o i n t j 2 if m c i m c b r e a k p o i n t ln m c b r e a k p o i n t u 1 6 0 β 0 j β x j n 0 10000 ε i n 0 σ ε 2 σ ε 2 g 0 001 0 001 i 1 n x n h 4 w t w i n d t p c h l a where β 0j and β 1j denotes the intercept and slope terms for the two segments determined by the mc concentration breakpoint or mc breakpoint u 1 6 0 is the log uniform prior distribution assigned to mc breakpoint with lower and upper bounds of 1 6 and 0 ln μg l 1 or 0 2 and 1 μg l 1 respectively we also used a tobit configuration to address the potential for bias due to the fact that 20 of mc measured concentrations were below the detection limit 0 15 μg l 1 mc values falling below the detection limit were treated as random draws from a normal distribution parameterized such that its values were lying between the actual zero and the detection limit this approach used a bounded distribution for the measurements with an upper bound equal to either the detection limit or a very large arbitrary number depending on whether or not the measurement fell below the detection limit model codes and computational aspects of our bayesian modelling framework are provided in the supporting information section confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards probabilistic standards stipulate that no more than a stated frequency of exceedances of a targeted environmental threshold should occur within a given number of samples collected over a compliance assessment domain simply put a probabilistic standard requires that a targeted numerical value of a water quality variable should not be exceeded more frequently than a selected percentage e g 10 15 of all the samples collected from a pre specified number of monitoring sites representative of the system dynamics over a time span of management interest hence the evaluation of compliance with a water quality standard is subjected to sampling error associated with the total number of samples collected as well as the decisions made regarding the locations and time frequency of the monitoring programs mcbride and ellis 2001 this uncertainty not only influences the potential for an error in the inference drawn regarding the compliance or breach of the probabilistic standard but also the nature of the error type i falsely inferring a breach of standard or ii falsely inferring compliance that might occur in a bayesian context compliance assessment has the potential to address such issues directly without the need to consider significance levels type i and type ii error risks mcbride and ellis 2001 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 in this study similar to the modelling framework originally presented by mcbride and ellis 2001 we use beta distributed prior information and a binomial likelihood to produce confidence of compliance graphs see supporting information section for illustration purposes we evaluated the confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of two mc thresholds 1 5 and 5 μg l 1 when we consider different sample sizes and prior beliefs 3 results the distribution of mc concentrations recorded from 2003 to 2016 was highly skewed fig 3 a collectively 16 1 of mc values exceeded the drinking water guideline of 1 5 μg l 1 while 3 1 of observed values exceeded the recommended recreational threshold of 20 μg l 1 the maximum mc concentration measured was close to 3 mg l 1 in august 2015 interestingly a higher proportion of violations of water quality guidelines both drinking water and recreational was observed from 2009 to 2015 than in other periods fig 3b there were no mc violations of the drinking water quality guidelines registered in 2006 2008 nor in 2016 but it should also be noted that sample sizes were low n 25 in those years fig 3b records of mc violations of drinking water guidelines regularly occur from may through october but the frequency is more pronounced from mid summer to early fall fig 3c violations of recreational guidelines mainly occur from july to august although frequent violations have also been registered in september or even in october fig 3c the bernoulli model correctly classified 157 instances where the drinking water threshold 1 5 μg l 1 was not violated and the predicted probability of occurrence was similarly low p 0 5 there were no cases of non violation that were assigned a high probability of occurrence p 0 5 i e no false alarms table 1 however the model underestimated the number of mc violations experienced in the system predicting only 5 cases with high probability of occurrence p 0 5 out of 29 recorded violations 17 accuracy we thus infer that the bernoulli model is prone to predicting false negatives i e failure to predict the frequency of mc violations that actually occurred and cannot offer a reliable tool from a public health perspective in the bay of quinte table 1 nh 4 displayed a negative 0 33 0 21 relationship with the probability of mc violations in a bayesian context the significance of this result can be assessed with the odds ratio 2 2 the odds ratio or of a regression coefficient being negative positive is the ratio of the probability to be below above zero to the probability above below zero for the corresponding regression coefficient to be negative which was 16 2 1 in this particular case in a similar manner chl a displayed a strongly positive 0 89 0 29 association with mc violations characterized by an or of 930 1 table 2 we can also infer that the relationships between the likelihood of mc violations and water temperature 0 32 0 71 or tp concentrations 0 22 0 47 were negative but the ors 2 1 1 suggest that the corresponding coefficients were marginally discernible from zero the same pattern held true with our model intercept 1 59 4 66 i e the likelihood of mc violations when all four predictor variables tend to low values moreover the simple piecewise regression model suggests a breakpoint at the level of 1 97 ln μg chl a l 1 or 7 1 μg chl a l 1 where the nature of the relationship between mc and chl a concentrations changes from weakly 0 21 0 23 to strongly 0 96 0 15 positive fig 4 importantly the latter segment of this relationship comprises nearly all the daily snapshots from the system when mc violations of the drinking water standard occurred the segmented multiple regression model identified a significant mc breakpoint at the level of 0 54 μg l 1 or 0 62 0 08 in the logarithmic scale separating the relationship between environmental variables and mc concentrations into two regions table 2 the comparison of the posterior predicted median mc values against the measured ones was satisfactory r 2 0 73 fig 5 with a mean standard error of the estimate equal to 0 77 0 04 ln μg mc l 1 below the mc breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 our analysis suggests a fairly strong positive relationship of chl a 0 14 0 08 tp 0 22 0 15 and water temperature 0 34 0 25 with mc concentrations where the ors for the corresponding regression coefficients to be positive were 24 0 1 13 0 1 and 10 5 1 in contrast the signature of wind speed 0 29 0 39 and nh 4 0 08 0 07 was weakly negative with ors of a negative relationship equal to 3 4 1 and 6 9 1 respectively table 2 when mc concentrations exceed the breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 our analysis underscores the strongly positive association with chl a or 3 8 105 1 the negative relationship with the ambient tp or 19 1 1 and nh 4 or 80 8 1 levels and the weakly negative practically non discernible from zero effects of wind speed or 1 4 1 and water temperature or 1 1 1 table 2 to identify approximate thresholds of environmental predictors that increased the probability of exceedance of the 1 5 μg l 1 mc drinking water guideline we selected the values above or below which 80 of the daily snapshots recorded from the bay of quinte are characterized by a greater than 10 probability of exceedance of that threshold overall our analysis suggests the environmental conditions that appear to increase the probability of exceedance of the mc drinking water standard are chl a concentrations 7 μg l 1 water temperatures 20 c nh 4 concentrations 40 μg l 1 tp concentrations 25 μg l 1 and wind speeds 37 km h 1 fig 6 to demonstrate the applicability of our modelling exercise for risk management decisions we examined the frequency histogram of the predicted probability values from the stochastic segmented model or the probability of exceedance probabilities fig 7 in this histogram we included a benchmark value of 10 representing the maximum acceptable probability to violate the 1 5 μg mc l 1 drinking water guideline for each sample collected from the bay of quinte according to our analysis only 56 6 of the mean predicted probabilities of mc violations were below this benchmark and thus the probability of exceedances greater than 10 has been relatively high 45 over the course of the study period by contrast when we apply the same procedure for the likelihood of violations of the recreational 20 μg mc l 1 water quality guidelines we found that 98 9 of the mean predicted probabilities of mc violations were below the 10 benchmark employing an intermediate threshold between the two values established in the water resource management literature could serve as evidence of excessive risks when using the system for drinking water supply as well as an early warning sign about its suitability for recreational purposes for example if we opt for a 5 μg l 1 target the distribution of probabilities for mc violations had more than 89 of the daily snapshots recorded from the bay of quinte below the 10 benchmark it is also interesting to note that the same threshold was exceeded in 7 2 of the samples collected from all the sites during the study period from an operational standpoint the number of samples required during the growing season end of may early october in order to assess system compliance with targeted mc thresholds can vary from 30 to 216 depending on the number of locations monitored sampling frequency used and duration of the period examined table 3 for illustration purposes we created confidence of compliance graphs to evaluate the likelihood of compliance against two probabilistic criteria that stipulate less than 10 violations of two mc threshold concentrations i e 1 5 and 5 μg l 1 when we consider different sample sizes and prior beliefs fig 8 based on empirical evidence regarding the achievability of the two mc values in the bay of quinte the former target was assigned a conservative prior be 1 7 2 whereby we accorded relatively high probabilities to exceedance rates up to 20 fig 8a the latter mc threshold was given a more optimistic prior be 0 2 9 with a high probability assigned to very low exceedance rates 5 and practically negligible prior probabilities thereafter fig 8a according to the confidence of compliance graph fig 8c after collecting samples from four sites on a biweekly basis during two growing seasons n 80 see table 3 4 exceedances of the 1 5 μg mc l 1 threshold point a suggest our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be exceeded more than 10 is 87 0 similarly if we register 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8c then our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be violated by more than 10 will be 64 2 35 4 14 3 and 4 2 respectively intended to offer an early warning sign for the likelihood of impairment of the recreational guideline the confidence of compliance graph for the 5 μg mc l 1 target paints a more favorable picture with respect to the frequency of mc violations in the bay of quinte even if there are 4 violations after collecting samples from four sites on a biweekly basis over the course of two growing seasons our confidence of compliance with the mc standard will be 97 1 point a in fig 7d likewise 6 8 10 and 12 violations of the 5 μg mc l 1 target would suggest our confidence of compliance with lower than 10 violations of the mc target will be 87 4 64 1 35 5 and 15 2 points b e in fig 8d respectively as a final exercise we attempted to eliminate any subjectivity with the formulation of our prior beliefs and instead used empirical knowledge about the frequency of mc violations in the bay of quinte as depicted by the piecewise regression model with sole predictor the recorded chl a concentrations fig 3 in this case we formulated beta prior distributions with shape parameters derived from the predicted mean exceedance rate and the associated model error variance or residual variability it is interesting to note the similarity between the empirically derived priors and those based solely on our prior perception without any consideration of the available data fig 7a and b according to the mc estimates derived by the chl a data if there are again 4 exceedances of the drinking water guideline out of 80 samples collected during two growing seasons then our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be exceeded by more than 10 will be 93 6 fig 8e in a similar manner if we experience 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8e it would suggest that our confidence of compliance is 76 0 47 9 22 2 and 7 7 respectively when collecting the same sample size our degree of confidence with 4 violations of the 5 μg mc l 1 target will be 96 4 fig 8f interestingly the inference drawn degree of confidence of compliance remains consistently higher i e 82 5 56 2 28 6 and 10 4 if 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8f are registered over the course of two growing seasons 4 discussion owing to the increasing frequency of cyanobacteria dominated harmful algal blooms chabs as well as to their potential to inflict socioeconomic damages and ecological impairments predicting their occurrence and magnitude has become an essential management exercise in many freshwater ecosystems around the world in this study we used different statistical models parameterized with bayesian inference techniques to identify critical levels of key environmental factors that influence the exceedance risk of specific mc thresholds in the bay of quinte lake ontario canada our results suggest that chl a concentrations 7 μg l 1 tp concentrations 25 μg l 1 nh 4 concentrations 40 μg l 1 water temperatures 20 c and wind speed 37 km h 1 significantly increase the likelihood of violation of the drinking water advisory level for the bay of quinte these threshold values collectively reflect meso eutrophic conditions during periods of warm water and calm winds which were observed on approximately 17 of the sampling dates i e all sampling dates that met all five conditions and typically occur between late july and early september these environmental conditions are commonly experienced in the area particularly in summer months which suggests that high mc concentrations will continue to occur for the foreseeable future without any additional management interventions identifying reliable predictors of microcystin production using a bernoulli logistic regression model shimoda et al 2016 found that tp concentrations alone failed to predict exceedances of various levels of mc concentrations and concluded that more comprehensive modelling was needed to reliably predict drinking water violations building upon the recommendations of shimoda et al 2016 our application of the bernoulli logistic model with additional environmental variables also failed to reliably predict the occurrence of mc violations i e false negative predictions in contrast the delineation of two subsets on the basis of mc concentrations 0 54 μg l 1 as determined by our segmented multiple regression model allowed us to effectively accommodate non monotonic non linear relationships with environmental predictors and to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the risks of exceeding mc drinking water guidelines thus even though our modelling analysis in its current form cannot be used for forecasting purposes i e lack of predictors that reflect the antecedent conditions breakpoint on the response rather than on the explanatory variables it does allow to delineate critical values of explanatory variables associated with increased probability of exceedance of the drinking water standard moreover the fact that it is founded upon explanatory variables that are readily available from nearly all the monitoring programs in the great lakes and elsewhere see also the statistical models presented by shimoda et al 2016 provides a plausible framework upon which stronger causative foundation can be built by designing suitable lab field experiments or monitoring programs with finer granularity our modelling analysis identified chl a concentrations as the predictor variable with the strongest relationship with mc concentrations often used as an indicator of phytoplankton standing biomass in freshwater systems it includes all toxic and non toxic cyanobacteria and other algal taxa despite this fact chl a can be a significant predictor of mc violations harris and graham 2017 mc presence absence taranu et al 2017 or is positively correlated with mcs rinta kanto et al 2009 likewise there are also several attempts to identify chl a thresholds that could be associated with a higher likelihood of exceedance of selected health advisory mc levels for example taranu et al 2017 found that a high probability of exceeding mc concentrations of 1 6 2 0 μg l 1 occurred at tn concentrations 650 μg l 1 and cyanobacterial biomass 160 mg l 1 using a conditional probability approach hollister and kreakie 2016 estimated a 50 chance of exceeding health advisory mc thresholds of 1 and 2 μg l 1 when chl a concentrations reached 68 and 104 μg l 1 respectively when paired with low tn concentrations 570 μg l 1 yuan et al 2014 found a 10 chance of exceeding the 1 μg mc l 1 level when chl a concentrations were 37 μg l 1 see their fig 3 although the same probability level was also associated with a much lower chl a threshold 3 μg l 1 when tn concentrations were elevated 1100 μg l 1 our chl a threshold is apparently different from these estimates but it should also be noted that our analysis is focused on the variability recorded within a particular system as opposed to the cross sectional multi site character of the aforementioned modelling work that teased out information from broader regions chl a is used as an important indicator of the bay of quinte ecosystem state and a remediation target for chl a concentrations of 10 12 μg l 1 has been established for the restoration of water quality munawar et al 2012 however our analysis indicated that the average exceedance probability of the drinking water guideline ranges between 20 and 25 at these targeted concentrations see also the scatter of the predicted probabilities once the black vertical line in fig 6a is exceeded the role of cultural eutrophication in promoting harmful algal blooms in freshwaters is well established heisler et al 2008 pick 2016 but the causal linkages between exogenous nutrient enrichment and mc production is an on going debate e g see orihel et al 2012 scott et al 2013 in a similar manner the relationship between mcs and external nutrient loading remains unclear in the bay of quinte as a greater risk of exceedance of the drinking water guidelines was associated with intermediate tp and low nh 4 concentrations p availability is considered the primary limiting factor influencing cyanobacterial growth in freshwaters but the availability of various forms of n could be another important factor for the production of n rich mc and toxicity gobler et al 2016 and references therein elevated n levels have been associated with higher cellular quotas of mcs in the non diazotrophs microcystis and planktothrix and thus n enrichment particularly in p replete environments may increase mc production donald et al 2011 monchamp et al 2014 observed elevated mc concentrations in nh 4 depleted waters in quebec lakes regardless of the total cyanobacterial biomass observed along the same line of evidence microcystis is known to have high affinity for nh 4 and often displays superior uptake capacity for rapidly recycled reduced n under nitrogen limiting conditions mccarthy et al 2009 glibert et al 2014 given the presence of active nutrient cycling in the bay of quinte mediated by sediment diagenesis dreissenids excreta egesta and macrophyte decomposition arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 we hypothesize that once the internal nutrient pump begins to replenish the overlying water an interplay of increased p sequestration and rapid uptake of energetically favorable nh 4 may trigger microcystis growth and mc production considering the low summer ambient levels of all inorganic nitrogen forms nh 4 no 2 no 3 in the bay of quinte shimoda et al 2016 surmised that there are two additional factors that promote microcystis dominance i the selective dreissenid filtration that may be responsible for the reduced biovolume of n 2 fixers aphanizomenon spp and anabaena spp and ii the bioavailability of other nitrogen forms such as urea which can enter cells either via light independent transport or by diffusion and which produce two nh 4 per molecule of urea transported inside the cells in this case the need for active uptake of hco 3 at high ph is minimized and co 2 can be released by intracellular urease valladares et al 2002 flores and herrero 2005 donald et al 2011 although multiple studies have demonstrated the linkages between increasing water temperature and toxic cyanobacterial blooms jacoby et al 2000 wood et al 2017 fewer have directly connected temperature to ambient mc levels francy et al 2016 in our study we were able to identify a threshold of 20 c above which the exceedance likelihood of mc drinking water guidelines increases the cyanobacterium microcystis has been found to out compete other phytoplankton species at or above 25 c paerl and paul 2012 while the number of genes or transcripts associated with mc production increase with water temperature davis et al 2009 thus there is growing concern that increases in temperature due to global climate change will increase the frequency and magnitude of chabs and promote the growth of toxic strains of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 these changes have important implications for future water quality trends particularly in the bay of quinte for example trumpickas et al 2009 predicted future summer surface water temperatures in lake ontario to rise by 2 5 c above 1971 2000 norms under the intergovernmental panel on climate change a2 emissions scenario and by 2 25 c under the b2 scenario for the 2041 2070 period further nicholls 1999 predicted that an increase in average summer water temperature by 3 4 c would double the summer average tp concentrations in line with current warming trends maximum summer surface waters in the bay of quinte have warmed by almost 1 c from 1972 to 2008 minns et al 2011 if we also consider that the mean summer jun aug tp concentrations and surface water temperatures measured in the upper bay were approximately 32 μg l 1 and 23 c respectively then it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of mc violations will continue to be relatively high especially since the internal nutrient feedback loop is projected to remain active in the near future arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 to our knowledge few studies to date have examined the influence of physical conditions other than temperature in predicting mcs in freshwater lakes cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to take advantage of optimal nutrient and light conditions and thus could gain a competitive advantage over other eukaryotic phytoplankton under these conditions reviewed in watson et al 2015 leading to higher mc concentrations and increased risk of mc health advisory violations jacoby et al 2000 found that higher water column stability and decreased lake flushing were associated with a pronounced and prolonged toxic bloom of microcystis aeruginosa during summer 1994 in steilacoom lake washington usa although mc concentrations per gram of phytoplankton were found be unrelated to the prevailing environmental conditions except from soluble reactive phosphorus more recently wood et al 2017 found that an extended drought in the shallow eutrophic lake rotorua new zealand led to prolonged stratification increased dissolved reactive phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen concentrations which interacted with temperature to influence cyanobacterial mc cell quotas because direct measurements of water column stability were unavailable for the bay of quinte we used wind speed as a representative proxy of mixing conditions assuming a negative relationship whereby higher wind speeds reduce water column stability kann and welch 2005 this relationship would be particularly pronounced for locations in the middle and lower bay which are deep enough for stratification to occur throughout the year and thus wind driven mixing could interrupt water column stability to a greater extent at these locations nonetheless because the hypothesized strong negative association between wind speed and the probability of mc violations did not manifest itself in our modelling analysis future investigation of the direct role of physical lake dynamics and in particular water column stability and interactions with water temperature is clearly warranted in order to gain a better understanding of mc production dynamics setting probabilistic criteria for microcystin concentrations in the management of impaired waterbodies the establishment of probabilistic water quality criteria is often considered an effective strategy to deal with the inherent uncertainty and or our imperfect knowledge of natural systems e g mcbride and ellis 2001 shabman and smith 2003 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 mahmood et al 2014 smith and canale 2015 it is within this context that our statistical framework can assist with the development of realistic water quality criteria to track the occurrence of high mc levels or other cyanotoxins as demonstrated by the derived probability of exceedance probabilities in particular the bayesian nature of our work gives direct answers to questions of confidence of compliance with percentile standards see panels b e in fig 8 and as such can effectively guide management decisions and monitoring practices that consider both risks of reaching false conclusions i e falsely inferring a breach of standard or falsely inferring compliance mcbride and ellis 2001 instead of basing inference solely on the exceedance frequency level of a threshold mc concentration the estimated probabilities are regarded as a continuous variable about which we make confidence statements simply put we introduce an extra dimension of uncertainty by targeting the probability of an acceptable mc exceedance risk or margin of safety across all water samples taken zhang and arhonditsis 2008 mahmood et al 2014 the conceptual advantages of the proposed framework presumably come at the cost of having to state one s prior belief as to likely exceedance rates namely our first two illustrations were based on the formulation of prior distributions that reflected our subjective pessimistic or optimistic beliefs regarding the likelihood of compliance with two 1 5 and 5 μg mc l 1 targeted thresholds nonetheless this issue was rectified with our subsequent examples in which empirical knowledge from the system was used to characterize our prior beliefs that is the mean predictions about the achievability of the two targets along with the associated error of the simple piecewise regression model provided the basis for the specification of the shape parameters of our beta prior even more so a well known property of bayesian analysis is that the results from classical and bayesian statistics become more similar at larger numbers of samples as the information in the data increasingly dominates over that in the chosen prior distributions mcbride and ellis 2001 arhonditsis et al 2008 our confidence of compliance graphs can determine the optimal sample size that will allow to draw robust inference about the prevailing ambient conditions and address any criticism about the potential subjectivity with methodological practices followed from a management viewpoint our analysis suggests that the occurrence of chabs could be a manifestation of the tight control exerted by the sediments which act as a net source of phosphorus and the corresponding fluxes are likely magnified by the macrophyte and dreissenid activity e g nutrient pump effect and pseudofeces production kim et al 2013 according to recent empirical and modelling evidence arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 the presence of significant nutrient regeneration mechanisms is primarily responsible for the elevated end of summer p 25 30 μg tp l 1 in the upper bay of quinte which in turn appears to be the first condition for structural shifts to occur in the algal assemblage see also the positive linkage between mc and tp concentrations below the breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 once ambient p is no longer a limiting factor the inter specific competition for energetically favorable nitrogen forms coupled with the water temperature and or water column stability are some of the factors that likely shape the development of chabs and production of toxins thus while additional reductions of the external point and non point nutrient loading are warranted it is also important to note that the ability of the sediments to modulate the relative abundance of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus forms indicates that the anticipated benefits may not be realized immediately and chabs may still occur in the near future in view of this prospect our analysis reinforces the pragmatic standpoint that the compliance rules should explicitly accommodate all the sources of uncertainty such as insufficient information lack of knowledge natural variability unaccounted ecological unknowns by adopting a probabilistic approach that permits a realistic frequency of violations 10 and satisfactory level of confidence 75 80 recognizing that chabs are inherently episodic events the compliance assessment should be based on multiple sites and over the course of two or three years as their nonoccurrence in a particular year does not necessarily guarantee that the problem has been eradicated we also recommend the introduction of an additional intermediate threshold value e g 5 μg mc l 1 between those used in the drinking 1 5 μg mc l 1 and recreational 20 μg mc l 1 guidelines that could serve as an early warning sign for an imminent highly toxic bloom especially since the water quality monitoring takes places in the open waters of the bay of quinte see monitoring sites fig 2 where the initiation of chabs frequently takes place the question arising is whether the precautionary spirit of our approach with the introduction of several layers of uncertainty is constructive or if it is overly conservative and runs the risk of perpetuating the management of impaired waterbodies with an overly alarmist mindset arhonditsis et al 2019 with respect to the latter issue the perspective of the public in the bay of quinte area has been positive that it does matter based on the responses of more than 1500 local residents and tourists ramin et al 2018 indicated that the degree of public satisfaction changes between the beginning and end of summer season following the gradual deterioration of the water quality conditions and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms importantly the same study showed a distinctly higher degree of satisfaction of the public when chl a concentrations remain below the 10 μg l 1 threshold or ambient tp levels are lower than 20 25 μg l 1 which is remarkably close with the critical levels of the two water quality variables associated with elevated risk of mc violations the fact that the sentiment of the public is clearly influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions offers ammunition to develop and implement an ambitious long term management plan that protects the bay of quinte from excess nutrients associated with urban runoff sewage treatment plants and agricultural land uses arhonditsis et al 2019 thus the presented probabilistic framework is intended to facilitate the policy making process in the area as the local water quality managers have long realized the expectation of a system that 100 satisfies the water quality standards is overly ambitious if not unrealistic given the currently prevailing conditions it is important though to communicate to the public that harmful algal blooms may still occur in the foreseeable future and their reduced frequency within a pre specified spatiotemporal domain is the most pragmatic way to evaluate the success of the local restoration efforts kim et al 2018 arhonditsis et al 2019 5 conclusions using the bay of quinte as a model ecosystem we demonstrated that the probability of violations of the mc drinking water guideline deemed protective of human and animal health increased significantly under specific thresholds of a suite of eutrophication indicators i e chl a nutrients and physical environmental variables our analysis highlights that nutrient management remains the best option to reduce the frequency of high mc events through their link in controlling chl a concentrations and undesirable shifts in the phytoplankton community composition in the context of environmental policy the uncertainty regarding the achievability of quality goals stemming from i the often unknown important drivers of ecological degradation ii the need to effectively balance environmental concerns with socioeconomic values and iii our desire to have contingency plans to deal with the unexpected should be a focal point when making management decisions and designing restoration monitoring plans accordingly the logic of our modelling framework is founded upon this concept and can be used to guide the decision making process in systems that

18652,freshwater ecosystems can experience harmful algal blooms which negatively impact recreational uses aesthetics taste and odor in drinking water cyanobacterial toxins can have dire repercussions on aquatic wildlife and human health and the most ubiquitous worldwide are the hepatotoxic compounds known as microcystins the factors that influence the occurrence and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms and toxin production vary in space and time and remain poorly understood it is within this context that we present a suite of statistical models parameterized with bayesian inference techniques to link the retrospective analysis of important environmental factors with the probability of exceedance of threshold microcystin levels our modelling framework is applied to the bay of quinte lake ontario canada a system with a long history of eutrophication problems collectively 16 1 of the samples of the system collected during the study period 2003 2016 exceeded the drinking water guideline of 1 5 μgl 1 while approximately 3 of recorded values exceeded the recommended recreational threshold of 20 μgl 1 using a segmented regression model with a stochastic breakpoint of microcystin concentrations estimated at 0 54 μg l 1 we demonstrate that the environmental conditions associated with increased probability of exceedance of the drinking water standard are chlorophyll a concentration 7 μg l 1 water temperature 20 c ammonium concentration 40 μgl 1 total phosphorus concentration 25 μg l 1 and wind speed 37 km h 1 considering the multitude of factors that can influence the ambient levels of toxins our study argues that the adoption of probabilistic water quality criteria offers a pragmatic approach to accommodate the associated uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of violations in this context we present a framework to evaluate the confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of microcystin threshold

composition and methylation mcs comprise 90 variants with varying levels of toxicity the most toxic of which are mc lr and mc la sivonen and jones 1999 mcs are highly resistant to degradation and can

2017 jacoby et al 2000 kotak et al 2000 wood et al 2017 likewise total nitrogen to total phosphorus tn tp ratio has been hypothesized to be a significant regulatory factor orihel et al 2012 scott et al 2013 jacoby et al 2015 and so has the relative abundance of different nitrogen n species that may also modulate the toxicity of mc variants produced monchamp et al 2014 scott et al 2014 nonetheless despite all the active research the causal relationships and mechanisms leading to high mc events still remain elusive scholz et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 the dynamic response of cyanobacteria to changes in environmental conditions results in blooms that are highly variable in space and time stumpf et al 2012 it has also been reported that the genetic capacity of cyanobacteria to produce toxins varies among taxa or even within strains of the same species rinta kanto et al 2009 while both toxic and non toxic genotypes can coexist within the same population and actively compete for the same natural resources kardinaal et al 2007 understanding the site specific mechanisms that drive the variability of mc concentrations is important to the water quality assessment process and ultimately to the development of effective water management policies in this context a major challenge is to interpret the data from a limited amount of samples and determine whether an apparent violation of toxin threshold levels warrants classifying a system as impaired or actions taken to address water quality degradation have brought about the desired improvements smith et al 2001 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 considering the multitude of factors that can modulate the ambient levels of toxins the adoption of probabilistic criteria offers a pragmatic approach to accommodate the associated uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of violations that is a system in question will be classified as impaired only if more than 10 of the samples collected exceed a critical toxin concentration another important step to establish an operational procedure is the coupling of predictive models with uncertainty analysis that will allow a shift in the focus from the mean model predictions to the tails of the derived error distributions in doing so we can draw predictive statements about the fraction of mc events that exceed a pre specified critical risk level borsuk et al 2002 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 ramin et al 2011 to date less than a handful of studies have attempted to connect the prevailing environmental conditions with the likelihood of violations of water quality guidelines for mc threshold concentrations yuan et al 2014 hollister and kreakie 2016 taranu et al 2017 it is within this context that we present a bayesian modelling framework to identify thresholds of environmental factors influencing high mc events while providing a probabilistic assessment of the risk of encountering violations our analysis aims to shed light on the nature of the relationships between mcs and several potentially important predictor variables accounting for the nutrient concentrations temperature and meteorological conditions special emphasis is given to the chlorophyll a concentration which is a frequently used surrogate variable of total phytoplankton biomass and is considered one of the most reliable predictors of toxin concentrations we also illustrate a methodological framework to evaluate the confidence of compliance with candidate probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of potential mc thresholds with different sample sizes and prior beliefs based on our empirical knowledge fig 1 to showcase this modelling framework we used data collected from the bay of quinte lake ontario ontario canada a system that has been experiencing water quality issues and where the elimination of chabs represents one of the major challenges of eutrophication management arhonditsis et al 2016 2 materials and methods study site and probabilistic standards the bay of quinte is a z shaped embayment located on the northeastern shore of lake ontario ontario canada fig 1 surrounded by a 18000 km2 watershed the bay of quinte has a total surface area of 254 km2 that is divided into three segments the upper bay is large and shallow 136 km2 mean and maximum depth of 3 5 m and 8 m respectively the middle bay is smaller but deeper 49 km2 mean depth 5 2 m maximum depth 17 m and represents an intermediate zone between the upper and lower bay which is a deep and fjord like system 72 km2 mean depth 24 4 m maximum depth 66 m directly connected with lake ontario as a result of decades of cultural eutrophication the bay of quinte has been experiencing significant water quality problems including the frequent occurrence of spatially extensive algal blooms and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria most notably the emergence of the mc producing microcystis aeruginosa after the invasion of zebra dreissena polymorpha and quagga d bugensis mussels in the mid 1990s nicholls et al 2002 consequently eutrophication management in the area has primarily focused on the eradication of harmful algal blooms and restoration of optimal water quality conditions through reduction of external nutrient loading nonetheless recent empirical and modelling evidence highlighted internal recycling as another key factor that shapes phosphorus dynamics in the bay of quinte kim et al 2013 doan et al 2018 while the flow from trent river is the predominant driver of water quality in the innermost area of the system fig 2 the sediments in the upper and middle bay release a significant amount of phosphorus and the corresponding fluxes are modulated by the macrophyte and dreissenid activity kim et al 2013 from a management perspective the presence of an active nutrient regeneration mechanism suggests that the benefits of additional reductions of the external point and non point loading may not be realized within a reasonable time frame i e 5 10 years in fact arhonditsis et al 2016 showed that the restoration pace of the system could be slow with no clear evidence of an establishment of an alternative stable state janse et al 2010 even if the riverine total phosphorus concentrations reach levels significantly lower than their contemporary values 25 μg tp l 1 water quality targets are based on an aggregated spatiotemporal i e seasonal and system wide scale and are currently set at 30 μg l 1 and 10 12 μg l 1 for total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a hereafter chl a concentrations respectively arhonditsis et al 2016 however the adequacy of the coarse scale selected to establish water quality standards has been challenged since it neither captures the intra annual variability in the upper bay nor does it represent the dynamics in nearshore areas of high public exposure e g beaches kim et al 2013 2018 arhonditsis et al 2016 a single valued water quality standard monitored in a few offshore sampling stations is unlikely to reflect the entire range of conditions experienced in time and space including episodic events such as excessively high end of summer ambient tp levels or chabs kim et al 2013 instead it has been advocated that the water quality targets should revolve around extreme and not average values of variables of management interest and must explicitly accommodate all the sources of uncertainty by permitting a realistic frequency of standard violations namely arhonditsis et al 2016 have proposed the critical threshold tp level should be set at a value of 40 μg l 1 which cannot be exceeded in more than 10 15 of the samples collected from selected monitoring sites during the growing may october season based on empirical evidence that the tp concentrations in the bay of quinte follow a log normal distribution and that tp values 15 μg l 1 are typically registered in only 10 of the collected samples 10 15 exceedances of the 40 μg tp l 1 level are approximately equivalent to a targeted seasonal average of 25 28 μg tp l 1 similar probabilistic criteria to more comprehensively monitor the progress of the prevailing conditions with chabs in the bay have not been proposed dataset description we compiled concurrent mc water quality and meteorological data from several monitoring programs the bay of quinte harmful algal blooms bqhabs initiative and environment and climate change canada eccc have monitored water quality since 2003 watson et al 2011 the bay of quinte algae watch bqaw program intensively sampled mcs and selected chemical and physical parameters over the course of a 4 year period 2010 2013 under these programs water samples water column profiles total mcs and related site data were collected from various locations throughout the bay of quinte i e beaches embayments offshore waters downstream sites of wastewater treatment plant discharges macrophyte beds and river mouths for all programs total mcs were analyzed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa and protein phosphatase inhibition assay ppia watson et al 2007 a suite of water quality parameters were measured from selected water samples and analyzed following standard methods at the national laboratory for environmental testing in burlington ontario watson et al 2007 2011 data collected from the bqhabs bqaw and eccc surveys were combined with information from the drinking water surveillance program dwsp https www ontario ca data drinking water surveillance program for the belleville drinking water system plant operated by the province of ontario s ministry of the environment and climate change moecc in partnership with municipalities the dwsp is a voluntary program that monitors water quality at selected municipal drinking water systems in order to gather information on drinking water quality in ontario raw water samples were collected on a weekly basis from june to november 2011 2013 from inside the water treatment plant prior to addition of treatment chemicals and thus the samples represent the water at the source a series of microbiological inorganic and organic chemical parameters water temperature emerging complex contaminants were monitored by drinking water systems staff and analyzed with standard methods at the moecc laboratory services branch moe 2010 additional data for chl a for the belleville drinking water system plant were reported under the great lakes intake program https www ontario ca data lake water quality drinking water intakes we compiled meteorological data from the eccc digital archive of canadian climatological data http climate weather gc ca we accessed publicly available data from trenton a weather station climate id 6158875 which is the closest 25 km to the majority of the monitoring sites shown in fig 2 with consistent records throughout our study period the first hypothesis examined was the presence of a lagged relationship between meteorological forcing and dominance of microcystis in the summer algal assemblage or microcystin production we examined a number of expressions that connected the microcystin ambient levels with the antecedent meteorological conditions e g wind speed wind direction precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration such as moving time windows that averaged each of the weather related variables for up to ten days prior to the measured microcystin concentrations none of the tested permutations outperformed the models that considered contemporaneous values of the meteorological predictors given the large number of environmental water quality and meteorological predictors available we chose to retain a subset based on three criteria i those that had been found to influence mc concentrations in previous studies on freshwater systems ii those that are used as primary indicators of local ecosystem conditions munawar et al 2012 and iii data availability thus our mc statistical models are based on the following predictors tp and ammonium nh4 concentrations wind speed water temperature and chl a concentrations in the absence of water column stratification records we used wind speed measured as the maximum instantaneous gust recorded over an elapsed time of 3 5 s during the day km h 1 as a proxy measure of water column stability assuming that gustier days correspond to greater water column mixing and lower water column stability kann and welch 2005 it is also important to note that the consideration of multiple predictors for our statistical models reduced the total sample size i e n 186 across all the locations monitored over the course of our study and the data used were mainly based on offshore waters and less so on beaches embayments macrophyte beds and river mouths bayesian modelling framework our first statistical model bernoulli model examines the likelihood exceedance of an established drinking water standard for mc equal to 1 5 μg l 1 given different combinations of environmental conditions hc 2017 this model postulates that the violation of a mc standard resembles a bernoulli process such that the collected samples represent a sequence of independent identically distributed bernoulli trials mahmood et al 2014 shimoda et al 2016 for every sample collected the model calculates the likelihood of violating the mc threshold level independently from the previous or subsequent samples while the probability p of a certain mc violation is determined by a series of potentially important causal factors such as nutrient concentrations water temperature or meteorological conditions the causal relationship between the probability of violation occurrence of the 1 5 μg mc l 1 threshold and environmental conditions was modeled using logistic regression m c e x c e e d a n c e i p i β 0 β x x i b e r n o u l l i p i l o g i t p i β 0 β x ln x i β 0 β x n 0 10000 i 1 μ x n h 4 w t w i n d t p c h l a where mc exceedance i denotes the violation or not of the mc threshold 1 or 0 in the i th sample x i corresponds to the value of each of the predictors in the same sample and β 0 and β x are the regression coefficients which were assigned flat or diffuse normal prior distributions with mean 0 and variance 10000 and m 186 is the size of our dataset our second model aimed to examine the strength and monotonicity of the relationship between total mc and chl a concentrations within the domain delineated by our dataset in particular we use segmented or piecewise simple regression to identify a breakpoint in which the independent variable is partitioned into two intervals and then fit separate linear equations within each interval thus the model can be summarized as follows l n m c m o d i β 0 β 1 j ln c h l a i ln c h l a b r e a k p o i n t ε i j 1 if c h l a i c h l a b r e a k p o i n t j 2 if c h l a i c h l a b r e a k p o i n t ln c h l a b r e a k p o i n t u 1 6 2 3 β 0 β 1 j n 0 10000 ε i n 0 σ ε 2 σ ε 2 g 0 001 0 001 i 1 μ where ln mc modi represents the natural log transformed predicted mc concentration in sample i β 0 is the intercept term β 1j denotes the slope terms for the two segments determined by the chl a concentration breakpoint or chla breakpoint u 1 6 2 3 is the log uniform prior distribution assigned to chla breakpoint with lower and upper bounds of 1 6 and 2 3 ln μg chl a l 1 or 5 and 10 μg chl a l 1 respectively ε i represents the model error term which is a draw from a normal distribution with a mean equal to zero and error variance σ ε 2 n 0 10000 is the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 10000 and g 0 001 0 001 is the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters of 0 001 these prior distributions are considered non informative or vague our third statistical formulation employs a segmented multiple regression model with a stochastic breakpoint set on the response variable specifically this formulation dissects the multivariate data into two subsets on the basis of their mc concentrations within which two linear equations are being estimated in doing so we can examine to what extent the nature of the relationship of the individual predictors changes against low or high mc values and subsequently examine if there are approximate thresholds for each predictor variable that increases the likelihood of violations of the drinking water guidelines the third statistical model can be summarized as follows l n m c m o d i β 0 j β x j ln x i ε i j 1 if m c i m c b r e a k p o i n t j 2 if m c i m c b r e a k p o i n t ln m c b r e a k p o i n t u 1 6 0 β 0 j

concentration breakpoint or mc breakpoint u 1 6 0 is the log uniform prior distribution assigned to mc breakpoint with lower and upper bounds of 1 6 and 0 ln μg l 1 or 0 2 and 1 μg l 1 respectively we also used a tobit configuration to address the potential for bias due to the fact that 20 of mc measured concentrations were below the detection limit 0 15 μg l 1 mc values falling below the detection limit were treated as random draws from a normal distribution parameterized such that its values were lying between the actual zero and the detection limit this approach used a bounded distribution for the measurements with an upper bound equal to either the detection limit or a very large arbitrary number depending on whether or not the measurement fell below the detection limit model codes and computational aspects of our bayesian modelling framework are provided in the supporting information section confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards probabilistic standards stipulate that no more than a stated frequency of exceedances of a targeted environmental threshold should occur within a given number of samples collected over a compliance assessment domain simply put a probabilistic standard requires that a targeted numerical value of a water quality variable should not be exceeded more frequently than a selected percentage e g 10 15 of all the samples collected from a pre specified number of monitoring sites representative of the system dynamics over a time span of management interest hence the evaluation of compliance with a water quality standard is subjected to sampling error associated with the total number of samples collected as well as the decisions made regarding the locations and time frequency of the monitoring programs mcbride and ellis 2001 this uncertainty not only influences the potential for an error in the inference drawn regarding the compliance or breach of the probabilistic standard but also the nature of the error type i falsely inferring a breach of standard or ii falsely inferring compliance that might occur in a bayesian context compliance assessment has the potential to address such issues directly without the need to consider significance levels type i and type ii error risks mcbride and ellis 2001 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 in this study similar to the modelling framework originally presented by mcbride and ellis 2001 we use beta distributed prior information and a binomial likelihood to produce confidence of compliance graphs see supporting information section for illustration purposes we evaluated the confidence of compliance with probabilistic standards that stipulate less than 10 violations of two mc thresholds 1 5 and 5 μg l 1 when we consider different sample sizes and prior beliefs 3 results the distribution of mc concentrations recorded from 2003 to 2016 was highly skewed fig 3 a collectively 16 1 of mc values exceeded the drinking water guideline of 1 5 μg l 1 while 3 1 of observed values exceeded the recommended recreational threshold of 20 μg l 1 the maximum mc concentration measured was close to 3 mg l 1 in august 2015 interestingly a higher proportion of violations of water quality guidelines both drinking water and recreational was observed from 2009 to 2015 than in other periods fig 3b there were no mc violations of the drinking water quality guidelines registered in 2006 2008 nor in 2016 but it should also be noted that sample sizes were low n 25 in those years fig 3b records of mc violations of drinking water guidelines regularly occur from may through october but the frequency is more pronounced from mid summer to early fall fig 3c violations of recreational guidelines mainly occur from july to august although frequent violations have also been registered in september or even in october fig 3c the bernoulli model correctly classified 157 instances where the drinking water threshold 1 5 μg l 1 was not violated and the predicted probability of occurrence was similarly low p 0 5 there were no cases of non violation that were assigned a high probability of occurrence p 0 5 i e no false alarms table 1 however the model underestimated the number of mc violations experienced in the system predicting only 5 cases with high probability of occurrence p 0 5 out of 29 recorded violations 17 accuracy we thus infer that the bernoulli model is prone to predicting false negatives i e failure to predict the frequency of mc violations that actually occurred and cannot offer a reliable tool from a public health perspective in the bay of quinte table 1 nh 4 displayed a negative 0 33 0 21 relationship with the probability of mc violations in a bayesian context the significance of this result can be assessed with the odds ratio 2 2 the odds ratio or of a regression coefficient being negative positive is the ratio of the probability to be below above zero to the probability above below zero for the corresponding regression coefficient to be negative which was 16 2 1 in this particular case in a similar manner chl a displayed a strongly positive 0 89 0 29 association with mc violations characterized by an or of 930 1 table 2 we can also infer that the relationships between the likelihood of mc violations and water temperature 0 32 0 71 or tp concentrations 0 22 0 47 were negative but the ors 2 1 1 suggest that the corresponding coefficients were marginally discernible from zero the same pattern held true with our model intercept 1 59 4 66 i e the likelihood of mc violations when all four predictor variables tend to low values moreover the simple piecewise regression model suggests a breakpoint at the level of 1 97 ln μg chl a l 1 or 7 1 μg chl a l 1 where the nature of the relationship between mc and chl a concentrations changes from weakly 0 21 0 23 to strongly 0 96 0 15 positive fig 4 importantly the latter segment of this relationship comprises nearly all the daily snapshots from the system when mc violations of the drinking water standard occurred the segmented multiple regression model identified a significant mc breakpoint at the level of 0 54 μg l 1 or 0 62 0 08 in the logarithmic scale separating the relationship between environmental variables and mc concentrations into two regions table 2 the comparison of the posterior predicted median mc values against the measured ones was satisfactory r 2 0 73 fig 5 with a mean standard error of the estimate equal to 0 77 0 04 ln μg mc l 1 below the mc breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 our analysis suggests a fairly strong positive relationship of chl a 0 14 0 08 tp 0 22 0 15 and water temperature 0 34 0 25 with mc concentrations where the ors for the corresponding regression coefficients to be positive were 24 0 1 13 0 1 and 10 5 1 in contrast the signature of wind speed 0 29 0 39 and nh 4 0 08 0 07 was weakly negative with ors of a negative relationship equal to 3 4 1 and 6 9 1 respectively table 2 when mc concentrations exceed the breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 our analysis underscores the strongly positive association with chl a or 3 8 105 1 the negative relationship with the ambient tp or 19 1 1 and nh 4 or 80 8 1 levels and the weakly negative practically non discernible from zero effects of wind speed or 1 4 1 and water temperature or 1 1 1 table 2 to identify approximate thresholds of environmental predictors that increased the probability of exceedance of the 1 5 μg l 1 mc drinking water guideline we selected the values above or below which 80 of the daily snapshots recorded from the bay of quinte are characterized by a greater than 10 probability of exceedance of that threshold overall our analysis suggests the environmental conditions that appear to increase the probability of exceedance of the mc drinking water standard are chl a concentrations 7 μg l 1 water temperatures 20 c nh 4 concentrations 40 μg l 1 tp concentrations 25 μg l 1 and wind speeds 37 km h 1 fig 6 to demonstrate the applicability of our modelling exercise for risk management decisions we examined the frequency histogram of the predicted probability values from the stochastic segmented model or the probability of exceedance probabilities fig 7 in this histogram we included a benchmark value of 10 representing the maximum acceptable probability to violate the 1 5 μg mc l 1 drinking water guideline for each sample collected from the bay of quinte according to our analysis only 56 6 of the mean predicted probabilities of mc violations were below this benchmark and thus the probability of exceedances greater than 10 has been relatively high 45 over the course of the study period by contrast when we apply the same procedure for the likelihood of violations of the recreational 20 μg mc l 1 water quality guidelines we found that 98 9 of the mean predicted probabilities of mc violations were below the 10 benchmark employing an intermediate threshold between the two values established in the water resource management literature could serve as evidence of excessive risks when using the system for drinking water supply as well as an early warning sign about its suitability for recreational purposes for example if we opt for a 5 μg l 1 target the distribution of probabilities for mc violations had more than 89 of the daily snapshots recorded from the bay of quinte below the 10 benchmark it is also interesting to note that the same threshold was exceeded in 7 2 of the samples collected from all the sites during the study period from an operational standpoint the number of samples required during the growing season end of may early october in order to assess system compliance with targeted mc thresholds can vary from 30 to 216 depending on the number of locations monitored sampling frequency used and duration of the period examined table 3 for illustration purposes we created confidence of compliance graphs to evaluate the likelihood of compliance against two probabilistic criteria that stipulate less than 10 violations of two mc threshold concentrations i e 1 5 and 5 μg l 1 when we consider different sample sizes and prior beliefs fig 8 based on empirical evidence regarding the achievability of the two mc values in the bay of quinte the former target was assigned a conservative prior be 1 7 2 whereby we accorded relatively high probabilities to exceedance rates up to 20 fig 8a the latter mc threshold was given a more optimistic prior be 0 2 9 with a high probability assigned to very low exceedance rates 5 and practically negligible prior probabilities thereafter fig 8a according to the confidence of compliance graph fig 8c after collecting samples from four sites on a biweekly basis during two growing seasons n 80 see table 3 4 exceedances of the 1 5 μg mc l 1 threshold point a suggest our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be exceeded more than 10 is 87 0 similarly if we register 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8c then our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be violated by more than 10 will be 64 2 35 4 14 3 and 4 2 respectively intended to offer an early warning sign for the likelihood of impairment of the recreational guideline the confidence of compliance graph for the 5 μg mc l 1 target paints a more favorable picture with respect to the frequency of mc violations in the bay of quinte even if there are 4 violations after collecting samples from four sites on a biweekly basis over the course of two growing seasons our confidence of compliance with the mc standard will be 97 1 point a in fig 7d likewise 6 8 10 and 12 violations of the 5 μg mc l 1 target would suggest our confidence of compliance with lower than 10 violations of the mc target will be 87 4 64 1 35 5 and 15 2 points b e in fig 8d respectively as a final exercise we attempted to eliminate any subjectivity with the formulation of our prior beliefs and instead used empirical knowledge about the frequency of mc violations in the bay of quinte as depicted by the piecewise regression model with sole predictor the recorded chl a concentrations fig 3 in this case we formulated beta prior distributions with shape parameters derived from the predicted mean exceedance rate and the associated model error variance or residual variability it is interesting to note the similarity between the empirically derived priors and those based solely on our prior perception without any consideration of the available data fig 7a and b according to the mc estimates derived by the chl a data if there are again 4 exceedances of the drinking water guideline out of 80 samples collected during two growing seasons then our confidence of compliance that the standard will not be exceeded by more than 10 will be 93 6 fig 8e in a similar manner if we experience 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8e it would suggest that our confidence of compliance is 76 0 47 9 22 2 and 7 7 respectively when collecting the same sample size our degree of confidence with 4 violations of the 5 μg mc l 1 target will be 96 4 fig 8f interestingly the inference drawn degree of confidence of compliance remains consistently higher i e 82 5 56 2 28 6 and 10 4 if 6 8 10 or 12 violations of the same mc threshold points b e in fig 8f are registered over the course of two growing seasons 4 discussion owing to the increasing frequency of cyanobacteria dominated harmful algal blooms chabs as well as to their potential to inflict socioeconomic damages and ecological impairments predicting their occurrence and magnitude has become an essential management exercise in many freshwater ecosystems around the world in this study we used different statistical models parameterized with bayesian inference techniques to identify critical levels of key environmental factors that influence the exceedance risk of specific mc thresholds in the bay of quinte lake ontario canada our results suggest that chl a concentrations 7 μg l 1 tp concentrations 25 μg l 1 nh 4 concentrations 40 μg l 1 water temperatures 20 c and wind speed 37 km h 1 significantly increase the likelihood of violation of the drinking water advisory level for the bay of quinte these threshold values collectively reflect meso eutrophic conditions during periods of warm water and calm winds which were observed on approximately 17 of the sampling dates i e all sampling dates that met all five conditions and typically occur between late july and early september these environmental conditions are commonly experienced in the area particularly in summer months which suggests that high mc concentrations will continue to occur for the foreseeable future without any additional management interventions identifying reliable predictors of microcystin production using a bernoulli logistic regression model shimoda et al 2016 found that tp concentrations alone failed to predict exceedances of various levels of mc concentrations and concluded that more comprehensive modelling was needed to reliably predict drinking water violations building upon the recommendations of shimoda et al 2016 our application of the bernoulli logistic model with additional environmental variables also failed to reliably predict the occurrence of mc violations i e false negative predictions in contrast the delineation of two subsets on the basis of mc concentrations 0 54 μg l 1 as determined by our segmented multiple regression model allowed us to effectively accommodate non monotonic non linear relationships with environmental predictors and to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the risks of exceeding mc drinking water guidelines thus even though our modelling analysis in its current form cannot be used for forecasting purposes i e lack of predictors that reflect the antecedent conditions breakpoint on the response rather than on the explanatory variables it does allow to delineate critical values of explanatory variables associated with increased probability of exceedance of the drinking water standard moreover the fact that it is founded upon explanatory variables that are readily available from nearly all the monitoring programs in the great lakes and elsewhere see also the statistical models presented by shimoda et al 2016 provides a plausible framework upon which stronger causative foundation can be built by designing suitable lab field experiments or monitoring programs with finer granularity our modelling analysis identified chl a concentrations as the predictor variable with the strongest relationship with mc concentrations often used as an indicator of phytoplankton standing biomass in freshwater systems it includes all toxic and non toxic cyanobacteria and other algal taxa despite this fact chl a can be a significant predictor of mc violations harris and graham 2017 mc presence absence taranu et al 2017 or is positively correlated with mcs rinta kanto et al 2009 likewise there are also several attempts to identify chl a thresholds that could be associated with a higher likelihood of exceedance of selected health advisory mc levels for example taranu et al 2017 found that a high probability of exceeding mc concentrations of 1 6 2 0 μg l 1 occurred at tn concentrations 650 μg l 1 and cyanobacterial biomass 160 mg l 1 using a conditional probability approach hollister and kreakie 2016 estimated a 50 chance of exceeding health advisory mc thresholds of 1 and 2 μg l 1 when chl a concentrations reached 68 and 104 μg l 1 respectively when paired with low tn concentrations 570 μg l 1 yuan et al 2014 found a 10 chance of exceeding the 1 μg mc l 1 level when chl a concentrations were 37 μg l 1 see their fig 3 although the same probability level was also associated with a much lower chl a threshold 3 μg l 1 when tn concentrations were elevated 1100 μg l 1 our chl a threshold is apparently different from these estimates but it should also be noted that our analysis is focused on the variability recorded within a particular system as opposed to the cross sectional multi site character of the aforementioned modelling work that teased out information from broader regions chl a is used as an important indicator of the bay of quinte ecosystem state and a remediation target for chl a concentrations of 10 12 μg l 1 has been established for the restoration of water quality munawar et al 2012 however our analysis indicated that the average exceedance probability of the drinking water guideline ranges between 20 and 25 at these targeted concentrations see also the scatter of the predicted probabilities once the black vertical line in fig 6a is exceeded the role of cultural eutrophication in promoting harmful algal blooms in freshwaters is well established heisler et al 2008 pick 2016 but the causal linkages between exogenous nutrient enrichment and mc production is an on going debate e g see orihel et al 2012 scott et al 2013 in a similar manner the relationship between mcs and external nutrient loading remains unclear in the bay of quinte as a greater risk of exceedance of the drinking water guidelines was associated with intermediate tp and low nh 4 concentrations p availability is considered the primary limiting factor influencing cyanobacterial growth in freshwaters but the availability of various forms of n could be another important factor for the production of n rich mc and toxicity gobler et al 2016 and references therein elevated n levels have been associated with higher cellular quotas of mcs in the non diazotrophs microcystis and planktothrix and thus n enrichment particularly in p replete environments may increase mc production donald et al 2011 monchamp et al 2014 observed elevated mc concentrations in nh 4 depleted waters in quebec lakes regardless of the total cyanobacterial biomass observed along the same line of evidence microcystis is known to have high affinity for nh 4 and often displays superior uptake capacity for rapidly recycled reduced n under nitrogen limiting conditions mccarthy et al 2009 glibert et al 2014 given the presence of active nutrient cycling in the bay of quinte mediated by sediment diagenesis dreissenids excreta egesta and macrophyte decomposition arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 we hypothesize that once the internal nutrient pump begins to replenish the overlying water an interplay of increased p sequestration and rapid uptake of energetically favorable nh 4 may trigger microcystis growth and mc production considering the low summer ambient levels of all inorganic nitrogen forms nh 4 no 2 no 3 in the bay of quinte shimoda et al 2016 surmised that there are two additional factors that promote microcystis dominance i the selective dreissenid filtration that may be responsible for the reduced biovolume of n 2 fixers aphanizomenon spp and anabaena spp and ii the bioavailability of other nitrogen forms such as urea which can enter cells either via light independent transport or by diffusion and which produce two nh 4 per molecule of urea transported inside the cells in this case the need for active uptake of hco 3 at high ph is minimized and co 2 can be released by intracellular urease valladares et al 2002 flores and herrero 2005 donald et al 2011 although multiple studies have demonstrated the linkages between increasing water temperature and toxic cyanobacterial blooms jacoby et al 2000 wood et al 2017 fewer have directly connected temperature to ambient mc levels francy et al 2016 in our study we were able to identify a threshold of 20 c above which the exceedance likelihood of mc drinking water guidelines increases the cyanobacterium microcystis has been found to out compete other phytoplankton species at or above 25 c paerl and paul 2012 while the number of genes or transcripts associated with mc production increase with water temperature davis et al 2009 thus there is growing concern that increases in temperature due to global climate change will increase the frequency and magnitude of chabs and promote the growth of toxic strains of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 these changes have important implications for future water quality trends particularly in the bay of quinte for example trumpickas et al 2009 predicted future summer surface water temperatures in lake ontario to rise by 2 5 c above 1971 2000 norms under the intergovernmental panel on climate change a2 emissions scenario and by 2 25 c under the b2 scenario for the 2041 2070 period further nicholls 1999 predicted that an increase in average summer water temperature by 3 4 c would double the summer average tp concentrations in line with current warming trends maximum summer surface waters in the bay of quinte have warmed by almost 1 c from 1972 to 2008 minns et al 2011 if we also consider that the mean summer jun aug tp concentrations and surface water temperatures measured in the upper bay were approximately 32 μg l 1 and 23 c respectively then it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of mc violations will continue to be relatively high especially since the internal nutrient feedback loop is projected to remain active in the near future arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 to our knowledge few studies to date have examined the influence of physical conditions other than temperature in predicting mcs in freshwater lakes cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to take advantage of optimal nutrient and light conditions and thus could gain a competitive advantage over other eukaryotic phytoplankton under these conditions reviewed in watson et al 2015 leading to higher mc concentrations and increased risk of mc health advisory violations jacoby et al 2000 found that higher water column stability and decreased lake flushing were associated with a pronounced and prolonged toxic bloom of microcystis aeruginosa during summer 1994 in steilacoom lake washington usa although mc concentrations per gram of phytoplankton were found be unrelated to the prevailing environmental conditions except from soluble reactive phosphorus more recently wood et al 2017 found that an extended drought in the shallow eutrophic lake rotorua new zealand led to prolonged stratification increased dissolved reactive phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen concentrations which interacted with temperature to influence cyanobacterial mc cell quotas because direct measurements of water column stability were unavailable for the bay of quinte we used wind speed as a representative proxy of mixing conditions assuming a negative relationship whereby higher wind speeds reduce water column stability kann and welch 2005 this relationship would be particularly pronounced for locations in the middle and lower bay which are deep enough for stratification to occur throughout the year and thus wind driven mixing could interrupt water column stability to a greater extent at these locations nonetheless because the hypothesized strong negative association between wind speed and the probability of mc violations did not manifest itself in our modelling analysis future investigation of the direct role of physical lake dynamics and in particular water column stability and interactions with water temperature is clearly warranted in order to gain a better understanding of mc production dynamics setting probabilistic criteria for microcystin concentrations in the management of impaired waterbodies the establishment of probabilistic water quality criteria is often considered an effective strategy to deal with the inherent uncertainty and or our imperfect knowledge of natural systems e g mcbride and ellis 2001 shabman and smith 2003 zhang and arhonditsis 2008 mahmood et al 2014 smith and canale 2015 it is within this context that our statistical framework can assist with the development of realistic water quality criteria to track the occurrence of high mc levels or other cyanotoxins as demonstrated by the derived probability of exceedance probabilities in particular the bayesian nature of our work gives direct answers to questions of confidence of compliance with percentile standards see panels b e in fig 8 and as such can effectively guide management decisions and monitoring practices that consider both risks of reaching false conclusions i e falsely inferring a breach of standard or falsely inferring compliance mcbride and ellis 2001 instead of basing inference solely on the exceedance frequency level of a threshold mc concentration the estimated probabilities are regarded as a continuous variable about which we make confidence statements simply put we introduce an extra dimension of uncertainty by targeting the probability of an acceptable mc exceedance risk or margin of safety across all water samples taken zhang and arhonditsis 2008 mahmood et al 2014 the conceptual advantages of the proposed framework presumably come at the cost of having to state one s prior belief as to likely exceedance rates namely our first two illustrations were based on the formulation of prior distributions that reflected our subjective pessimistic or optimistic beliefs regarding the likelihood of compliance with two 1 5 and 5 μg mc l 1 targeted thresholds nonetheless this issue was rectified with our subsequent examples in which empirical knowledge from the system was used to characterize our prior beliefs that is the mean predictions about the achievability of the two targets along with the associated error of the simple piecewise regression model provided the basis for the specification of the shape parameters of our beta prior even more so a well known property of bayesian analysis is that the results from classical and bayesian statistics become more similar at larger numbers of samples as the information in the data increasingly dominates over that in the chosen prior distributions mcbride and ellis 2001 arhonditsis et al 2008 our confidence of compliance graphs can determine the optimal sample size that will allow to draw robust inference about the prevailing ambient conditions and address any criticism about the potential subjectivity with methodological practices followed from a management viewpoint our analysis suggests that the occurrence of chabs could be a manifestation of the tight control exerted by the sediments which act as a net source of phosphorus and the corresponding fluxes are likely magnified by the macrophyte and dreissenid activity e g nutrient pump effect and pseudofeces production kim et al 2013 according to recent empirical and modelling evidence arhonditsis et al 2016 doan et al 2018 the presence of significant nutrient regeneration mechanisms is primarily responsible for the elevated end of summer p 25 30 μg tp l 1 in the upper bay of quinte which in turn appears to be the first condition for structural shifts to occur in the algal assemblage see also the positive linkage between mc and tp concentrations below the breakpoint of 0 54 μg l 1 once ambient p is no longer a limiting factor the inter specific competition for energetically favorable nitrogen forms coupled with the water temperature and or water column stability are some of the factors that likely shape the development of chabs and production of toxins thus while additional reductions of the external point and non point nutrient loading are warranted it is also important to note that the ability of the sediments to modulate the relative abundance of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus forms indicates that the anticipated benefits may not be realized immediately and chabs may still occur in the near future in view of this prospect our analysis reinforces the pragmatic standpoint that the compliance rules should explicitly accommodate all the sources of uncertainty such as insufficient information lack of knowledge natural variability unaccounted ecological unknowns by adopting a probabilistic approach that permits a realistic frequency of violations 10 and satisfactory level of confidence 75 80 recognizing that chabs are inherently episodic events the compliance assessment should be based on multiple sites and over the course of two or three years as their nonoccurrence in a particular year does not necessarily guarantee that the problem has been eradicated we also recommend the introduction of an additional intermediate threshold value e g 5 μg mc l 1 between those used in the drinking 1 5 μg mc l 1 and recreational 20 μg mc l 1 guidelines that could serve as an early warning sign for an imminent highly toxic bloom especially since the water quality monitoring takes places in the open waters of the bay of quinte see monitoring sites fig 2 where the initiation of chabs frequently takes place the question arising is whether the precautionary spirit of our approach with the introduction of several layers of uncertainty is constructive or if it is overly conservative and runs the risk of perpetuating the management of impaired waterbodies with an overly alarmist mindset arhonditsis et al 2019 with respect to the latter issue the perspective of the public in the bay of quinte area has been positive that it does matter based on the responses of more than 1500 local residents and tourists ramin et al 2018 indicated that the degree of public satisfaction changes between the beginning and end of summer season following the gradual deterioration of the water quality conditions and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms importantly the same study showed a distinctly higher degree of satisfaction of the public when chl a concentrations remain below the 10 μg l 1 threshold or ambient tp levels are lower than 20 25 μg l 1 which is remarkably close with the critical levels of the two water quality variables associated with elevated risk of mc violations the fact that the sentiment of the public is clearly influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions offers ammunition to develop and implement an ambitious long term management plan that protects the bay of quinte from excess nutrients associated with urban runoff sewage treatment plants and agricultural land uses arhonditsis et al 2019 thus the presented probabilistic framework is intended to facilitate the policy making process in the area as the local water quality managers have long realized the expectation of a system that 100 satisfies the water quality standards is overly ambitious if not unrealistic given the currently prevailing conditions it is important though to communicate to the public that harmful algal blooms may still occur in the foreseeable future and their reduced frequency within a pre specified spatiotemporal domain is the most pragmatic way to evaluate the success of the local restoration efforts kim et al 2018 arhonditsis et al 2019 5 conclusions using the bay of quinte as a model ecosystem we demonstrated that the probability of violations of the mc drinking water guideline deemed protective of human and animal health increased significantly under specific thresholds of a suite of eutrophication indicators i e chl a nutrients and physical environmental variables our analysis highlights that nutrient management remains the best option to reduce the frequency of high mc events through their link in controlling chl a concentrations and undesirable shifts in the phytoplankton community composition in the context of environmental policy the uncertainty regarding the achievability of quality goals stemming from i the often unknown important drivers of ecological degradation ii the need to effectively balance environmental concerns with socioeconomic values and iii our desire to have contingency plans to deal with the unexpected should be a focal point when making management decisions and designing restoration monitoring plans accordingly the logic of our modelling framework is founded upon this concept and can be used to guide the decision making process in systems that experience episodic outbreaks of toxic cyanobacteria acknowledgment funding for this study was provided by the krembil foundation and national sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc

18653,there is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes args during wastewater treatment their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies in this study we used quantitative pcr qpcr to determine the abundance of nine args and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents from ten different european countries in order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies gene abundances in the latter were also analysed six out of the nine args analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples among the quantified genes inti1 and sul1 were the most abundant our results demonstrate that european wwtp contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions the args concentrations in wwtp effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps indicating a possible option for wwtp management furthermore this study has identified bla oxa 58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of wwtps on their receiving water graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater freshwater qpcr europe 1 introduction the evolution of antibiotic resistance has historically been viewed as a strictly clinical issue and considered to be exclusively related to the use and misuse of antibiotics ainsa 2002 in recent years the fate of antibiotic resistance genes args emitted from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp has received increasing attention berendonk et al 2015 jia et al 2017 lorenzo et al 2018 sabri et al 2018 stoll et al 2012 there is a worldwide consensus that raw municipal wastewater treated effluent wastewater and wastewater sludge where environmental bacteria with genetically different composition interact with each other are reservoirs of args auerbach et al 2007 ghosh et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and hotspots for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance caucci et al 2016 guo et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 even though treated wastewater contains significantly lower amounts of args than raw wastewater various researchers have demonstrated that the discharge of treated municipal wastewater can increase the quantities of args in the receiving water bodies amos et al 2018 jäger et al 2018 lapara et al 2011 pruden et al 2012 aquatic environments downstream of wwtps can eventually be enriched also with mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids integrative and conjugative elements ices transposons and integrons di cesare et al 2016 marano and cytryn 2017 van hoek et al 2011 which represent effective carriers of args including multi resistances currently little is known about the mechanisms controlling transport transfer and accumulation of args in these aquatic systems according to the scientific literature we hypothesize that wwtp effluents may serve as a source of args and mobile elements carrying resistance for downstream aquatic environments independent from the treatment processes in a specific wwtp and the country of origin freeman et al 2018 karkman et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in addition among the screened args and genetic elements we hypothesize that inti1 is the most abundant genetic component in both effluents and water environments relative to other antibiotic resistance elements that are being screened since it is a genetic platform enabling the capture of over a hundred known resistance gene cassettes gillings et al 2015 khan et al 2013 nevertheless studies on a larger geographic scale supporting these findings are still largely lacking this is unfortunate because it is generally accepted that args as environmental contaminants have to be monitored in order to generate information as a base for risk assessment berendonk et al 2015 a large scale geographic analysis of the levels of args discharged by wwtps comprising different treatment technologies and geographical locations and their effect on the receiving waters is still missing to obtain such data a method that can achieve high specificity based on targeted detection rendering reliable and reproducible quantifications and therefore quantifiable ranges of variation is the best choice real time quantitative pcr qpcr is currently the best candidate for such an application rocha et al 2018 accordingly the objective was to quantify the abundance of selected args and inti1 in wwtps effluents and their receiving waters across europe and to document the possible impact of wwtps on their receiving water ten antibiotic resistance determinants considered to be relevant indicators of the resistome of different environments berendonk et al 2015 rocha et al 2018 were investigated in this study the args conferring resistance to antibiotics of different classes such as beta lactams sulfonamides and tetracycline were chosen as recognised to be widely occurring in urban wastewater and water environments narciso da rocha and manaia 2016 szczepanowski et al 2009 the args encoding for broad bla kpc 3 and extended spectrum bla oxa bla ctx m and bla tem β lactamases esbl were chosen in relation to their ability to confer resistance against an essential class of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious disease graham et al 2016 the gene mcr 1 encodes colistin resistance and its occurrence and prevalence in wwtps and surrounding environments is still largely unknown poirel et al 2016 this gene is of particular interest because to the best of our knowledge it has only been detected in treated wastewater by two other groups hembach et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2017 the inti1 gene encoding the class 1 integron integrases is highly abundant in both wastewater and freshwater environments and therefore is commonly used as an indicator for anthropogenic pollution because of linkage to gene cassettes containing genes conferring resistance to antibiotics gatica et al 2016 power et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction two different sampling campaigns were performed in the first campaign 1 l of a 24 h composite treated wastewater samples were collected during three consecutive days 14th 15th and 16th of october 2014 from 16 urban wwtps in 10 different european countries france italy norway portugal germany netherlands cyprus turkey austria and united kingdom fig s1 table 1 all participants provided metadata e g weekly discharge averages wwtp characteristics weather conditions etc by filling in a common survey table 1 table s2 the second sampling campaign took place 11 months later 8th 9th and 10th september 2015 in addition to the wwtp effluent samples same procedure as in the first campaign the corresponding receiving water bodies were sampled as well four wwtps it no1 cy and de6 had to be excluded from this extended sampling because the receiving waters could not be accessed with reasonable logistic effort grab samples were collected both upstream and downstream of the discharge point of the wwtp volumes of 500 ml of water were collected from each of the two sides of the water body and subsequently mixed to obtain 1 l integrated grab sample in order to harmonize and standardise the sampling amongst the participating countries the downstream samples were taken at a specified distance from the wwtp equalling 10 times the width of the river after sampling the samples were transferred in sterile glass bottles to local laboratories where three 150 ml aliquots were filtered through polycarbonate membrane filters 0 22 μm and stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction dna was extracted from the three filters using the powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s instructions total dna was recovered in 100 μl of elution buffer and replicates were pooled to reduce variations in extraction efficiencies and sampling the concentration of extracted dna was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 thermo scientific waldham usa the extracted dna was stored at 20 c pending further analysis 2 2 quantification of antibiotic resistance genes a total of nine resistance genes bla tem bla oxa 48 bla oxa 58 bla ctx m 15 bla ctx m 32 bla kpc 3 sul1 tetm mcr 1 the 16s rrna encoding genes and the class 1 integron integrase inti1 gene were quantified qpcrs were performed in 20 μl reaction volumes in 96 well plates on a mastercycler ep realplex eppendorf hamburg germany containing 10 μl 1 luna universal qpcr master mix new england biolabs ipswich usa 0 5 μl of the respective primers stock concentration 10 μm 4 μl of nuclease free water and 5 μl of template dna 2 ng μl heβ et al 2018 the qpcr cycling conditions for all reactions were as follows 95 c for 10 min for dna polymerase activation followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 1 min at respective temperature for primer annealing and elongation table s1 melting curves were obtained to confirm amplification specificity both samples and standards were analyzed in technical duplicates all the analyses were performed in the same laboratory data analysis was performed by using the realplex software eppendorf ag hamburg germany and according to the procedures described in rocha et al 2018 abundance of the above listed args was quantified via qpcr targeting different fragments of args that were cloned into plasmid vectors and used as standards the fragments of 16s rrna inti1 sul1 and bla ctx m 32 were embedded into a single plasmid pnorm designed by christophe merlin for the norman project www norman network net hembach et al 2017 rocha et al 2018 stalder et al 2014 the rest of the args were quantified by using puc19 plasmids including the corresponding gene fragment heβ et al 2018 plasmid dna was extracted by a qiaprep spin miniprep kit hilden germany and used after linearization to generate a standard curve between 108 and 101 copy numbers in duplicate for each qpcr run 2 3 data analysis and statistics the impact of a wwtp on the receiving river is best reflected by the ratio of arg concentrations measured downstream and upstream of the discharge site cd cu in practice it is difficult to define and uniformize the cd and cu sampling sites and therefore assess how representative those values are for the respective cross sections moreover even though composed water samples from both river banks were used in this study the quality of the downstream measurements cd remains particularly sensitive to incomplete mixing while the downstream sample could have been taken very far from the wwtp so as to guarantee complete mixing of effluent and river water under all circumstances this option has not been adopted for two reasons on the one hand the measurements might easily be affected by further unknown sources of arg located between the effluent pipe and the sampling point on the other hand the effects of in stream processes such as settling and bacteria attachment would gain in importance as the travel time between the effluent and the downstream sampling site increases in view of these difficulties and also as an exercise to test whether the use of available data can be used to predict the dissemination of args in surface water it was decided to complement measured values of cd with independent estimates derived from the mass balance eqn 1 where ce and qe denote the concentration and discharge of the wwtp effluent respectively and qu represents stream flow upstream of the plant 1 cd cu qu ce qe qu qe as compared to measured values of cd the estimates computed with eqn 1 are unaffected by incomplete mixing or in stream processes nevertheless they are sensitive to inaccuracies in the flow rates qe and qu all statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in r version 3 4 4 the welch test was used to check for significant shifts in location and input data were log transformed as necessary where appropriate p values underwent conventional adjustment by holm s method to minimize the chance of false positive outcomes in multiple test problems holm 1979 data associated with the individual days of a sampling campaign were not aggregated into mean values but rather processed in original form so as to retain as much of the variance as possible 3 results 3 1 spatial overview of the abundance of args abundance in wastewater effluents in europe averaged bacterial abundance measured as 16s rrna genes was quantified in 16 different european effluents of wwtps over the two sampling campaigns also the abundance of nine args conferring resistance to beta lactams bla tem bla oxa 48 bla oxa 58 bla ctx m 15 bla ctx m 32 bla kpc 3 sulfonamides sul1 tetracycline tetm and polymixin mcr 1 and of the class 1 integrase gene inti1 were determined effluent samples from the two different sampling campaigns showed no considerable variation for each of the screened args in 50 of the cases the arg concentrations between the two campaigns did not differ by more than a factor of 2 inter campaign variations exceeding one order of magnitude were rarely observed 8 of the cases mostly attributed to a single plant in general the variation of the abundance of the analysed genetic determinants was consistent over all wwtps and therefore the absolute abundance args 100 ml of the analyzed genes could be ranked along the following order inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 fig 1 the limit of quantification loq of the screened genetic components ranged from 104 100 ml 16s rrna and inti1 to 103 100 ml sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 in addition it is important to note that mcr 1 bla oxa 48 and bla kpc 3 were not detected in all effluents the overall absolute abundance of args and inti1 in the wwtp effluent samples did not follow a clear geographical pattern fig s2 the samples from the wwtp in cyprus contained always the lowest abundance of args in effluents except in the case of bla ctx m 32 fig 1 illustrates the median of the measured absolute abundance essentially based on their absolute abundance three groups of genes can be distinguished 16s inti1 sul1 and tetm forming the group with the highest concentration resistance genes coding for beta lactamases bla tem bla oxa 58 bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 bla ctx m 15 and bla kpc 3 cluster forming a group with intermediate low concentrations the gene mcr 1 was detected and quantified in all of the investigated effluents except for no2 and cyp fig s2 3 2 absolute abundance of args in relation to wwtp characteristics in order to identify which parameter might affect the absolute abundance of args in each of the effluents of wwtps the collected data were separated into two main groups for each of the metadata parameters assessed for the wwtps nr of hospital beds in the catchment nr of biological stages cod effluent concentration nr of hospitals in the catchment geographical latitude plant size the results of the analysis are represented in fig 2 the only factor that shows a significant correlation with the absolute abundance of args is the number of biological steps both inti1 and bla tem p 0 001 together with 16s and sul1 p 0 01 are significantly reduced in wwtps combining a high loaded first step c removal with a subsequent low loaded second biological step n removal the same is noticeable for bla oxa 58 and tetm p 0 05 for all the other investigated parameters no clear trend or pattern correlating with args concentrations was observed 3 3 absolute abundance of args upstream of the wwtps during the second sampling campaign besides the wwtp effluents samples from the receiving river upstream and downstream of the discharge points were also collected the results of the measured absolute args abundance are also shown in fig 2 interestingly we can observe a similar ranking for the args abundance as in the wwtp effluent samples with some minor variation within the above formulated groups the observed pattern fig 3 shows that for most of the quantified genetic elements the absolute abundance is higher in wwtp effluents compared to upstream corresponding samples a more detailed analysis of fig 4 shows that with the exception of norway no2 tr at and de5 all the investigated locations show the same relation of the two sampling points effluent upstream for the most abundant analysed components bla oxa 58 sul1 tetm and inti1 while de5 and no2 do not show any considerable difference between upstream and effluent tr and at display a higher absolute abundance of args upstream than in the effluent suggesting that the receiving water body has eventually been exposed to a considerable source of args further upstream to the sampling point e g by combined sewer overflows garner et al 2017 or surface runoff almakki et al 2019 the absolute abundance of inti1 was always highest in all the locations and in both sampling points the only exceptions were the effluent of tr and nl in the rivers the mcr 1 gene has been detected in four cases upstream the wwtp tr pt de5 nl it was not possible to reliably quantify the gene as its number of copies per 100 ml was rarely above its loq 3 4 impact of wwtp effluents on the receiving river as outlined in sec 2 3 the impact of treatment plant effluents on the receiving rivers has been quantified in terms of the ratio cd cu relating the arg concentration downstream of the effluent site to the corresponding upstream value in accordance with expectation the ratio cd cu exceeded the value of 1 for the majority of wwtps and resistance genes indicating a rise in the in stream level of arg due to the plant effluent fig 4 however fig 4 also indicates that the estimated ratios are not strong predictors of resistance dissemination the use of measured arg concentrations at the downstream sampling site cd generally results in larger estimates of cd cu as compared to a situation where cd is approximated by eqn 1 since reliable hydrological information was unavailable for some canals and highly regulated rivers eqn 1 was not applicable everywhere and the analysis depicted in fig 4 was thus restricted to a total of nine locations for the genes mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla ctx m 32 and bla kpc 3 reliable estimates of cd cu could not be computed because the measured in river concentrations upstream cu of the plant were mostly close to below the loq of about 103 copies 100 ml 1 however downstream of the plants these args were quantifiable in many cases suggesting an impact of the effluent on the receiving water body advanced methods such as droplet pcr might be able to allow to precisely quantify low abundant args and could be used to investigate the impact of the effluents of wwtp on the receiving environments 4 discussion this study has achieved its first objective and produced a comprehensive qpcr dataset on quantified selected args in wwtp effluents and the receiving rivers across various european countries the data provided by this study give a first environmental standard for qpcr based quantifications of these selected args due to the uniform distribution pattern of absolute abundance of args throughout europe future studies can compare their quantifications to this study and conclude if they have detected comparatively high or low concentrations of args furthermore this investigation verifies previous case studies results that the analysed component with the highest concentration is intl1 followed by the sul1 gene which is often associated to class 1 integrons gillings et al 2015 furthermore the results demonstrated that the abundance of the analysed resistance genes could be clustered in three groups and these results were surprisingly consistent throughout europe the first group of abundant args consisted of the above mentioned inti1 and sul1 genes the second group of intermediate abundance with all values above the loq were tetm bla tem bla oxa 48 and bla oxa 58 the third group mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 and bla kpc 3 could be viewed as emerging args in the environment as they are detected at comparatively low abundance and sometimes the values did not pass the loq threshold however if scientists perform future studies and endeavour to compare their results to this study they should follow the guidelines given in rocha et al 2018 and heβ et al 2018 and they should be aware of the fact that an interlaboratory error margin or variation of up to 30 needs to be considered rocha et al 2018 if taken these considerations into account the values of the concentrations differ strongly to the here presented ones it can be concluded that the values might indicate unique local or regional processes 4 1 biogeography of args in european wwtp effluents this study is one of the first studies on a pan continental scale investigating the abundance and dissemination of args in wwtps and inland freshwater bodies absolute abundance of args did not exhibit biogeographical patterns in wwtp effluents this suggests that it is unlikely that environmental factors such as climate or latitude are driving the pattern of args in european wwtp effluents similar results have been documented by zhu et al 2017 for a continent scale study in china all across the sampled wwtps the most abundant genes were the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the sul1 gene coding for sulfonamide resistance both have been extensively reported to be identified as genetic markers associated with anthropogenic influenced environments such as wwtps gillings et al 2015 nardelli et al 2012 and surface waters receiving their treated effluents the samples originating from the cypriot wwtp effluents showed the lowest absolute abundance of args among the investigated plants possibly this result is due to the wastewater treatment technology used as a matter of fact unlike the other investigated wwtps the cyprus facility implements membrane mbr technology for the separation of treated water and activated sludge which has been proven to be an efficient technology to reduce the absolute concentration of both antibiotic resistant bacteria schwermer et al 2018 and subsequently args kappell et al 2018 due to particle retention our findings show that even wwtps that are equipped with a secondary clarifier are responsible for a significant reduction of four args sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem and inti1 considering the simultaneous reduction of 16s rrna this observation can be attributed to sedimentation of activated sludge particles in the clarifier the finding is in agreement with the results of previous studies li et al 2017 mcconnell et al 2018 that investigated the fate of the same genetic markers hospitals are generally considered a direct source of args hocquet et al 2016 szekeres et al 2017 varela et al 2013 according to our data however the number of hospitals and the number of hospitalized patients do not have a significant impact on the amount of args released from the wwtps the results rather confirm that hospital wastewater in terms of args load have a minor contribution 0 2 2 to the total amount of wastewater collected from an urban area buelow et al 2018 carraro et al 2016 this observation however does not preclude the possibility that locally hospitals may have an impact on the wwtp effluents furthermore it should be noted that neither effluent cod nor the size and geographical location latitude of the wwtp correlate to the concentration of args copies released from the treatment facilities 4 2 estimated effects of wwtps on downstream freshwater environments wwtps and their effluents represent a situation where a high diversity of bacteria antibiotics and other pollutants from the urban area mix together with environmental bacteria turning them into hotspots for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 pruden and arabi 2011 rizzo et al 2013 wu et al 2019 args have been extensively reported to be ubiquitous in both wastewater and in downstream environments across all europe freeman et al 2018 moura et al 2007 oberlé et al 2012 szczepanowski et al 2009 similarly our findings indicate that european wwtps are releasing treated effluent containing concentrations of args that are higher in absolute abundance than those measured in the receiving environment however the impact on the receiving water body cannot be deduced from the effluent concentration data alone but the discharge from the plant in relation to stream flow must be taken into account fig 4 our data suggest that the impact of a particular wwtp on the receiving river is determined by both the gene concentration in the effluent water and the local hydrological situation six out of ten measured genes were always detected bla tem bla oxa 58 bla ctx m 32 sul1 tetm inti1 in all sampling points upstream effluent and downstream for each of the screened locations fig 3 in this investigation special attention has been given to mcr 1 this arg located on highly mobile plasmids has been detected for the first time by liu et al 2016 in e coli isolated from raw meat and chinese inpatients it has been afterwards detected in bacterial isolates originated from pig farms or slaughterhouses of various countries such as mexico garza ramos et al 2018 japan kusumoto et al 2016 usa mcgann et al 2016 vietnam nakayama et al 2018 korea yoon et al 2018 and throughout europe el garch et al 2018 on the other hand the occurrence of mcr 1 in freshwater environments is confined to a limited number of studies hembach et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the most likely explanation for the numerous cases of reported presence of mcr 1 in this study in both wwtp effluents and surrounding environments is that this arg is widespread within european wwtps and that in accordance with hembach et al 2017 it is able to withstand the treatment processes and eventually to be persistent in downstream environments also in the case of the receiving rivers intl1 and sul1 were the most predominant genes and they are often used as proxies of anthropogenic pollution djordjevic et al 2013 domingues et al 2012 eckert et al 2018 in both wwtp and surrounding environments our results question the sole use of sul1 and inti1 as proxies at least in an urban environment as their concentrations in the wwtps and the receiving rivers are similar figs 1 and 3 making it difficult to assess the impact of a wwtp on the receiving system the reason may be that the receiving water is already enriched with genes such as inti1 or sul1 due to e g combined sewer overflows intensive agriculture or wwtp effluents located upstream of the sampling points note that the similar pattern of intl1 and sul1 is not surprising as they are suggested to be physically linked in many cases uyaguari díaz et al 2018 our data suggest that gene bla oxa 58 would be a better proxy since it often occurs at lower concentrations upstream but at higher concentrations in the wwtp effluent and downstream of the effluent figs 3 and 4 and supplement fig s3 and fig s4 in addition the concentrations of bla oxa 58 were always above the loq therefore this work encourages further studies on the prevalence of bla oxa 58 this arg has been considered to be almost exclusively associated with acinetobacter baumannii an opportunistic pathogen known to cause nosocomial infections heritier et al 2005 but recent studies have found bla oxa 58 also to be linked to several environmental bacteria genera suggesting that this arg is prevalent in more bacterial groups than originally thought hultman et al 2018 xin et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that many european surface waters are enriched with args due to the discharge of treated municipal wastewater see e g the cases of de2 de3 nl and pt in fig 3 nevertheless some unexpected local exceptions were also encountered as illustrated for example by the data of the austrian and turkish wwtp and their receiving rivers here future studies are warranted to find an explanation of these unusual exceptions fig 3 cases at and tr for several args and sampling points considerable mismatches between the observed and computed concentrations downstream of the wwtp were identified fig 4 these deviations possible reflect incomplete mixing between effluent and river water uncertainty in the hydrological information processed through eqn 1 or unknown sources and sinks of arg within the studied river sections interestingly the observed concentrations downstream of the wwtp were typically equal or even higher than anticipated from the mass balance eqn 1 suggesting that the emitted args do not undergo instant elimination from water phase generally the collection of consistent data in a multinational context turned out to be challenging specifically this study has identified two major critical points which should be considered for future studies a to obtain sound and complete information on the river catchment and the local hydrological situation the collection of reliable metadata must receive particular attention this should also include detailed attention towards potential pollution sources upstream the target impact point b to define an accurate sampling strategy aimed to minimize the risk of biased measurements resulting e g from incomplete mixing accordingly the downstream sampling site must be chosen with special care in spite of these challenges the study also demonstrated an unexpected consistency namely the ranking of arg abundances inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 was almost identical for all wwtps effluents and the receiving waters within europe and therefore these results may well be of general significance 5 conclusions the challenges connected to the study of antibiotic resistance in environmental reservoirs are mainly related to the definition and understanding of the processes behind the transport of contaminants in the different environmental matrices soil water sludge etc thus the identification of strategies to limit the spread of clinically relevant args is the driving force behind this work in this study we monitored wwtp effluents across europe and estimated their loadings of args in downstream water environments in order to provide basic data on the proliferation of args in the environment 5 1 specific implications include the following wwtp are responsible for the discharge of considerable amounts of args in the downstream water bodies abundance of the monitored genetic markers could be ranked according to the following order inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 the calculation of mass balances in order to evaluate the impact of wwtps on the receiving waters needs a carefully designed sampling scheme with repeated spatial and temporal sampling in the receiving waters along with detailed metadata on the catchment further research is needed to understand the dynamics that occur downstream of the wwtps in order to be able to reliably study and understand the fate and behaviour of args in natural environments this study has identified bla oxa 58 as a possibly suitable candidate resistance

18653,there is increasing public concern regarding the fate of antibiotic resistance genes args during wastewater treatment their persistence during the treatment process and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies in this study we used quantitative pcr qpcr to determine the abundance of nine args and a class 1 integron associated integrase gene in 16 wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents from ten different european countries in order to assess the impact on the receiving water bodies gene abundances in the latter were also analysed six out of the nine args analysed were detected in all effluent and river water samples among the quantified genes inti1 and sul1 were the most abundant our results demonstrate that european wwtp contribute to the enrichment of the resistome in the receiving water bodies with the particular impact being dependent on the effluent load and local hydrological conditions the args concentrations in wwtp effluents were found to be inversely correlated to the number of implemented biological treatment steps indicating a possible option for wwtp management furthermore this study has identified bla oxa 58 as a possible resistance gene for future studies investigating the impact of wwtps on their receiving water graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater freshwater qpcr europe 1 introduction the evolution of antibiotic resistance has historically been viewed as a strictly clinical issue and considered to be exclusively related to the use and misuse of antibiotics ainsa 2002 in recent years the fate of antibiotic resistance genes args emitted from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp has received increasing attention berendonk et al 2015 jia et al 2017 lorenzo et al 2018 sabri et al 2018 stoll et al 2012 there is a worldwide consensus that raw municipal wastewater treated effluent wastewater and wastewater sludge where environmental bacteria with genetically different composition interact with each other are reservoirs of args auerbach et al 2007 ghosh et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and hotspots for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance caucci et al 2016 guo et al 2017 rizzo et al 2013 even though treated wastewater contains significantly lower amounts of args than raw wastewater various researchers have demonstrated that the discharge of treated municipal wastewater can increase the quantities of args in the receiving water bodies amos et al 2018 jäger et al 2018 lapara et al 2011 pruden et al 2012 aquatic environments downstream of wwtps can eventually be enriched also with mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids integrative and conjugative elements ices transposons and integrons di cesare et al 2016 marano and cytryn 2017 van hoek et al 2011 which represent effective carriers of args including multi resistances currently little is known about the mechanisms controlling transport transfer and accumulation of args in these aquatic systems according to the scientific literature we hypothesize that wwtp effluents may serve as a source of args and mobile elements carrying resistance for downstream aquatic environments independent from the treatment processes in a specific wwtp and the country of origin freeman et al 2018 karkman et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in addition among the screened args and genetic elements we hypothesize that inti1 is the most abundant genetic component in both effluents and water environments relative to other antibiotic resistance elements that are being screened since it is a genetic platform enabling the capture of over a hundred known resistance gene cassettes gillings et al 2015 khan et al 2013 nevertheless studies on a larger geographic scale supporting these findings are still largely lacking this is unfortunate because it is generally accepted that args as environmental contaminants have to be monitored in order to generate information as a base for risk assessment berendonk et al 2015 a large scale geographic analysis of the levels of args discharged by wwtps comprising different treatment technologies and geographical locations and their effect on the receiving waters is still missing to obtain such data a method that can achieve high specificity based on targeted detection rendering reliable and reproducible quantifications and therefore quantifiable ranges of variation is the best choice real time quantitative pcr qpcr is currently the best candidate for such an application rocha et al 2018 accordingly the objective was to quantify the abundance of selected args and inti1 in wwtps effluents and their receiving waters across europe and to document the possible impact of wwtps on their receiving water ten antibiotic resistance determinants considered to be relevant indicators of the resistome of different environments berendonk et al 2015 rocha et al 2018 were investigated in this study the args conferring resistance to antibiotics of different classes such as beta lactams sulfonamides and tetracycline were chosen as recognised to be widely occurring in urban wastewater and water environments narciso da rocha and manaia 2016 szczepanowski et al 2009 the args encoding for broad bla kpc 3 and extended spectrum bla oxa bla ctx m and bla tem β lactamases esbl were chosen in relation to their ability to confer resistance against an essential class of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious disease graham et al 2016 the gene mcr 1 encodes colistin resistance and its occurrence and prevalence in wwtps and surrounding environments is still largely unknown poirel et al 2016 this gene is of particular interest because to the best of our knowledge it has only been detected in treated wastewater by two other groups hembach et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2017 the inti1 gene encoding the class 1 integron integrases is highly abundant in both wastewater and freshwater environments and therefore is commonly used as an indicator for anthropogenic pollution because of linkage to gene cassettes containing genes conferring resistance to antibiotics gatica et al 2016 power et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction two different sampling campaigns were performed in the first campaign 1 l of a 24 h composite treated wastewater samples were collected during three consecutive days 14th 15th and 16th of october 2014 from 16 urban wwtps in 10 different european countries france italy norway portugal germany netherlands cyprus turkey austria and united kingdom fig s1 table 1 all participants provided metadata e g weekly discharge averages wwtp characteristics weather conditions etc by filling in a common survey table 1 table s2 the second sampling campaign took place 11 months later 8th 9th and 10th september 2015 in addition to the wwtp effluent samples same procedure as in the first campaign the corresponding receiving water bodies were sampled as well four wwtps it no1 cy and de6 had to be excluded from this extended sampling because the receiving waters could not be accessed with reasonable logistic effort grab samples were collected both upstream and downstream of the discharge point of the wwtp volumes of 500 ml of water were collected from each of the two sides of the water body and subsequently mixed to obtain 1 l integrated grab sample in order to harmonize and standardise the sampling amongst the participating countries the downstream samples were taken at a specified distance from the wwtp equalling 10 times the width of the river after sampling the samples were transferred in sterile glass bottles to local laboratories where three 150 ml aliquots were filtered through polycarbonate membrane filters 0 22 μm and stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction dna was extracted from the three filters using the powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s instructions total dna was recovered in 100 μl of elution buffer and replicates were pooled to reduce variations in extraction efficiencies and sampling the concentration of extracted dna was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 thermo scientific waldham usa the extracted dna was stored at 20 c pending further analysis 2 2 quantification of antibiotic resistance genes a total of nine resistance genes

specificity both samples and standards were analyzed in technical duplicates all the analyses were performed in the same laboratory data analysis was performed by using the realplex software eppendorf ag hamburg germany and according to the procedures described in rocha et al 2018 abundance of the above listed args was quantified via qpcr targeting different fragments of args that were cloned into plasmid vectors and used as standards the fragments of 16s rrna inti1 sul1 and bla ctx m 32 were embedded into a single plasmid pnorm designed by christophe merlin for the norman project www norman network net hembach et al 2017 rocha et al 2018 stalder et al 2014 the rest of the args were quantified by using puc19 plasmids including the corresponding gene fragment heβ et al 2018 plasmid dna was extracted by a qiaprep spin miniprep kit hilden germany and used after linearization to generate a standard curve between 108 and 101 copy numbers in duplicate for each qpcr run 2 3 data analysis and statistics the impact of a wwtp on the receiving river is best reflected by the ratio of arg concentrations measured downstream and upstream of the discharge site cd cu in practice it is difficult to define and uniformize the cd and cu sampling sites and therefore assess how representative those values are for the respective cross sections moreover even though composed water samples from both river banks were used in this study the quality of the downstream measurements cd remains particularly sensitive to incomplete mixing while the downstream sample could have been taken very far from the wwtp so as to guarantee complete mixing of effluent and river water under all circumstances this option has not been adopted for two reasons on the one hand the measurements might easily be affected by further unknown sources of arg located between the effluent pipe and the sampling point on the other hand the effects of in stream processes such as settling and bacteria attachment would gain in importance as the travel time between the effluent and the downstream sampling site increases in view of these difficulties and also as an exercise to test whether the use of available data can be used to predict the dissemination of args in surface water it was decided to complement measured values of cd with independent estimates derived from the mass balance eqn 1 where ce and qe denote the concentration and discharge of the wwtp effluent respectively and qu represents stream flow upstream of the plant 1 cd cu qu ce qe qu qe as compared to measured values of cd the estimates computed with eqn 1 are unaffected by incomplete mixing or in stream processes nevertheless they are sensitive to inaccuracies in the flow rates qe and qu all statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in r version 3 4 4 the welch test was used to check for significant shifts in location and input data were log transformed as necessary where appropriate p values underwent conventional adjustment by holm s method to minimize the chance of false positive outcomes in multiple test problems holm 1979 data associated with the individual days of a sampling campaign were not aggregated into mean values but rather processed in original form so as to retain as much of the variance as possible 3 results 3 1 spatial overview of the abundance of args abundance in wastewater effluents in europe averaged bacterial abundance measured as 16s rrna genes was quantified in 16 different european effluents of wwtps over the two sampling campaigns also the abundance of nine args conferring resistance to beta lactams bla tem bla oxa 48 bla oxa 58 bla ctx m 15 bla ctx m 32 bla kpc 3 sulfonamides sul1 tetracycline tetm and polymixin mcr 1 and of the class 1 integrase gene inti1 were determined effluent samples from the two different sampling campaigns showed no considerable variation for each of the screened args in 50 of the cases the arg concentrations between the two campaigns did not differ by more than a factor of 2 inter campaign variations exceeding one order of magnitude were rarely observed 8 of the cases mostly attributed to a single plant in general the variation of the abundance of the analysed genetic determinants was consistent over all wwtps and therefore the absolute abundance args 100 ml of the analyzed genes could be ranked along the following order inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 fig 1 the limit of quantification loq of the screened genetic components ranged from 104 100 ml 16s rrna and inti1 to 103 100 ml sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 in addition it is important to note that mcr 1 bla oxa 48 and bla kpc 3 were not detected in all effluents the overall absolute abundance of args and inti1 in the wwtp effluent samples did not follow a clear geographical pattern fig s2 the samples from the wwtp in cyprus contained always the lowest abundance of args in effluents except in the case of bla ctx m 32 fig 1 illustrates the median of the measured absolute abundance essentially based on their absolute abundance three groups of genes can be distinguished 16s inti1 sul1 and tetm forming the group with the highest concentration resistance genes coding for beta lactamases bla tem bla oxa 58 bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 bla ctx m 15 and bla kpc 3 cluster forming a group with intermediate low concentrations the gene mcr 1 was detected and quantified in all of the investigated effluents except for no2 and cyp fig s2 3 2 absolute abundance of args in relation to wwtp characteristics in order to identify which parameter might affect the absolute abundance of args in each of the effluents of wwtps the collected data were separated into two main groups for each of the metadata parameters assessed for the wwtps nr of hospital beds in the catchment nr of biological stages cod effluent concentration nr of hospitals in the catchment geographical latitude plant size the results of the analysis are represented in fig 2 the only factor that shows a significant correlation with the absolute abundance of args is the number of biological steps both inti1 and bla tem p 0 001 together with 16s and sul1 p 0 01 are significantly reduced in wwtps combining a high loaded first step c removal with a subsequent low loaded second biological step n removal the same is noticeable for bla oxa 58 and tetm p 0 05 for all the other investigated parameters no clear trend or pattern correlating with args concentrations was observed 3 3 absolute abundance of args upstream of the wwtps during the second sampling campaign besides the wwtp effluents samples from the receiving river upstream and downstream of the discharge points were also collected the results of the measured absolute args abundance are also shown in fig 2 interestingly we can observe a similar ranking for the args abundance as in the wwtp effluent samples with some minor variation within the above formulated groups the observed pattern fig 3 shows that for most of the quantified genetic elements the absolute abundance is higher in wwtp effluents compared to upstream corresponding samples a more detailed analysis of fig 4 shows that with the exception of norway no2 tr at and de5 all the investigated locations show the same relation of the two sampling points effluent upstream for the most abundant analysed components bla oxa 58 sul1 tetm and inti1 while de5 and no2 do not show any considerable difference between upstream and effluent tr and at display a higher absolute abundance of args upstream than in the effluent suggesting that the receiving water body has eventually been exposed to a considerable source of args further upstream to the sampling point e g by combined sewer overflows garner et al 2017 or surface runoff almakki et al 2019 the absolute abundance of inti1 was always highest in all the locations and in both sampling points the only exceptions were the effluent of tr and nl in the rivers the mcr 1 gene has been detected in four cases upstream the wwtp tr pt de5 nl it was not possible to reliably quantify the gene as its number of copies per 100 ml was rarely above its loq 3 4 impact of wwtp effluents on the receiving river as outlined in sec 2 3 the impact of treatment plant effluents on the receiving rivers has been quantified in terms of the ratio cd cu relating the arg concentration downstream of the effluent site to the corresponding upstream value in accordance with expectation the ratio cd cu exceeded the value of 1 for the majority of wwtps and resistance genes indicating a rise in the in stream level of arg due to the plant effluent fig 4 however fig 4 also indicates that the estimated ratios are not strong predictors of resistance dissemination the use of measured arg concentrations at the downstream sampling site cd generally results in larger estimates of cd cu as compared to a situation where cd is approximated by eqn 1 since reliable hydrological information was unavailable for some canals and highly regulated rivers eqn 1 was not applicable everywhere and the analysis depicted in fig 4 was thus restricted to a total of nine locations for the genes mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla ctx m 32 and bla kpc 3 reliable estimates of cd cu could not be computed because the measured in river concentrations upstream cu of the plant were mostly close to below the loq of about 103 copies 100 ml 1 however downstream of the plants these args were quantifiable in many cases suggesting an impact of the effluent on the receiving water body advanced methods such as droplet pcr might be able to allow to precisely quantify low abundant args and could be used to investigate the impact of the effluents of wwtp on the receiving environments 4 discussion this study has achieved its first objective and produced a comprehensive qpcr dataset on quantified selected args in wwtp effluents and the receiving rivers across various european countries the data provided by this study give a first environmental standard for qpcr based quantifications of these selected args due to the uniform distribution pattern of absolute abundance of args throughout europe future studies can compare their quantifications to this study and conclude if they have detected comparatively high or low concentrations of args furthermore this investigation verifies previous case studies results that the analysed component with the highest concentration is intl1 followed by the sul1 gene which is often associated to class 1 integrons gillings et al 2015 furthermore the results demonstrated that the abundance of the analysed resistance genes could be clustered in three groups and these results were surprisingly consistent throughout europe the first group of abundant args consisted of the above mentioned inti1 and sul1 genes the second group of intermediate abundance with all values above the loq were tetm bla tem bla oxa 48 and bla oxa 58 the third group mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 and bla kpc 3 could be viewed as emerging args in the environment as they are detected at comparatively low abundance and sometimes the values did not pass the loq threshold however if scientists perform future studies and endeavour to compare their results to this study they should follow the guidelines given in rocha et al 2018 and heβ et al 2018 and they should be aware of the fact that an interlaboratory error margin or variation of up to 30 needs to be considered rocha et al 2018 if taken these considerations into account the values of the concentrations differ strongly to the here presented ones it can be concluded that the values might indicate unique local or regional processes 4 1 biogeography of args in european wwtp effluents this study is one of the first studies on a pan continental scale investigating the abundance and dissemination of args in wwtps and inland freshwater bodies absolute abundance of args did not exhibit biogeographical patterns in wwtp effluents this suggests that it is unlikely that environmental factors such as climate or latitude are driving the pattern of args in european wwtp effluents similar results have been documented by zhu et al 2017 for a continent scale study in china all across the sampled wwtps the most abundant genes were the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the sul1 gene coding for sulfonamide resistance both have been extensively reported to be identified as genetic markers associated with anthropogenic influenced environments such as wwtps gillings et al 2015 nardelli et al 2012 and surface waters receiving their treated effluents the samples originating from the cypriot wwtp effluents showed the lowest absolute abundance of args among the investigated plants possibly this result is due to the wastewater treatment technology used as a matter of fact unlike the other investigated wwtps the cyprus facility implements membrane mbr technology for the separation of treated water and activated sludge which has been proven to be an efficient technology to reduce the absolute concentration of both antibiotic resistant bacteria schwermer et al 2018 and subsequently args kappell et al 2018 due to particle retention our findings show that even wwtps that are equipped with a secondary clarifier are responsible for a significant reduction of four args sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem and inti1 considering the simultaneous reduction of 16s rrna this observation can be attributed to sedimentation of activated sludge particles in the clarifier the finding is in agreement with the results of previous studies li et al 2017 mcconnell et al 2018 that investigated the fate of the same genetic markers hospitals are generally considered a direct source of args hocquet et al 2016 szekeres et al 2017 varela et al 2013 according to our data however the number of hospitals and the number of hospitalized patients do not have a significant impact on the amount of args released from the wwtps the results rather confirm that hospital wastewater in terms of args load have a minor contribution 0 2 2 to the total amount of wastewater collected from an urban area buelow et al 2018 carraro et al 2016 this observation however does not preclude the possibility that locally hospitals may have an impact on the wwtp effluents furthermore it should be noted that neither effluent cod nor the size and geographical location latitude of the wwtp correlate to the concentration of args copies released from the treatment facilities 4 2 estimated effects of wwtps on downstream freshwater environments wwtps and their effluents represent a situation where a high diversity of bacteria antibiotics and other pollutants from the urban area mix together with environmental bacteria turning them into hotspots for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 pruden and arabi 2011 rizzo et al 2013 wu et al 2019 args have been extensively reported to be ubiquitous in both wastewater and in downstream environments across all europe freeman et al 2018 moura et al 2007 oberlé et al 2012 szczepanowski et al 2009 similarly our findings indicate that european wwtps are releasing treated effluent containing concentrations of args that are higher in absolute abundance than those measured in the receiving environment however the impact on the receiving water body cannot be deduced from the effluent concentration data alone but the discharge from the plant in relation to stream flow must be taken into account fig 4 our data suggest that the impact of a particular wwtp on the receiving river is determined by both the gene concentration in the effluent water and the local hydrological situation six out of ten measured genes were always detected bla tem bla oxa 58 bla ctx m 32 sul1 tetm inti1 in all sampling points upstream effluent and downstream for each of the screened locations fig 3 in this investigation special attention has been given to mcr 1 this arg located on highly mobile plasmids has been detected for the first time by liu et al 2016 in e coli isolated from raw meat and chinese inpatients it has been afterwards detected in bacterial isolates originated from pig farms or slaughterhouses of various countries such as mexico garza ramos et al 2018 japan kusumoto et al 2016 usa mcgann et al 2016 vietnam nakayama et al 2018 korea yoon et al 2018 and throughout europe el garch et al 2018 on the other hand the occurrence of mcr 1 in freshwater environments is confined to a limited number of studies hembach et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the most likely explanation for the numerous cases of reported presence of mcr 1 in this study in both wwtp effluents and surrounding environments is that this arg is widespread within european wwtps and that in accordance with hembach et al 2017 it is able to withstand the treatment processes and eventually to be persistent in downstream environments also in the case of the receiving rivers intl1 and sul1 were the most predominant genes and they are often used as proxies of anthropogenic pollution djordjevic et al 2013 domingues et al 2012 eckert et al 2018 in both wwtp and surrounding environments our results question the sole use of sul1 and inti1 as proxies at least in an urban environment as their concentrations in the wwtps and the receiving rivers are similar figs 1 and 3 making it difficult to assess the impact of a wwtp on the receiving system the reason may be that the receiving water is already enriched with genes such as inti1 or sul1 due to e g combined sewer overflows intensive agriculture or wwtp effluents located upstream of the sampling points note that the similar pattern of intl1 and sul1 is not surprising as they are suggested to be physically linked in many cases uyaguari díaz et al 2018 our data suggest that gene bla oxa 58 would be a better proxy since it often occurs at lower concentrations upstream but at higher concentrations in the wwtp effluent and downstream of the effluent figs 3 and 4 and supplement fig s3 and fig s4 in addition the concentrations of bla oxa 58 were always above the loq therefore this work encourages further studies on the prevalence of bla oxa 58 this arg has been considered to be almost exclusively associated with acinetobacter baumannii an opportunistic pathogen known to cause nosocomial infections heritier et al 2005 but recent studies have found bla oxa 58 also to be linked to several environmental bacteria genera suggesting that this arg is prevalent in more bacterial groups than originally thought hultman et al 2018 xin et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that many european surface waters are enriched with args due to the discharge of treated municipal wastewater see e g the cases of de2 de3 nl and pt in fig 3 nevertheless some unexpected local exceptions were also encountered as illustrated for example by the data of the austrian and turkish wwtp and their receiving rivers here future studies are warranted to find an explanation of these unusual exceptions fig 3 cases at and tr for several args and sampling points considerable mismatches between the observed and computed concentrations downstream of the wwtp were identified fig 4 these deviations possible reflect incomplete mixing between effluent and river water uncertainty in the hydrological information processed through eqn 1 or unknown sources and sinks of arg within the studied river sections interestingly the observed concentrations downstream of the wwtp were typically equal or even higher than anticipated from the mass balance eqn 1 suggesting that the emitted args do not undergo instant elimination from water phase generally the collection of consistent data in a multinational context turned out to be challenging specifically this study has identified two major critical points which should be considered for future studies a to obtain sound and complete information on the river catchment and the local hydrological situation the collection of reliable metadata must receive particular attention this should also include detailed attention towards potential pollution sources upstream the target impact point b to define an accurate sampling strategy aimed to minimize the risk of biased measurements resulting e g from incomplete mixing accordingly the downstream sampling site must be chosen with special care in spite of these challenges the study also demonstrated an unexpected consistency namely the ranking of arg abundances inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 was almost identical for all wwtps effluents and the receiving waters within europe and therefore these results may well be of general significance 5 conclusions the challenges connected to the study of antibiotic resistance in environmental reservoirs are mainly related to the definition and understanding of the processes behind the transport of contaminants in the different environmental matrices soil water sludge etc thus the identification of strategies to limit the spread of clinically relevant args is the driving force behind this work in this study we monitored wwtp effluents across europe and estimated their loadings of args in downstream water environments in order to provide basic data on the proliferation of args in the environment 5 1 specific implications include the following wwtp are responsible for the discharge of considerable amounts of args in the downstream water bodies abundance of the monitored genetic markers could be ranked according to the following order inti1 sul1 tetm bla oxa 58 bla tem bla oxa 48 bla ctx m 32 mcr 1 bla ctx m 15 bla kpc 3 the calculation of mass balances in order to evaluate the impact of wwtps on the receiving waters needs a carefully designed sampling scheme with repeated spatial and temporal sampling in the receiving waters along with detailed metadata on the catchment further research is needed to understand the dynamics that occur downstream of the wwtps in order to be able to reliably study and understand the fate and behaviour of args in natural environments this study has identified bla oxa 58 as a possibly suitable candidate resistance

18654,the mass transport processes always accompany the flow phenomena and have attracted many researchers a lot of numerical methods have been developed to study them these numerical methods can be classified into the eulerian and the lagrangian approaches the lagrangian approach has advantages in high stability and simplicity over the eulerian approach but suffers from heavy computational cost in this paper we are mainly concerned with the trade offs between the accuracy and computational cost when applying the random walk method which is a lagrangian approach for examining the mass transport scenario we introduce a linear model to assess the accuracy of the random walk method in several computational configurations studies on computational parameters i e the size of time step and number of particles are conducted with the focus on estimation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l in steady flows the results show that the proposed linear model can satisfactorily explain the computational accuracy both in sample and out of sample furthermore we find a constant dimensionless parameter which quantifies a generic relationship between the accuracy and the number of particles regardless of the flow and diffusion conditions this dimensionless parameter is of theoretic value and offers guidelines for choosing the correct computational parameters to achieve the required numerical accuracy graphical abstract image 1 keywords random walk method mass transport error analysis longitudinal dispersion coefficient weak convergence stochastic differential equation 1 introduction mass transport phenomena in fluid exist widely hence extensive studies have been conducted by many researchers since the middle of the last century generally the numerical methods for mass transport problems can be classified into either eulerian or lagrangian approaches the eulerian approach solves the mass transport equations on a control volume basis which is in a similar form as that for the flow field calculation consequently eulerian approach is grid based and has gained its popularity on studying mass transport in finite computational domain benkhaldoun et al 2007 benson et al 2017 liang et al 2010 the selection of the size of time step δt in eulerian approach often depends on the grid size δx for example the size of the time step is restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy condition for pure advection equation i e δt must be less than the time taken for the fluid with varying state to travel to adjacent grid points for the pure diffusion equation the explicit scheme such as the central differencing scheme requires δ t δ x 2 2 d where d is the diffusion coefficient the relative dominance of the advection or diffusion constraint can be assessed using the peclet number pe given by p e u δ x d where u is the local flow velocity on the other hand the lagrangian approach a powerful method from individual particles perspective has been widely applied as a counterpart of the eulerian one although the flow field is traditionally solved through eulerian approach it has also been increasingly solved by lagrangian methods for example the incompressible navier stokes equations have been solved by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method shao and gotoh 2005 shao and lo 2003 the lagrangian approach uses a large number of discrete massless particles to represent the pollutant cloud and tracks the pathway of each individual particle the concentration as well as other parameters such as the dispersion coefficient can be obtained by studying the statistics of these particles trajectories or their total ensemble by definition the lagrangian approach is perfectly conservative and free from artificial diffusion near the steep concentration gradients besides this mesh free scheme limits its computation to the regions that the pollutant reaches while the computation in eulerian approach always needs to cover the entire flow domain regardless of the presence of the pollutant some more merits of lagrangian approaches have been reported in recent years zhang and chen 2007 found the lagrangian approach performed better than the eulerian one in the unsteady state condition saidi et al 2014 concluded that eulerian method cannot be applied to problems involving low concentration of particles while its lagrangian counterpart can well detect the particles wu and liang 2019 and yang et al 2019 compared the two algorithms through designed cases and found the lagrangian approach achieved higher accuracy the advantages of the lagrangian method listed above are accompanied by the high computational cost which has been well recognized möbus et al 2001 neuman 1993 zhang and chen 2007 furthermore much less guidance has been reported concerning the selection of computational parameters in the lagrangian approach than that in the eulerian ones as seen in the description of the method the amount of the computation depends on two parameters the number of particles n to present the pollutant cloud and the size of the computational time step δt therefore the choices of n and δt are crucial to the efficiency of the random walk method according to many simulation cases in different aquatic environments the more particles applied and the smaller the time step is the more accurate and stable the simulation results will be although these often lead to greater computational load hence it is necessary to optimize the selection of the number of particles and the size of the time step the random walk method studied in this paper is a typical representative of the lagrangian approach unfortunately there is little literature mentioning a detailed and optimized selection of these parameters for the random walk method applied in hydraulics and hydrodynamics therefore in this paper we empirically studied the impact of particles number and size of time step on the accuracy of longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the random walk method for steady flow with the aim to minimize its computational cost and control the error of simulation for future studies first the theory of random walk method is introduced then an error model of n and δt is presented which is commonly used for stochastic differential equations sde in the current mathematical framework of the accuracy analysis in sde approximations the coefficients of n and δt in the error model do not have analytical expressions and thus need to be estimated by case studies the estimation of coefficients is usually difficult in practical situations which requires careful experiment design in addition to huge computational cost in this study we have conducted the error analysis based on two types of steady flow for this model couette flow and open channel flow in both types of steady flow a dimensionless parameter of n is found to be a constant shedding light on the possibility of the priori optimization of the simulation accuracy for the couette flow it is found that the error model degrades into a simpler form i e linear relationship with n by a constant dimensionless parameter while δt has little impact on the results as long as it does not exceed a threshold in the end we attempted to give some theoretically explanations for the model for potential applications findings of this paper can be used to accelerate the sde related simulations in water research 2 theoretical background 2 1 random walk method the random walk method originates from statistical physics which has been used to model movement in a wide variety of contexts from time series of financial markets hamid et al 2017 mishra et al 2015 to the dispersion in porous media de anna et al 2013 sole mari et al 2017 in the simulation of mass transportation a large number of particles are released to represent the pollutant cloud in the flow the trajectories of each particle are tracked then the streamwise variation of the ensemble of particles will reveal the dispersion rate i e the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the process is illustrated in fig 1 with takes the fully developed turbent open channel flow as an example an ensemble of particles are released at time t 0 and then move along the x axis the histogram of the particles reveals the concentration at different times after the release as shown in the bottom subfigure the displacement of each particle during each time step in the random walk method is described by eq 1 to simplify the derivation we take the one dimensional case here 1 d x a x t t d t b x t t d w t which consists of a deterministic component a x t t d t and a random component b x t t d w t w t here denotes a standard wiener process while x t denotes the x axis position of each particle at time t we introduce p x t as the conditional probability density for x t which subjects to the fokker planck equation as 2 p t x a x t p 1 2 2 x 2 b x t 2 p a more thorough analysis can be referred to the classic book in the field of statistics gardiner 2004 the above analysis shows that the distribution of particles that move according to eq 1 which is the ito stochastic differential equation sde satisfies the fokker planck equation i e eq 2 meanwhile eq 2 is similar in form to the mass transport equation the probability density p is equivalent to the concentration c which is the foundation of the diffusion advection phenomenon shown as eq 3 3 c t x u c x d c x where d is the diffusion coefficient u is the velocity of the flow t is time by now we connected the ito sde with the mass transport equation which is the bedrock of the random walk method in hydraulics we use the longitudinal dispersion coefficient denoted as d l to quantitatively analyze the mixing rate of pollutants in shear layers which is a key parameter in water quality modeling as a measure of the spatially averaged spreading rate of a tracer cloud d l could be determined by analyzing the statistics of the positions of a large number of particles after a certain time has elapsed since the release of the particle ensemble known as the fickian limit the standard deviation of particles positions in the longitudinal direction increases linearly with time so that d l converges into a constant by then d l can be calculated through the time change of the longitudinal variance of the particle ensemble as 4 d l 1 2 σ x t 2 σ x t 1 t 2 t 1 in this paper we conduct error analysis on the simulation of d l which is a typical example of weak convergence approximation for sdes peter e kloeden 2007 a strong convergence approximation for sdes is needed when the trajectories of the ensemble of particles are taken into considerations while a weak convergence approximation is applicable when only the distribution of the particles is concerned the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be calculated from the particle distribution and its development with time rather than from the trajectories hence the weak convergence analysis is adopted here 2 2 error analysis in the field of mathematics and finance the statistical features of sde have been well developed first the sde in eq 1 is discretized by a simple euler discretization with time step δt as eq 5 5 x n 1 x n a x n t n δ t b x n t n δ w n in our case d l depends on the distribution of the particle ensemble which is effectively related to the time varying probability distribution p x t as described in eq 2 and eq 4 to calculate d l we want to compute the expectation of f x t i e e f x t where f x is a scalar function with a uniform lipschitz bound giles 2008 to be specific in our context f x t is the function that maps the ensemble of particles into d l at instant t where t indicates the time after the fickian limit to obtain e f x t the simplest estimation would be the mean of the discrete values f x t δ t from n independent path simulations as shown in eq 6 6 y n 1 i 1 n f x t δ t i in computational mathematics it is well established that provided that a x t and b x t satisfy certain conditions bally and talay 1996 peter e kloeden 2007 talay and tubaro 1990 the expected mean square error mse in the estimate y is asymptotically of the form expressed in eq 7 7 m s e c 1 n 1 c 2 δ t 2 which implies that the mse comes with two sources error due to the limited number of particles n and the size of time step δt giles 2015 therefore as long as c 1 and c 2 are established the relationship between the choice of particles number n and the time step δ t will be known given the required mse of d l it is also worth mentioning that δt actually affects mse in a much more complex way which follows a polynomial function with a dominating quadratic component bally and talay 2009 in practice c 1 and c 2 are usually unknown and have to be estimated case by case which is undesirable in this study we collect evidence from different cases and try to establish some general guidelines for finding c 1 and c 2 that are independent of water environment configurations such as flow field and diffusion coefficient 3 case studies 3 1 couette flow we first choose the dispersion phenomenon in couette flow to verify the error analysis model because this laminar shear flow gives the analytical solution for d l as fisher first derived it in 1979 as shown in eq 8 8 d a n a l y t i c a l u 2 h 2 120 d y in the couette flow water flow is assumed to go through two parallel plates of infinite extent with the top plate moving at velocity u compared to the bottom one the width between these two parallel plates is h and d y is the diffusion coefficient in the transverse direction 3 1 1 demonstration in a particular flow condition firstly the random walk method has been applied on a verification case whose parameters are presented in table 1 with 100 000 particles and time step as 0 001 s the simulated longitudinal dispersion coefficient is compared with the analytical solution and the accuracy of this lagrangian approach has been validated as fig 2 many simulations are carried out with different numbers of particles n and time steps δ t as presented in table 2 the results will be used to fit the parameters c 1 and c 2 in eq 7 under each set of δ t and n the random walk simulation was run for 20 times in each run the simulated d l was compared with the analytical d l hence the error for each run was obtained the mse of d l was calculated through the mean square error of the 20 simulations for one combination of the particles number n and time step δ t the target parameters are the c 1 and c 2 in eq 7 meanwhile 30 sets of δ t and n shown in table 2 are available for fitting this is a typical linear regression problem and the target is to estimate two coefficients c 1 and c 2 of the two variables n δ t we choose the ordinary least squares ols method to find c 1 and c 2 for the case in table 1 we obtained c 1 125 8463 1 5850 and the fitted r s q 0 9315 which represents the fraction of the total sum of squares of mse that the model explains please note that the linear model does not contain an intercept thus the rsq value should be interpreted as the fraction of total sum of squares of the error explained by the model rather than the total variance explained by the model the regression results are as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 to verify the model s predictive ability for the mse of d l in eq 7 we use out of sample test for the model this out of sample test is carried out as follows we generate another set of δt and n combinations 8 randomly chosen cases which are within the limit of the sets for fitting as shown in table 3 and then run simulations to test the goodness of using the fitted c 1 and c 2 above in predicting the mse of d l the results are shown in fig 4 in this out of sample test the r s q value is 0 8999 indicating that 89 99 of the total sum of squares of the mse of the d l can be captured using this set of c 1 and c 2 values which is also close to the r s q value previously obtained from the parameter fitting procedure given the satisfactory predictability of the model in the out of sample test which is comparable to the in sample fitting the linear model introduced in eq 7 is verified to be a good model which can be used to estimate the mse of d l given different input of n and δt in addition the ols approach we have adopted for estimating the values of c 1 and c 2 is validated as an appropriate approach 3 1 2 nondimensionalization for different conditions besides the case we studied above more flow conditions of couette flow were tested for each flow conditions c 1 and c 2 were estimated and the r s q of them were calculated as shown in the upper part of table 4 we can see that among all the conditions the r s q values are quite high above 0 9 the t statistics of c 1 are significantly large and p values of c 1 are less than 0 1 significance level thus these tests provide further evidence to support the linear model established in the previous section the nondimensionalization step is to study the coefficient c 1 and c 2 in a dimensionless perspective to nondimensionalize these two parameters we divide d l by d l a n l and divide δt by d y h 2 we then replace the original d l and δt with these rescaled values denoted as d l n d i m and δt n d i m other methods of nondimensionalization have also been tried as listed in table 4 in the research data uploaded alongside but here we select the one that works best then we repeat the ols fitting for the set of parameters c 1 and c 2 again using these nondimensionalize values d l n d i m and δt n d i m the refitted c 1 and c 2 are donated as c 1 n d i m and c 2 n d i m respectively the lower part of table 4 shows the c 1 n d i m and c 2 n d i m values estimated using this nondimensionalizing approach we can see that the dimensionless values of c 1 n d i m are close to 2 for all flow conditions this indicates a theoretical explanation behind we have tried to change 1 2 to 1 5 in eq 4 found c 1 n d i m remains around 2 implying 1 2 in eq 4 is not the reason for this number 2 therefore further research should be done to unravel the theory c 1 n d i m 2 enables us to provide predictions for c 1 in different scenarios once we know the parameters for the flow environment such as u h and d y without the need to conduct simulations again to prove that c 1 n o n d i m 2 we choose another 25 sets of n and δt as listed in table 4 in the research data uploaded alongside the values of n and δt are selected because we want to minimize the mse from δt abbreviated as m s e δt thus mse due to n abbreviated as m s e n is predominant each combination of n and δt is used in the random walk model for the simulation of the flow case in table 1 for 20 times then the mse can be obtained for this set of n and δt meanwhile with c 1 n o n d i m 2 and comparatively small m s e δt the mse predicted by the error model can be calculated as m s e n d i m m s e n d l a n a 2 2 n 1 the measured mse are then compared with the predicted mse as shown in fig 5 the black line which represents the predicted mse can fit the measured mse well illustrated by red dots with c 1 n o n d i m 2 the predicted mse explained 89 9 of the total sum of squares of the measured mse therefore the inference that c 1 n o n d i m 2 for couette flow is tenable however we are unable to find a unified dimensionless value for c 2 in the current stage it can be seen from table 4 and table 4 in the research data uploaded alongside that the estimation of c 2 which implies the influence of δ t has much lower confidence one possible reason for such inaccuracy may be that the weights that two parts carry are not balanced therefore we tried more sets of n and δ t 86 sets in total with a very large number of n fixed at 50000 i e using 50000 particles to reduce the part of mse due to the number of particles assuming m s e n 2 n 1 stands true the time step part of error m s e δ t can then be obtained by subtracting m s e n from the total mse we then plotted the relationship between m s e δ t and size of time step as fig 6 a compared with that of the particles numbers as shown in fig 5 m s e δ t are scattered randomly around the zero line with no evident regularity such a distribution implies that the accuracy of the numerical simulation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l in couette flow may be independent of the size of the time step i e c 2 0 this conclusion is confirmed by fig 6 b which shows that all the development lines of d l converge together for δ t from 20s to as large as 400s in conclusion the choice of the size of the time step in the given steady flow actually has very little impact on the simulation of the d l this evidence is also in line with the large p values of c 2 in table 4 suggesting c 2 0 3 2 open channel flow the above conclusions might be a special case regarding the couette flow hence we also did simulations on another steady flow condition e g open channel flow with logarithmic velocity distribution interestingly we reached the same conclusion c 1 n d i m 2 and d l is irrelevant with the size of time step in a certain range when velocity is small enough however when the velocity is moderately large it can be noticed that a larger d l leads to a larger mse the analytical solution for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l a n l of logarithmic flow as well as the flow conditions can be found in the research data uploaded alongside fig 7 shows the results by these varying δ t from 0 1s to 0 5s with the same particles number 50 000 as can be seen despite the differences in the sizes of the time step there is some small difference among the simulated d l the simulation of d l for open channel flow is dependent on δ t although the impact is relatively small in this range the impact of n and δ t is displayed in details in table 5 the same ordinary least squares ols method is utilized to find the values of c 1 and c 2 we also extend the calculation to other flow conditions as listed in table 5 and nondimensionalization was done by the same method as illustrated in the above section again c 1 n d i m converges to 2 after being nondimensionalized despite the changing of flow conditions the confidence of such a regression model is quite high as proved by the high value of the r s q in all configurations however impact of the time step is now more obvious in the open channel flow than that in the couette flow the 2nd and the 3rd columns show that a significant non zero c 2 can be estimated from simulations when the flow velocity is larger than 0 05 m s suggesting a positive impact of time step on the simulated error although the estimated coefficient c 2 seems to be small the modeled relationship between it and the measured mse is strong and cannot be omitted as indicated by the large t statistics and the p values associated with it these results are consistent with eq 7 the m s e n for different particles numbers are plotted in fig 8 the red dots are the measured mse from 20 runs of the model while the black line shows the predictions made with c 1 n d i m 2 it is clear that the larger number of particles leads to the smaller m s e n besides the predicted black line can well fit the measured data with rsq 96 2 4 discussions 4 1 error due to the particle number the random walk scheme which tries to use a relatively smaller number of samples to approximate the probability distribution belongs to the class of monte carlo methods monte carlo methods are popular methods in many fields and the error analysis of the monte carlo methods has been well studied it is known that as mackay 2003 claimed monte carlo methods are usually used to solve two problems 1 to generate samples x r r 1 r from a probability distribution p x 2 to estimate expectations of functions ϕ x under this distribution suppose a set of n samples x i i 1 n is generated from a probability distribution p x we can then obtain an estimator φ ˆ by using the following equation 9 φ ˆ 1 n i 1 n ϕ x i this estimator φ ˆ is an unbiased estimator of the expectation of ϕ furthermore the variance of φ ˆ will decrease as σ 2 n where σ 2 is the variance of ϕ in our case given a known time discretization euler discretization and all other initial setups of a simulation we are actually trying to use n particles to track their trajectories x i i 1 n and ϕ x i here is the function for longitudinal dispersion coefficient φ ˆ is the estimator for ϕ x i i e d l therefore the left side of eq 9 is the simulated d l the variance of the simulated d l hence will decrease as σ 2 n σ 2 here is the variance of ϕ since φ ˆ is an unbiased estimator the variance and the mean square error mse are equivalent thus the mse due to the limited number of particles denoted as m s e n will decrease as σ 2 n i e m s e n σ 2 n since the initial conditions and other settings of simulations are fixed the target probability distribution p x although unknown is a determined distribution thus its variance σ 2 is constant therefore m s e n σ 2 n can be expressed as m s e n c 1 n 1 where c 1 is a constant to be determined in different cases and is dependent on the variances of the p x 4 2 error due to the size of the time step the calculation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which concerns the ensemble of the particles cloud rather than the exact trajectory of each particle belongs to weak convergence approximation of sde bally and talay 1996 it has been proved that the euler scheme one of the simplest discretization schemes and the one we used in the paper converges with a weak order of 1 i e the mean square error due tothe discretization scheme is proportional to the square of δ t as indicated in eq 7 this becomes noticeable in open channel flow case studies with a large flow speeds 5 conclusions it is well known that the choice of the number of particles n and the size of time step δt is of vital importance in the implementation of random walk methods the choice of these two parameters in random walk methods relies on the balance between the accuracy measured as mse and the computational cost in this paper we present an empirical study on the reliance of the mse of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l on these two parameters in a quantitative approach the following conclusions are made for steady flows 1 after nondimensionalization i e normalizing d l by the analytical value d l a n l the value of c 1 n d i m converges to a constant of 2 regardless of the flow conditions 2 for the couette flow the accuracy of the random walk simulations for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient seems to be independent of δt however when the velocity profile is highly nonlinear extremely large δt values will decrease the accuracy of the random walk simulation therefore a relatively large time step δt can be applied to minimize the computational expenses without compromising the accuracy for the numerical simulation of d l in certain steady flows however the time step must be limited for the correct treatment of boundary conditions and source terms furthermore given that the nondimensionalized value c 1 n d i m 2 is valid for any flow conditions the absolute value of c 1 can be calculated as 2 d l a n l 2 once the analytical solution or empirical value of the dispersion coefficient d l a n l 2 is known the relationship between the accuracy of predicted d l value and the computational parameters can be expressed by 10 m s e c 1 n 1 this degraded error model provides guidance on the choice of the number of the particles needed to achieve the desired accuracy on the other hand it can be used to estimate the computational uncertainty m s e n for a given value of n in different flow scenarios we are currently extending this research to unsteady flows and the related details will be described in another paper both the dispersion coefficient and other parameters will be examined by our error model for the random walk simulations declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18654,the mass transport processes always accompany the flow phenomena and have attracted many researchers a lot of numerical methods have been developed to study them these numerical methods can be classified into the eulerian and the lagrangian approaches the lagrangian approach has advantages in high stability and simplicity over the eulerian approach but suffers from heavy computational cost in this paper we are mainly concerned with the trade offs between the accuracy and computational cost when applying the random walk method which is a lagrangian approach for examining the mass transport scenario we introduce a linear model to assess the accuracy of the random walk method in several computational configurations studies on computational parameters i e the size of time step and number of particles are conducted with the focus on estimation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l in steady flows the results show that the proposed linear model can satisfactorily explain the computational accuracy both in sample and out of sample furthermore we find a constant dimensionless parameter which quantifies a generic relationship between the accuracy and the number of particles regardless of the flow and diffusion conditions this dimensionless parameter is of theoretic value and offers guidelines for choosing the correct computational parameters to achieve the required numerical accuracy graphical abstract image 1 keywords random walk method mass transport error analysis longitudinal dispersion coefficient weak convergence stochastic differential equation 1 introduction mass transport phenomena in fluid exist widely hence extensive studies have been conducted by many researchers since the middle of the last century generally the numerical methods for mass transport problems can be classified into either eulerian or lagrangian approaches the eulerian approach solves the mass transport equations on a control volume basis which is in a similar form as that for the flow field calculation consequently eulerian approach is grid based and has gained its popularity on studying mass transport in finite computational domain benkhaldoun et al 2007 benson et al 2017 liang et al 2010 the selection of the size of time step δt in eulerian approach often depends on the grid size δx for example the size of the time step is restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy condition for pure advection equation i e δt must be less than the time taken for the fluid with varying state to travel to adjacent grid points for the pure diffusion equation the explicit scheme such as the central differencing scheme requires δ t δ x 2 2 d where d is the diffusion coefficient the relative dominance of the advection or diffusion constraint can be assessed using the peclet number pe given by p e u δ x d where u is the local flow velocity on the other hand the lagrangian approach a powerful method from individual particles perspective has been widely applied as a counterpart of the eulerian one although the flow field is traditionally solved through eulerian approach it has also been increasingly solved by lagrangian methods for example the incompressible navier stokes equations have been solved by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method shao and gotoh 2005 shao and lo 2003 the lagrangian approach uses a large number of discrete massless particles to represent the pollutant cloud and tracks the pathway of each individual particle the concentration as well as other parameters such as the dispersion coefficient can be obtained by studying the statistics of these particles trajectories or their total ensemble by definition the lagrangian approach is perfectly conservative and free from artificial diffusion near the steep concentration gradients besides this mesh free scheme limits its computation to the regions that the pollutant reaches while the computation in eulerian approach always needs to cover the entire flow domain regardless of the presence of the pollutant some more merits of lagrangian approaches have been reported in recent years zhang and chen 2007 found the lagrangian approach performed better than the eulerian one in the unsteady state condition saidi et al 2014 concluded that eulerian method cannot be applied to problems involving low concentration of particles while its lagrangian counterpart can well detect the particles wu and liang 2019 and yang et al 2019 compared the two algorithms through designed cases and found the lagrangian approach achieved higher accuracy the advantages of the lagrangian method listed above are accompanied by the high computational cost which has been well recognized möbus et al 2001 neuman 1993 zhang and chen 2007 furthermore much less guidance has been reported concerning the selection of computational parameters in the lagrangian approach than that in the eulerian ones as seen in the description of the method the amount of the computation depends on two parameters the number of particles n to present the pollutant cloud and the size of the computational time step δt therefore the choices of n and δt are crucial to the efficiency of the random walk method according to many simulation cases in different aquatic environments the more particles applied and the smaller the time step is the more accurate and stable the simulation results will be although these often lead to greater computational load hence it is necessary to optimize the selection of the number of particles and the size of the time step the random walk method studied in this paper is a typical representative of the lagrangian approach unfortunately there is little literature mentioning a detailed and optimized selection of these parameters for the random walk method applied in hydraulics and hydrodynamics therefore in this paper we empirically studied the impact of particles number and size of time step on the accuracy of longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the random walk method for steady flow with the aim to minimize its computational cost and control the error of simulation for future studies first the theory of random walk method is introduced then an error model of n and δt is presented which is commonly used for stochastic differential equations sde in the current mathematical framework of the accuracy analysis in sde approximations the coefficients of n and δt in the error model do not have analytical expressions and thus need to be estimated by case studies the estimation of coefficients is usually difficult in practical situations which requires careful experiment design in addition to huge computational cost in this study we have conducted the error analysis based on two types of steady flow for this model couette flow and open channel flow in both types of steady flow a dimensionless parameter of n is found to be a constant shedding light on the possibility of the priori optimization of the simulation accuracy for the couette flow it is found that the error model degrades into a simpler form i e linear relationship with n by a constant dimensionless parameter while δt has little impact on the results as long as it does not exceed a threshold in the end we attempted to give some theoretically explanations for the model for potential applications findings of this paper can be used to accelerate the sde related simulations in water research 2 theoretical background 2 1 random walk method the random walk method originates from statistical physics which has been used to model movement in a wide variety of contexts from time series of financial markets hamid et al 2017 mishra et al 2015 to the dispersion in porous media de anna et al 2013 sole mari et al 2017 in the simulation of mass transportation a large number of particles are released to represent the pollutant cloud in the flow the trajectories of each particle are tracked then the streamwise variation of the ensemble of particles will reveal the dispersion rate i e the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the process is illustrated in fig 1 with takes the fully developed turbent open channel flow as an example an ensemble of particles are released at time t 0 and then move along the x axis the histogram of the particles reveals the concentration at different times after the release as shown in the bottom subfigure the displacement of each particle during each time step in the random walk method is described by eq 1 to simplify the derivation we take the one dimensional case here 1 d x a x t t d t b x t t d w t which consists of a deterministic component a x t t d t and a random component b x t t d w t w t here denotes a standard wiener process while x t denotes the x axis position of each particle at time t we introduce p x t as the conditional probability density for x t which subjects to the fokker planck equation as 2 p t x a x t p 1 2 2 x 2 b x t 2 p a more thorough analysis can be referred to the classic book in the field of statistics gardiner 2004 the above analysis shows that the distribution of particles that move according to eq 1 which is the ito stochastic differential equation sde satisfies the fokker planck equation i e eq 2 meanwhile eq 2 is similar in form to the mass transport equation the probability density p is equivalent to the concentration c which is the foundation of the diffusion advection phenomenon shown as eq 3 3 c t x u c x d c x where d is the diffusion coefficient u is the velocity of the flow t is time by now we connected the ito sde with the mass transport equation which is the bedrock of the random walk method in hydraulics we use the longitudinal dispersion coefficient denoted as d l to quantitatively analyze the mixing rate of pollutants in shear layers which is a key parameter in water quality modeling as a measure of the spatially averaged spreading rate of a tracer cloud d l could be determined by analyzing the statistics of the positions of a large number of particles after a certain time has elapsed since the release of the particle ensemble known as the fickian limit the standard deviation of particles positions in the longitudinal direction increases linearly with time so that d l converges into a constant by then d l can be calculated through the time change of the longitudinal variance of the particle ensemble as 4 d l 1 2 σ x t 2 σ x t 1 t 2 t 1 in this paper we conduct error analysis on the simulation of d l which is a typical example of weak convergence approximation for sdes peter e kloeden 2007 a strong convergence approximation for sdes is needed when the trajectories of the ensemble of particles are taken into considerations while a weak convergence approximation is applicable when only the distribution of the particles is concerned the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be calculated from the particle distribution and its development with time rather than from the trajectories hence the weak convergence analysis is adopted here 2 2 error analysis in the field of mathematics and finance the statistical features of sde have been well developed first the sde in eq 1 is discretized by a simple euler discretization with time step δt as eq 5 5 x n 1 x n a x n t n δ t b x n t n δ w n in our case d l depends on the distribution of the particle ensemble which is effectively related to the time varying probability distribution p x t as described in eq 2 and eq 4 to calculate d l we want to compute the expectation of f x t i e e f x t where f x is a scalar function with a uniform lipschitz bound giles 2008 to be specific in our context f x t is the function that maps the ensemble of particles into d l at instant t where t indicates the time after the fickian limit to obtain e f x t the simplest estimation would be the mean of the discrete values f x t δ t from n independent path simulations as shown in eq 6 6 y n 1 i 1 n f x t δ t i in computational mathematics it is well established that provided that a x t and b x t satisfy certain conditions bally and talay 1996 peter e kloeden 2007 talay and tubaro 1990 the expected mean square error mse in the estimate y is asymptotically of the form expressed in eq 7 7 m s e c 1 n 1 c 2 δ t 2 which implies that the mse comes with two sources error due to the limited number of particles n and the size of time step δt giles 2015 therefore as long as c 1 and c 2 are established the relationship between the choice of particles number n and the time step δ t will be known given the required mse of d l it is also worth mentioning that δt actually affects mse in a much more complex way which follows a polynomial function with a dominating quadratic component bally and talay 2009 in practice c 1 and c 2 are usually unknown and have to be estimated case by case which is undesirable in this study we collect evidence from different cases and try to establish some general guidelines for finding c 1 and c 2 that are independent of water environment configurations such as flow field and diffusion coefficient 3 case studies 3 1 couette flow we first choose the dispersion phenomenon in couette flow to verify the error analysis model because this laminar shear flow gives the analytical solution for d l as fisher first derived it in 1979 as shown in eq 8 8 d a n a l y t i c a l u 2 h 2 120 d y in the couette flow water flow is assumed to go through two parallel plates of infinite extent with the top plate moving at velocity u compared to the bottom one the width between these two parallel plates is h and d y is the diffusion coefficient in the transverse direction 3 1 1 demonstration in a particular flow condition firstly the random walk method has been applied on a verification case whose parameters are presented in table 1 with 100 000 particles and time step as 0 001 s the simulated longitudinal dispersion coefficient is compared with the analytical solution and the accuracy of this lagrangian

in a certain range when velocity is small enough however when the velocity is moderately large it can be noticed that a larger d l leads to a larger mse the analytical solution for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l a n l of logarithmic flow as well as the flow conditions can be found in the research data uploaded alongside fig 7 shows the results by these varying δ t from 0 1s to 0 5s with the same particles number 50 000 as can be seen despite the differences in the sizes of the time step there is some small difference among the simulated d l the simulation of d l for open channel flow is dependent on δ t although the impact is relatively small in this range the impact of n and δ t is displayed in details in table 5 the same ordinary least squares ols method is utilized to find the values of c 1 and c 2 we also extend the calculation to other flow conditions as listed in table 5 and nondimensionalization was done by the same method as illustrated in the above section again c 1 n d i m converges to 2 after being nondimensionalized despite the changing of flow conditions the confidence of such a regression model is quite high as proved by the high value of the r s q in all configurations however impact of the time step is now more obvious in the open channel flow than that in the couette flow the 2nd and the 3rd columns show that a significant non zero c 2 can be estimated from simulations when the flow velocity is larger than 0 05 m s suggesting a positive impact of time step on the simulated error although the estimated coefficient c 2 seems to be small the modeled relationship between it and the measured mse is strong and cannot be omitted as indicated by the large t statistics and the p values associated with it these results are consistent with eq 7 the m s e n for different particles numbers are plotted in fig 8 the red dots are the measured mse from 20 runs of the model while the black line shows the predictions made with c 1 n d i m 2 it is clear that the larger number of particles leads to the smaller m s e n besides the predicted black line can well fit the measured data with rsq 96 2 4 discussions 4 1 error due to the particle number the random walk scheme which tries to use a relatively smaller number of samples to approximate the probability distribution belongs to the class of monte carlo methods monte carlo methods are popular methods in many fields and the error analysis of the monte carlo methods has been well studied it is known that as mackay 2003 claimed monte carlo methods are usually used to solve two problems 1 to generate samples x r r 1 r from a probability distribution p x 2 to estimate expectations of functions ϕ x under this distribution suppose a set of n samples x i i 1 n is generated from a probability distribution p x we can then obtain an estimator φ ˆ by using the following equation 9 φ ˆ 1 n i 1 n ϕ x i this estimator φ ˆ is an unbiased estimator of the expectation of ϕ furthermore the variance of φ ˆ will decrease as σ 2 n where σ 2 is the variance of ϕ in our case given a known time discretization euler discretization and all other initial setups of a simulation we are actually trying to use n particles to track their trajectories x i i 1 n and ϕ x i here is the function for longitudinal dispersion coefficient φ ˆ is the estimator for ϕ x i i e d l therefore the left side of eq 9 is the simulated d l the variance of the simulated d l hence will decrease as σ 2 n σ 2 here is the variance of ϕ since φ ˆ is an unbiased estimator the variance and the mean square error mse are equivalent thus the mse due to the limited number of particles denoted as m s e n will decrease as σ 2 n i e m s e n σ 2 n since the initial conditions and other settings of simulations are fixed the target probability distribution p x although unknown is a determined distribution thus its variance σ 2 is constant therefore m s e n σ 2 n can be expressed as m s e n c 1 n 1 where c 1 is a constant to be determined in different cases and is dependent on the variances of the p x 4 2 error due to the size of the time step the calculation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which concerns the ensemble of the particles cloud rather than the exact trajectory of each particle belongs to weak convergence approximation of sde bally and talay 1996 it has been proved that the euler scheme one of the simplest discretization schemes and the one we used in the paper converges with a weak order of 1 i e the mean square error due tothe discretization scheme is proportional to the square of δ t as indicated in eq 7 this becomes noticeable in open channel flow case studies with a large flow speeds 5 conclusions it is well known that the choice of the number of particles n and the size of time step δt is of vital importance in the implementation of random walk methods the choice of these two parameters in random walk methods relies on the balance between the accuracy measured as mse and the computational cost in this paper we present an empirical study on the reliance of the mse of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l on these two parameters in a quantitative approach the following conclusions are made for steady flows 1 after nondimensionalization i e normalizing d l by the analytical value d l a n l the value of c 1 n d i m converges to a constant of 2 regardless of the flow conditions 2 for the couette flow the accuracy of the random walk simulations for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient seems to be independent of δt however when the velocity profile is highly nonlinear extremely large δt values will decrease the accuracy of the random walk simulation therefore a relatively large time step δt can be applied to minimize the computational expenses without compromising the accuracy for the numerical simulation of d l in certain steady flows however the time step must be limited for the correct treatment of boundary conditions and source terms furthermore given that the nondimensionalized value c 1 n d i m 2 is valid for any flow conditions the absolute value of c 1 can be calculated as 2 d l a n l 2 once the analytical solution or empirical value of the dispersion coefficient d l a n l 2 is known the relationship between the accuracy of predicted d l value and the computational parameters can be expressed by 10 m s e c 1 n 1 this degraded error model provides guidance on the choice of the number of the particles needed to achieve the desired accuracy on the other hand it can be used to estimate the computational uncertainty m s e n for a given value of n in different flow scenarios we are currently extending this research to unsteady flows and the related details will be described in another paper both the dispersion coefficient and other parameters will be examined by our error model for the random walk simulations declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
