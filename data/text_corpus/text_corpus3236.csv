16180,to date the application of marine anammox bacteria mab is still a challenge in saline wastewater treatment due to the low growth rate and high sensitivity herein bioelectrochemical system with applied voltage was exerted for the first time to promote the activity of mab for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater at the optimal voltage of 1 5 v the mean total nitrogen removal rate tnrr reached the maximum of 0 65 kg m3 d which was 27 45 higher than that without applied voltage besides applied voltage reduced the microbial diversity of mab based consortia but the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua increased by 4 63 at 1 5 v compared with that without applied voltage also proper applied voltage promoted the secretion of eps and heme c which resulted in the enhancement of mab activity based on the remodified logistic model analysis the lag time of the nitrogen removal process was shortened by 0 72 h at the voltage of 1 5 v furthermore it was found that higher voltage 2 0 v had a negative effect on the mab activity for low tnrr of 0 33 kg m3 d 2 5 v however tnrr increased back to 0 61 kg m3 d after removing the high applied voltage which implied that the bioactivity was recoverable after being inhibited these findings demonstrated that external electrical stimulation is an effective strategy to promote nitrogen removal and mab activity for treating saline wastewater graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords applied voltage marine anammox bacteria nitrogen removal microbial community saline wastewater 1 introduction saline wastewater containing large amounts of soluble salt and nitrogen contaminants is generated from food processing mustard tuber pickling and aquacultural wastewater li et al 2018b in recent years with the advantages of no secondary pollution and low operation cost biological treatment technologies have been widely used to treat nitrogen rich saline wastewater ali et al 2019 ge et al 2019 nevertheless high osmotic pressure caused by the salinity above 1 w v may induce cell plasmolysis or even death which severely limits the application of conventional biological nitrogen removal technologies gonzalez silva et al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2022 therefore a feasible strategy for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater is indispensable anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox with the advantages of cost effectiveness and high efficiency has been extensively investigated for treating nitrogen rich wastewater zhang et al 2020 to date six anammox bacteria genera have been identified yu et al 2021 among them the freshwater derived anammox bacteria fab candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia has low salt tolerance 5 g l nacl in saline wastewater treatment ali et al 2014 gao et al 2021 compared with fab the genus candidatus scalindua belonging to marine anammox bacteria mab naturally possessed good salt tolerance li et al 2018b yokota et al 2018 previous studies indicated that mab maintained stable nitrogen removal performance at a wider salinity range 0 50 g l nacl ali et al 2020 li et al 2018b hence mab is an excellent candidate for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater however anammox bacteria are restricted to be applied during nitrogen removal due to their low growth rate and high sensitivity to the operational environment gao et al 2021 recently electrochemical technology has been regarded as an alternative method to strengthen the biological nitrogen removal process as early as 1992 mellor et al 1992 observed that the removal rate of nitrate was significantly improved which resulted from the bioactivity of denitrifying bacteria was promoted by electrical stimulation lately the electrostimulation by bioelectrodes disclosed effective regulation not only on electrode surface communities wang et al 2020a wang et al 2022 but also in the bulk solutions wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020b leading to positive electron and energy flow for microbial activities and cooperation through interspecies electron transfer qian et al also used a periodic reversal bio electrocoagulation system to promote the activity of functional bacteria and a higher nitrogen removal rate was acquired qian et al 2017 2018 besides the effects resulting from electrical stimulation on fab for nitrogen removal had also been explored by previous reports yin et al 2015 indicated that the nitrogen removal rate of the fab based anammox process increased by 25 3 at the optimal electrode potential 0 08 v and corresponding crude enzymes activity and anammox biomass yield were improved also zhang et al 2019 revealed that exerting an electric field increased nitrogen removal efficiency and shorten the anammox start up time by improving bacterial activity furthermore electroactive microorganisms coexisting with anammox bacteria such as electroactive denitrifiers also could promote the nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria in bioelectrochemical system zekker et al 2020 compared with fab the doubling time 11 d mab has a longer start up time because its doubling time is 14 4 d awata et al 2015 however until now the impact resulting from electrochemical technologies on mab is still not clear in this work it was the first time to exert applied voltage to promote nitrogen removal and activity of mab in saline wastewater treatment 35 g l salts the nitrogen removal characteristics and mechanism of mab were investigated at different applied voltages besides microbial community dynamics were also analyzed in response to the continuous applied voltage also the eps and heme c content were measured to reflect the variation of bioactivity two kinetic models were used to predict the nitrogen removal process at different applied voltages this work would provide a significant and profound basis to understand the nitrogen removal through mab via bioelectrochemical system with applied voltage in saline wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup and operation two identical single chamber column reactors ø50 150 mm with an effective liquid volume of 220 ml were operated in this work a pair of carbon fiber brushes ø5 10 cm with high surface areas and good biocompatibility were inserted in each reactor as cathode and anode with a distance of 5 cm between electrodes the carbon fiber brushes were heat treated according to the method of feng et al 2010 and connected by a copper wire before experiment applied voltage was exerted into one biotic reactor hereafter referred to as r2 by a regulated dc power source rps3003c 2 china the blank control reactor without applied voltage hereafter referred to as r1 was conducted to clarify the effects of applied voltage on nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment additionally each reactor was shielded from light with aluminum foil to avoid the proliferation of phototrophic microorganisms the reactors were sealed using a rubber stopper after pumping n2 purity 98 to ensure an anoxic environment during the operation period the reactor temperature was regulated at 25 1 c using a thermostatic incubator the applied voltages of 0 1 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 v were continuously exerted into r2 the operating cycle of each reactor was controlled at 6 h hydraulic retention time the typical operating cycles of r2 were taken from the last cycle of each applied voltage stage before experiment r1 and r2 were set up with the same nitrogen removal performance at least 20 cycles were kept in each voltage stage to achieve stable performance 2 2 seed sludge and feeding medium nearly 45 ml of mab sludge harvested from a lab scale sbr sequencing batch reactor li et al 2021a was seeded into each reactor which resulted in a final mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of 18 45 g l the synthetic wastewater in this work was taken from the seawater of jiaozhou bay in qingdao china with a salinity of 35 g l the seawater had been sterilized and purified before use which ensured that synthetic wastewater did not contain any biomass nh4cl and nano2 were prepared as substrates for the anammox process about 80 mg l of nh4 n and 105 6 mg l of no2 n were set as influent concentrations meanwhile the mineral medium and trace elements also were supplied to the synthetic wastewater according to li et al 2020b 2 3 analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n collected from influent and effluent samples were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 each sample was detected three times for taking the mean value the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were recorded by a ph probe phs 3c china the measurement of mlvss was finished by the gravimetric method apha 2005 extracellular polymeric substances eps containing polysaccharide ps and protein pn were extracted at different voltage stages by the heat extraction method yin et al 2015 and measured by the phenol sulfuric acid and the lowry method respectively dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 heme c content was determined as described by yin et al 2015 the observation of the electrode biofilm morphology in r1 and r2 was achieved using scanning electron microscopy sem liu et al 2019 2 4 microbial community analysis five sludge samples s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 were harvested from r1and r2 during the operation of 151 cycles and analyzed by high throughput sequencing meanwhile s0 represented the inoculated sludge s1 and s3 were taken from r1 and s2 and s4 were taken from r2 when the voltages were 1 5 and 2 5 v the total extracted dna from each sample was quantified and qualitatized after that the universal polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification primers 338f and 806r were performed in the target region v3 v4 of the bacterial 16s rrna genes then the pcr products were sequenced based on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform biomarker technologies company beijing after purification the detailed analysis processes refer to the previous report gao et al 2021 2 5 kinetic analysis the modified logistic model hereafter referred to as the l model and the modified gompertz model hereafter referred to as the g model have been frequently used to describe the kinetic characteristics of the substrate degradation process in an operating cycle chen et al 2021 similarly these models are also suitable to analyze and predict nitrogen removal through mab at different applied voltages model formulas were described in supporting information text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of mab at different applied voltages fig 1 a d presented the reactor performance of r1 and r2 at different applied voltages with the applied voltage changed the nitrogen removal efficiency also correspondingly varied during saline wastewater treatment in the first 6 cycles at the voltage of 0 1 v the effluent substrates concentrations in r2 were 22 37 2 45 nh4 n and 30 98 2 14 mg l no2 n respectively which were close to those in r1 22 14 5 34 and 34 40 2 49 mg l respectively subsequently it was observed that the effluent nh4 n and no2 n of r2 at 0 6 v were 22 28 and 20 69 mg l lower than those in r1 with the voltage further increased to 1 5 v ammonium and nitrite were completely consumed with the removal efficiency of 100 are and nire which were 16 89 and 19 27 higher than those in r1 the performance of mab was significantly promoted by low voltage 1 5 v combined with the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr analysis the increment of tnrr at different applied voltages were 0 14 0 1 v 0 04 0 3 v 0 06 0 6 v 0 07 1 0 v 0 07 1 5 v kg m3 d respectively the maximal tnrr of 0 65 kg m3 d was also acquired at the voltage of 1 5 v however higher voltage 2 5 v suppressed the nitrogen removal through mab with a lower tnrr 0 33 kg m3 d in addition to the adverse effects of electrical stimulation on mab the reason for the decrease of mab activity might also be that too high voltages caused anodic oxygen evolution reaction which resulted in electrode biofilm shedding even suppressed mab growth as a result the optimal applied voltage for nitrogen removal through mab was 1 5 v in saline wastewater treatment also the voltage below 1 5 v showed a positive effect on mab activity however the bioactivity was severely inhibited when the voltage 2 0 v a previous study showed that the optimal voltage was 0 8 v for nitrogen removal through fab and the maximal tnrr variation was 0 02 kg m3 d zhang et al 2012 also qiao et al 2018 observed that the most satisfactory tnrr was acquired when the voltage was 1 0 v but it only increased by 0 08 kg m3 d in an electrode anammox reactor in this work the tnrr of mab increased by 0 16 kg m3 d at 1 5 v which was 2 0 folds as high as the results of qiao et al 2017 comparatively applied voltage has a better effect on the improvement of mab activity for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater remarkably when the voltage in r2 further increased to 2 5 v the are rapidly declined to 42 36 16 88 but the nire was still stabilized at 90 42 3 98 the mean effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 46 35 13 25 9 05 4 31 and 52 67 3 03 mg l respectively which greatly deviated from the stoichiometric ratios the accumulation of excessive no3 n and consumption of excessive no2 n at 2 5 v were attributed to the following two possible reasons one was that no2 n was converted to no3 n at anode using functional microorganisms maybe nitrite oxidizing bacteria as a catalyst koffi and okabe 2021 another was that no2 n oxidation was directly driven to no3 n at high anode potential by the electrochemical process chen et al 2014 however nitrite oxidizing bacteria such as nitrospira were not detected in the mab based consortia therefore the direct conversion of no2 n into no3 n by the electrochemical process was probably preferred in this work furthermore the nitrate produced from anammox and electrochemical process could be completely removed by coupling marine anammox process and autotrophic denitrification at cathode in the saline wastewater treatment qiao et al 2018 compared with r2 the variation of substrates in r1 was completely consistent with the anammox mechanism throughout the experiment and a slight increase of tnrr resulted from the long term culture of mab the variation of ph δph and orp δorp in saline wastewater treatment can be used to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance of mab feng et al 2020 as presented in fig 1e the peaks of mean δph and δorp were acquired when the voltage was 1 5 v 0 29 and 27 mv respectively which were higher than those at 0 1 v 0 2 and 12 mv respectively correspondingly the mean tnrr of mab also reached the maximum at this stage however with the voltage increased to 2 0 v the effluent ph was unexpectedly lower than the influent and corresponding orp values were higher this phenomenon was further strengthened by the voltage of 2 5 v the reason for the lower ph might be that too high voltages caused anodic oxygen evolution reaction which resulted in the release of large amounts of h in the electrochemical system zhang et al 2021 additionally as shown in fig 1f the stoichiometric ratios in r2 were not affected when the voltage 1 5 v the mean δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n 1 25 and 0 27 were close to the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 however compared with r1 fig s1 the stoichiometric ratios in r2 significantly deviated when the voltage 2 0 v this suggested that the transformation of nitrogen species was not only attributed to the anammox process 3 2 nitrogen removal in a typical operating cycle as presented in fig 2 the typical operating cycles of each applied voltage stage were analyzed in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment meanwhile open circuit voltage ocv at the beginning and end of the experiment served as a control experiment at ocv begin ammonium and nitrite removal efficiency are and nire were 63 93 and 55 37 respectively subsequently at the voltage of 0 6 v nh4 n was removed completely and only 7 16 mg l no2 n remained within 6 h reaction time fig 2a b with the voltage further increased to 1 5 v the reaction time for complete consumption of nh4 n was reduced to 3 h which indicated that nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment was further promoted however with the negative effect of 2 5 v are decreased to 40 27 dramatically but 96 25 of no2 n was still removed and the corresponding no3 n increased to 57 75 mg l within 6 h reaction time fig 2c this indicated that mab was significantly suppressed by higher voltage 2 0 v a previous study found that the bioactivity of anammox bacteria was restored to the initial level after being inhibited by the electric field qiao et al 2014 in this work after removing applied voltage are and nire at ocv end were 36 07 and 32 84 higher than those at ocv begin it indicated that the mab activity was also recoverable after being inhibited in saline wastewater treatment the substrates conversion rate scr in r2 at different applied voltages was presented in fig 2d previous studies found that the maximum scr scrmax could be improved and realized in a shorter reaction time by the intensification of applied factors mn2 ni2 co2 fe3 etc li et al 2020a 2020b with the positive effect of 1 5 v the scrmax increased to 1 47 from 0 96 kg m3 d at ocv begin furthermore the corresponding reaction time was reduced to 2 h from 6 h subsequently the scrmax decreased to 1 05 kg m3 d due to the negative effect of 2 5 v on mab activity this indicated that the scrmax could be improved and the start up time could be shortened by proper applied voltage as shown in fig 2e f at different applied voltages except for 2 5 v the stoichiometric ratios in a typical operating cycle presented a gradually increasing trend and they eventually approached the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 in the first 2 h the stoichiometric ratios were lower than the theoretical values and fluctuated irregularly si et al 2021 and li et al 2018a and revealed similar results in their works this could result from the variation of hydraulic conditions caused by feeding setting and draining in the reactor dramatically at 2 5 v the stoichiometric ratios 2 91 and 1 52 deviated significantly from the theoretical values the relevant reasons had been discussed in section 3 1 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis between microbial communities the alpha diversity indices of five samples s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 were summarized in table s1 based on the 97 similarity threshold the high coverage index 0 99 implied that the sequencing data in all samples were convincing compared with the inoculated sludge s0 the number of otus in other samples increased according to the variation of ace and chao 1 the maximum values were observed in s2 which indicated that microorganism enrichment was prompted by the voltage of 1 5 v generally the microbial community diversity can be characterized by simpson and shannon indices after the operation of 151 cycles the simpson index in r2 decreased to 0 89 s4 from 0 92 s0 while that in r1 increased to 0 96 s3 the shannon index showed the same variation trend this indicated that applied voltage reduced the microbial diversity of mab based consortia in saline wastewater treatment a similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 high microbial richness and low microbial diversity in s2 implied that dominant functional genera were enriched which resulted in the improvement of tnrr in r2 to investigate the similarities and differences of microbial community structures among five samples principal component analysis pca and principal coordinates analysis pcoa were conducted based on the bray curtis distance in the coordinate plot fig 3 the distance of two samples is closer implied that the difference in community composition between two samples is smaller according to the pca plot the similarity between s1 from r1 and s2 from r2 implied that the voltage of 1 5 v had no impact on microbial community composition in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment nevertheless higher voltage 2 5 v significantly changed the microbial community composition in r2 according to the difference between s2 and s4 the changes of microbial community structure under applied voltage were further confirmed by pcoa analysis 3 3 2 microbial community dynamics to illustrate the shift of dominant genera in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment deeply the top 10 phylum and top 30 genus of five samples in r1 and r2 were analyzed at phylum level the predominant phyla of five samples were proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were fig 4 a accounting for more than 85 of all microorganisms the relative abundance of proteobacteria in r2 increased continuously to 53 67 s4 from 41 04 s0 which was 6 7 higher than that of s3 in r1 it was reported that most electroactive microorganisms belonged to the proteobacteria phylum logan 2009 therefore the electroactive microorganisms in r2 could be enriched resulting from electrical stimulation similarly the actinobacteria phylum was also detected in the bio electrochemical systems frequently velvizhi and mohan 2015 its abundance reached the maximum 5 64 at 1 5 v and then decreased to 2 26 at 2 5 v the planctomycetes played a vital role in nitrogen removal through mab and its abundance increased by 3 99 under proper applied voltage 27 80 for s2 and 23 81 for s1 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in r1and r2 was similar and showed only slight fluctuation comparatively the relative abundances of chloroflexi acidobacteria and calditrichaeota in r2 showed slight growing trends with the increase of applied voltage these results suggested that applied voltage changed the microbial community structure at phylum level which resulted from the high selectivity to different microorganisms at genus level candidatus scalindua as the predominant functional bacteria had been proved to be an electroactive microorganism for treating nitrogen rich saline wastewater shaw et al 2020 among five samples the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua was 16 97 s0 18 26 s1 22 89 s2 19 38 s3 and 10 65 s4 respectively fig 4b the abundance in s2 was the highest which implied that proper applied voltage 1 5 v promoted the growth rate of candidatus scalindua at this stage the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr also reached the maximum however due to the negative effect of 2 5 v the candidatus scalindua was significantly inhibited with a lower abundance 10 65 for s4 compared with that without applied voltage 19 38 for s3 as a result the enhancement of nitrogen removal performance in r2 might result from the increased relative abundance of candidatus scalindua besides several unclassified genus belonging to the class gammaproteobacteria were also identified such as unclassified gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and unclassified gammaproteobacteria it was reported that the class gammaproteobacteria are commonly found in the marine environment and participate in the marine nutrient cycle evans et al 2008 including organic carbon turnover and nitrogen and sulfur cycling processes baker et al 2015 the relative abundance of the class gammaproteobacteria in r2 53 59 for s4 increased by 19 17 compared with that in r1 34 42 for s3 meanwhile the genus gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum had been proved to be electroactive microorganisms logan et al 2019 their abundance increased to 19 87 and 0 27 s4 from 11 76 and 0 18 s0 respectively fig 4b this suggested that applied voltage was highly selective for electroactive microorganisms in saline wastewater treatment in addition the genus rhodobacteraceae was also detected in two reactors which was responsible to reduce nitrate to nitrite using endogenous substrates rios del toro et al 2017 thus the nitrate produced by anammox process could be utilized by denitrifiers such as rhodobacteraceae to provide an electron acceptor nitrite for anammox bacteria research showed that ignavibacterium was involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process li et al 2021c the ignavibacterium was upregulated in r1 while it continuously decreased to 0 99 from 1 50 in r2 this indicated that applied voltage was not beneficial to its enrichment consequently the shift of microbial community structure was closely related to the nitrogen removal through mab at different applied voltages in saline wastewater treatment 3 3 3 microbial functions prediction based on the kegg database based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the dynamics of microbial functions among all samples were analyzed by the picrust2 tool according to the kegg pathway fig 5 four predominant classes metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes with 21 functional genes were analyzed meanwhile carbohydrate metabolism 8 00 8 28 and amino acid 7 18 7 46 were the first and second most abundant functional genes the abundance of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in r1 increased continuously while they first increased and then decreased in r2 the most abundances were observed in s2 with the voltage of 1 5 v a similar variation trend was observed for nitrogen removal through mab in r1 and r2 this suggested that the supply of carbon and nitrogen sources in marine anammox process were essential for cellular synthesis and metabolism of mab for treating saline wastewater in addition the highest abundance of energy metabolism was also observed in s2 the energy metabolism was involved in the production of intracellular materials and microbial metabolism therefore the improvement of mab activity might be attributed to the upregulation of the abundance of energy and carbohydrate metabolism compared with r1 the relative abundance of xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism transport and catabolism and lipid metabolism in r2 were downregulated conversely the replication and repair signal transduction and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were upregulated differently the relative abundance of cell motility and membrane transport in s2 increased first and then decreased to the minimum in s4 this indicated that the metabolism and intracellular material transformation ability of mab were affected by applied voltage it was reported that electrical stimulation intensified the microbial metabolism activity by changing the permeability of cells membrane guo et al 2019 in this work mab activity was promoted by the voltage of 1 5 v which possibly resulted from the improvement of ion migration velocity during microbial metabolism further study was still needed to confirm it 3 4 variations of eps and heme c extracellular polymeric substances eps which are mainly composed of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps play an essential role in promoting the stability and activity of anammox biomass hou et al 2015 by the beginning of the experiment the eps content in r1 and r2 was stable at 6 35 0 30 mg g wet weight fig 6 a the eps content in r1 presented a slightly increasing trend and reached the maximum of 10 41 mg g wet weight on cycle 151 differently at the voltage of 1 5 v the eps content in r2 increased to 14 94 mg g wet weight which was 1 52 folds higher than that in r1 on the same cycle subsequently the eps content declined to 9 34 mg g wet weight due to the negative effect of 2 5 v furthermore compared with r1 the increments of eps content in r2 at different applied voltages were 0 0 v 1 06 0 3 v 2 5 0 6 v 5 13 1 5 v and 1 07 2 5 v mg g wet weight respectively this indicated that eps secretion was promoted by low applied voltages 1 5 v therefore the nitrogen removal performance of mab at different applied voltages was positively correlated with the variation of eps content which implied that eps content could be used to characterize the nitrogen removal performance of mab in saline wastewater treatment in addition the pn ps ratio in r2 gradually increased to the maximum of 13 96 from 7 76 however it always remained stable between 7 75 and 8 63 in r1 during the experiment some studies indicated that a high pn ps ratio contributed to the formation of biofilm by adhesion of anammox biomass on electrodes liu et al 2019 yin et al 2015 according to the physical photos and sem images in r1 and r2 fig s2c f more mab sludge was attached to the surface of the carbon fiber brush in r2 compared with that in r1 and the electrode biofilm in r2 was significantly thicker these results indicated that it was easier to form biofilm on the electrode surface by electrical stimulation heme c as a key co enzyme factor in the anammox metabolism has been confirmed as an indicator to reflect the bioactivity of anammox biomass ma et al 2019 hence the heme c content in r1 and r2 was measured at different voltage stages fig 6b in contrast to the steady increase of heme c in r1 the peak of heme c in r2 was acquired at 1 5 v 1 75 μm g vss which was 40 higher than that in r1 the increment of heme c gradually increased to 0 50 μm g vss 1 5 v from 0 17 μm g vss 0 3 v and then the heme c content rapidly declined to 0 42 μm g vss at 2 5 v which was lower than that in r1 through the physical photos fig s2a b the color of anammox biomass changed from carmine in r1 to brownish red in r2 some studies reported that the characteristic of carmine red in anammox bacteria results from high heme c content in cells kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 in this work more heme c was secreted at proper applied voltage which resulted in the improvement of mab activity in saline wastewater treatment similar results were also observed in previous reports ma et al 2019 2020 3 5 kinetic analysis the l model and g model were used to further analyze and predict the nitrogen removal process of mab at different applied voltages for treating saline wastewater fig 7 a b the fitted parameters contained r2 relative coefficient sremax rmax and λ were acquired from both models data for supporting information according to the r2 0 97 values the nitrogen removal process of mab could be well fitted through both models at different applied voltages however the fitted sremax values by the l model were closer to the experimental values than that by the g model fig 7c therefore the l model was more suitable for analyzing and predicting the nitrogen removal process of mab at different applied voltages in saline wastewater treatment nevertheless the g model could only be used at high voltage stages recently zhu et al 2017 confirmed that adding appropriate metal ions or optimizing the reactor structure was a feasible way to shorten the lag time of mab in saline wastewater treatment li et al 2020b yu et al 2019 as presented in fig 7d the fitted λ a lag time values by the l model at different applied voltages were analyzed at the voltage of 1 5 v the fitted λ value reached the minimum value of 0 05 h which was 0 72 h lower than that at open circuit voltage 0 v and then the fitted λ values at higher voltage 2 0 v were still lower and stabilized at 0 27 0 28 h the lag time was shortened significantly by the stimulation of proper applied voltage meanwhile the fitted rmax values increased gradually to 33 31 h at 1 5 v and then declined to 19 68 h at 2 5 v these results indicated that exerting proper applied voltage could not only shorten the lag time of marine anammox process but also promote the substrates removal rate in saline wastewater treatment combined with the analysis above the optimal voltage of 1 5 v for nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment was further verified by the fitted values of the remodified logistic model 4 conclusion in this work the growth up and nitrogen removal of mab had been successfully regulated at different applied voltages which was firstly studied to use mab for treating saline wastewater the main findings were as follows the optimal applied voltage for nitrogen removal through mab was 1 5 v the total nitrogen removal rate increased by 29 10 compared with that of control without applied voltage applied voltage reduced microbial diversity and was highly selective for electroactive microorganisms in mab based consortia meanwhile the candidatus scalindua was enriched and strengthened by the voltage of 1 5 v more eps and heme c were secreted implied that mab activity was promoted by proper applied voltage higher voltage 2 0 v had a negative effect on mab activity but it was recoverable after removing applied voltage based on the remodified logistic model analysis applied voltage shortened the lag time of marine anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16180,to date the application of marine anammox bacteria mab is still a challenge in saline wastewater treatment due to the low growth rate and high sensitivity herein bioelectrochemical system with applied voltage was exerted for the first time to promote the activity of mab for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater at the optimal voltage of 1 5 v the mean total nitrogen removal rate tnrr reached the maximum of 0 65 kg m3 d which was 27 45 higher than that without applied voltage besides applied voltage reduced the microbial diversity of mab based consortia but the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua increased by 4 63 at 1 5 v compared with that without applied voltage also proper applied voltage promoted the secretion of eps and heme c which resulted in the enhancement of

0 v had a negative effect on the mab activity for low tnrr of 0 33 kg m3 d 2 5 v however tnrr increased back to 0 61 kg m3 d after removing the high applied voltage which implied that the bioactivity was recoverable after being inhibited these findings demonstrated that external electrical stimulation is an effective strategy to promote nitrogen removal and mab activity for treating saline

al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2022 therefore a feasible strategy for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater is indispensable anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox with the advantages of cost effectiveness and high efficiency has been extensively investigated for treating nitrogen rich wastewater zhang et al 2020 to date six anammox bacteria genera have been identified yu et al 2021 among them the freshwater derived anammox bacteria fab candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia has low salt tolerance 5 g l nacl in saline wastewater treatment ali et al 2014 gao et al 2021 compared with fab the genus candidatus scalindua belonging to marine anammox bacteria mab naturally possessed good salt tolerance li et al 2018b yokota et al 2018 previous studies indicated that mab maintained stable nitrogen removal performance at a wider salinity range 0 50 g l nacl ali et al 2020 li et al 2018b hence mab is an excellent candidate for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater however anammox bacteria are restricted to be applied during nitrogen removal due to their low growth rate and high sensitivity to the operational environment gao et al 2021 recently electrochemical technology has been regarded as an alternative method to strengthen the biological nitrogen removal process as early as 1992 mellor et al 1992 observed that the removal rate of nitrate was significantly improved which resulted from the bioactivity of denitrifying bacteria was promoted by electrical stimulation lately the electrostimulation by bioelectrodes disclosed effective regulation not only on electrode surface communities wang et al 2020a wang et al 2022 but also in the bulk solutions wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020b leading to positive electron and energy flow for microbial activities and cooperation through interspecies electron transfer qian et al also used a periodic reversal bio electrocoagulation system to promote the activity of functional bacteria and a higher nitrogen removal rate was acquired qian et al 2017 2018 besides the effects resulting from electrical stimulation on fab for nitrogen removal had also been explored by previous reports yin et al 2015 indicated that the nitrogen removal rate of the fab based anammox process increased by 25 3 at the optimal electrode potential 0 08 v and corresponding crude enzymes activity and anammox biomass yield were improved also zhang et al 2019 revealed that exerting an electric field increased nitrogen removal efficiency and shorten the anammox start up time by improving bacterial activity furthermore electroactive microorganisms coexisting with anammox bacteria such as electroactive denitrifiers also could promote the nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria in bioelectrochemical system zekker et al 2020 compared with fab the doubling time 11 d mab has a longer start up time because its doubling time is 14 4 d awata et al 2015 however until now the impact resulting from electrochemical technologies on mab is still not clear in this work it was the first time to exert applied voltage to promote nitrogen removal and activity of mab in saline wastewater treatment 35 g l salts the nitrogen removal characteristics and mechanism of mab were investigated at different applied voltages besides microbial community dynamics were also analyzed in response to the continuous applied voltage also the eps and heme c content were measured to reflect the variation of bioactivity two kinetic models were used to predict the nitrogen removal process at different applied voltages this work would provide a significant and profound basis to understand the nitrogen removal through mab via bioelectrochemical system with applied voltage in saline wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup and operation two identical single chamber column reactors ø50 150 mm with an effective liquid volume of 220 ml were operated in this work a pair of carbon fiber brushes ø5 10 cm with high surface areas and good biocompatibility were inserted in each reactor as cathode and anode with a distance of 5 cm between electrodes the carbon fiber brushes were heat treated according to the method of feng et al 2010 and connected by a copper wire before experiment applied voltage was exerted into one biotic reactor hereafter referred to as r2 by a regulated dc power source rps3003c 2 china the blank control reactor without applied voltage hereafter referred to as r1 was conducted to clarify the effects of applied voltage on nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment additionally each reactor was shielded from light with aluminum foil to avoid the proliferation of phototrophic microorganisms the reactors were sealed using a rubber stopper after pumping n2 purity 98 to ensure an anoxic environment during the operation period the reactor temperature was regulated at 25 1 c using a thermostatic incubator the applied voltages of 0 1 0 3 0 6 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 v were continuously exerted into r2 the operating cycle of each reactor was controlled at 6 h hydraulic retention time the typical operating cycles of r2 were taken from the last cycle of each applied voltage stage before experiment r1 and r2 were set up with the same nitrogen removal performance at least 20 cycles were kept in each voltage stage to achieve stable performance 2 2 seed sludge and feeding medium nearly 45 ml of mab sludge harvested from a lab scale sbr sequencing batch reactor li et al 2021a was seeded into each reactor which resulted in a final mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of 18 45 g l the synthetic wastewater in this work was taken from the seawater of jiaozhou bay in qingdao china with a salinity of 35 g l the seawater had been sterilized and purified before use which ensured that synthetic wastewater did not contain any biomass nh4cl and nano2 were prepared as substrates for the anammox process about 80 mg l of nh4 n and 105 6 mg l of no2 n were set as influent concentrations meanwhile the mineral medium and trace elements also were supplied to the synthetic wastewater according to li et al 2020b 2 3 analytical methods the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n collected from influent and effluent samples were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 each sample was detected three times for taking the mean value the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were recorded by a ph probe phs 3c china the measurement of mlvss was finished by the gravimetric method apha 2005 extracellular polymeric substances eps containing polysaccharide ps and protein pn were extracted at different voltage stages by the heat extraction method yin et al 2015 and measured by the phenol sulfuric acid and the lowry method respectively dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 heme c content was determined as described by yin et al 2015 the observation of the electrode biofilm morphology in r1 and r2 was achieved using scanning electron microscopy sem liu et al 2019 2 4 microbial community analysis five sludge samples s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 were harvested from r1and r2 during the operation of 151 cycles and analyzed by high throughput sequencing meanwhile s0 represented the inoculated sludge s1 and s3 were taken from r1 and s2 and s4 were taken from r2 when the voltages were 1 5 and 2 5 v the total extracted dna from each sample was quantified and qualitatized after that the universal polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification primers 338f and 806r were performed in the target region v3 v4 of the bacterial 16s rrna genes then the pcr products were sequenced based on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform biomarker technologies company beijing after purification the detailed analysis processes refer to the previous report gao et al 2021 2 5 kinetic analysis the modified logistic model hereafter referred to as the l model and the modified gompertz model hereafter referred to as the g model have been frequently used to describe the kinetic characteristics of the substrate degradation process in an operating cycle chen et al 2021 similarly these models are also suitable to analyze and predict nitrogen removal through mab at different applied voltages model formulas were described in supporting information text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of mab at different applied voltages fig 1 a d presented the reactor performance of r1 and r2 at different applied voltages with the applied voltage changed the nitrogen removal efficiency also correspondingly varied during saline wastewater treatment in the first 6 cycles at the voltage of 0 1 v the effluent substrates concentrations in r2 were 22 37 2 45 nh4 n and 30 98 2 14 mg l no2 n respectively which were close to those in r1 22 14 5 34 and 34 40 2 49 mg l respectively subsequently it was observed that the effluent nh4 n and no2 n of r2 at 0 6 v were 22 28 and 20 69 mg l lower than those in r1 with the voltage further increased to 1 5 v ammonium and nitrite were completely consumed with the removal efficiency of 100 are and nire which were 16 89 and 19 27 higher than those in r1 the performance of mab was significantly promoted by low voltage 1 5 v combined with the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr analysis the increment of tnrr at different applied voltages were 0 14 0 1 v 0 04 0 3 v 0 06 0 6 v 0 07 1 0 v 0 07 1 5 v kg m3 d respectively the maximal tnrr of 0 65 kg m3 d was also acquired at the voltage of 1 5 v however higher voltage 2 5 v suppressed the nitrogen removal through mab with a lower tnrr 0 33 kg m3 d in addition to the adverse effects of electrical stimulation on mab the reason for the decrease of mab activity might also be that too high voltages caused anodic oxygen evolution reaction which resulted in electrode biofilm shedding even suppressed mab growth as a result the optimal applied voltage for nitrogen removal through mab was 1 5 v in saline wastewater treatment also the voltage below 1 5 v showed a positive effect on mab activity however the bioactivity was severely inhibited when the voltage 2 0 v a previous study showed that the optimal voltage was 0 8 v for nitrogen removal through fab and the maximal tnrr variation was 0 02 kg m3 d zhang et al 2012 also qiao et al 2018 observed that the most satisfactory tnrr was acquired when the voltage was 1 0 v but it only increased by 0 08 kg m3 d in an electrode anammox reactor in this work the tnrr of mab increased by 0 16 kg m3 d at 1 5 v which was 2 0 folds as high as the results of qiao et al 2017 comparatively applied voltage has a better effect on the improvement of mab activity for removing nitrogen from saline wastewater remarkably when the voltage in r2 further increased to 2 5 v the are rapidly declined to 42 36 16 88 but the nire was still stabilized at 90 42 3 98 the mean effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 46 35 13 25 9 05 4 31 and 52 67 3 03 mg l respectively which greatly deviated from the stoichiometric ratios the accumulation of excessive no3 n and consumption of excessive no2 n at 2 5 v were attributed to the following two possible reasons one was that no2 n was converted to no3 n at anode using functional microorganisms maybe nitrite oxidizing bacteria as a catalyst koffi and okabe 2021 another was that no2 n oxidation was directly driven to no3 n at high anode potential by the electrochemical process chen et al 2014 however nitrite oxidizing bacteria such as nitrospira were not detected in the mab based consortia therefore the direct conversion of no2 n into no3 n by the electrochemical process was probably preferred in this work furthermore the nitrate produced from anammox and electrochemical process could be completely removed by coupling marine anammox process and autotrophic denitrification at cathode in the saline wastewater treatment qiao et al 2018 compared with r2 the variation of substrates in r1 was completely consistent with the anammox mechanism throughout the experiment and a slight increase of tnrr resulted from the long term culture of mab the variation of ph δph and orp δorp in saline wastewater treatment can be used to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance of mab feng et al 2020 as presented in fig 1e the peaks of mean δph and δorp were acquired when the voltage was 1 5 v 0 29 and 27 mv respectively which were higher than those at 0 1 v 0 2 and 12 mv respectively correspondingly the mean tnrr of mab also reached the maximum at this stage however with the voltage increased to 2 0 v the effluent ph was unexpectedly lower than the influent and corresponding orp values were higher this phenomenon was further strengthened by the voltage of 2 5 v the reason for the lower ph might be that too high voltages caused anodic oxygen evolution reaction which resulted in the release of large amounts of h in the electrochemical system zhang et al 2021 additionally as shown in fig 1f the stoichiometric ratios in r2 were not affected when the voltage 1 5 v the mean δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n 1 25 and 0 27 were close to the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 however compared with r1 fig s1 the stoichiometric ratios in r2 significantly deviated when the voltage 2 0 v this suggested that the transformation of nitrogen species was not only attributed to the anammox process 3 2 nitrogen removal in a typical operating cycle as presented in fig 2 the typical operating cycles of each applied voltage stage were analyzed in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment meanwhile open circuit voltage ocv at the beginning and end of the experiment served as a control experiment at ocv begin ammonium and nitrite removal efficiency are and nire were 63 93 and 55 37 respectively subsequently at the voltage of 0 6 v nh4 n was removed completely and only 7 16 mg l no2 n remained within 6 h reaction time fig 2a b with the voltage further increased to 1 5 v the reaction time for complete consumption of nh4 n was reduced to 3 h which indicated that nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment was further promoted however with the negative effect of 2 5 v are decreased to 40 27 dramatically but 96 25 of no2 n was still removed and the corresponding no3 n increased to 57 75 mg l within 6 h reaction time fig 2c this indicated that mab was significantly suppressed by higher voltage 2 0 v a previous study found that the bioactivity of anammox bacteria was restored to the initial level after being inhibited by the electric field qiao et al 2014 in this work after removing applied voltage are and nire at ocv end were 36 07 and 32 84 higher than those at ocv begin it indicated that the mab activity was also recoverable after being inhibited in saline wastewater treatment the substrates conversion rate scr in r2 at different applied voltages was presented in fig 2d previous studies found that the maximum scr scrmax could be improved and realized in a shorter reaction time by the intensification of applied factors mn2 ni2 co2 fe3 etc li et al 2020a 2020b with the positive effect of 1 5 v the scrmax increased to 1 47 from 0 96 kg m3 d at ocv begin furthermore the corresponding reaction time was reduced to 2 h from 6 h subsequently the scrmax decreased to 1 05 kg m3 d due to the negative effect of 2 5 v on mab activity this indicated that the scrmax could be improved and the start up time could be shortened by proper applied voltage as shown in fig 2e f at different applied voltages except for 2 5 v the stoichiometric ratios in a typical operating cycle presented a gradually increasing trend and they eventually approached the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 in the first 2 h the stoichiometric ratios were lower than the theoretical values and fluctuated irregularly si et al 2021 and li et al 2018a and revealed similar results in their works this could result from the variation of hydraulic conditions caused by feeding setting and draining in the reactor dramatically at 2 5 v the stoichiometric ratios 2 91 and 1 52 deviated significantly from the theoretical values the relevant reasons had been discussed in section 3 1 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis between microbial communities the alpha diversity indices of five samples s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 were summarized in table s1 based on the 97 similarity threshold the high coverage index 0 99 implied that the sequencing data in all samples were convincing compared with the inoculated sludge s0 the number of otus in other samples increased according to the variation of ace and chao 1 the maximum values were observed in s2 which indicated that microorganism enrichment was prompted by the voltage of 1 5 v generally the microbial community diversity can be characterized by simpson and shannon indices after the operation of 151 cycles the simpson index in r2 decreased to 0 89 s4 from 0 92 s0 while that in r1 increased to 0 96 s3 the shannon index showed the same variation trend this indicated that applied voltage reduced the microbial diversity of mab based consortia in saline wastewater treatment a similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 high microbial richness and low microbial diversity in s2 implied that dominant functional genera were enriched which resulted in the improvement of tnrr in r2 to investigate the similarities and differences of microbial community structures among five samples principal component analysis pca and principal coordinates analysis pcoa were conducted based on the bray curtis distance in the coordinate plot fig 3 the distance of two samples is closer implied that the difference in community composition between two samples is smaller according to the pca plot the similarity between s1 from r1 and s2 from r2 implied that the voltage of 1 5 v had no impact on microbial community composition in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment nevertheless higher voltage 2 5 v significantly changed the microbial community composition in r2 according to the difference between s2 and s4 the changes of microbial community structure under applied voltage were further confirmed by pcoa analysis 3 3 2 microbial community dynamics to illustrate the shift of dominant genera in nitrogen rich saline wastewater treatment deeply the top 10 phylum and top 30 genus of five samples in r1 and r2 were analyzed at phylum level the predominant phyla of five samples were proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were fig 4 a accounting for more than 85 of all microorganisms the relative abundance of proteobacteria in r2 increased continuously to 53 67 s4 from 41 04 s0 which was 6 7 higher than that of s3 in r1 it was reported that most electroactive microorganisms belonged to the proteobacteria phylum logan 2009 therefore the electroactive microorganisms in r2 could be enriched resulting from electrical stimulation similarly the actinobacteria phylum was also detected in the bio electrochemical systems frequently velvizhi and mohan 2015 its abundance reached the maximum 5 64 at 1 5 v and then decreased to 2 26 at 2 5 v the planctomycetes played a vital role in nitrogen removal through mab and its abundance increased by 3 99 under proper applied voltage 27 80 for s2 and 23 81 for s1 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in r1and r2 was similar and showed only slight fluctuation comparatively the relative abundances of chloroflexi acidobacteria and calditrichaeota in r2 showed slight growing trends with the increase of applied voltage these results suggested that applied voltage changed the microbial community structure at phylum level which resulted from the high selectivity to different microorganisms at genus level candidatus scalindua as the predominant functional bacteria had been proved to be an electroactive microorganism for treating nitrogen rich saline wastewater shaw et al 2020 among five samples the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua was 16 97 s0 18 26 s1 22 89 s2 19 38 s3 and 10 65 s4 respectively fig 4b the abundance in s2 was the highest which implied that proper applied voltage 1 5 v promoted the growth rate of candidatus scalindua at this stage the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr also reached the maximum however due to the negative effect of 2 5 v the candidatus scalindua was significantly inhibited with a lower abundance 10 65 for s4 compared with that without applied voltage 19 38 for s3 as a result the enhancement of nitrogen removal performance in r2 might result from the increased relative abundance of candidatus scalindua besides several unclassified genus belonging to the class gammaproteobacteria were also identified such as unclassified gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and unclassified gammaproteobacteria it was reported that the class gammaproteobacteria are commonly found in the marine environment and participate in the marine nutrient cycle evans et al 2008 including organic carbon turnover and nitrogen and sulfur cycling processes baker et al 2015 the relative abundance of the class gammaproteobacteria in r2 53 59 for s4 increased by 19 17 compared with that in r1 34 42 for s3 meanwhile the genus gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum had been proved to be electroactive microorganisms logan et al 2019 their abundance increased to 19 87 and 0 27 s4 from 11 76 and 0 18 s0 respectively fig 4b this suggested that applied voltage was highly selective for electroactive microorganisms in saline wastewater treatment in addition the genus rhodobacteraceae was also detected in two reactors which was responsible to reduce nitrate to nitrite using endogenous substrates rios del toro et al 2017 thus the nitrate produced by anammox process could be utilized by denitrifiers such as rhodobacteraceae to provide an electron acceptor nitrite for anammox bacteria research showed that ignavibacterium was involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process li et al 2021c the ignavibacterium was upregulated in r1 while it continuously decreased to 0 99 from 1 50 in r2 this indicated that applied voltage was not beneficial to its enrichment consequently the shift of microbial community structure was closely related to the nitrogen removal through mab at different applied voltages in saline wastewater treatment 3 3 3 microbial functions prediction based on the kegg database based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the dynamics of microbial functions among all samples were analyzed by the picrust2 tool according to the kegg pathway fig 5 four predominant classes metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes with 21 functional genes were analyzed meanwhile carbohydrate metabolism 8 00 8 28 and amino acid 7 18 7 46 were the first and second most abundant functional genes the abundance of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in r1 increased continuously while they first increased and then decreased in r2 the most abundances were observed in s2 with the voltage of 1 5 v a similar variation trend was observed for nitrogen removal through mab in r1 and r2 this suggested that the supply of carbon and nitrogen sources in marine anammox process were essential for cellular synthesis and metabolism of mab for treating saline wastewater in addition the highest abundance of energy metabolism was also observed in s2 the energy metabolism was involved in the production of intracellular materials and microbial metabolism therefore the improvement of mab activity might be attributed to the upregulation of the abundance of energy and carbohydrate metabolism compared with r1 the relative abundance of xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism transport and catabolism and lipid metabolism in r2 were downregulated conversely the replication and repair signal transduction and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were upregulated differently the relative abundance of cell motility and membrane transport in s2 increased first and then decreased to the minimum in s4 this indicated that the metabolism and intracellular material transformation ability of mab were affected by applied voltage it was reported that electrical stimulation intensified the microbial metabolism activity by changing the permeability of cells membrane guo et al 2019 in this work mab activity was promoted by the voltage of 1 5 v which possibly resulted from the improvement of ion migration velocity during microbial metabolism further study was still needed to confirm it 3 4 variations of eps and heme c extracellular polymeric substances eps which are mainly composed of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps play an essential role in promoting the stability and activity of anammox biomass hou et al 2015 by the beginning of the experiment the eps content in r1 and r2 was stable at 6 35 0 30 mg g wet weight fig 6 a the eps content in r1 presented a slightly increasing trend and reached the maximum of 10 41 mg g wet weight on cycle 151 differently at the voltage of 1 5 v the eps content in r2 increased to 14 94 mg g wet weight which was 1 52 folds higher than that in r1 on the same cycle subsequently the eps content declined to 9 34 mg g wet weight due to the negative effect of 2 5 v furthermore compared with r1 the increments of eps content in r2 at different applied voltages were 0 0 v 1 06 0 3 v 2 5 0 6 v 5 13 1 5 v and 1 07 2 5 v mg g wet weight respectively this indicated that eps secretion was promoted by low applied voltages 1 5 v therefore the nitrogen removal performance of mab at different applied voltages was positively correlated with the variation of eps content which implied that eps content could be used to characterize the nitrogen removal performance of mab in saline wastewater treatment in addition the pn ps ratio in r2 gradually increased to the maximum of 13 96 from 7 76 however it always remained stable between 7 75 and 8 63 in r1 during the experiment some studies indicated that a high pn ps ratio contributed to the formation of biofilm by adhesion of anammox biomass on electrodes liu et al 2019 yin et al 2015 according to the physical photos and sem images in r1 and r2 fig s2c f more mab sludge was attached to the surface of the carbon fiber brush in r2 compared with that in r1 and the electrode biofilm in r2 was significantly thicker these results indicated that it was easier to form biofilm on the electrode surface by electrical stimulation heme c as a key co enzyme factor in the anammox metabolism has been confirmed as an indicator to reflect the bioactivity of anammox biomass ma et al 2019 hence the heme c content in r1 and r2 was measured at different voltage stages fig 6b in contrast to the steady increase of heme c in r1 the peak of heme c in r2 was acquired at 1 5 v 1 75 μm g vss which was 40 higher than that in r1 the increment of heme c gradually increased to 0 50 μm g vss 1 5 v from 0 17 μm g vss 0 3 v and then the heme c content rapidly declined to 0 42 μm g vss at 2 5 v which was lower than that in r1 through the physical photos fig s2a b the color of anammox biomass changed from carmine in r1 to brownish red in r2 some studies reported that the characteristic of carmine red in anammox bacteria results from high heme c content in cells kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 in this work more heme c was secreted at proper applied voltage which resulted in the improvement of mab activity in saline wastewater treatment similar results were also observed in previous reports ma et al 2019 2020 3 5 kinetic analysis the l model and g model were used to further analyze and predict the nitrogen removal process of mab at different applied voltages for treating saline wastewater fig 7 a b the fitted parameters contained r2 relative coefficient sremax rmax and λ were acquired from both models data for supporting information according to the r2 0 97 values the nitrogen removal process of mab could be well fitted through both models at different applied voltages however the fitted sremax values by the l model were closer to the experimental values than that by the g model fig 7c therefore the l model was more suitable for analyzing and predicting the nitrogen removal process of mab at different applied voltages in saline wastewater treatment nevertheless the g model could only be used at high voltage stages recently zhu et al 2017 confirmed that adding appropriate metal ions or optimizing the reactor structure was a feasible way to shorten the lag time of mab in saline wastewater treatment li et al 2020b yu et al 2019 as presented in fig 7d the fitted λ a lag time values by the l model at different applied voltages were analyzed at the voltage of 1 5 v the fitted λ value reached the minimum value of 0 05 h which was 0 72 h lower than that at open circuit voltage 0 v and then the fitted λ values at higher voltage 2 0 v were still lower and stabilized at 0 27 0 28 h the lag time was shortened significantly by the stimulation of proper applied voltage meanwhile the fitted rmax values increased gradually to 33 31 h at 1 5 v and then declined to 19 68 h at 2 5 v these results indicated that exerting proper applied voltage could not only shorten the lag time of marine anammox process but also promote the substrates removal rate in saline wastewater treatment combined with the analysis above the optimal voltage of 1 5 v for nitrogen removal through mab in saline wastewater treatment was further verified by the fitted values of the remodified logistic model 4 conclusion in this work the growth up and nitrogen removal of mab had been successfully regulated at different applied voltages which was firstly studied to use mab for treating saline wastewater the main findings were as follows the optimal applied voltage for nitrogen removal through mab was 1 5 v the total nitrogen removal rate increased by 29 10 compared with that of control without applied voltage applied voltage reduced microbial diversity and was highly selective for electroactive microorganisms in mab based consortia meanwhile the candidatus scalindua was enriched and strengthened by the voltage of 1 5 v more eps and heme c were secreted implied that mab activity was promoted by proper applied voltage higher voltage 2 0 v had a negative effect on mab activity but it was recoverable after removing applied voltage based on the remodified logistic model analysis applied voltage shortened the lag time of marine anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16181,distributed infiltration systems can benefit downstream water bodies by reducing the runoff flowrate and volume discharges from the catchment investigating their runoff flowrate and volume reduction potential at the catchment scale will inform decision makers regarding their efficacy for managing catchment outflows to this end we conducted field investigations at the residential catchment scale for three years the study monitored the catchment for one year before the installation of leaky well systems preinstallation and two years after installation postinstallation the hydrological model calibrated to preinstallation catchment outflows acted as a virtual control tool runoff flow outputs from the control model and two years of monitored runoff flow data from the postinstallation period were analysed using statistical methods the statistical tests showed a significant 13 reduction in average flowrates in storms with a corresponding runoff flowrate of up to 50 l s the study further reported the ability of infiltration systems to reduce runoff volume in the catchment by 9 this reduction was not significant however as per the results of the statistical analysis we then fitted the generalized linear model glm to the monitored and simulated runoff volume data this enabled us to break down the effect of curbside infiltration systems on runoff volume according to corresponding peak flowrates during the storm the results of the two way anova performed to detect significant differences in the regression slopes of the glm indicated that curbside infiltration systems significantly reduced runoff volume for storms when the runoff flowrates remained below 100 l s graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords catchment scale study water sensitive urban design wsud hydraulic investigations hydrological modelling statistical hydrology 1 introduction in a society with a high awareness of climate change and the effects of urbanization on water resources a strong argument exists for including green infrastructure in urban planning consequently novel green infrastructure is being increasingly applied to address the impacts of urbanization on stormwater management provide alternative water supplies and reduce urban heat island effects in the 1990s the philosophy of water sensitive urban design wsud emerged in australia based on the principles of sustainable water management including managing stormwater by detaining and utilizing rainfall in situ argue et al 2013 wsud is a philosophy of water management that has been popular in australia since and is akin to other sustainable water management philosophies such as low impact development lid and best management practices bmps in the usa sustainable urban drainage systems suds in the uk and sponge cities in china fletcher et al 2015 devices such as rainwater tanks pervious pavements bioretention basins rain gardens swales and leaky wells are common to these approaches and they are typically applied in combination with conventional drainage networks to reduce and delay flood peaks argue et al 2013 1 1 performance of curbside infiltration systems curbside stormwater harvesting systems are a form of wsud that have been developed to intercept runoff from sealed urban surfaces and direct the captured runoff into the root zone of street trees grey et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 szota et al 2019 research into curbside infiltration measures is limited but some studies have reported on the application of these systems in mainstream stormwater management for example a field based study in australia monitored the retention capacity of 24 curbside infiltration trenches in melbourne australia each trench had a storage capacity of up to 960 l the most effective trench retained up to 43 of the total contributing runoff but 8 to 14 was typical szota et al 2019 the study reported that tree pits have the potential to retain runoff for rain events with rainfall depths 10 mm this study indicated runoff retention by individual curbside infiltration systems but no investigation of this retention on catchment runoff volume and flowrate discharges has yet been conducted 1 2 catchment scale field studies the runoff reduction benefits of curbside infiltration systems in a developed catchment based on monitored rainfall runoff data are seldom reported loperfido et al 2014 the literature usually reports on the performance of individual systems for example the studies noted above however the hydrological efficiencies of distributed infiltration devices may vary across a catchment due to various factors including bypass flowrate and capture efficiency of inlets grey et al 2018 szota et al 2019 for example storms of higher magnitude may lead to increased flow velocities with greater potential to mobilize sediment and fallen leaves the result could be the proliferation of sediments and fallen leaves in the dish area of the curbside inlet this may temporarily block the inlet orifice resulting in reduced runoff conductance through curbside inlets therefore upscaling performance measured at the individual system level to investigate performance when distributed across a catchment may be misleading to address this potential for error several methods have been developed in one method wsud devices are installed in one of a matched pair of catchments and catchment outflows are then compared between the two systems this is usually referred to as a paired catchment approach at the catchment scale we only found three paired catchment studies in the literature shuster and rhea 2013 reported on the effect of applying 50 rain gardens of a 16 m2 planned area and 100 rain barrels of 300 l volume in a peri urban catchment of 1800 ha in cincinnati ohio united states catchment runoff flow data from this catchment were then compared with a control catchment with no rain gardens or rain barrels they reported no significant effect on catchment runoff flowrates from the catchment after installing the wsud devices however they did report a reduction in runoff volume of up to 6 9 following the installation of an additional 35 rain gardens and 74 rain barrels the second study was based on experiments by jarden et al 2016 in a small catchment of 35 ha in parma ohio usa they adopted a paired catchment approach using two residential streets with 0 05 ha 0 075 ha residential lots as control subcatchments 10 5 ha and 6 7 ha and two residential streets streets with 0 1 ha to 0 2 ha residential lots 11 7 ha and 6 ha as treatment sites each street is a subcatchment of west creek catchment jarden et al 2016 reported up to 33 reductions in peak flows and up to 40 reductions in total runoff volume from urban streets the third paired catchment study was performed by page et al 2015 the focus of this study was to determine the hydrological effects of bioretention cells pervious pavements and tree filter devices these devices were retrofitted in a 0 53 ha catchment in wilmington north carolina usa and the catchment outflows were compared with a nearby control catchment after retrofitting with these devices the directly connected impervious area was reduced from 24 to 12 a 50 reduction the study reported a 52 reduction in the runoff volume and a similar reduction was observed in the runoff coefficient the study further reported a 28 reduction in peak flowrates during the study period 1 3 hydrological model as virtual control the rarity of catchment scale studies can be attributed to two potential causes a high financial costs and b time constraints in addition finding ideal control and treatment catchments with similar hydrological features in urbanized environments is challenging shuster and rhea 2013 given these difficulties zégre et al 2010 proposed that a model may be used as a virtual control to simulate prechange hydrology and to determine the extent of change in the hydrological performance of a catchment li et al 2019 adopted this approach to evaluate the performance of wsud devices this study monitored a suite of wsud devices including rain gardens green roofs and infiltration basins with storage capacities from 70 m3 to 1200 m3 in a 111 ha urban catchment using an artificial neural network model calibrated based on the runoff flowrates and volumes of storm events measured prior to wsud construction li et al 2019 compared predicted runoff flowrates and volumes in the catchment based on data collected before and after the construction of wsud devices the authors reported runoff volume reductions in the range of 0 5 to 79 for events observed with an average reduction of 25 and concluded that the wsud elements effectively managed storm events of small duration and low intensity 1 4 study objectives in the literature review of catchment scale studies we found that empirical studies such as those that use the paired catchment approach cited previously applied wsud devices in combination and did not directly contribute to the knowledge base regarding the efficacy of a particular device retrofitted over the entire catchment studies incorporating a single device type at the catchment scale are nonexistent this study was designed to fill these knowledge gaps based on the installation of a single wsud device type at various locations across an urbanised catchment in this study we applied a hydrological model as a virtual control to simulate catchment hydrology based on the pre wsud conditions using the approach of zégre et al 2010 to date this approach has not been widely used to assess the runoff reduction benefits provided by distributed wsud systems in urban catchments a previously calibrated and validated hydrological model developed in pcswmm version 7 2 was used in this study as a virtual control tool to represent the preinstallation catchment model preparation and evaluation were reported by shahzad et al 2021 this model was used to evaluate the performance of the catchment without wsud the preinstallation catchment when subjected to storm events observed after the installation of leaky wells the study aimed to investigate the ability of curbside leaky well systems to reduce runoff peak flowrates and volume from the catchment the hypothesis that the installation of dispersed small scale infiltration devices in a low permeability clay environment will not reduce the stormwater runoff volume or peak flowrates in an urban catchment was tested 2 materials and methods this study tested the stated hypothesis by analysing the runoff produced after the installation of leaky wells throughout the case study catchment the postinstallation phase against outputs from a validated hydrological model representing the preinstallation catchment conditions in this approach the first step was to monitor the catchment for the acceptable duration to capture pre and postinstallation catchment behaviour the second step was to prepare and evaluate the performance of a hydrological model to represent the preinstallation catchment hydrology the third step was to analyse the runoff flow and volume data to detect differences in pre and postinstallation catchment behaviour 2 1 study area description empirical data were collected from a residential catchment containing 108 residential allotments in a catchment area of 17 45 ha in hawthorn 34 975 s 138 603 e an inner suburb located 5 km south of adelaide the capital city of south australia fig 1 the site is characterized by a semiarid climate with a mean annual temperature of 20 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 541 mm the study site is located in the southern australia climate zone argue et al 2013 notably 80 of rainfall events have an intensity of less than 4 mm hr pavelic et al 1997 based on its location in the southern climate zone the connected paved area in the catchment is assigned a runoff coefficient of 0 90 and the indirectly connected area has a 10 year runoff coefficient of 0 10 argue et al 2013 the region has an average annual potential evapotranspiration of 1500 mm bureau of meteorology 2019 the catchment terrain slopes in a westerly direction at a gradient of 0 5 separate sewer and stormwater drainage systems serve the catchment as is usual in australia in december 2015 prior to the installation of curbside infiltration systems the catchment was fitted with equipment to measure rainfall runoff volume and flowrate a tipping bucket rain gauge tb3 hyquest solutions warwick farm new south wales australia was installed near the northern side of the catchment 34 97350 138 60075 to collect rainfall data in increments of 0 2 mm at a one minute resolution a flow metre starflow ultrasonic doppler instrument model 6526 unidata pty ltd o connor western australia was installed in a 450 mm diameter concrete drainpipe at the end of the catchment 34 97400 138 60086 the depth measurement accuracy of this device was 1 mm and the flow velocity accuracy was 1 mm s 2 2 description of curbside leaky well systems curbside inlets and leaky wells are structural wsuds that have been implemented in catchments across australia curbside inlets and leaky wells are typically placed in new or existing urban catchments to provide distributed storage for the retention of stormwater runoff and passive irrigation of street trees in this study curbside inlets in the form of treenet inlets treenet inlet model r750 space down under adelaide australia were installed with adjacent leaky wells the design of a typical treenet inlet and leaky well system as applied across the study catchment in this research is shown in fig 2 for brevity the systems applied in the study catchment will be referred to as curbside leaky wells unless otherwise noted the details regarding the design working mechanism and volumetric capacity of installed leaky wells are described in the supplementary information note that each leaky well had no formal overflow system when full all flow bypassed the inlet plate fig 2 a the ability of curbside leaky well systems to restore storage capacity is dependent on the exfiltration rate to the surrounding soil the time required for a leaky well to empty following cessation of inflow was measured in six leaky wells three on each of two streets near opposite ends of the study catchment the emptying time was measured using water level depth loggers hobo model u20l 04 onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa in january 2017 93 curbside inlets were installed in streets throughout the western side of the gauged catchment and connected to leaky wells constructed in the adjacent verges tree lawns phase 1 an additional 88 inlets and wells were installed on the eastern side of the catchment in december 2017 phase 2 fig 1 data recorded prior to december 2016 illustrated catchment behaviour without curbside inlets and leaky wells preinstallation data recorded between january 2017 and december 2017 inclusive phase 1 illustrated catchment behaviour with 93 curbside inlets and leaky wells installed data recorded during and after january 2018 phase 2 illustrated catchment behaviour with 181 curbside inlets and leaky wells 2 3 description of the hydrological model the catchment model was constructed using pcswmm version 7 2 computational hydraulics international ontario canada full details of model preparation and assessment were provided in a previous study shahzad et al 2021 the model was calibrated for flowrates observed in the preinstallation period 21 december 2015 to 30 september 2016 the model was calibrated and validated in accordance with the recommendations of the asce asce task committee 1993 the model achieved an nse value of 0 66 for the continuous flow time series and for individual calibration events in the time series the nse ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 shahzad et al 2021 the percent error in volume pev for the continuous series was 4 while the pev for individual events varied from 4 to 19 the percent error peak pep for individual events varied from 7 to 15 the performance of the model was then evaluated using the model performance criteria established by moriasi et al 2015 according to these criteria the performance of the model was considered satisfactory for representing the preinstallation catchment for advanced studies based on these results we decided to use a preinstallation model as a control tool in this study to analyse the preinstallation catchment outputs for postinstallation storm events specifically we compared the runoff predictions from the preinstallation catchment model with field monitored runoff data from storm events in phase 1 and phase 2 the preinstallation model in this study is referred to as the control model 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis 2 4 1 data processing and grouping the time series processing tool in pcswmm version 7 2 was used to identify and extract individual runoff flow events from the continuous time series a runoff event for this study was defined based on runoff flow beginning no less than 12 hours after the cessation of runoff flow from a previous storm the time series processing included the extension of each event by three hours preceding and following the runoff flow this was done to include any pre storm rainfall in considerations storms that met the 12 hour separation requirement were separated into preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 groups before being sorted further by flowrate as measured at the catchment outfall table 1 sorting these storms as per this criterion for event based performance comparison resulted in discarding a total runoff volume of 6 in the preinstallation phase and 11 in the postinstallation phase the performance of curbside leaky wells is impacted by the approach flowrate sapdhare et al 2019 and runoff with a high velocity may bypass the inlet orifice of curbside leaky wells without being intercepted szota et al 2019 to assess the limits of leaky wells according to corresponding flowrates storm events from both the preinstallation and postinstallation phases were extracted and grouped based on the associated flowrate thresholds we grouped the storms according to observed flowrates before performing statistical analysis 2 4 2 statistical analysis before using the data to identify the changes in the runoff volume and flowrates we performed the following statistical analysis on preinstallation and postinstallation runoff outflows at the 0 05 level of significance 2 4 2 1 runoff flowrate analysis for each flowrate group the maximum and mean postinstallation observed flowrates were calculated and compared against the preinstallation catchment flowrates for the same time periods using the control model simulation data initially we performed one way analysis of variance anova to detect any main effects of installing curbside leaky well systems on the average group flowrates as described in table 1 we calculated the control model group averages as a control for testing the post hoc analysis results using dunnett s test as discussed by queen et al 2002 for each rainfall event in each flowrate category a t test was used to investigate the significance of any differences in mean flows in the catchment in the preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 states with flows grouped according to the flowrate thresholds defined in table 1 following this analysis we also performed a rainfall runoff analysis to identify the peak flowrate response of the catchment to rainfall depths for this analysis we plotted the total rainfall depth of each storm against the corresponding peak flowrate as noted during the storm the analysis was performed based on flowrate groups as identified in table 1 this gave us the groupwise runoff response based on the observed rainfall depth and peak flowrate then we compared the runoff response to estimate any reductions between installation stages 2 4 2 2 runoff discharge series analysis we performed ranked based nonparametric mann kendall tests to identify any trends change in the observed patterns of runoff outflows the mann kendall test was performed on the monthly rainfall and runoff volumes of the continuous flow records considering all available data including the data discarded as part of the storm event selection in section 2 4 1 to ensure that trend variations were not a function of seasonality we applied a multiplicative model to remove the effects of seasonality from the runoff time series before performing the mann kendall tests full details of this are provided in the supplementary information we then performed mann kendall tests on the seasonally adjusted monthly rainfall and runoff volumes setting the monthly runoff volume against control model predictions for the postinstallation phases we estimated the runoff retained by each system during phase 1 and phase 2 runoff retention refers to the runoff volume retained by each leaky well system this retention is estimated based on the total runoff volume reductions as observed in the postinstallation phases compared with the control averaged over the total number of leaky wells sen s slope was also estimated to investigate the magnitude of change in catchment hydrology over the duration of the experiment the sign of the s statistic indicated the direction of change sen 1968 2 4 2 3 runoff volume event based analysis a regression analysis was performed on the monitored per event total runoff volumes against control model predictions the analysis was performed for preinstallation and for phase 1 and phase 2 of the curbside leaky well installation we performed an ordinary least square regression ols analysis among the control model outputs and observed the postinstallation runoff events grouped according to the installation phases of the curbside leaky wells a decrease in regression slope indicated a reduction in imperviousness relative to an increase in the density of curbside leaky wells the residuals of the regression models were analysed using one way anova to test the hypothesis that residuals from the regression model in phase 1 and phase 2 would be significantly different from those in the preinstallation phase as the control model cannot explain the effect of added retention storage in the form of curbside leaky wells the residuals from the regression model were grouped into three phases preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 if the null hypothesis was true then no difference should be found among the three groups of residuals from the regression model indicating no significant difference between the preinstallation and postinstallation catchment discharge values we investigated the runoff volume outflows to determine whether the density and storage capacity of curbside leaky well systems significantly influenced runoff outflow patterns therefore we fitted a generalized linear model glm and performed two way factorial anova to assess the significance of the relation between the flowrate and each installation phase this approach enabled us to quantify the flowrate threshold up to which a significant reduction in runoff volume could be detected the equality of the slope was then tested based on the results of two way anova with a post hoc comparison of slopes or coefficients using tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test ordinary least squares ols regression was used to determine whether the installation of inlets and wells altered the volumetric runoff coefficient of the catchment the events analysed are listed in table 1 regressions were performed for the flowrate groups indicated in table 1 the slope of the regression line between the rainfall volume kl and runoff volume kl was accepted as the volumetric runoff coefficient of the catchment guo and urbonas 2014 3 results 3 1 runoff flowrate reductions the model of the preinstallation catchment predicted higher peak flows than those measured for 70 of events during phase 1 and for 77 of events during phase 2 fig 3 the one way anova indicated that the differences in mean flowrate between the control and phase 1 and phase 2 treatments were not significant α 0 05 f 3 132 1 47 p 0 22 however in the low flowrate categories associated with low intensity rainfall events peak flows did differ between the control and treatment cases table 2 during phase 2 with 181 curbside inlets and leaky wells in the catchment events with peak flowrates of less than 50 l s were reduced by up to 13 16 notably this could be above 14 if the result considers the error analysis of peak flow prediction in each flowrate group supplementary information fig s7 however the runoff response analysis based on total rainfall depth fig 4 shows that in phase 1 the peak flowrate to total rainfall depth was reduced by 5 and for phase 2 it was reduced by 12 50 fig 4 these reductions are in the same range as estimated by comparing the control model outputs against the observed peak flowrates we therefore conclude that despite model errors the results of the predictions are reasonable and we can expect peak flow reductions of up to 12 for runoff flows less than 50 l s the results of t tests performed on individual flowrate groups showed that the installation of leaky wells significantly reduced peak flowrates for storms with a peak flow of up to 100 l s table 2 but not above this 3 2 quantification of runoff volume reduction 3 2 1 runoff volume discharge series analysis and retention the mann kendall trend tests fig 5 indicated a decreasing but nonsignificant trend in catchment runoff volume outflows corresponding to the installation of leaky wells s statistic 120 α 0 05 τ 0 191 sen s slope quantified this decrease to be 5 kl z 1 622 n 36 p 0 1048 per month the slope was nonsignificant as well indicating insufficient evidence to suggest that runoff discharges during the preinstallation and postinstallation phases displayed significant shifts in their patterns due to the installation of curbside leaky well systems fig 5 also shows that considerably less rainfall occurred in phase 2 than in the preinstallation and phase 1 periods we also quantified the runoff retention by comparing control model outputs against observed runoff data for the same time periods in the monitored time period the preinstallation model indicated that the catchment would have discharged 5950 kl of runoff in 2017 if the inlets had not been installed while the measured discharge was 5560 kl for this period however by considering a 4 overprediction based on the volumetric error of the model over the continuous time series section 2 1 this equates to up to 5712 kl of runoff from the control model or a 3 reduction in the 2017 annual runoff volume these reductions indicate that at least 152 kl of stormwater was harvested and retained in the catchment by the curbside leaky wells with a mean retention per inlet of 1 63 kl in 2017 in phase 2 the total runoff from the catchment in 2018 was 2400 kl while the preinstallation model with no curbside inlets and leaky wells predicted 2650 kl after adjusting for up to 4 overprediction this difference resulted in an estimated 9 reduction in total runoff with a total stormwater retention volume of 252 kl or a mean volumetric reduction of 1 38 kl per inlet in 2018 the decrease in volumetric runoff retention per device could be attributed to the reduced rainfall in 2018 compared with 2017 this difference resulted in less discharge from the catchment and therefore less discharge for leaky wells to intercept based on these results we concluded that by installing leaky well systems the average potential runoff retention ranged from 3 to 9 during phases 1 and 2 3 2 2 runoff volume reduction event based the installation of curbside leaky wells resulted in additional retention storage in the catchment relative to that in the preinstallation catchment the field monitored data showed that the total discharge volume was reduced over the study period however the proportion of stormwater retained decreased as the storm intensity increased in this study this was manifested by the decreasing slope of the regression line between the control model outputs and total runoff from observed storms fig 6 the results of the one way anova α 0 05 f 2 100 1 64 p 0 19 0 05 for the regression model residuals indicated no significant difference among the three monitoring phases based on these results we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no significant difference between the pre and postinstallation runoff regimes the relationship between the control model and observed runoff flows was further explored by considering the data in the flowrate groups presented in table 1 for each phase fig 7 the regression slopes of the glm analysis showed that in storms with flowrates of 10 l s f 100 l s the preinstallation catchment runoff volume was greater than the postinstallation runoff volume fig 7 table 3 during high flowrate storms the difference in regression slopes was negligible compared with the preinstallation slopes table 3 this result was indicative of the diminishing impact of curbside leaky wells on retaining runoff during high flow rate events the runoff reduction in the two phases was more pronounced in phase 2 particularly for low flowrate groups such as f 100 l s the results of the two way anova once flowrates were considered showed that the effects of the installation stages accounted for 7 3 of the total variance with p 0 004 f dfn 4 dfd 89 4 16 this relation in combination with curbside leaky wells was considered significant however the post hoc analysis of regression coefficients with standard error from the glm indicated that the interaction term between the flowrate and installation phases had a significant effect on runoff for 10 l s f 50 l s storms in phase 1 and phase 2 table 3 during storms with a flowrate of 50 l s f 100 l s only phase 2 exhibited a strong relation with leaky well installations table 3 the p value results for regression slopes compared with the preinstallation catchment are provided in table 3 and detailed statistics obtained through analysis for all interactive terms as well as the p values for each relation are provided in table s2 in the supplementary information 3 2 3 volumetric runoff coefficient the results of the runoff coefficient analysis fig 8 indicated an effective runoff coefficient reduction for events with a peak flowrate of up to 100 l s in the case study catchment however the retention effects were less notable beyond 100 l s the results were similar to those of the runoff analysis in the previous section during phase 1 the reduction in the runoff coefficient of storm events in the pre and postinstallation catchments varied from 4 to 20 in phase 2 the reduction ranged from 13 to 38 increasing the number of leaky wells in phase 2 increased the reduction in the volumetric runoff coefficient with an 18 greater reduction in the runoff coefficient for flow events with 10 l s f 50 l s and a 23 greater reduction for runoff flows with 50 l s f 100 l s the reductions are estimated from the runoff coefficients as provided in fig 8 statistical tests indicated that significant reductions were only observed for flowrates 100 l s for phase 2 storms we must note here that most runoff producing events in the studied catchment were rainfall events that fell within the low flowrate groups 10 l s f 100 l s in phase 1 events with 10 l s f 100 l s represented 70 of events table 1 in phase 2 74 had a peak flowrate in this range table 1 the benefit of installing the curbside leaky well is therefore notable in this range in a given year the curbside inlet and leaky well systems significantly reduced the volumetric runoff coefficient by at least 15 for 70 of observed storms 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological storage volume a critical factor curbside leaky wells achieved inferior runoff flowrates and volume reductions compared with published studies e g jarden et al 2016 page et al 2015 in contrast with previous studies the curbside leaky wells in this case study with a density of 10 systems ha were placed in the path of runoff from 100 of the directly connected impervious area of the catchment this provides curbside leaky well systems with a maximum opportunity to intercept runoff this should have significantly reduced runoff flowrates in street gutters according to jarden et al 2016 despite these favourable conditions the reductions in runoff flowrate we estimated for the case study catchment were less than those reported by jarden et al 2016 they reported runoff flowrate reductions of 42 in peak flowrates of up to 300 l s in comparison current leaky well systems on average only achieved 4 13 peak flow reduction for flowrates of up to 100 l s beyond flowrates greater than 100 l s the estimated runoff flowrate reductions remain minimal 1 3 we reason that contrary to the 1 footprint in the current study the study area of jarden et al 2016 included green infrastructure which covered 12 5 to 32 5 of the total contributing drainage area page et al 2015 reported an estimated runoff flowrate reduction of 28 based on the differences in regression slopes between the control and treatment catchments page et al 2015 achieved this reduction by installing 23 kl of storage to manage runoff from a 0 53 ha catchment of which only 52 of the directly connected impervious area was discharged to the retrofitted wsud systems again the curbside leaky wells in this study were designed for runoff from the entire 17 45 ha catchment but with only 18 kl total storage this comparison indicates that hydrological storage volume governed the performance of the curbside leaky well systems in this study as such other factors recommended in the literature such as connecting larger connected impervious areas to wsud systems only become critical once sufficient hydrological storage volume is provided these findings are also consistent with model based studies of other distributed storage devices for example myers et al 2014 simulated the performance of rain gardens in a 2 3 ha catchment each raingarden had ponding storage volumes between 0 84 m3 and 0 93 m3 as reported by myers et al 2014 as the storage volume per hectare of the catchment increased rain gardens reduced the peak flowrates by 39 for a six month ari storm event and the performance was reduced for less frequent higher intensity storms we detected the influence of increasing storage volume on runoff volume reductions as reported in section 3 2 2 the results from the glm fig 7 analysis show that during storms with corresponding flowrates of 10 l s f 50 l s a significant reduction in runoff volume occurred in phase 1 and phase 2 however in phase 2 a significant runoff volume reduction was also detected for storms with runoff flows of 50 l s f 100 l s table 3 similarly the volumetric runoff coefficient analysis showed that significant results were obtained by increasing the storage volume and the number of wells effectively increasing the total catchment wsud storage volume section 3 2 3 we attribute this significant difference in phase 2 to the addition of more 88 curbside leaky wells which is tantamount to the addition of 9 kl of storage capacity in the catchment and reduction of the drainage to storage ratio this finding suggests that if runoff flowrate and volume management are priorities the ratio of well storage to the contributing area must be considered based on the above discussion we reason that the hydrological storage volume of individual curbside leaky well systems along with their exfiltration rate were key limiting factors due to limited storage volume and modest exfiltration rate significant runoff reductions were not detected for events with higher flowrates in this study leaky wells with limited storage volume filled rapidly during storm events and once the wells were full the catchment behaved similarly to the control case in addition to limited storage volume a slow exfiltration rate to the surrounding soil limited the recovery of storage volume the leaky wells in the study catchment were installed in a clay soil profile resulting in a low exfiltration rate of 0 002 l s therefore in long duration events the ongoing flowrate reduction effects of leaky well devices cannot be as prominent as those for wells in more favourable soils such as sandy soils the results for this case study catchment therefore suggest that the storage volume of wsud systems was critical especially as all of the connected impervious areas were potentially intercepted particularly in slow draining soils such as clays 4 2 runoff volume retention the results of the mann kendall testing section 3 2 1 showed that in phase 1 with 93 curbside leaky wells the monitored catchment flows exhibited a slight reduction in runoff compared with the equivalent flows from the control model despite having limited storage volume under field conditions the curbside inlets with 100 l leaky wells collected on average 1 5 kl of runoff in 2017 and 1 25 kl in 2018 stormwater harvesting at this scale can be highly beneficial to vegetation in arid and semiarid regions neumann and cardon 2012 as a vital component of urban greening and can support sapling growth and increased evapotranspiration to help mitigate urban heat island effects berland et al 2017 gleeson 2020 in a catchment case study where the behaviour of mature white cedar melia azedarach trees with inlets and wells was compared with trees without leaky wells their root zones experienced 29 more transpiration during summer months additionally sapling photosynthesis was 94 higher sapling height was 50 greater and sapling trunk diameter growth was 25 higher gleeson 2020 however the runoff retention of individual systems can suffer from two other factors in addition to storage volume a bypass runoff volume for high flow rate events leaky wells exhibit reduced interception efficiency leading to increases in bypass runoff sapdhare et al 2019 reported that the capture flowrate of a curbside inlet placed at a 0 5 gradient identical to that in the study catchment was 51 lower when the flowrate was 5 l s compared with 0 5 l s thus during storms that generate flowrates greater than 50 l s 51 of the runoff volume can potentially bypass the system without being intercepted b blockage of inlet another factor that can result in these devices being nonfunctional is the accumulation of sediments in the capture areas of curbside leaky well systems as observed during site visits after the storm fig 9 high flow velocities can potentially mobilize sediment and fallen leaves which temporarily clog curbside inlets resulting in no or reduced flow into leaky wells szota et al 2019 these observations were also validated by personal communication with residents of the catchment they reported that during storms the wells only captured runoff during the initial phase and then no noticeable runoff reductions occurred however these observations also support the usefulness of inlets in preventing sedimentation leaves and litters from entering the stormwater drainage system in this way leaky wells still contribute by improving the quality of stormwater discharge from the catchment and preventing degradation of the receiving water bodies this water quality benefit is particularly important in interconnected urban catchments that discharge to riparian or coastal areas with little or no pretreatment macdonald et al 2015 4 3 the hydrological model as a virtual control we estimated the runoff flowrate and volume reductions in this study by comparing the control model output against the observed data section 3 1 and section 3 2 1 this was conducted in lieu of a suitable control catchment for a traditional paired catchment study due to the difficulty of conducting such studies in urban environments shuster and rhea 2013 the runoff flowrate and volume reduction benefits were evaluated through comparison with similar published studies the results were logical and largely followed the trend in published studies where the results deviated from the literature findings plausible reasons were provided regarding this deviation based on this analysis we can conclude that a calibrated model can be used as an alternative control to a paired catchment in before and after control impact studies the hydrological model can provide similar benefits as can be achieved by using a paired catchment approach in contrast to a paired catchment approach a carefully constructed detailed model of the catchment in its preinstallation stage can be trusted to simulate the true preinstallation behaviour of the catchment in an urban environment additionally although we could not identify significant main effects of installing curbside leaky wells on runoff volume discharges when examining all flows from the catchment without grouping when catchment peak flowrates were grouped according to magnitude significant differences in runoff volumes were detected section 3 2 2 fig 7 this underpins the ability of the control model to represent the preinstallation catchment understanding the limitations of hydrological models should precede their use as a control for assessing the impact of curbside leaky wells in an urban environment monitoring individual wsud systems such as curbside leaky wells to understand their expected performance behaviour during storms of different intensities can benefit the user in evaluating model based benefits against field data additionally a hydrological model should only be used for the range of storms it has been calibrated against significant error due to model uncertainty may result in simulation of the model for storms that are beyond the calibration dataset 4 4 case for distributed curbside leaky well systems the results section 3 1 3 2 suggest that curbside inlet and leaky well systems in their present configurations may not be ideal measures for runoff volume and peak flow reduction from the perspective of stormwater management these limitations imply that benefits will only occur for low flow events however although reductions in peak flowrates are not highly evident such reductions are typically not the primary motivation behind the adoption of these curbside inlets and leaky wells retained runoff volume can provide passive irrigation benefits for street trees grey et al 2018 and performance can potentially be improved by adopting larger leaky well storage systems and or modified curbside inlet plates other advantages relate to ease of management unlike other distributed stormwater harvesting options such as rainwater tanks which are typically owned and operated by residents and landowners the stormwater capacity of curbside inlets and wells is generally managed by local authorities the potential value of dispersed rainwater tanks has been reported di matteo et al 2019 van dijk et al 2020 but this benefit cannot be achieved unless control of the detention capacity can be automated and not left to the discretion of the landowner petrucci et al 2012 another advantage of curbside inlets is that they collect runoff from streets which in turn typically drain runoff from allotments in urban areas as such placing wsud systems in the path of flow from all impervious areas maximizes the potential for harvest to occur additionally curbside inlets and wells help improve catchment runoff quality reduce impacts on receiving water bodies and instead deliver runoff to street tree root zones where it is bioremediated denman et al 2006 in climates with primarily low intensity rainfall such as that at the study site the use of curbside inlets and leaky wells can still be justified on the basis of their contributions to discharge reduction and the infiltration of water for environmental and human benefits more research is recommended to assess the performance of different layouts and the design of curbside infiltration systems with increased storage capacities the results of this study will assist urban planners in critically examining the hydrological storage volume of individual leaky well systems in clay environments before adopting distributed storage systems for runoff control ultimately we advocate for more catchment scale studies to discern the performance of curbside infiltration systems as runoff management solutions catchment scale study results may not be optimal and the corresponding control measures are often difficult to implement but their contribution to providing real field data for quantifying the reduction in runoff outflows from a catchment provides policy makers with tangible evidence regarding the potential of green infrastructure thus catchment scale studies can reduce the impediments to the widespread adoption of green infrastructure for runoff management 5 conclusions this study attempted to detect the effects of installing curbside inlets and leaky wells infiltration systems on runoff volume and peak flowrates from a residential catchment using a hydrological model as virtual control similar to previous studies the impacts of curbside leaky well systems on reducing runoff flowrates were not significant for all flowrates but were significant for the most frequent small storm events when the study design and results of the present study were compared with similar studies we found that the limiting factor in the performance of the curbside leaky well systems was storage volume in that they were too small to collect sufficient runoff previous studies have stressed the importance of connecting more impervious areas to curbside leaky well systems as this will give them the best opportunity to maximize runoff reduction performance however in this study systems were situated to collect all impervious area runoff from the catchment but their limited size resulted in significant impacts on runoff volume and peak flowrates during the most frequent storms only performance was also limited due to the slow emptying rate to the native clay soil therefore due to the higher hydraulic loading during intense and long duration storms curbside leaky wells did not have free storage volume for oncoming runoff based on the results of this experiment the installation of curbside leaky wells with larger storage volumes would provide greater stormwater reduction benefits furthermore our study findings stress that the placement of curbside leaky well systems and connecting large impervious areas to curbside leaky wells will only become governing factors if sufficient storage volume is provided 6 contributions hussain shahzad data analysis

16181,distributed infiltration systems can benefit downstream water bodies by reducing the runoff flowrate and volume discharges from the catchment investigating their runoff flowrate and volume reduction potential at the catchment scale will inform decision makers regarding their efficacy for managing catchment outflows to this end we conducted field investigations at the residential catchment scale for three years the study monitored the catchment for one year before the installation of leaky well systems preinstallation and two years after installation postinstallation the hydrological model calibrated to preinstallation catchment outflows acted as a virtual control tool runoff flow outputs from the control model and two years of monitored runoff flow data from the postinstallation period were analysed using statistical methods the statistical tests showed a significant 13 reduction in average flowrates in storms with a corresponding runoff flowrate of up to 50 l s the study further reported the ability of infiltration systems to reduce runoff volume in the catchment by 9 this reduction was not significant however as per the results of the statistical analysis we then fitted the generalized linear model glm to the monitored and simulated runoff volume data this enabled us to break down the effect of curbside infiltration systems on runoff volume according to corresponding peak flowrates during the storm the results of the two way anova performed to detect significant differences in the regression slopes of the glm indicated that curbside infiltration systems significantly reduced runoff volume for storms when the runoff flowrates remained below 100 l s graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords catchment scale study water sensitive urban design wsud hydraulic investigations hydrological modelling statistical hydrology 1 introduction in a society with a high awareness of climate change and the effects of urbanization on water resources a strong argument exists for including green infrastructure in urban planning consequently novel green infrastructure is being increasingly applied to address the impacts of urbanization on stormwater management provide alternative water supplies and reduce urban heat island effects in the 1990s the philosophy of water sensitive urban design wsud emerged in australia based on the principles of sustainable water management including managing stormwater by detaining and utilizing rainfall in situ argue et al 2013 wsud is a philosophy of water management that has been popular in australia since and is akin to other sustainable water management philosophies such as low impact development lid and best management practices bmps in the usa sustainable urban drainage systems suds in the uk and sponge cities in china fletcher et al 2015 devices such as rainwater tanks pervious pavements bioretention basins rain gardens swales and leaky wells are common to these approaches and they are typically applied in combination with conventional drainage networks to reduce and delay flood peaks argue et al 2013 1 1 performance of curbside infiltration systems curbside stormwater harvesting systems are a form of wsud that have been developed to intercept runoff from sealed urban surfaces and direct the captured runoff into the root zone of street trees grey et al 2018 johnson et al 2016 szota et al 2019 research into curbside infiltration measures is limited but some studies have reported on the application of these systems in mainstream stormwater management for example a field based study in australia monitored the retention capacity of 24 curbside infiltration trenches in melbourne australia each trench had a storage capacity of up to 960 l the most effective trench retained up to 43 of the total contributing runoff but 8 to 14 was typical szota et al 2019 the study reported that tree pits have the potential to retain runoff for rain events with rainfall depths 10 mm this study indicated runoff retention by individual curbside infiltration systems but no investigation of this retention on catchment runoff volume and flowrate discharges has yet been conducted 1 2 catchment scale field studies the runoff reduction benefits of curbside infiltration systems in a developed catchment based on monitored rainfall runoff data are seldom reported loperfido et al 2014 the literature usually reports on the performance of individual systems for example the studies noted above however the hydrological efficiencies of distributed infiltration devices may vary across a catchment due to various factors including bypass flowrate and capture efficiency of inlets grey et al 2018 szota et al 2019 for example storms of higher magnitude may lead to increased flow velocities with greater potential to mobilize sediment and fallen leaves the result could be the proliferation of sediments and fallen leaves in the dish area of the curbside inlet this may temporarily block the inlet orifice resulting in reduced runoff conductance through curbside inlets therefore upscaling performance measured at the individual system level to investigate performance when distributed across a catchment may be misleading to address this potential for error several methods have been developed in one method wsud devices are installed in one of a matched pair of catchments and catchment outflows are then compared between the two systems this is usually referred to as a paired catchment approach at the catchment scale we only found three paired catchment studies in the literature shuster and rhea 2013 reported on the effect of applying 50 rain gardens of a 16 m2 planned area and 100 rain barrels of 300 l volume in a peri urban catchment of 1800 ha in cincinnati ohio united states catchment runoff flow data from this catchment were then compared with a control catchment with no rain gardens or rain barrels they reported no significant effect on catchment runoff flowrates from the catchment after installing the wsud devices however they did report a reduction in runoff volume of up to 6 9 following the installation of an additional 35 rain gardens and 74 rain barrels the second study was based on experiments by jarden et al 2016 in a small catchment of 35 ha in parma ohio usa they adopted a paired catchment approach using two residential streets with 0 05 ha 0 075 ha residential lots as control subcatchments 10 5 ha and 6 7 ha and two residential streets streets with 0 1 ha to 0 2 ha residential lots 11 7 ha and 6 ha as treatment sites each street is a subcatchment of west creek catchment jarden et al 2016 reported up to 33 reductions in peak flows and up to 40 reductions in total runoff volume from urban streets the third paired catchment study was performed by page et al 2015 the focus of this study was to determine the hydrological effects of bioretention cells pervious pavements and tree filter devices these devices were retrofitted in a 0 53 ha catchment in wilmington north carolina usa and the catchment outflows were compared with a nearby control catchment after retrofitting with these devices the directly connected impervious area was reduced from 24 to 12 a 50 reduction the study reported a 52 reduction in the runoff volume and a similar reduction was observed in the runoff coefficient the study further reported a 28 reduction in peak flowrates during the study period 1 3 hydrological model as virtual control the rarity of catchment scale studies can be attributed to two potential causes a high financial costs and b time constraints in addition finding ideal control and treatment catchments with similar hydrological features in urbanized environments is challenging shuster and rhea 2013 given these difficulties zégre et al 2010 proposed that a model may be used as a virtual control to simulate prechange hydrology and to determine the extent of change in the hydrological performance of a catchment li et al 2019 adopted this approach to evaluate the performance of wsud devices this study monitored a suite of wsud devices including rain gardens green roofs and infiltration basins with storage capacities from 70 m3 to 1200 m3 in a 111 ha urban catchment using an artificial neural network model calibrated based on the runoff flowrates and volumes of storm events measured prior to wsud construction li et al 2019 compared predicted runoff flowrates and volumes in the catchment based on data collected before and after the construction of wsud devices the authors reported runoff volume reductions in the range of 0 5 to 79 for events observed with an average reduction of 25 and concluded that the wsud elements effectively managed storm events of small duration and low intensity 1 4 study objectives in the literature review of catchment scale studies we found that empirical studies such as those that use the paired catchment approach cited previously applied wsud devices in combination and did not directly contribute to the knowledge base regarding the efficacy of a particular device retrofitted over the entire catchment studies incorporating a single device type at the catchment scale are nonexistent this study was designed to fill these knowledge gaps based on the installation of a single wsud device type at various locations across an urbanised catchment in this study we applied a hydrological model as a virtual control to simulate catchment hydrology based on the pre wsud conditions using the approach of zégre et al 2010 to date this approach has not been widely used to assess the runoff reduction benefits provided by distributed wsud systems in urban catchments a previously calibrated and validated hydrological model developed in pcswmm version 7 2 was used in this study as a virtual control tool to represent the preinstallation catchment model preparation and evaluation were reported by shahzad et al 2021 this model was used to evaluate the performance of the catchment without wsud the preinstallation catchment when subjected to storm events observed after the installation of leaky wells the study aimed to investigate the ability of curbside leaky well systems to reduce runoff peak flowrates and volume from the catchment the hypothesis that the installation of dispersed small scale infiltration devices in a low permeability clay environment will not reduce the stormwater runoff volume or peak flowrates in an urban catchment was tested 2 materials and methods this study tested the stated hypothesis by analysing the runoff produced after the installation of leaky wells throughout the case study catchment the postinstallation phase against outputs from a validated hydrological model representing the preinstallation catchment conditions in this approach the first step was to monitor the catchment for the acceptable duration to capture pre and postinstallation catchment behaviour the second step was to prepare and evaluate the performance of a hydrological model to represent the preinstallation catchment hydrology the third step was to analyse the runoff flow and volume data to detect differences in pre and postinstallation catchment behaviour 2 1 study area description empirical data were collected from a residential catchment containing 108 residential allotments in a catchment area of 17 45 ha in hawthorn 34 975 s 138 603 e an inner suburb located 5 km south of adelaide the capital city of south australia fig 1 the site is characterized by a semiarid climate with a mean annual temperature of 20 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 541 mm the study site is located in the southern australia climate zone argue et al 2013 notably 80 of rainfall events have an intensity of less than 4 mm hr pavelic et al 1997 based on its location in the southern climate zone the connected paved area in the catchment is assigned a runoff coefficient of 0 90 and the indirectly connected area has a 10 year runoff coefficient of 0 10 argue et al 2013 the region has an average annual potential evapotranspiration of 1500 mm bureau of meteorology 2019 the catchment terrain slopes in a westerly direction at a gradient of 0 5 separate sewer and stormwater drainage systems serve the catchment as is usual in australia in december 2015 prior to the installation of curbside infiltration systems the catchment was fitted with equipment to measure rainfall runoff volume and flowrate a tipping bucket rain gauge tb3 hyquest solutions warwick farm new south wales australia was installed near the northern side of the catchment 34 97350 138 60075 to collect rainfall data in increments of 0 2 mm at a one minute resolution a flow metre starflow ultrasonic doppler instrument model 6526 unidata pty ltd o connor western australia was installed in a 450 mm diameter concrete drainpipe at the end of the catchment 34 97400 138 60086 the depth measurement accuracy of this device was 1 mm and the flow velocity accuracy was 1 mm s 2 2 description of curbside leaky well systems curbside inlets and leaky wells are structural wsuds that have been implemented in catchments across australia curbside inlets and leaky wells are typically placed in new or existing urban catchments to provide distributed storage for the retention of stormwater runoff and passive irrigation of street trees in this study curbside inlets in the form of treenet inlets treenet inlet model r750 space down under adelaide australia were installed with adjacent leaky wells the design of a typical treenet inlet and leaky well system as applied across the study catchment in this research is shown in fig 2 for brevity the systems applied in the study catchment will be referred to as curbside leaky wells unless otherwise noted the details regarding the design working mechanism and volumetric capacity of installed leaky wells are described in the supplementary information note that each leaky well had no formal overflow system when full all flow bypassed the inlet plate fig 2 a the ability of curbside leaky well systems to restore storage capacity is dependent on the exfiltration rate to the surrounding soil the time required for a leaky well to empty following cessation of inflow was measured in six leaky wells three on each of two streets near opposite ends of the study catchment the emptying time was measured using water level depth loggers hobo model u20l 04 onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa in january 2017 93 curbside inlets were installed in streets throughout the western side of the gauged catchment and connected to leaky wells constructed in the adjacent verges tree lawns phase 1 an additional 88 inlets and wells were installed on the eastern side of the catchment in december 2017 phase 2 fig 1 data recorded prior to december 2016 illustrated catchment behaviour without curbside inlets and leaky wells preinstallation data recorded between january 2017 and december 2017 inclusive phase 1 illustrated catchment behaviour with 93 curbside inlets and leaky wells installed data recorded during and after january 2018 phase 2 illustrated catchment behaviour with 181 curbside inlets and leaky wells 2 3 description of the hydrological model the catchment model was constructed using pcswmm version 7 2 computational hydraulics international ontario canada full details of model preparation and assessment were provided in a previous study shahzad et al 2021 the model was calibrated for flowrates observed in the preinstallation period 21 december 2015 to 30 september 2016 the model was calibrated and validated in accordance with the recommendations of the asce asce task committee 1993 the model achieved an nse value of 0 66 for the continuous flow time series and for individual calibration events in the time series the nse ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 shahzad et al 2021 the percent error in volume pev for the continuous series was 4 while the pev for individual events varied from 4 to 19 the percent error peak pep for individual events varied from 7 to 15 the performance of the model was then evaluated using the model performance criteria established by moriasi et al 2015 according to these criteria the performance of the model was considered satisfactory for representing the preinstallation catchment for advanced studies based on these results we decided to use a preinstallation model as a control tool in this study to analyse the preinstallation catchment outputs for postinstallation storm events specifically we compared the runoff predictions from the preinstallation catchment model with field monitored runoff data from storm events in phase 1 and phase 2 the preinstallation model in this study is referred to as the control model 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis 2 4 1 data processing and grouping the time series processing tool in pcswmm version 7 2 was used to identify and extract individual runoff flow events from the continuous time series a runoff event for this study was defined based on runoff flow beginning no less than 12 hours after the cessation of runoff flow from a previous storm the time series processing included the extension of each event by three hours preceding and following the runoff flow this was done to include any pre storm rainfall in considerations storms that met the 12 hour separation requirement were separated into preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 groups before being sorted further by flowrate as measured at the catchment outfall table 1 sorting these storms as per this criterion for event based performance comparison resulted in discarding a total runoff volume of 6 in the preinstallation phase and 11 in the postinstallation phase the performance of curbside leaky wells is impacted by the approach flowrate sapdhare et al 2019 and runoff with a high velocity may bypass the inlet orifice of curbside leaky wells without being intercepted szota et al 2019 to assess the limits of leaky wells according to corresponding flowrates storm events from both the preinstallation and postinstallation phases were extracted and grouped based on the associated flowrate thresholds we grouped the storms according to observed flowrates before performing statistical analysis 2 4 2 statistical analysis before using the data to identify the changes in the runoff volume and flowrates we performed the following statistical analysis on preinstallation and postinstallation runoff outflows at the 0 05 level of significance 2 4 2 1 runoff flowrate analysis for each flowrate group the maximum and mean postinstallation observed flowrates were calculated and compared against the preinstallation catchment flowrates for the same time periods using the control model simulation data initially we performed one way analysis of variance anova to detect any main effects of installing curbside leaky well systems on the average group flowrates as described in table 1 we calculated the control model group averages as a control for testing the post hoc analysis results using dunnett s test as discussed by queen et al 2002 for each rainfall event in each flowrate category a t test was used to investigate the significance of any differences in mean flows in the catchment in the preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 states with flows grouped according to the flowrate thresholds defined in table 1 following this analysis we also performed a rainfall runoff analysis to identify the peak flowrate response of the catchment to rainfall depths for this analysis we plotted the total rainfall depth of each storm against the corresponding peak flowrate as noted during the storm the analysis was performed based on flowrate groups as identified in table 1 this gave us the groupwise runoff response based on the observed rainfall depth and peak flowrate then we compared the runoff response to estimate any reductions between installation stages 2 4 2 2 runoff discharge series analysis we performed ranked based nonparametric mann kendall tests to identify any trends change in the observed patterns of runoff outflows the mann kendall test was performed on the monthly rainfall and runoff volumes of the continuous flow records considering all available data including the data discarded as part of the storm event selection in section 2 4 1 to ensure that trend variations were not a function of seasonality we applied a multiplicative model to remove the effects of seasonality from the runoff time series before performing the mann kendall tests full details of this are provided in the supplementary information we then performed mann kendall tests on the seasonally adjusted monthly rainfall and runoff volumes setting the monthly runoff volume against control model predictions for the postinstallation phases we estimated the runoff retained by each system during phase 1 and phase 2 runoff retention refers to the runoff volume retained by each leaky well system this retention is estimated based on the total runoff volume reductions as observed in the postinstallation phases compared with the control averaged over the total number of leaky wells sen s slope was also estimated to investigate the magnitude of change in catchment hydrology over the duration of the experiment the sign of the s statistic indicated the direction of change sen 1968 2 4 2 3 runoff volume event based analysis a regression analysis was performed on the monitored per event total runoff volumes against control model predictions the analysis was performed for preinstallation and for phase 1 and phase 2 of the curbside leaky well installation we performed an ordinary least square regression ols analysis among the control model outputs and observed the postinstallation runoff events grouped according to the installation phases of the curbside leaky wells a decrease in regression slope indicated a reduction in imperviousness relative to an increase in the density of curbside leaky wells the residuals of the regression models were analysed using one way anova to test the hypothesis that residuals from the regression model in phase 1 and phase 2 would be significantly different from those in the preinstallation phase as the control model cannot explain the effect of added retention storage in the form of curbside leaky wells the residuals from the regression model were grouped into three phases preinstallation phase 1 and phase 2 if the null hypothesis was true then no difference should be found among the three groups of residuals from the regression model indicating no significant difference between the preinstallation and postinstallation catchment discharge values we investigated the runoff volume outflows to determine whether the density and storage capacity of curbside leaky well systems significantly influenced runoff outflow patterns therefore we fitted a generalized linear model glm and performed two way factorial anova to assess the significance of the relation between the flowrate and each installation phase this approach enabled us to quantify the flowrate threshold up to which a significant reduction in runoff volume could be detected the equality of the slope was then tested based on the results of two way anova with a post hoc comparison of slopes or coefficients using tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test ordinary least squares ols regression was used to determine whether the installation of inlets and wells altered the volumetric runoff coefficient of the catchment the events analysed are listed in table 1 regressions were performed for the flowrate groups indicated in table 1 the slope of the regression line between the rainfall volume kl and runoff volume kl was accepted as the volumetric runoff coefficient of the catchment guo and urbonas 2014 3 results 3 1 runoff flowrate reductions the model of the preinstallation catchment predicted higher peak flows than those measured for 70 of events during phase 1 and for 77 of events during phase 2 fig 3 the one way anova indicated that the differences in mean flowrate between the control and phase 1 and phase 2 treatments were not significant α 0 05 f 3 132 1 47 p 0 22 however in the low flowrate categories associated with low intensity rainfall events peak flows did differ between the control and treatment cases table 2 during phase 2 with 181 curbside inlets and leaky wells in the catchment events with peak flowrates of less than 50 l s were reduced by up to 13 16 notably this could be above 14 if the result considers the error analysis of peak flow prediction in each flowrate group supplementary information fig s7 however the runoff response analysis based on total rainfall depth fig 4 shows that in phase 1 the peak flowrate to total rainfall depth was reduced by 5 and for phase 2 it was reduced by 12 50 fig 4 these reductions are in the same range as estimated by comparing the control model outputs against the observed peak flowrates we therefore conclude that despite model errors the results of the predictions are reasonable and we can expect peak flow reductions of up to 12 for runoff flows less than 50 l s the results of t tests performed on individual flowrate groups showed that the installation of leaky wells significantly reduced peak flowrates for storms with a peak flow of up to 100 l s table 2 but not above this 3 2 quantification of runoff volume reduction 3 2 1 runoff volume discharge series analysis and retention the mann kendall trend tests fig 5 indicated a decreasing but nonsignificant trend in catchment runoff volume outflows corresponding to the installation of leaky wells s statistic 120 α 0 05 τ 0 191 sen s slope quantified this decrease to be 5 kl z 1 622 n 36 p 0 1048 per month the slope was nonsignificant as well indicating insufficient evidence to suggest that runoff discharges during the preinstallation and postinstallation phases displayed significant shifts in their patterns due to the installation of curbside leaky well systems fig 5 also shows that considerably less rainfall occurred in phase 2 than in the preinstallation and phase 1 periods we also quantified the runoff retention by comparing control model outputs against observed runoff data for the same time periods in the monitored time period the preinstallation model indicated that the catchment would have discharged 5950 kl of runoff in 2017 if the inlets had not been installed while the measured discharge was 5560 kl for this period however by considering a 4 overprediction based on the volumetric error of the model over the continuous time series section 2 1 this equates to up to 5712 kl of runoff from the control model or a 3 reduction in the 2017 annual runoff volume these reductions indicate that at least 152 kl of stormwater was harvested and retained in the catchment by the curbside leaky wells with a mean retention per inlet of 1 63 kl in 2017 in phase 2 the total runoff from the catchment in 2018 was 2400 kl while the preinstallation model with no curbside inlets and leaky wells predicted 2650 kl after adjusting for up to 4 overprediction this difference resulted in an estimated 9 reduction in total runoff with a total stormwater retention volume of 252 kl or a mean volumetric reduction of 1 38 kl per inlet in 2018 the decrease in volumetric runoff retention per device could be attributed to the reduced rainfall in 2018 compared with 2017 this difference resulted in less discharge from the catchment and therefore less discharge for leaky wells to intercept based on these results we concluded that by installing leaky well systems the average potential runoff retention ranged from 3 to 9 during phases 1 and 2 3 2 2 runoff volume reduction event based the installation of curbside leaky wells resulted in additional retention storage in the catchment relative to that in the preinstallation catchment the field monitored data showed that the total discharge volume was reduced over the study period however the proportion of stormwater retained decreased as the storm intensity increased in this study this was manifested by the decreasing slope of the regression line between the control model outputs and total runoff from observed storms fig 6 the results of the one way anova α 0 05 f 2 100 1 64 p 0 19 0 05 for the regression model residuals indicated no significant difference among the three monitoring phases based on these results we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no significant difference between the pre and postinstallation runoff regimes the relationship between the control model and observed runoff flows was further explored by considering the data in the flowrate groups presented in table 1 for each phase fig 7 the regression slopes of the glm analysis showed that in storms with flowrates of 10 l s f 100 l s the preinstallation catchment runoff volume was greater than the postinstallation runoff volume fig 7 table 3 during high flowrate storms the difference in regression slopes was negligible compared with the preinstallation slopes table 3 this result was indicative of the diminishing impact of curbside leaky wells on retaining runoff during high flow rate events the runoff reduction in the two phases was more pronounced in phase 2 particularly for low flowrate groups such as f 100 l s the results of the two way anova once flowrates were considered showed that the effects of the installation stages accounted for 7 3 of the total variance with p 0 004 f dfn 4 dfd 89 4 16 this relation in combination with curbside leaky wells was considered significant however the post hoc analysis of regression coefficients with standard error from the glm indicated that the interaction term between the flowrate and installation phases had a significant effect on runoff for 10 l s f 50 l s storms in phase 1 and phase 2 table 3 during storms with a flowrate of 50 l s f 100 l s only phase 2 exhibited a strong relation with leaky well installations table 3 the p value results for regression slopes compared with the preinstallation catchment are provided in table 3 and detailed statistics obtained through analysis for all interactive terms as well as the p values for each relation are provided in table s2 in the supplementary information 3 2 3 volumetric runoff coefficient the results of the runoff coefficient analysis fig 8 indicated an effective runoff coefficient reduction for events with a peak flowrate of up to 100 l s in the case study catchment however the retention effects were less notable beyond 100 l s the results were similar to those of the runoff analysis in the previous section during phase 1 the reduction in the runoff coefficient of storm events in the pre and postinstallation catchments varied from 4 to 20 in phase 2 the reduction ranged from 13 to 38 increasing the number of leaky wells in phase 2 increased the reduction in the volumetric runoff coefficient with an 18 greater reduction in the runoff coefficient for flow events with 10 l s f 50 l s and a 23 greater reduction for runoff flows with 50 l s f 100 l s the reductions are estimated from the runoff coefficients as provided in fig 8 statistical tests indicated that significant reductions were only observed for flowrates 100 l s for phase 2 storms we must note here that most runoff producing events in the studied catchment were rainfall events that fell within the low flowrate groups 10 l s f 100 l s in phase 1 events with 10 l s f 100 l s represented 70 of events table 1 in phase 2 74 had a peak flowrate in this range table 1 the benefit of installing the curbside leaky well is therefore notable in this range in a given year the curbside inlet and leaky well systems significantly reduced the volumetric runoff coefficient by at least 15 for 70 of observed storms 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological storage volume a critical factor curbside leaky wells achieved inferior runoff flowrates and volume reductions compared with published studies e g jarden et al 2016 page et al 2015 in contrast with previous studies the curbside leaky wells in this case study with a density of 10 systems ha were placed in the path of runoff from 100 of the directly connected impervious area of the catchment this provides curbside leaky well systems with a maximum opportunity to intercept runoff this should have significantly reduced runoff flowrates in street gutters according to jarden et al 2016 despite these favourable conditions the reductions in runoff flowrate we estimated for the case study catchment were less than those reported by jarden et al 2016 they reported runoff flowrate reductions of 42 in peak flowrates of up to 300 l s in comparison current leaky well systems on average only achieved 4 13 peak flow reduction for flowrates of up to 100 l s beyond flowrates greater than 100 l s the estimated runoff flowrate reductions remain minimal 1 3 we reason that contrary to the 1 footprint in the current study the study area of jarden et al 2016 included green infrastructure which covered 12 5 to 32 5 of the total contributing drainage area page et al 2015 reported an estimated runoff flowrate reduction of 28 based on the differences in regression slopes between the control and treatment catchments page et al 2015 achieved this reduction by installing 23 kl of storage to manage runoff from a 0 53 ha catchment of which only 52 of the directly connected impervious area was discharged to the retrofitted wsud systems again the curbside leaky wells in this study were designed for runoff from the entire 17 45 ha catchment but with only 18 kl total storage this comparison indicates that hydrological storage volume governed the performance of the curbside leaky well systems in this study as such other factors recommended in the literature such as connecting larger connected impervious areas to wsud systems only become critical once sufficient hydrological storage volume is provided these findings are also consistent with model based studies of other distributed storage devices for example myers et al 2014 simulated the performance of rain gardens in a 2 3 ha catchment each raingarden had ponding storage volumes between 0 84 m3 and 0 93 m3 as reported by myers et al 2014 as the storage volume per hectare of the catchment increased rain gardens reduced the peak flowrates by 39 for a six month ari storm event and the performance was reduced for less frequent higher intensity storms we detected the influence of increasing storage volume on runoff volume reductions as reported in section 3 2 2 the results from the glm fig 7 analysis show that during storms with corresponding flowrates of 10 l s f 50 l s a significant reduction in runoff volume occurred in phase 1 and phase 2 however in phase 2 a significant runoff volume reduction was also detected for storms with runoff flows of 50 l s f 100 l s table 3 similarly the volumetric runoff coefficient analysis showed that significant results were obtained by increasing the storage volume and the number of wells effectively increasing the total catchment wsud storage volume section 3 2 3 we attribute this significant difference in phase 2 to the addition of more 88 curbside leaky wells which is tantamount to the addition of 9 kl of storage capacity in the catchment and reduction of the drainage to storage ratio this finding suggests that if runoff flowrate and volume management are priorities the ratio of well storage to the contributing area must be considered based on the above discussion we reason that the hydrological storage volume of individual curbside leaky well systems along with their exfiltration rate were key limiting factors due to limited storage volume and modest exfiltration rate significant runoff reductions were not detected for events with higher flowrates in this study leaky wells with limited storage volume filled rapidly during storm events and once the wells were full the catchment behaved similarly to the control case in addition to limited storage volume a slow exfiltration rate to the surrounding soil limited the recovery of storage volume the leaky wells in the study catchment were installed in a clay soil profile resulting in a low exfiltration rate of 0 002 l s therefore in long duration events the ongoing flowrate reduction effects of leaky well devices cannot be as prominent as those for wells in more favourable soils such as sandy soils the results for this case study catchment therefore suggest that the storage volume of wsud systems was critical especially as all of the connected impervious areas were potentially intercepted particularly in slow draining soils such as clays 4 2 runoff volume retention the results of the mann kendall testing section 3 2 1 showed that in phase 1 with 93 curbside leaky wells the monitored catchment flows exhibited a slight reduction in runoff compared with the equivalent flows from the control model despite having limited storage volume under field conditions the curbside inlets with 100 l leaky wells collected on average 1 5 kl of runoff in 2017 and 1 25 kl in 2018 stormwater harvesting at this scale can be highly beneficial to vegetation in arid and semiarid regions neumann and cardon 2012 as a vital component of urban greening and can support sapling growth and increased evapotranspiration to help mitigate urban heat island effects berland et al 2017 gleeson 2020 in a catchment case study where the behaviour of mature white cedar melia azedarach trees with inlets and wells was compared with trees without leaky wells their root zones experienced 29 more transpiration during summer months additionally sapling photosynthesis was 94 higher sapling height was 50 greater and sapling trunk diameter growth was 25 higher gleeson 2020 however the runoff retention of individual systems can suffer from two other factors in addition to storage volume a bypass runoff volume for high flow rate events leaky wells exhibit reduced interception efficiency leading to increases in bypass runoff sapdhare et al 2019 reported that the capture flowrate of a curbside inlet placed at a 0 5 gradient identical to that in the study catchment was 51 lower when the flowrate was 5 l s compared with 0 5 l s thus during storms that generate flowrates greater than 50 l s 51 of the runoff volume can potentially bypass the system without being intercepted b blockage of inlet another factor that can result in these devices being nonfunctional is the accumulation of sediments in the capture areas of curbside leaky well systems as observed during site visits after the storm fig 9 high flow velocities can potentially mobilize sediment and fallen leaves which temporarily clog curbside inlets resulting in no or reduced flow into leaky wells szota et al 2019 these observations were also validated by personal communication with residents of the catchment they reported that during storms the wells only captured runoff during the initial phase and then no noticeable runoff reductions occurred however these observations also support the usefulness of inlets in preventing sedimentation leaves and litters from entering the stormwater drainage system in this way leaky wells still contribute by improving the quality of stormwater discharge from the catchment and preventing degradation of the receiving water bodies this water quality benefit is particularly important in interconnected urban catchments that discharge to riparian or coastal areas with little or no pretreatment macdonald et al 2015 4 3 the hydrological model as a virtual control we estimated the runoff flowrate and volume reductions in this study by comparing the control model output against the observed data section 3 1 and section 3 2 1 this was conducted in lieu of a suitable control catchment for a traditional paired catchment study due to the difficulty of conducting such studies in urban environments shuster and rhea 2013 the runoff flowrate and volume reduction benefits were evaluated through comparison with similar published studies the results were logical and largely followed the trend in published studies where the results deviated from the literature findings plausible reasons were provided regarding this deviation based on this analysis we can conclude that a calibrated model can be used as an alternative control to a paired catchment in before and after control impact studies the hydrological model can provide similar benefits as can be achieved by using a paired catchment approach in contrast to a paired catchment approach a carefully constructed detailed model of the catchment in its preinstallation stage can be trusted to simulate the true preinstallation behaviour of the catchment in an urban environment additionally although we could not identify significant main effects of installing curbside leaky wells on runoff volume discharges when examining all flows from the catchment without grouping when catchment peak flowrates were grouped according to magnitude significant differences in runoff volumes were detected section 3 2 2 fig 7 this underpins the ability of the control model to represent the preinstallation catchment understanding the limitations of hydrological models should precede their use as a control for assessing the impact of curbside leaky wells in an urban environment monitoring individual wsud systems such as curbside leaky wells to understand their expected performance behaviour during storms of different intensities can benefit the user in evaluating model based benefits against field data additionally a hydrological model should only be used for the range of storms it has been calibrated against significant error due to model uncertainty may result in simulation of the model for storms that are beyond the calibration dataset 4 4 case for distributed curbside leaky well systems the results section 3 1 3 2 suggest that curbside inlet and leaky well systems in their present configurations may not be ideal measures for runoff volume and peak flow reduction from the perspective of stormwater management these limitations imply that benefits will only occur for low flow events however although reductions in peak flowrates are not highly evident such reductions are typically not the primary motivation behind the adoption of these curbside inlets and leaky wells retained runoff volume can provide passive irrigation benefits for street trees grey et al 2018 and performance can potentially be improved by adopting larger leaky well storage systems and or modified curbside inlet plates other advantages relate to ease of management unlike other distributed stormwater harvesting options such as rainwater tanks which are typically owned and operated by residents and landowners the stormwater capacity of curbside inlets and wells is generally managed by local authorities the potential value of dispersed rainwater tanks has been reported di matteo et al 2019 van dijk et al 2020 but this benefit cannot be achieved unless control of the detention capacity can be automated and not left to the discretion of the landowner petrucci et al 2012 another advantage of curbside inlets is that they collect runoff from streets which in turn typically drain runoff from allotments in urban areas as such placing wsud systems in the path of flow from all impervious areas maximizes the potential for harvest to occur additionally curbside inlets and wells help improve catchment runoff quality reduce impacts on receiving water bodies and instead deliver runoff to street tree root zones where it is bioremediated denman et al 2006 in climates with primarily low intensity rainfall such as that at the study site the use of curbside inlets and leaky wells can still be justified on the basis of their contributions to discharge reduction and the infiltration of water for environmental and human benefits more research is recommended to assess the performance of different layouts and the design of curbside infiltration systems with increased storage capacities the results of this study will assist urban planners in critically examining the hydrological storage volume of individual leaky well systems in clay environments before adopting distributed storage systems for runoff control ultimately we advocate for more catchment scale studies to discern the performance of curbside infiltration systems as runoff management solutions catchment scale study results may not be optimal and the corresponding control measures are often difficult to implement but their contribution to providing real field data for quantifying the reduction in runoff outflows from a catchment provides policy makers with tangible evidence regarding the potential of green infrastructure thus catchment scale studies can reduce the impediments to the widespread adoption of green infrastructure for runoff management 5 conclusions this study attempted to detect the effects of installing curbside inlets and leaky wells infiltration systems on runoff volume and peak flowrates from a residential catchment using a hydrological model as virtual control similar to previous studies the impacts of curbside leaky well systems on reducing runoff flowrates were not significant for all flowrates but were significant for the most frequent small storm events when the study design and results of the present study were compared with similar studies we found that the limiting factor in the performance of the curbside leaky well systems was storage volume in that they were too small to collect sufficient runoff previous studies have stressed the importance of connecting more impervious areas to curbside leaky well systems as this will give them the best opportunity to maximize runoff reduction performance however in this study systems were situated to collect all impervious area runoff from the catchment but their limited size resulted in significant impacts on runoff volume and peak flowrates during the most frequent storms only performance was also limited due to the slow emptying rate to the native clay soil therefore due to the higher hydraulic loading during intense and long duration storms curbside leaky wells did not have free storage volume for oncoming runoff based on the results of this experiment the installation of curbside leaky wells with larger storage volumes would provide greater stormwater reduction benefits furthermore our study findings stress that the placement of curbside leaky well systems and connecting large impervious areas to curbside leaky wells will only become governing factors if sufficient storage volume is provided 6 contributions hussain shahzad data analysis

16182,the rational design of a ceramic based nanofiltration membrane remains a significant challenge due to its performance and fabrication cost herein we report a high performance ceramic based thin film composite tfc membrane fabricated via a typical interfacial polymerization on an interwoven net substrate assembled by titanium dioxide tio2 nanowires the chemical properties and morphologies were systematically investigated for ceramic substrates and their corresponding tfc membranes due to the significantly improved hydrophilicity of the tio2 framework more reactive amine monomers were uniformly adsorbed on the modified surface of the ceramic substrate yielding an ultrathin polyamide layer with less resistance in addition the smooth surface and decreased pore size of the tio2 framework contributed to forming a defect free polyamide layer as a result the obtained ceramic based tfc membrane evinced high permeance of 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and excellent salt rejection efficiency leading to simultaneous improvements compared with the control tfc membrane without the tio2 framework notably the potential regeneration ability of the ceramic based tfc membrane could be achieved via facile low temperature calcination and re polymerization process due to the varied thermostability between the polyamide layer and the robust ceramic substrate the operation of regeneration helped to prolong the lifetime and decrease the cost for the ceramic based tfc membrane this research provides a feasible protocol to fabricate sustainable ceramic based nanofiltration membranes with enhanced performance for water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane tio2 nanowire nanofiltration regeneration high water permeance 1 introduction water scarcity has become a global challenge in view of the increasing water demand wang et al 2022a to address this issue nanofiltration has received increasing attention due to its wide applications in wastewater reuse brackish groundwater treatment and surface water purification xu et al 2022 in addition further recycling of concentrated wastewater derived from the nanofiltration process can offer extra drinking water and reduce the discharge of sewage wang et al 2021 presently polyamide nanofiltration membranes with gold standard performance and generally formed on polymeric substrates using scalable interfacial polymerization dai et al 2020 sarkar et al 2021 are mostly used however most polymeric substrates e g polysulfone and polyethersulfone suffer from poor mechanical strength and insufficient chemical and thermal resistance limiting the further application of nanofiltration membranes cheng et al 2022 chong and wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 presumably the inorganic ceramic membrane with excellent mechanical chemical and thermal stability is a feasible alternative for fabricating thin film composite tfc nanofiltration membranes wang et al 2022b wu et al 2022 chong et al successfully prepared a polyamide layer on an aluminium oxide al2o3 substrate a microfiltration membrane for nanofitration chong and wang 2019 the mechanical and thermal stability of the ceramic substrate maintained the membrane performance at high temperature and pressure conditions xia et al fabricated a chemical resistant tfc membrane on a tubular ceramic substrate yielding a methanol permeance of 22 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a high rejection of various dyes xia et al 2018 however despite the feasibility of the preparation of ceramic based nanofiltration membranes these membranes are still limited in the literature due to the several constraints for using ceramic substrates to fabricate tfc membranes generally the substrate properties including pore size roughness and porosity have a critical effect on the formation of the polyamide layer nevertheless commercial ceramic substrates with a low production cost have a large pore size and a coarse surface resulting in a polyamide layer with a low cross linking degree chong and wang 2019 zhu et al 2021 in addition the low porosity and tortuous channels of ceramic substrates are likely to increase membrane resistance zhou et al 2018 thus a rational surface design of ceramic substrates plays a potential role in the subsequent fabrication of high performance tfc membranes recently the interwoven net structure assembled by one dimensional nanomaterials e g carbon nanotube gao et al 2019 cadmium hydroxide nanostrand karan et al 2015 and copper hydroxide nanofiber ji et al 2019 is anticipated as an ideal surface for interfacial polymerization thanks to its uniform pore size smooth surface and high porosity in addition a series of simple and scalable assembly methods such as vacuum filtration spray coating and brush painting gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 make this structure easy to form on a polymeric substrate zhu et al reported an ultrathin polyamide layer fabricated on an interwoven net layer made of carbon nanotube and the resulting membrane showed ultrahigh permeance zhu et al 2016 however this novel structure has not yet been explored for ceramic substrates due to most one dimensional nanomaterials appearing in poor thermal resistance titanium dioxide tio2 a metal oxide with high hydrophilicity and thermal resistance widely used in the fabrication of the ceramic membrane has several structural morphologies yuan and su 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this context one dimensional tio2 nanowires have the potential to modify the low cost macropore ceramic substrates forming an interwoven net structure for high performance tfc membrane fabrication zhang et al 2009a zhang et al 2009b in this work the effect of a tio2 interwoven net layer on the physicochemical characteristics of the resulting tfc membrane was performed the separation performance of tfc membranes was tested and the underlying mechanism was studied to elucidate the enhanced permeance and salt rejection efficiency in addition the potential regeneration ability of the ceramic based tfc membrane was investigated using low temperature calcination and re polymerization procedure taking into account the difference in thermal resistance between the polyamide layer and ceramic substrate the performance of the regenerated membrane was further evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility for sustainable application in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals α al2o3 powder 150 300 nm changsha xinhui electronic technology co ltd china polyethersulfone pes basf co ltd germany polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp shanghai chemical reagent company china and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp merck germany were used to prepare the macroporous al2o3 substrate piperazine pip trimesoyl chloride tmc and n hexane obtained from sigma aldrich mo were used as water phase monomer organic phase monomer and organic solvent to fabricate the polyamide layer tio2 degussa germany and potassium hydroxide koh sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china were used to synthesize tio2 nanowires for membrane performance evaluation sodium sulfate na2so4 magnesium sulfate mgso4 magnesium chloride mgcl2 sodium chloride nacl polyethylene glycol peg 200 1000 da and fluorescein sodium were supplied by aladdin chemical co ltd china 2 2 tio2 nanowires synthesis the synthesis of tio2 nanowires via hydrothermal reaction is similar to the literature yuan and su 2004 briefly tio2 powder 4 g was slowly added to a koh solution 10 m 160 ml with vigorous stirring to form a uniform solution then the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 c for 48 h the white deposition was collected and washed using hcl 0 1 m and water several times finally non crystallized tio2 nanowires were obtained by vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h without the calcination process 2 3 preparation of ceramic substrates the al2o3 substrate was prepared via a phase inversion method luo et al 2021 the casting solution including 2 pvp 6 pes 32 nmp and 60 al2o3 powder was obtained via ball milling for over 24 h the homogeneous casting solution was degassed in a vacuum oven for 10 min then it was cast on glass by a doctor blade with a thickness of 1 mm subsequently the casted film was immersed into a water bath for water solvent exchange the resulting al2o3 substrate was sintered in a tube furnace at 800 c for 3 h and further heating to 1500 c for another 5 h the tio2 al2o3 substrate was prepared via facile vacuum filtration specifically the as prepared tio2 nanowires 10 mg were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water with an ultrasonication for 2 h to avoid the agglomeration of the nanowires then 1 ml of supernatant was aspirated and diluted ten times as feed solution finally the tio2 al2o3 substrate was fabricated via filtrating above feed solution and calcination at 600 c for 3 h 2 4 nanofiltration membrane fabrication the polyamide layer was fabricated using interfacial polymerization reaction by pip and tmc on the ceramic substrate fig 1 the ceramic substrate was first exposed to the pip aqueous solution 0 5 wt for 10 min after pouring out the solution excess droplets on the substrate were gently blown via a nitrogen gun subsequently the ceramic substrate was immersed in the tmc organic solution 0 1 wt for 30 s to form the polyamide layer finally the as synthesized tfc membrane was cured in an oven at 60 c for 5 min and rinsed with n hexane to remove residual tmc monomer the tfc membranes fabricated on the al2o3 substrate and tio2 al2o3 substrate are denoted as a tfc and t tfc membranes 2 5 membrane characterization the morphology and crystalline structure of the tio2 nanowires were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 2100f and x ray diffractometry xrd d8 advance respectively the mechanical stability of the ceramic substrate was studied by wsm 30 kn changchun intelligent instrument equipment co ltd china the pore size distribution and porosity of the ceramic substrate were measured by autopore v mercury intrusion porosimetry the thermal stability of the polyamide layer was tested by thermogravimetric analysis tga ta instruments q500 usa under the air atmosphere the surface composition and cross linking degree of the polyamide layer were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermofisher escalab 250xi usa the zeta potential of the polyamide layer was calculated from streaming current values which were measured by a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar gmbh austria with a 10 mm kcl electrolyte solution the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane was assessed by a dynamic water contact angles goniometer dsa25 krüss germany the morphology and roughness of the membrane were observed with a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 500 zeiss germany and an atomic force microscope afm bioscope resolve bruker usa respectively 2 6 membrane performance evaluation the filtration performance of the membrane was evaluated in a lab made cross flow filtration module as described elsewhere luo et al 2021 before the filtration the membrane was compacted by deionized water at 1 5 bar for 2 h the temperature of the feed solution was maintained at 25 c via a temperature controller then the weight of permeance m was recorded over the filtration time t h by an online electronic balance at 1 bar the pure water permeance j l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated as j m p s t where p bar is the transmembrane pressure and s m2 is the active area of the membrane the rejection r i e salt and organic matter was calculated as r 1 cp cf 100 where cp and cf are the concentration of permeance and feed solution respectively the salt concentration was measured by a conductivity meter dds 307 leici china and the feed solution was 1 g l the concentration of peg was determined via a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany and the feed solution was 200 mg l 2 7 regeneration of the t tfc membrane the regeneration ability of the ceramic based nanofiltration membrane was evaluated via low temperature calcination and re polymerization process first the dried t tfc membrane was calcined at 500 c for 1 h to peel off the polyamide layer then the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate was rinsed three times by deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h finally a regenerated t tfc membrane was fabricated via interfacial polymerization as described in section 2 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ceramic substrates fig 2 shows the morphology of ceramic substrates the surface of the sintering al2o3 substrate exhibited a porous structure with part of macropores fig 2a the formation of macropores was mainly attributed to the stack of varying sizes of al2o3 particles fig s1 the wide range of pore size distribution might reduce the absorption of water phase monomer especially at the macropores region with a poor capillary effect thus generating defects at the interface polymerization process peng et al 2020 to fabricate a defect free polyamide layer on the ceramic substrate tio2 nanowires were deposited on the surface of the al2o3 substrate as seen in fig 2b the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a porous framework without agglomerated particles compared with other one dimensional nanomaterials assembled frameworks li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 indicating the excellent dispersibility of tio2 nanowires in the water solution in addition the roughness of ceramic substrates was evaluated by afm fig s2 the average roughness ra significantly decreased from 104 0 nm for the al2o3 substrate to 18 2 nm for the tio2 al2o3 substrate proving the smoother surface of the tio2 framework this result was consistent with the membrane morphology observed in sem images fig 2a b the pore size distribution and porosity of ceramic substrates having a critical effect on the subsequent polyamide layer formation and tfc membrane performance peng et al 2020 were measured by the mercury intrusion method the pore size distribution of the al2o3 substrate exhibited two peaks at 280 and 830 nm fig s3a which was consistent with the size distribution detected by sem fig s1 to avoid the interference of pores from the al2o3 substrate a freestanding tio2 membrane was fabricated for the evaluation of the pore size distribution and porosity briefly tio2 nanowires were firstly filtered on a glass fibre membrane after drying in the oven a freestanding tio2 membrane was obtained by peeling off the glass fibre membrane and sintering the resulting tio2 membrane showed a smaller pore size of about 10 20 nm fig s3a which was the same as the tio2 al2o3 substrate visualized by the magnified sem image fig 2b the pore size of the framework assembled by the nanowires was mainly related to the diameter of the precursory nanowires zhang et al 2009b compared to other macroporous frameworks constructed by nanowires with a diameter over 20 nm da silva et al 2016 luo et al 2018 the ultrathin tio2 nanowires of about 10 nm successfully endowed the tio2 al2o3 substrate with a compact mesoporous surface fig s4 in terms of the ceramic substrate porosity the al2o3 substrate had an interstitial porosity of 29 5 fig s3b which was approximate to that of the ceramic membranes reported before mouiya et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 interestingly a significant increase of interstitial porosity to 47 6 was observed for the tio2 framework due to its interwoven net structure consequently introducing the tio2 framework on a traditional ceramic substrate might provide a versatile scaffold with homogenized pore size and enhanced porosity for the subsequent interfacial polymerization the phase composition and crystal structure of ceramic substrates were studied from xrd spectra fig s5 the distinct peaks of the al2o3 substrate corresponded to the corundum pdf no 74 1081 regarding the tio2 al2o3 substrate the ultrathin tio2 nanowires were transformed from k2tino2n 1 precursors which were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction xu et al 2018 then the k ion was displaced by h3o in a dilute acidic solution to form the h2tino2n 1 nanowires after dehydration of h2tino2n 1 nanowires via sintering at 600 c the ultrathin tio2 nanowires were obtained with anatase structure fig s5b which was also evidenced by its corresponding electron diffraction pattern fig s4 in addition the thickness of the tio2 framework was about 373 nm fig s6 consistently with the eds mapping result fig s7 its thin thickness added less resistance to the substrate fig s8 furthermore the robust tio2 al2o3 substrate had a high mechanical strength of almost 66 4 mpa fig s9 which was greater than most organic polymer substrates the hydrophilicity of ceramic substrates is important for tfc membranes fabrication because the high water affinity promotes the adsorption of pip molecules for the subsequent interfacial polymerization reaction the apparent contact angle was used to evaluate the surface hydrophilicity of the ceramic substrates via measuring the sessile drop of deionized water fig 3 a due to the high roughness of the al2o3 substrate its apparent contact angle was lower than that of the tio2 al2o3 substrate interestingly after eliminating the influence of the roughness the corrected contact angle values of the al2o3 and tio2 al2o3 substrates were 49 3 and 43 6 respectively indicating the introduction of the tio2 framework improved the surface hydrophilicity zhang et al 2020 the enhanced hydrophilicity of the tio2 framework accelerated the adsorption of water phase monomers as shown in fig 3b the water uptake significantly increased from 13 7 to 20 1 for al2o3 and tio2 al2o3 substrates which was attributed to the interwoven net structure of the tio2 framework with high porosity providing more storage space for the solution containing amine monomers fig s3b wu et al 2019 the distribution of water phase monomers on the surface of the ceramic substrates was investigated using fluorescein sodium as a probe the luminous area and intensity qualitatively display the distribution and amount of adsorbed pip molecules on the substrates zhu et al 2020a the al2o3 substrate had a luminous layer with a significant fluctuation of intensity fig 3c indicating that pip molecules were unevenly distributed on the surface of the substrate the darkness in the macropore regions further demonstrated that the poor capillary effect was unable to adsorb pip molecules in contrast the luminous layer was uniformly distributed on the tio2 al2o3 substrate indicating that the aqueous solution was well spread on the tio2 framework fig 3d in addition compared with the al2o3 substrate the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a thicker luminous layer together with higher intensity implying that the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a significant capability for adsorption of pip molecules these results were consistent with the water uptake capacity of ceramic substrates the high concentration of pip molecules was beneficial to the subsequent interfacial polymerization to form a homogeneous and defect free polyamide layer 3 2 characterization of ceramic based tfc membranes the surface of all as prepared tfc membranes was visualized by sem as shown in fig 4 a b a tfc and t tfc membranes both exhibited typical nodular like structures on their surface confirming that the polyamide layer was successfully polymerized onto ceramic substrates in addition the t tfc membrane had a higher amount of nodular like structures than the a tfc membrane afm topography further proved this result and the ra values were 24 1 nm and 8 9 nm for t tfc and a tfc membranes fig s10 respectively it was reported that the formation of a nodular like structure was generally driven by the violent reaction between diamine and tmc molecules zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 thus the high porosity of the t tfc membrane releasing more diamine formed a rough surface with more nodular like structures offering potential extra channels to increase the water permeance zhu et al 2020b the thickness of the polyamide layer that dominated the primary resistance of ceramic based tfc membranes was measured the polyamide layer thickness was 43 nm for the a tfc membrane fig s11 considering the ultrathin polyamide layer thickness of the t tfc afm is applied to determine its polyamide layer isolated from tio2 al2o3 substrate fig s12 specifically a small piece of t tfc membrane was immersed in hf solution after slowly dissolving the tio2 framework the polyamide layer floated on the surface of the acid solution then the nanofilm was transferred to the silicon wafer and was washed three times with deionized water for further testing the polyamide layer thickness of the t tfc membrane was distinctly decreased to 15 4 nm fig 4c commonly the water uptake capacity of the substrate directly affected the diamine concentration for interfacial polymerization and determined the ultimate thickness of the polyamide layer freger 2003 you et al 2021 due to the interwoven net structure of the tio2 framework with high porosity homogenized pore size improved hydrophilicity and smooth surface the tio2 al2o3 substrate enabled the sufficient and uniform release of diamine fig 3 leading to an instant polymerization and yielding a thin polyamide layer to limit the following diffusion of diamine from the water phase to the organic phase similar phenomena were also reported in literatures the ultrathin and defect free polyamide layer was generated on the interface assembled by one dimensional nanomaterials gao et al 2019 karan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the chemical composition of tfc membranes was analyzed by the xps spectrum as seen in fig 5 a both tfc membranes showed the presence of o n and c elements the cross linking degree of the polyamide layer reflecting the efficiency of the interfacial polymerization was calculated by the o n ratio xu et al 2021 the cross linking degree of the t tfc membrane was 65 3 much higher than the 57 8 of the a tfc membrane additionally the binding energy at 284 5 285 6 and 287 4 ev are assigned to the c c c n and n c o bonds fig s13 respectively the increased area of n c o bonds for the t tfc membrane was attributed to the enrichment of pip monomers on the substrate accelerating the cross linking between biphasic interface and forming a denser polyamide layer the molecular weight cut off mwco and surface charge corresponding to the steric hindrance and donnan exclusion of the tfc membranes were investigated jin et al 2022a zheng et al 2022 the mwco was measured to be 596 da and 438 da for a tfc and t tfc membranes fig 5b respectively further confirming that the t tfc membrane was denser than the a tfc membrane the low selectivity of the a tfc membrane was attributed to the lack of pip monomers in the macropore regions of the al2o3 substrate in contrast the uniform pore size distribution of the tio2 al2o3 substrate was beneficial to form a defect free polyamide layer yang et al 2018 in addition the diffusivity of pip monomers was enhanced with the increase of concentration thereby leading to an ultrafast reaction at the initial polymerization process and yielding a substantially denser polyamide layer with an ultrathin thickness for the t tfc membrane xu et al 2021 you et al 2021 fig 5 c showed the ζ potential of tfc membranes the isoelectric points of a tfc and t tfc membranes were located at ph 4 7 and 4 1 respectively the increased ζ potential of the t tfc membrane was attributed to the self termination effect of the polymerization process the high diffusivity of pip monomers accelerated to form the incipient polyamide layer and restrained its subsequent diffusivity making the front surface of the membrane with abundant tmc monomers freger 2005 thus negatively charged carboxylic groups derived from the acryl chloride groups endowed the t tfc membrane with a greater ζ potential the surface wettability of the tfc membranes was evaluated by the water contact angle as shown in fig 5d generally a decrease of the contact angle improves the hydrophilicity of the membrane and the t tfc membrane exhibited an increase of surface hydrophilicity compared with the a tfc membrane the increased hydrophilicity of the t tfc membrane was rationalized by substantial carboxylic groups on the membrane surface with strong hydrogen bonds fig s14 in addition the ultrathin polyamide layer of the t tfc membrane with lower resistance would accelerate the penetration of the droplet during water contact angle measurement wang et al 2017 3 3 performance of ceramic based tfc membranes tfc membranes performance in terms of permeance and salt rejection was assessed in a cross flow device the interplay between applied pressure and water flux is depicted in fig 6 a the t tfc membrane showed a near linear relation even at 16 bar while the break occurred for the a tfc membrane with a pressure at 1 5 bar the better structural robustness was attributed to the smooth surface and narrow pore size of the tio2 framework leading to a decreased internal stress in the polyamide layer zhang et al 2018 interestingly compared with the industrial organic polymer substrate which was prone to compaction arena et al 2021 davenport et al 2020 the pressure resistant ceramic substrate endowed the t tfc membrane with high pressure operation conditions without the attenuation of the water flux indicating that the ceramic based nanofiltration could meet the extreme water demand via pressure regulation based on the pressure and flux lines the permeance of tfc membranes was calculated the t tfc membrane exhibited a permeance of 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 almost two times higher than the a tfc membrane in general the polyamide layer dominated the resistance of the tfc membrane cheng et al 2021 karan et al 2015 the decreased pore size of the tio2 al2o3 substrate could avoid the formation of the polyamide into the substrate jin et al 2022b the hydrophilic surface of the tio2 al2o3 substrate favoured the formation of the polyamide layer with an ultrathin thickness fig 4c thus the permeance of the t tfc membrane was enhanced in addition the tio2 framework with a straight interwoven net structure shortened the transport pathway thereby further improving the permeance of the t tfc membrane fig 6b presented the single salt rejection of tfc membranes the salt rejection was poor for the a tfc membrane which was primarily attributed to the formation of defects on the al2o3 substrate with macropores in contrast the t tfc membrane showed a higher rejection for the four salts this enhancement was due to the change in inherent properties i e steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion of the polyamide layer as the t tfc membrane had a lower mwco and a stronger negative charge the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion were intensified fig 5b c resulting in increased salt rejection notably compared with a commercial membrane nf 270 the similar rejection of divalent anion ability indicated the t tfc membrane reached commercial separation performance to evaluate the stability of the t tfc membrane a long term filtration test was conducted fig 6c due to the robust ceramic substrate and strong hydrogen bond interactions between the polyamide layer and the tio2 framework the t tfc membrane maintained a good desalination performance for over 48 h hinting that this membrane has good stability in practical operation in addition the separation performance of the t tfc membrane was compared to state of the art nanofiltration membranes hu et al 2018 ji et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 ma et al 2019 pan et al 2017 puhlfürß et al 2000 shi et al 2017 van gestel et al 2002 wu et al 2016 xue et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2018a zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018b as shown in fig 6d the organic tfc membranes still had a high rejection for na2so4 in contrast the rejection of na2so4 was relatively low for ceramic nanofiltration membranes due to their poor ζ potential van gestel et al 2002 benefiting from the combination between the porous ceramic substrate and the polyamide layer the t tfc membrane displayed a comparable rejection of divalent ions and had high permeance outperforming most nanofiltration membranes considering the significant increase of the roughness that can slightly elevate the permeance due to the greater effective area yet may also cause severe membrane fouling zhu et al 2019 the anti fouling performance of the t tfc membrane was evaluated and compared with the nf 270 the similar flux decline and recovery curves of both membranes for model pollutant fig s15a and real wastewater fig s15b treatments implied that their anti fouling abilities were approximate as the separation layer that dominated the membrane fouling was prepared via interfacial polymerization for t tfc and nf 270 membranes their interaction energy between the corresponding surface and pollutant tended to be similar xu et al 2022 therefore the t tfc membrane still had an excellent anti fouling performance in practical operation in addition the separation performance of the t tfc membrane was further investigated using nanofiltration concentrated wastewater the high rejection of divalent ions was performed by the t tfc membrane fig s16 implying the feasibility of the t tfc membrane for recycling and reusing concentrated wastewater 3 4 regeneration of the t tfc membrane in full scale application of the membrane technology for the water treatment membrane fouling and ageing processes are significant problems resulting in a decline of the membrane performance generally the lifetimes of a ceramic membrane and a polyamide layer are significantly different about 40 and 5 years pećanac et al 2013 schäfer et al 2001 respectively hence the method of prolonging the ceramic tfc membrane lifetime appears of great value for reducing the membrane cost and sustainable application due to the dense polyamide layer dominating the separation of organic and inorganic pollutants the ceramic substrate with chemical resistance and hydrophilic property normally adsorbs a few contaminants which are easily removed via chemical cleaning huang et al 2020 in addition considering the flammability of the polyamide layer and the thermal stability of the ceramic substrate a low temperature calcination and re polymerization strategy is proposed for the regeneration of the t tfc membrane fig 7 a the morphology of the tio2 al2o3 substrate obtained via calcination of the t tfc membrane was characterized by sem to evaluate the feasibility of membrane regeneration the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate appeared as an interwoven net structure without the visible residue of the polyamide layer fig s17a the similar structure between virgin and restored tio2 al2o3 substrates indicated that the calcination slightly affected the tio2 framework and successfully peeled off the polyamide layer which provided a potential surface for the subsequent re polymerization process after interfacial polymerization on the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate the regenerated t tfc membrane showed nodular like structures consistent with the virgin t tfc membrane fig s17b thus the morphology characterization demonstrated that no changes occurred during the regeneration process for the surface structure of the tio2 al2o3 substrate and the t tfc membrane to elucidate the mechanism of the regeneration strategy the thermal stability of the tio2 al2o3 substrate and the exfoliated polyamide layer from the t tfc membrane was evaluated by tga fig 7b the tio2 al2o3 substrate exhibited an excellent thermal stability even at 700 c in contrast the polyamide layer was pyrolyzed like most polymers in an air atmosphere hu and marand 1999 interestingly despite the degradation of the polyamide layer occurring at about 470 c its remaining mass was mainly attributed to the insufficient degradation time in the rapid heating process of tga leading to the incomplete degradation below 500 c in terms of the regeneration process it could be inferred that sufficient time would ensure the degradation of the polyamide layer on the tio2 al2o3 substrate the low response carbon element mapping of the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate further demonstrated this result that the polyamide layer was sufficiently pyrolyzed fig s18 the performance of the regenerated t tfc membrane was evaluated in five regenerated cycles fig 7c the regenerated t tfc membrane exhibited a similar permeance and salt rejection compared with the virgin t tfc membrane implying that the regeneration process was effective and could be conducted in practical application based on three times high temperature calcination to prepare a virgin tio2 al2o3 substrate the cost of one step restored tio2 al2o3 substrate is at least three times lower making the regeneration process economically feasible in addition the restoration of the tio2 al2o3 membrane avoids the usage of extra ceramic materials thereby decreasing the consumption of resources with the technological innovation the improved polymerization process can be used for the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate to ensure the membrane with state of the art performance in addition the regeneration process extends the membrane lifetime and correspondingly reduces the total cost of the membrane currently the unpackaged hollow fibre structure is the main ceramic membrane module in practical application zarshenas et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the scale up process its exposed skin layer helps to achieve the filtration of tio2 nanowires interfacial polymerization and regenerative operation therefore this ceramic substrate with an interwoven net structure endows the nanofiltration membrane with an excellent performance and regeneration ability in practical application 4 conclusions in summary introducing the tio2 framework as a scaffold provided an interwoven net structure to fabricate a high performance ceramic based nanofiltration membrane compared with the al2o3 substrate the tio2 al2o3 substrate showed an excellent hydrophilicity great amine monomers adsorption capacity uniform pore size distribution and high porosity enabling a more suitable interface of the substrate for subsequent interfacial polymerization in this context an ultrathin polyamide layer with a high cross linking degree was formed for the t tfc membrane yielding a high permeance up to 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a satisfactory salt rejection in a long term test the t tfc membrane was remarkable in that it could be renewed via a facile low temperature calcination and re polymerization process considerably lowering the membrane cost and extending the membrane lifetime these findings propose a new avenue to fabricate ceramic based

16182,the rational design of a ceramic based nanofiltration membrane remains a significant challenge due to its performance and fabrication cost herein we report a high performance ceramic based thin film composite tfc membrane fabricated via a typical interfacial polymerization on an interwoven net substrate assembled by titanium dioxide tio2 nanowires the chemical properties and morphologies were systematically investigated for ceramic substrates and their corresponding tfc membranes due to the significantly improved hydrophilicity of the tio2 framework more reactive amine monomers were uniformly adsorbed on the modified surface of the ceramic substrate yielding an ultrathin polyamide layer with less resistance in addition the smooth surface and decreased pore size of the tio2 framework contributed to forming a defect free polyamide layer as a result the obtained ceramic based tfc membrane evinced high permeance of 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and excellent salt rejection efficiency leading to simultaneous improvements compared with the control tfc membrane without the tio2 framework notably the potential regeneration ability of the ceramic based tfc membrane could be achieved via facile low temperature calcination and re polymerization process due to the varied thermostability between the polyamide layer and the robust ceramic substrate the operation of regeneration helped to prolong the lifetime and decrease the cost for the ceramic based tfc membrane this research provides a feasible protocol to fabricate sustainable ceramic based nanofiltration membranes with enhanced performance for water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane tio2 nanowire nanofiltration regeneration high water permeance 1 introduction water scarcity has become a global challenge in view of the increasing water demand wang et al 2022a to address this issue nanofiltration has received increasing attention due to its wide applications in wastewater reuse brackish groundwater treatment and surface water purification xu et al 2022 in addition further recycling of concentrated wastewater derived from the nanofiltration process can offer extra drinking water and reduce the discharge of sewage wang et al 2021 presently polyamide nanofiltration membranes with gold standard performance and generally formed on polymeric substrates using scalable interfacial polymerization dai et al 2020 sarkar et al 2021 are mostly used however most polymeric substrates e g polysulfone and polyethersulfone suffer from poor mechanical strength and insufficient chemical and thermal resistance limiting the further application of nanofiltration membranes cheng et al 2022 chong and wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 presumably the inorganic ceramic membrane with excellent mechanical chemical and thermal stability is a feasible alternative for fabricating thin film composite tfc nanofiltration membranes wang et al 2022b wu et al 2022 chong et al successfully prepared a polyamide layer on an aluminium oxide al2o3 substrate a microfiltration membrane for nanofitration chong and wang 2019 the mechanical and thermal stability of the ceramic substrate maintained the membrane performance at high temperature and pressure conditions xia et al fabricated a chemical resistant tfc membrane on a tubular ceramic substrate yielding a methanol permeance of 22 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a high rejection of various dyes xia et al 2018 however despite the feasibility of the preparation of ceramic based nanofiltration membranes these membranes are still limited in the literature due to the several constraints for using ceramic substrates to fabricate tfc membranes generally the substrate properties including pore size roughness and porosity have a critical effect on the formation of the polyamide layer nevertheless commercial ceramic substrates with a low production cost have a large pore size and a coarse surface resulting in a polyamide layer with a low cross linking degree chong and wang 2019 zhu et al 2021 in addition the low porosity and tortuous channels of ceramic substrates are likely to increase membrane resistance zhou et al 2018 thus a rational surface design of ceramic substrates plays a potential role in the subsequent fabrication of high performance tfc membranes recently the interwoven net structure assembled by one dimensional nanomaterials e g carbon nanotube gao et al 2019 cadmium hydroxide nanostrand karan et al 2015 and copper hydroxide nanofiber ji et al 2019 is anticipated as an ideal surface for interfacial polymerization thanks to its uniform pore size smooth surface and high porosity in addition a series of simple and scalable assembly methods such as vacuum filtration spray coating and brush painting gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 make this structure easy to form on a polymeric substrate zhu et al reported an ultrathin polyamide layer fabricated on an interwoven net layer made of carbon nanotube and the resulting membrane showed ultrahigh permeance zhu et al 2016 however this novel structure has not yet been explored for ceramic substrates due to most one dimensional nanomaterials appearing in poor thermal resistance titanium dioxide tio2 a metal oxide with high hydrophilicity and thermal resistance widely used in the fabrication of the ceramic membrane has several structural morphologies yuan and su 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this context one dimensional tio2 nanowires have the potential to modify the low cost macropore ceramic substrates forming an interwoven net structure for high performance tfc membrane fabrication zhang et al 2009a zhang et al 2009b in this work the effect of a tio2 interwoven net layer on the physicochemical characteristics of the resulting tfc membrane was performed the separation performance of tfc membranes was tested and the underlying mechanism was studied to elucidate the enhanced permeance and salt rejection efficiency in addition the potential regeneration ability of the ceramic based tfc membrane was investigated using low temperature calcination and re polymerization procedure taking into account the difference in thermal resistance between the polyamide layer and ceramic substrate the performance of the regenerated membrane was further evaluated to demonstrate its feasibility for sustainable application in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals α al2o3 powder 150 300 nm changsha xinhui electronic technology co ltd china polyethersulfone pes basf co ltd germany polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp shanghai chemical reagent company china and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp merck germany were used to prepare the macroporous al2o3 substrate piperazine pip trimesoyl chloride tmc and n hexane obtained from sigma aldrich mo were used as water phase monomer organic phase monomer and organic solvent to fabricate the polyamide layer tio2 degussa germany and potassium hydroxide koh sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china were used to synthesize tio2 nanowires for membrane performance evaluation sodium sulfate na2so4 magnesium sulfate mgso4 magnesium chloride mgcl2 sodium chloride nacl polyethylene glycol peg 200 1000 da and fluorescein sodium were supplied by aladdin chemical co ltd china 2 2 tio2 nanowires synthesis the synthesis of tio2 nanowires via hydrothermal reaction is similar to the literature yuan and su 2004 briefly tio2 powder 4 g was slowly added to a koh solution 10 m 160 ml with vigorous stirring to form a uniform solution then the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 c for 48 h the white deposition was collected and washed using hcl 0 1 m and water several times finally non crystallized tio2 nanowires were obtained by vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h without the calcination process 2 3 preparation of ceramic substrates the al2o3 substrate was prepared via a phase inversion method luo et al 2021 the casting solution including 2 pvp 6 pes 32 nmp and 60 al2o3 powder was obtained via ball milling for over 24 h the homogeneous casting solution was degassed in a vacuum oven for 10 min then it was cast on glass by a doctor blade with a thickness of 1 mm subsequently the casted film was immersed into a water bath for water solvent exchange the resulting al2o3 substrate was sintered in a tube furnace at 800 c for 3 h and further heating to 1500 c for another 5 h the tio2 al2o3 substrate was prepared via facile vacuum filtration specifically the as prepared tio2 nanowires 10 mg were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water with an ultrasonication for 2 h to avoid the agglomeration of the nanowires then 1 ml of supernatant was aspirated and diluted ten times as feed solution finally the tio2 al2o3 substrate was fabricated via filtrating above feed solution and calcination at 600 c for 3 h 2 4 nanofiltration membrane fabrication the polyamide layer was fabricated using interfacial polymerization reaction by pip and tmc on the ceramic substrate fig 1 the ceramic substrate was first exposed to the pip aqueous solution 0 5 wt for 10 min after pouring out the solution excess droplets on the substrate were gently blown via a nitrogen gun subsequently the ceramic substrate was immersed in the tmc organic solution 0 1 wt for 30 s to form the polyamide layer finally the as synthesized tfc membrane was cured in an oven at 60 c for 5 min and rinsed with n hexane to remove residual tmc monomer the tfc membranes fabricated on the al2o3 substrate and tio2 al2o3 substrate are denoted as a tfc and t tfc membranes 2 5 membrane characterization the morphology and crystalline structure of the tio2 nanowires were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 2100f and x ray diffractometry xrd d8 advance respectively the mechanical stability of the ceramic substrate was studied by wsm 30 kn changchun intelligent instrument equipment co ltd china the pore size distribution and porosity of the ceramic substrate were measured by autopore v mercury intrusion porosimetry the thermal stability of the polyamide layer was tested by thermogravimetric analysis tga ta instruments q500 usa under the air atmosphere the surface composition and cross linking degree of the polyamide layer were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermofisher escalab 250xi usa the zeta potential of the polyamide layer was calculated from streaming current values which were measured by a surpass electrokinetic analyzer anton paar gmbh austria with a 10 mm kcl electrolyte solution the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane was assessed by a dynamic water contact angles goniometer dsa25 krüss germany the morphology and roughness of the membrane were observed with a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 500 zeiss germany and an atomic force microscope afm bioscope resolve bruker usa respectively 2 6 membrane performance evaluation the filtration performance of the membrane was evaluated in a lab made cross flow filtration module as described elsewhere luo et al 2021 before the filtration the membrane was compacted by deionized water at 1 5 bar for 2 h the temperature of the feed solution was maintained at 25 c via a temperature controller then the weight of permeance m was recorded over the filtration time t h by an online electronic balance at 1 bar the pure water permeance j l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated as j m p s t where p bar is the transmembrane pressure and s m2 is the active area of the membrane the rejection r i e salt and organic matter was calculated as r 1 cp cf 100 where cp and cf are the concentration of permeance and feed solution respectively the salt concentration was measured by a conductivity meter dds 307 leici china and the feed solution was 1 g l the concentration of peg was determined via a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany and the feed solution was 200 mg l 2 7 regeneration of the t tfc membrane the regeneration ability of the ceramic based nanofiltration membrane was evaluated via low temperature calcination and re polymerization process first the dried t tfc membrane was calcined at 500 c for 1 h to peel off the polyamide layer then the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate was rinsed three times by deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h finally a regenerated t tfc membrane was fabricated via interfacial polymerization as described in section 2 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ceramic substrates fig 2 shows the morphology of ceramic substrates the surface of the sintering al2o3 substrate exhibited a porous structure with part of macropores fig 2a the formation of macropores was mainly attributed to the stack of varying sizes of al2o3 particles fig s1 the wide range of pore size distribution might reduce the absorption of water phase monomer especially at the macropores region with a poor capillary effect thus generating defects at the interface polymerization process peng et al 2020 to fabricate a defect free polyamide layer on the ceramic substrate tio2 nanowires were deposited on the surface of the al2o3 substrate as seen in fig 2b the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a porous framework without agglomerated particles compared with other one dimensional nanomaterials assembled frameworks li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 indicating the excellent dispersibility of tio2 nanowires in the water solution in addition the roughness of ceramic substrates was evaluated by afm fig s2 the average roughness ra significantly decreased from 104 0 nm for the al2o3 substrate to 18 2 nm for the tio2 al2o3 substrate proving the smoother surface of the tio2 framework this result was consistent with the membrane morphology observed in sem images fig 2a b the pore size distribution and porosity of ceramic substrates having a critical effect on the subsequent polyamide layer formation and tfc membrane performance peng et al 2020 were measured by the mercury intrusion method the pore size distribution of the al2o3 substrate exhibited two peaks at 280 and 830 nm fig s3a which was consistent with the size distribution detected by sem fig s1 to avoid the interference of pores from the al2o3 substrate a freestanding tio2 membrane was fabricated for the evaluation of the pore size distribution and porosity briefly tio2 nanowires were firstly filtered on a glass fibre membrane after drying in the oven a freestanding tio2 membrane was obtained by peeling off the glass fibre membrane and sintering the resulting tio2 membrane showed a smaller pore size of about 10 20 nm fig s3a which was the same as the tio2 al2o3 substrate visualized by the magnified sem image fig 2b the pore size of the framework assembled by the nanowires was mainly related to the diameter of the precursory nanowires zhang et al 2009b compared to other macroporous frameworks constructed by nanowires with a diameter over 20 nm da silva et al 2016 luo et al 2018 the ultrathin tio2 nanowires of about 10 nm successfully endowed the tio2 al2o3 substrate with a compact mesoporous surface fig s4 in terms of the ceramic substrate porosity the al2o3 substrate had an interstitial porosity of 29 5 fig s3b which was approximate to that of the ceramic membranes reported before mouiya et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 interestingly a significant increase of interstitial porosity to 47 6 was observed for the tio2 framework due to its interwoven net structure consequently introducing the tio2 framework on a traditional ceramic substrate might provide a versatile scaffold with homogenized pore size and enhanced porosity for the subsequent interfacial polymerization the phase composition and crystal structure of ceramic substrates were studied from xrd spectra fig s5 the distinct peaks of the al2o3 substrate corresponded to the corundum pdf no 74 1081 regarding the tio2 al2o3 substrate the ultrathin tio2 nanowires were transformed from k2tino2n 1 precursors which were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction xu et al 2018 then the k ion was displaced by h3o in a dilute acidic solution to form the h2tino2n 1 nanowires after dehydration of h2tino2n 1 nanowires via sintering at 600 c the ultrathin tio2 nanowires were obtained with anatase structure fig s5b which was also evidenced by its corresponding electron diffraction pattern fig s4 in addition the thickness of the tio2 framework was about 373 nm fig s6 consistently with the eds mapping result fig s7 its thin thickness added less resistance to the substrate fig s8 furthermore the robust tio2 al2o3 substrate had a high mechanical strength of almost 66 4 mpa fig s9 which was greater than most organic polymer substrates the hydrophilicity of ceramic substrates is important for tfc membranes fabrication because the high water affinity promotes the adsorption of pip molecules for the subsequent interfacial polymerization reaction the apparent contact angle was used to evaluate the surface hydrophilicity of the ceramic substrates via measuring the sessile drop of deionized water fig 3 a due to the high roughness of the al2o3 substrate its apparent contact angle was lower than that of the tio2 al2o3 substrate interestingly after eliminating the influence of the roughness the corrected contact angle values of the al2o3 and tio2 al2o3 substrates were 49 3 and 43 6 respectively indicating the introduction of the tio2 framework improved the surface hydrophilicity zhang et al 2020 the enhanced hydrophilicity of the tio2 framework accelerated the adsorption of water phase monomers as shown in fig 3b the water uptake significantly increased from 13 7 to 20 1 for al2o3 and tio2 al2o3 substrates which was attributed to the interwoven net structure of the tio2 framework with high porosity providing more storage space for the solution containing amine monomers fig s3b wu et al 2019 the distribution of water phase monomers on the surface of the ceramic substrates was investigated using fluorescein sodium as a probe the luminous area and intensity qualitatively display the distribution and amount of adsorbed pip molecules on the substrates zhu et al 2020a the al2o3 substrate had a luminous layer with a significant fluctuation of intensity fig 3c indicating that pip molecules were unevenly distributed on the surface of the substrate the darkness in the macropore regions further demonstrated that the poor capillary effect was unable to adsorb pip molecules in contrast the luminous layer was uniformly distributed on the tio2 al2o3 substrate indicating that the aqueous solution was well spread on the tio2 framework fig 3d in addition compared with the al2o3 substrate the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a thicker luminous layer together with higher intensity implying that the tio2 al2o3 substrate had a significant capability for adsorption of pip molecules these results were consistent with the water uptake capacity of ceramic substrates the high concentration of pip molecules was beneficial to the subsequent interfacial polymerization to form a homogeneous and defect free polyamide layer 3 2 characterization of ceramic based tfc membranes the surface of all as prepared tfc membranes was visualized by sem as shown in fig 4 a b a tfc and t tfc membranes both exhibited typical nodular like structures on their surface confirming that the polyamide layer was successfully polymerized onto ceramic substrates in addition the t tfc membrane had a higher amount of nodular like structures than the a tfc membrane afm topography further proved this result and the ra values were 24 1 nm and 8 9 nm for t tfc and a tfc membranes fig s10 respectively it was reported that the formation of a nodular like structure was generally driven by the violent reaction between diamine and tmc molecules zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 thus the high porosity of the t tfc membrane releasing more diamine formed a rough surface with more nodular like structures offering potential extra channels to increase the water permeance zhu et al 2020b the thickness of the polyamide layer that dominated the primary resistance of ceramic based tfc membranes was measured the polyamide layer thickness was 43 nm for the a tfc membrane fig s11 considering the ultrathin polyamide layer thickness of the t tfc afm is applied to determine its polyamide layer isolated from tio2 al2o3 substrate fig s12 specifically a small piece of t tfc membrane was immersed in hf solution after slowly dissolving the tio2 framework the polyamide layer floated on the surface of the acid solution then the nanofilm was transferred to the silicon wafer and was washed three times with deionized water for further testing the polyamide layer thickness of the t tfc membrane was distinctly decreased to 15 4 nm fig 4c commonly the water uptake capacity of the substrate directly affected the diamine concentration for interfacial polymerization and determined the ultimate thickness of the polyamide layer freger 2003 you et al 2021 due to the interwoven net structure of the tio2 framework with high porosity homogenized pore size improved hydrophilicity and smooth surface the tio2 al2o3 substrate enabled the sufficient and uniform release of diamine fig 3 leading to an instant polymerization and yielding a thin polyamide layer to limit the following diffusion of diamine from the water phase to the organic phase similar phenomena were also reported in literatures the ultrathin and defect free polyamide layer was generated on the interface assembled by one dimensional nanomaterials gao et al 2019 karan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the chemical composition of tfc membranes was analyzed by the xps spectrum as seen in fig 5 a both tfc membranes showed the presence of o n and c elements the cross linking degree of the polyamide layer reflecting the efficiency of the interfacial polymerization was calculated by the o n ratio xu et al 2021 the cross linking degree of the t tfc membrane was 65 3 much higher than the 57 8 of the a tfc membrane additionally the binding energy at 284 5 285 6 and 287 4 ev are assigned to the c c c n and n c o bonds fig s13 respectively the increased area of n c o bonds for the t tfc membrane was attributed to the enrichment of pip monomers on the substrate accelerating the cross linking between biphasic interface and forming a denser polyamide layer the molecular weight cut off mwco and surface charge corresponding to the steric hindrance and donnan exclusion of the tfc membranes were investigated jin et al 2022a zheng et al 2022 the mwco was measured to be 596 da and 438 da for a tfc and t tfc membranes fig 5b respectively further confirming that the t tfc membrane was denser than the a tfc membrane the low selectivity of the a tfc membrane was attributed to the lack of pip monomers in the macropore regions of the al2o3 substrate in contrast the uniform pore size distribution of the tio2 al2o3 substrate was beneficial to form a defect free polyamide layer yang et al 2018 in addition the diffusivity of pip monomers was enhanced with the increase of concentration thereby leading to an ultrafast reaction at the initial polymerization process and yielding a substantially denser polyamide layer with an ultrathin thickness for the t tfc membrane xu et al 2021 you et al 2021 fig 5 c showed the ζ potential of tfc membranes the isoelectric points of a tfc and t tfc membranes were located at ph 4 7 and 4 1 respectively the increased ζ potential of the t tfc membrane was attributed to the self termination effect of the polymerization process the high diffusivity of pip monomers accelerated to form the incipient polyamide layer and restrained its subsequent diffusivity making the front surface of the membrane with abundant tmc monomers freger 2005 thus negatively charged carboxylic groups derived from the acryl chloride groups endowed the t tfc membrane with a greater ζ potential the surface wettability of the tfc membranes was evaluated by the water contact angle as shown in fig 5d generally a decrease of the contact angle improves the hydrophilicity of the membrane and the t tfc membrane exhibited an increase of surface hydrophilicity compared with the a tfc membrane the increased hydrophilicity of the t tfc membrane was rationalized by substantial carboxylic groups on the membrane surface with strong hydrogen bonds fig s14 in addition the ultrathin polyamide layer of the t tfc membrane with lower resistance would accelerate the penetration of the droplet during water contact angle measurement wang et al 2017 3 3 performance of ceramic based tfc membranes tfc membranes performance in terms of permeance and salt rejection was assessed in a cross flow device the interplay between applied pressure and water flux is depicted in fig 6 a the t tfc membrane showed a near linear relation even at 16 bar while the break occurred for the a tfc membrane with a pressure at 1 5 bar the better structural robustness was attributed to the smooth surface and narrow pore size of the tio2 framework leading to a decreased internal stress in the polyamide layer zhang et al 2018 interestingly compared with the industrial organic polymer substrate which was prone to compaction arena et al 2021 davenport et al 2020 the pressure resistant ceramic substrate endowed the t tfc membrane with high pressure operation conditions without the attenuation of the water flux indicating that the ceramic based nanofiltration could meet the extreme water demand via pressure regulation based on the pressure and flux lines the permeance of tfc membranes was calculated the t tfc membrane exhibited a permeance of 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 almost two times higher than the a tfc membrane in general the polyamide layer dominated the resistance of the tfc membrane cheng et al 2021 karan et al 2015 the decreased pore size of the tio2 al2o3 substrate could avoid the formation of the polyamide into the substrate jin et al 2022b the hydrophilic surface of the tio2 al2o3 substrate favoured the formation of the polyamide layer with an ultrathin thickness fig 4c thus the permeance of the t tfc membrane was enhanced in addition the tio2 framework with a straight interwoven net structure shortened the transport pathway thereby further improving the permeance of the t tfc membrane fig 6b presented the single salt rejection of tfc membranes the salt rejection was poor for the a tfc membrane which was primarily attributed to the formation of defects on the al2o3 substrate with macropores in contrast the t tfc membrane showed a higher rejection for the four salts this enhancement was due to the change in inherent properties i e steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion of the polyamide layer as the t tfc membrane had a lower mwco and a stronger negative charge the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion were intensified fig 5b c resulting in increased salt rejection notably compared with a commercial membrane nf 270 the similar rejection of divalent anion ability indicated the t tfc membrane reached commercial separation performance to evaluate the stability of the t tfc membrane a long term filtration test was conducted fig 6c due to the robust ceramic substrate and strong hydrogen bond interactions between the polyamide layer and the tio2 framework the t tfc membrane maintained a good desalination performance for over 48 h hinting that this membrane has good stability in practical operation in addition the separation performance of the t tfc membrane was compared to state of the art nanofiltration membranes hu et al 2018 ji et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 ma et al 2019 pan et al 2017 puhlfürß et al 2000 shi et al 2017 van gestel et al 2002 wu et al 2016 xue et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 zhu et al 2018a zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018b as shown in fig 6d the organic tfc membranes still had a high rejection for na2so4 in contrast the rejection of na2so4 was relatively low for ceramic nanofiltration membranes due to their poor ζ potential van gestel et al 2002 benefiting from the combination between the porous ceramic substrate and the polyamide layer the t tfc membrane displayed a comparable rejection of divalent ions and had high permeance outperforming most nanofiltration membranes considering the significant increase of the roughness that can slightly elevate the permeance due to the greater effective area yet may also cause severe membrane fouling zhu et al 2019 the anti fouling performance of the t tfc membrane was evaluated and compared with the nf 270 the similar flux decline and recovery curves of both membranes for model pollutant fig s15a and real wastewater fig s15b treatments implied that their anti fouling abilities were approximate as the separation layer that dominated the membrane fouling was prepared via interfacial polymerization for t tfc and nf 270 membranes their interaction energy between the corresponding surface and pollutant tended to be similar xu et al 2022 therefore the t tfc membrane still had an excellent anti fouling performance in practical operation in addition the separation performance of the t tfc membrane was further investigated using nanofiltration concentrated wastewater the high rejection of divalent ions was performed by the t tfc membrane fig s16 implying the feasibility of the t tfc membrane for recycling and reusing concentrated wastewater 3 4 regeneration of the t tfc membrane in full scale application of the membrane technology for the water treatment membrane fouling and ageing processes are significant problems resulting in a decline of the membrane performance generally the lifetimes of a ceramic membrane and a polyamide layer are significantly different about 40 and 5 years pećanac et al 2013 schäfer et al 2001 respectively hence the method of prolonging the ceramic tfc membrane lifetime appears of great value for reducing the membrane cost and sustainable application due to the dense polyamide layer dominating the separation of organic and inorganic pollutants the ceramic substrate with chemical resistance and hydrophilic property normally adsorbs a few contaminants which are easily removed via chemical cleaning huang et al 2020 in addition considering the flammability of the polyamide layer and the thermal stability of the ceramic substrate a low temperature calcination and re polymerization strategy is proposed for the regeneration of the t tfc membrane fig 7 a the morphology of the tio2 al2o3 substrate obtained via calcination of the t tfc membrane was characterized by sem to evaluate the feasibility of membrane regeneration the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate appeared as an interwoven net structure without the visible residue of the polyamide layer fig s17a the similar structure between virgin and restored tio2 al2o3 substrates indicated that the calcination slightly affected the tio2 framework and successfully peeled off the polyamide layer which provided a potential surface for the subsequent re polymerization process after interfacial polymerization on the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate the regenerated t tfc membrane showed nodular like structures consistent with the virgin t tfc membrane fig s17b thus the morphology characterization demonstrated that no changes occurred during the regeneration process for the surface structure of the tio2 al2o3 substrate and the t tfc membrane to elucidate the mechanism of the regeneration strategy the thermal stability of the tio2 al2o3 substrate and the exfoliated polyamide layer from the t tfc membrane was evaluated by tga fig 7b the tio2 al2o3 substrate exhibited an excellent thermal stability even at 700 c in contrast the polyamide layer was pyrolyzed like most polymers in an air atmosphere hu and marand 1999 interestingly despite the degradation of the polyamide layer occurring at about 470 c its remaining mass was mainly attributed to the insufficient degradation time in the rapid heating process of tga leading to the incomplete degradation below 500 c in terms of the regeneration process it could be inferred that sufficient time would ensure the degradation of the polyamide layer on the tio2 al2o3 substrate the low response carbon element mapping of the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate further demonstrated this result that the polyamide layer was sufficiently pyrolyzed fig s18 the performance of the regenerated t tfc membrane was evaluated in five regenerated cycles fig 7c the regenerated t tfc membrane exhibited a similar permeance and salt rejection compared with the virgin t tfc membrane implying that the regeneration process was effective and could be conducted in practical application based on three times high temperature calcination to prepare a virgin tio2 al2o3 substrate the cost of one step restored tio2 al2o3 substrate is at least three times lower making the regeneration process economically feasible in addition the restoration of the tio2 al2o3 membrane avoids the usage of extra ceramic materials thereby decreasing the consumption of resources with the technological innovation the improved polymerization process can be used for the restored tio2 al2o3 substrate to ensure the membrane with state of the art performance in addition the regeneration process extends the membrane lifetime and correspondingly reduces the total cost of the membrane currently the unpackaged hollow fibre structure is the main ceramic membrane module in practical application zarshenas et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the scale up process its exposed skin layer helps to achieve the filtration of tio2 nanowires interfacial polymerization and regenerative operation therefore this ceramic substrate with an interwoven net structure endows the nanofiltration membrane with an excellent performance and regeneration ability in practical application 4 conclusions in summary introducing the tio2 framework as a scaffold provided an interwoven net structure to fabricate a high performance ceramic based nanofiltration membrane compared with the al2o3 substrate the tio2 al2o3 substrate showed an excellent hydrophilicity great amine monomers adsorption capacity uniform pore size distribution and high porosity enabling a more suitable interface of the substrate for subsequent interfacial polymerization in this context an ultrathin polyamide layer with a high cross linking degree was formed for the t tfc membrane yielding a high permeance up to 26 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a satisfactory salt rejection in a long term test the t tfc membrane was remarkable in that it could be renewed via a facile low temperature calcination and re polymerization process considerably lowering the membrane cost and extending the membrane lifetime these findings propose a new avenue to fabricate ceramic based

16183,the entering of silver nanoparticles ag nps in natural environments constantly increases due to their widespread production and application while the environmental behavior impacts and fate of ag nps were critically assessed the main challenge represents continuous tracking and quantification of ag nps in environmental and biological matrices a group of labeled ag nps with gold cores au ag nps was developed for distinguishing between pristine ag nps and their other forms and we comprehensively compared their physicochemical properties environmental behavior and biological effects with unlabeled ag nps the electron transfer process from the au core to the ag shell gradually decreased with the increase of ag shell thickness then the inhibition of ag release induced by the au core was gradually alleviated but the generation of superoxide radicals was intensified sharply then the effect of the au core on the dissolution capacity and free radicals generation significantly altered the biological toxicity of ag nps and the influence degree was related to the test organism s species nevertheless the au core retained the surface properties of ag nps leading to the uptake of au ag nps entirely consistent with the behavior of unlabeled ag nps these findings confirmed that au core labeling provides new opportunities for tracking ag nps in environmental and biological systems and the exposure conditions and test organisms should be carefully assessed before employing the au core labeling technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoparticles labeling aquatic environment tracking accumulation 1 introduction silver nanoparticles ag nps were widely used in biotechnology medical devices engineering and energy fields due to their unique properties hansen et al 2020 ivask et al 2014 wu et al 2017 however the increased use of ag nps raised concerns about its unexpected accumulation in the environment especially in the aquatic and sewage treatment system li et al 2016 polesel et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 ag nps concentration could reach ng μg l levels gagnon et al 2021 xiao et al 2019 in the aquatic environment and ag nps may exist in a variety of sizes shapes and coatings bertela et al 2021 fiorati et al 2020 maturi et al 2021 prosposito et al 2019 posing a threat to aquatic organisms ivask et al 2014 martin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 many studies confirmed that ag nps caused biological toxicity through oxidative and non oxidative stress mechanisms induced by particles and dissolved ions du et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 gao et al 2021 the biological effects of ag nps could be significantly influenced by surface properties such as surface charge surface functionalization and hydrophobicity ivask et al 2014 wu et al 2017 however due to the ubiquity of nps transformation e g dissolution chlorination sulfidation and complexation in environmental and biological systems malysheva et al 2021 polesel et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the great challenge in simultaneous tracking of nps and ions lead to contradictions in explaining the mechanism of biological effects dubey et al 2015 hendrickson et al 2016 yaqoob et al 2020 limiting further applications of ag nps yaqoob et al 2020 for instance ag could form secondary intracellular nps which confused the interpretation of the external ag nps uptake drobne et al 2018 many tracking techniques were developed to study nps in complex matrices and they could be divided into two categories label free techniques and labeling techniques label free techniques are extraction separation e g field flow fractionation fff methods quantification e g single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms and bioimaging e g hyperspectral stimulated raman scattering microscopy and scattered light imaging deline et al 2018 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 however it remains challenging to distinguish between primary or secondary ag nps or simultaneous quantify nps and ions in biological samples drobne et al 2018 peng et al 2017 various labeled nps were developed to complement existing analytical techniques deline and nason 2019 deline et al 2018 merrifield et al 2017 these rare labeling approaches could help study the transformation bioaccumulation and toxicity of ag nps deline and nason 2019 four main types of labeling were used to enhance the study of the behavior and fate of ag nps fluorescent dyes radioisotopes stable isotopes and core shell labeling core shell labeling is a promising labeling technique for the existing analytical methods the most significant advantage of internal labeling compared to other labeling methods is that it can distinguish ag primary and secondary ag nps wang and wang 2022 in addition internal labeling is more stable and does not affect the surface properties of nps compared to dopant and fluorescent labeling methods deline and nason 2019 yan and wang 2021 encapsulating a stable metal label e g au inside the ag shell which is rare in complicated matrices allowed for analyzing many different mass quantification and particle visualization techniques such as icp ms liang et al 2020b merrifield et al 2017 transmission electron microscopy and hyperspectral imaging deline and nason 2019 the potential application scenarios of au core labeling in environmental and biological matrices were confirmed deline et al 2018 merrifield et al 2017 ponton et al 2019 the au core could be used as an internal standard of ag nps to directly evaluate the behavior of ag nps and ions in environmental and biological systems merrifield et al 2017 ponton et al 2019 the critical points in using au labeling are to provide that the au core cannot affect the physicochemical properties of ag nps and determine the most appropriate application conditions the extent to which au core labeled nps affect the environmental and biological behavior of unlabeled nps is also elusive therefore this study developed au core labeled ag nps as a new tool to study the environmental behavior biological effects and fate of ag nps a group of au labeled unlabeled ag nps with different ag shell thicknesses was synthesized and the physicochemical properties environmental behavior and biological effects of the two kinds of ag nps were comprehensively compared our study indicated that au core labeling could be a promising quantitative method for tracking nps in environmental and biological systems under suitable application conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents

voltammetry curve determined for the first time was recorded in the experiment 2 5 real time monitoring of the dissolution kinetics of nps good selectivity of the ag sensor tetrazole functionalized tetraphenylethylene derivative 1 tez tpe 1 to ag was confirmed in previous studies yan et al 2019 yan et al 2018 thus tez tpe 1 was used to monitor the real time dissolution kinetics of nps

algal growth assays were conducted using a 96 well microplate and modified according to the previous study haire et al 2018 the specific design of the microplate was described in supporting information before exposure c vulgaris in the logarithmic growth phase was centrifugated at 1000 g for 10 min and resuspended in the se medium next 100 μl of the algae suspension was mixed 1 1 by

was used to analyze the significant difference of all the data independent sample t test and one way anova were used to investigate the significant difference between different groups p 0 05 was considered significant linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between different biochemical indicators the linear relationships were reported to be significant if p 0 05 20 and 50 median inhibition values were calculated by the probit method using spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of au core labeling on the physicochemical properties of ag nps all the prepared ag nps and au ag nps were uniformly spherical fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the tem images showed that the core shell nanostructures had been successfully fabricated the scanning transmission electron microscopy stem images fig 1b of au ag nps indicate a bright central area surrounded by a less bright peripheral region suggesting that the au core was covered with ag shells of various thicknesses the elemental mapping also supports the core shell structure consisting of the au core and the ag shell for all au ag nps fig 1c the average diameter of the au core is 20 7 0 7 nm whereas the diameters of the final au agx nps are 25 4 0 3 47 2 1 4 64 3 0 4 and 76 6 1 4 nm fig s2 the thicknesses of the corresponding ag shells are 2 4 13 3 21 8 and 28 0 nm ag nps with similar sizes and surface coatings were also synthesized for investigating the influence of au core labeling the average diameter fig s2 of ag nps is 22 4 1 1 41 3 0 7 63 9 0 9 and 81 8 0 7 nm respectively as shown in fig 1d x ray diffraction xrd patterns further demonstrate the successful synthesis of au ag nps and ag nps all of which have similar crystal structures feng et al 2019 the dls results show that au ag nps and ag nps with the same average diameter exhibit similar hydrodynamic diameters fig 1e furthermore the surface coating onto au ag nps and ag nps was examined by atr and xps no apparent differences in functional groups and c1s binding energy were observed between au ag nps and corresponding ag nps fig s3 and s4 suggesting that the au core nps and ag nps have similar surface coatings the optical properties of au ag nps and ag nps were determined by measuring uv vis absorption spectra fig 1f au ag nps showed two different absorption peaks related to au and ag with an increase in the ag shell thickness the absorption peak of the au core was gradually blue shifted and attenuated and the peak of the ag shell became evident feng et al 2019 in contrast the absorption peaks of ag nps were gradually red shifted with an increase in the ag nps size for au ag 1 nps with the thinnest ag shell ag 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 peaks shift to lower binding energies than ag 1 nps with the same size fig 2 a indicating that the ag shell gains more electrons moreover with an increase in the ag shell thickness ag 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 peaks of au ag nps exhibit no apparent changes compared to the corresponding ag nps the electron compensation of the au core could facilitate electron enrichment in the ag shell consequently the surface oxidation of the ag shell could be inhibited feng et al reported that the proportion of ag2o was reduced significantly with the thinner ag shell according to the xps and xanes analyses feng et al 2019 however the xps results in our study show that all nps exhibit no significant ag oxidation state even for ag nps fig 2a different synthesis methods may cause this difference compared with the previous study feng et al 2019 other methods used sodium citrate as a weak reducing agent to slowly reduce ag under heating conditions here presented a new method a potent reducing agent ascorbic acid has been used to reduce these ions rapidly the whole synthesis process of ag nps accomplishes within 5 min and pvp is added for protection to avoid ag oxidation next the redox properties of different au ag nps and ag nps fig 2b e were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry for nps coated on the working electrode the onset potential is assigned as the energy of the homo and lumo for nps as shown in fig 2f the onset potential of au ag 1 up to 0 30 v was higher than that of ag 1 up to 0 20 v which indicates that au ag 1 is more difficult to oxidize suggesting the electron compensation effect from the au core by increasing the ag shell au ag nps and ag nps exhibit a similar onset potential 0 37 0 4 v it has also been observed that the oxidation peak potential of nps increases with an increase in particle size and au ag nps consistently exhibit a higher oxidation peak potential compared with ag nps with a similar size chen et al chen et al 2019 reported that aggregation of ag nps yielded a higher oxidation peak potential besides the oxidation of the ag shell to ag ions might result in the au core exposure changing the oxidation process which together may explain the higher oxidation potential observed for au ag nps 3 2 influence of au core labeling on the environmental behavior of ag nps the inhibition of ag oxidation by the au core may reduce the dissolution of the ag shell as oxidation constitutes an important part of the dissolution process xiu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the expression for the released ag content has been based on the surface area of nps to display the effect of the au core on the dissolution behavior of nps directly the dissolution of ag nps was significantly higher than that of au ag nps of the same size until the ag shell thickness reached 28 0 nm p 0 05 figs 3 a and 3b furthermore it was worth noting that the dissolution ability of au ag nps increased with the particle size p 0 05 fig 3b indicating a gradual weakening of the compensation effect from the au core the dissolution behavior of au ag nps was beyond our expectation as both cv curves and xps suggest that the au core exhibits no effect on the ag shell when the shell thickness exceeds 13 nm feng et al reported that au ag nps exhibit a similar dissolution ability as ag nps for an ag shell thickness of 10 nm feng et al 2019 they found that the dissolution ratio of their nps in a bronchial epithelial growth medium of 16 was much higher than the corresponding dissolution ratio in the present work of 5 thus it is suggested that the controlling factor in the present experiment may be different compared to feng s work leading to a lower dissolution ratio and a significant difference in the dissolution behavior between au ag nps and ag nps liu et al liu and hurt 2010 suggested the participation of peroxide intermediates during the dissolution of ag nps in ultrapure water the difference between au ag nps and ag nps in the production of intermediate o2 radicals is demonstrated in fig 3d therefore it has been suggested that the change in the ability of the au ag nps to produce reactive oxygen species ros may explain their slower dissolution ag nps may also undergo complex physical transformation after being released into aquatic environments the aggregation behavior of ag nps could be significantly influenced by their physicochemical characteristics and ambient conditions e g ionic strength and composition ph and natural organic matter petosa et al 2010 tang and cheng 2018 as shown in figs 3c and s7 8 au ag nps and ag nps are well dispersed in freshwater at ph 3 6 9 6 with the increase of h ph 1 5 or ca2 concentration au ag nps and most ag nps agglomerated obviously it has been reported that h or ca2 could be strongly adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged nps resulting in charge neutralization and the compression of electric double layers akaighe et al 2013 shih et al 2012 the ccc values of ca2 are 11 and 9 mm for ag 3 nps and ag 4 nps respectively as for ag nps with smaller particle sizes no significant aggregation was detected even for a ca2 concentration of 100 mm in the medium as the ag shell thickness increases the ccc values of au ag nps are 21 20 6 and 6 mm respectively moreover the au core was observed to significantly reduce the ccc values of ca2 for au ag nps the ccc values of ca2 for au ag nps and ag nps gradually approach each other with an increase in the ag shell thickness similarly the hydrodynamic diameter of au ag nps and ag nps under different ph conditions also gradually tends to be the same with an increase in the ag shell thickness the aggregation behavior of nps in freshwater could be analyzed using the dlvo theory two forces between nps electrostatic double layer repulsion and van der waals attraction are mainly accounted for in the dlvo theory handy et al 2008 as previously described the zeta potential of au ag nps was more negative than that of ag nps which might result in more ca2 adsorbed on the surface besides the au core might affect the van der waals forces between nps van der waals forces are dependent on the particle size and the hamaker constant the hamaker constant defines the strength of interactions pinchuk et al reported that the hamaker constant of au was significantly higher than that of ag pinchuk et al 2015 so the van der waals attraction between au ag nps is higher than that of ag nps with the same size with an increase in the ag shell thickness an increased distance between au cores and a decrease in the au atomic ratio lower the differences in van der waals forces between au ag nps and ag nps the ros generation ability of different nps under light conditions was analyzed to evaluate the effect of the au core on the ros generation of ag nps fig 3d superoxide radicals o2 are detected in ag nps and au ag nps solution under irradiation for 30 min it was suggested that o2 could mediate the photo oxidation and reduction processes on the surface of ag nps jones et al 2011 liu and hurt 2010 schmidt et al 2003 the au core exhibited a significant effect on the o2 generation ability of ag nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness the generation ability of au ag nps to produce o2 was higher than that of ag nps several studies reported similar results chang et al 2014 kamimura et al 2017 it was reported that au ag nps showed stronger surface enhanced raman scattering sers and photocatalytic activity due to the stronger localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect chang et al 2014 feng et al 2019 kamimura et al 2017 wang et al 2005 we suggest that the stronger lspr effect enhances the production of o2 by au ag nps 3 3 influence of au core labeling on the biological effects of ag nps as shown in fig s9 the ag au mass ratio in au ag nps exposure groups was close to the ag au mass ratio in au ag nps these results revealed that the uptake of particulate ag played a significant role in the uptake of ag by t thermophila cells wang and wang 2022 this finding was consistent with our previous study liang et al 2020a liang et al 2020b next we studied the effect of au core labeling on the uptake of ag nps by t thermophila cells the accumulation of au ag nps and ag nps was calculated based on the total ag accumulation because the uptake of ag was negligible fig s9 the results fig 4 showed that the au core exhibits no effect on the biological uptake of nps and such effect is independent of the particle size the internalization process of nps is influenced by surface properties such as chemical composition particle size and morphology hydrophobicity surface charge and functionalization angioletti uberti 2017 kennedy et al 2014 murugan et al 2015 compared to au core labeling some labeling methods including fluorescence labeling and dopants would inevitably modulate the surface of metal metal oxide nps which could affect their interactions with ambient substances and cell tissues deline and nason 2019 rodriguez lorenzo et al 2014 for instance yan et al found that the dissolution rate biological uptake and toxicity of emission fluorogen coated ag nps significantly differed from citrate coated ag nps yan and wang 2021 zhang and wang 2019 our results indicate that au core labeling could be well applicable for studying the uptake of ag nps as it would preserve the surface physicochemical properties in addition it should be noted that the aggregation state of nps in the medium was also one of key factors affecting the biological accumulation of nps liang et al 2020a tan et al 2017 as our previous results showed that au core labeling could promote the aggregation of nps fig 3c it is suggested that the exposure concentration of au ag nps should be as low as possible to minimize the adverse effect of aggregation next the au core labeling effect on the toxicity of ag nps was evaluated fig 5 as shown in fig 5a b the effects of ag 1 nps on cell lysosomal membrane damage and mortality are significantly higher than those of au ag 1 nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness the toxicity differences between ag nps and au ag nps with similar sizes become insignificant in particular the toxicity effects of ag nps and au ag nps to t thermophila are not consistent until the ag shell thickness reaches 21 8 nm the uptake results indicate that the au core does not affect the internalization of ag nps fig 4 therefore the differences in the toxicity of ag nps and au ag nps should be induced by the dissolved extent of nps or the particulate effect of au ag nps a previous study has proved that the ag release from the ag nps surface was responsible for the toxicity of ag nps to t thermophila including the released ag in the exposed medium and intracellular environment liang et al 2020a the linear correlation analysis between the dissolution proportion of nps and lysosomal membrane damage cell mortality fig 5c demonstrated a strong correlation confirming this speculation the au core labeling effect on the toxicity of ag nps was further evaluated using c vulgaris due to its critical role in the ecosystem the toxicity results fig 6 a showed that the influence of ag nps on the growth inhibition of c vulgaris is more significantly that of au ag nps with the thinnest ag shell remarkably the toxicity of ag nps decreases with the particle size while the toxicity of au ag nps increases at first and then decreases with the particle size fig 6 numerous studies indicated that the toxicity mechanisms of ag nps included oxidative stress induced by nps and the metal toxicity induced by released ag du et al 2018 gao et al 2021 unlike the toxicity mechanisms of ag nps to t thermophila there is no consistent trend between the dissolution proportion of nps and growth inhibition of c vulgaris fig s10 suggesting that the oxidative stress induced by ag nps may play an important role in the toxicity to algae the esr results fig 3d have indicated that the ability of au ag nps to produce ros is much higher than that of ag nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness excessive ros change the permeability of the cell membrane destroy chloroplasts and inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments inhibiting the intensity of chlorophyll fluorescence fig s11 and the growth of c reinhardtii zhao et al 2021 many studies using labeling methods do not fully compare between labeled and unlabeled nps chowdhury et al 2012 deline and nason 2019 yan et al 2019 although au core labeling used in this study may change the environmental behavior and toxicity of ag nps in some cases it still has significant advantages especially in the evaluation of bioavailability and bioaccumulation in complex scenarios on the one hand au core labeling could distinguish between different forms of nps and released ions which could help solve many controversial problems in the study of the biological fate of nps drobne et al 2018 kuehr et al 2020b for instance the ag au mass ratio in our results fig s9 can be used to estimate the primary uptake way of ag by cells and labeling can easily distinguish the primary and secondary nps by determining the presence of au or not drobne et al 2018 on the other hand au core labeling can help differentiate natural or engineered nps and reduce the background interference because it is almost impossible that environmental and biological matrices to contain au deline and nason 2019 drobne et al 2018 kuehr et al 2020a zeumer et al 2019 the known ti au ratio of the au tio2 nps could be used to determine which portion of the total titanium was attributable to the sample background deline et al 2018 moreover au core labeling can decrease the detection limit of nps for instance the size detection limit of au nps below 20 nm is lower than tio2 nps 30 40 nm using sp icp ms dan et al 2015 kuehr et al 2020c taboada lopez et al 2019 finally the internal labeling is especially appropriate for long term experiments including trophic transfer and chronic toxicity studies in organisms as the au core labeling is not time sensitive deline and nason 2019 deline et al 2018 4 conclusion in general the au core labeling effects on the environmental behavior and biological performance of ag nps were systematically studied for the first time it was found that most of the environmental behavior and biological effects of au ag nps and pristine ag nps gradually converged with an increase in the ag shell thickness furthermore it is worth noting that regardless of the ag shell the au core did not affect the biological uptake of ag nps in t thermophila these results implied that au core labeling could help track the uptake behavior of pristine nps and the toxicity mechanism of nps with au core also remained unchanged although au could influence the toxicity effect considering its significant advantages in complex media au core labeling could be a promising quantitative method for tracking nps in environmental and biological systems credit authorship

16183,the entering of silver nanoparticles ag nps in natural environments constantly increases due to their widespread production and application while the environmental behavior impacts and fate of ag nps were critically assessed the main challenge represents continuous tracking and quantification of ag nps in environmental and biological matrices a group of labeled ag nps with gold cores au ag nps was developed for distinguishing between pristine ag nps and their other forms and we comprehensively compared their physicochemical properties environmental behavior and biological effects with unlabeled ag nps the electron transfer process from the au core to the ag shell gradually decreased with the increase of ag shell thickness then the inhibition of ag release induced by the au core was gradually alleviated but the generation of superoxide radicals was intensified sharply then the effect of the au core on the dissolution capacity and free radicals generation significantly altered the biological toxicity of ag nps and the influence degree was related to the test organism s species nevertheless the au core retained the surface properties of ag nps leading to the uptake of au ag nps entirely consistent with the behavior of unlabeled ag nps these findings confirmed that au core labeling provides new opportunities for tracking ag nps in environmental and biological systems and the exposure conditions and test organisms should be carefully assessed before employing the au core labeling technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoparticles labeling aquatic environment tracking accumulation 1 introduction silver nanoparticles ag nps were widely used in biotechnology medical devices engineering and energy fields due to their unique properties hansen et al 2020 ivask et al 2014 wu et al 2017 however the increased use of ag nps raised concerns about its unexpected accumulation in the environment especially in the aquatic and sewage treatment system li et al 2016 polesel et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 ag nps concentration could reach ng μg l levels gagnon et al 2021 xiao et al 2019 in the aquatic environment and ag nps may exist in a variety of sizes shapes and coatings bertela et al 2021 fiorati et al 2020 maturi et al 2021 prosposito et al 2019 posing a threat to aquatic organisms ivask et al 2014 martin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 many studies confirmed that ag nps caused biological toxicity through oxidative and non oxidative stress mechanisms induced by particles and dissolved ions du et al 2018 dubey et al 2015 gao et al 2021 the biological effects of ag nps could be significantly influenced by surface properties such as surface charge surface functionalization and hydrophobicity ivask et al 2014 wu et al 2017 however due to the ubiquity of nps transformation e g dissolution chlorination sulfidation and complexation in environmental and biological systems malysheva et al 2021 polesel et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the great challenge in simultaneous tracking of nps and ions lead to contradictions in explaining the mechanism of biological effects dubey et al 2015 hendrickson et al 2016 yaqoob et al 2020 limiting further applications of ag nps yaqoob et al 2020 for instance ag could form secondary intracellular nps which confused the interpretation of the external ag nps uptake drobne et al 2018 many tracking techniques were developed to study nps in complex matrices and they could be divided into two categories label free techniques and labeling techniques label free techniques are extraction separation e g field flow fractionation fff methods quantification e g single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms and bioimaging e g hyperspectral stimulated raman scattering microscopy and scattered light imaging deline et al 2018 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 however it remains challenging to distinguish between primary or secondary ag nps or simultaneous quantify nps and ions in biological samples drobne et al 2018 peng et al 2017 various labeled nps were developed to complement existing analytical techniques deline and nason 2019 deline et al 2018 merrifield et al 2017 these rare labeling approaches could help study the transformation bioaccumulation and toxicity of ag nps deline and nason 2019 four main types of labeling were used to enhance the study of the behavior and fate of ag nps fluorescent dyes radioisotopes stable isotopes and core shell labeling core shell labeling is a promising labeling technique for the existing analytical methods the most significant advantage of internal labeling compared to other labeling methods is that it can distinguish ag primary and secondary ag nps wang and wang 2022 in addition internal labeling is more stable and does not affect the surface properties of nps compared to dopant and fluorescent labeling methods deline and nason 2019 yan and wang 2021 encapsulating a stable metal label e g au inside the ag shell which is rare in complicated matrices allowed for analyzing many different mass quantification and particle visualization techniques such as icp ms liang et al 2020b merrifield et al 2017 transmission electron microscopy and hyperspectral imaging deline and nason 2019 the potential application scenarios of au core labeling in environmental and biological matrices were confirmed deline et al 2018 merrifield et al 2017 ponton et al 2019 the au core could be used as an internal standard of ag nps to directly evaluate the behavior of ag nps and ions in environmental and biological systems merrifield et al 2017 ponton et al 2019 the critical points in using au labeling are to provide that the au core cannot affect the physicochemical properties of ag nps and determine the most appropriate application conditions the extent to which au core labeled nps affect the environmental and biological behavior of unlabeled nps is also elusive therefore this study developed au core labeled ag nps as a new tool to study the environmental behavior biological effects and fate of ag nps a group of au labeled unlabeled ag nps with different ag shell thicknesses was synthesized and the physicochemical properties environmental behavior and biological effects of the two kinds of ag nps were comprehensively compared our study indicated that au core labeling could be a promising quantitative method for tracking nps in environmental and biological systems under suitable application conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents

dissolved from different nps was finally calculated according to the standard curve method we analyzed the dissolution kinetics of different nps using the exponential fitting and the maximum dissolved ag was also calculated 2 6 aggregation kinetics tests of nps the influence of au core labeling on the aggregation kinetics of ag nps was analyzed using time resolved dls tests as reported previously

algal growth assays were conducted using a 96 well microplate and modified according to the previous study haire et al 2018 the specific design of the microplate was described in supporting information before exposure c vulgaris in the logarithmic growth phase was centrifugated at 1000 g for 10 min and resuspended in the se medium next 100 μl of the algae suspension was mixed 1 1 by

was used to analyze the significant difference of all the data independent sample t test and one way anova were used to investigate the significant difference between different groups p 0 05 was considered significant linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between different biochemical indicators the linear relationships were reported to be significant if p 0 05 20 and 50 median inhibition values were calculated by the probit method using spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of au core labeling on the physicochemical properties of ag nps all the prepared ag nps and au ag nps were uniformly spherical fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the tem images showed that the core shell nanostructures had been successfully fabricated the scanning transmission electron microscopy stem images fig 1b of au ag nps indicate a bright central area surrounded by a less bright peripheral region suggesting that the au core was covered with ag shells of various thicknesses the elemental mapping also supports the core shell structure consisting of the au core and the ag shell for all au ag nps fig 1c the average diameter of the au core is 20 7 0 7 nm whereas the diameters of the final au agx nps are 25 4 0 3 47 2 1 4 64 3 0 4 and 76 6 1 4 nm fig s2 the thicknesses of the corresponding ag shells are 2 4 13 3 21 8 and 28 0 nm ag nps with similar sizes and surface coatings were also synthesized for investigating the influence of au core labeling the average diameter fig s2 of ag nps is 22 4 1 1 41 3 0 7 63 9 0 9 and 81 8 0 7 nm respectively as shown in fig 1d x ray diffraction xrd patterns further demonstrate the successful synthesis of au ag nps and ag nps all of which have similar crystal structures feng et al 2019 the dls results show that au ag nps and ag nps with the same average diameter exhibit similar hydrodynamic diameters fig 1e furthermore the surface coating onto au ag nps and ag nps was examined by atr and xps no apparent differences in functional groups and c1s binding energy were observed between au ag nps and corresponding ag nps fig s3 and s4 suggesting that the au core nps and ag nps have similar surface coatings the optical properties of au ag nps and ag nps were determined by measuring uv vis absorption spectra fig 1f au ag nps showed two different absorption peaks related to au and ag with an increase in the ag shell thickness the absorption peak of the au core was gradually blue shifted and attenuated and the peak of the ag shell became evident feng et al 2019 in contrast the absorption peaks of ag nps were gradually red shifted with an increase in the ag nps size for au ag 1 nps with the thinnest ag shell ag 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 peaks shift to lower binding energies than ag 1 nps with the same size fig 2 a indicating that the ag shell gains more electrons moreover with an increase in the ag shell thickness ag 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 peaks of au ag nps exhibit no apparent changes compared to the corresponding ag nps the electron compensation of the au core could facilitate electron enrichment in the ag shell consequently the surface oxidation of the ag shell could be inhibited feng et al reported that the proportion of ag2o was reduced significantly with the thinner ag shell according to the xps and xanes analyses feng et al 2019 however the xps results in our study show that all nps exhibit no significant ag oxidation state even for ag nps fig 2a different synthesis methods may cause this difference compared with the previous study feng et al 2019 other methods used sodium citrate as a weak reducing agent to slowly reduce ag under heating conditions here presented a new method a potent reducing agent ascorbic acid has been used to reduce these ions rapidly the whole synthesis process of ag nps accomplishes within 5 min and pvp is added for protection to avoid ag oxidation next the redox properties of different au ag nps and ag nps fig 2b e were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry for nps coated on the working electrode the onset potential is assigned as the energy of the homo and lumo for nps as shown in fig 2f the onset potential of au ag 1 up to 0 30 v was higher than that of ag 1 up to 0 20 v which indicates that au ag 1 is more difficult to oxidize suggesting the electron compensation effect from the au core by increasing the ag shell au ag nps and ag nps exhibit a similar onset potential 0 37 0 4 v it has also been observed that the oxidation peak potential of nps increases with an increase in particle size and au ag nps consistently exhibit a higher oxidation peak potential compared with ag nps with a similar size chen et al chen et al 2019 reported that aggregation of ag nps yielded a higher oxidation peak potential besides the oxidation of the ag shell to ag ions might result in the au core exposure changing the oxidation process which together may explain the higher oxidation potential observed for au ag nps 3 2 influence of au core labeling on the environmental behavior of ag nps the inhibition of ag oxidation by the au core may reduce the dissolution of the ag shell as oxidation constitutes an important part of the dissolution process xiu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the expression for the released ag content has been based on the surface area of nps to display the effect of the au core on the dissolution behavior of nps directly the dissolution of ag nps was significantly higher than that of au ag nps of the same size until the ag shell thickness reached 28 0 nm p 0 05 figs 3 a and 3b furthermore it was worth noting that the dissolution ability of au ag nps increased with the particle size p 0 05 fig 3b indicating a gradual weakening of the compensation effect from the au core the dissolution behavior of au ag nps was beyond our expectation as both cv curves and xps suggest that the au core exhibits no effect on the ag shell when the shell thickness exceeds 13 nm feng et al reported that au ag nps exhibit a similar dissolution ability as ag nps for an ag shell thickness of 10 nm feng et al 2019 they found that the dissolution ratio of their nps in a bronchial epithelial growth medium of 16 was much higher than the corresponding dissolution ratio in the present work of 5 thus it is suggested that the controlling factor in the present experiment may be different compared to feng s work leading to a lower dissolution ratio and a significant difference in the dissolution behavior between au ag nps and ag nps liu et al liu and hurt 2010 suggested the participation of peroxide intermediates during the dissolution of ag nps in ultrapure water the difference between au ag nps and ag nps in the production of intermediate o2 radicals is demonstrated in fig 3d therefore it has been suggested that the change in the ability of the au ag nps to produce reactive oxygen species ros may explain their slower dissolution ag nps may also undergo complex physical transformation after being released into aquatic environments the aggregation behavior of ag nps could be significantly influenced by their physicochemical characteristics and ambient conditions e g ionic strength and composition ph and natural organic matter petosa et al 2010 tang and cheng 2018 as shown in figs 3c and s7 8 au ag nps and ag nps are well dispersed in freshwater at ph 3 6 9 6 with the increase of h ph 1 5 or ca2 concentration au ag nps and most ag nps agglomerated obviously it has been reported that h or ca2 could be strongly adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged nps resulting in charge neutralization and the compression of electric double layers akaighe et al 2013 shih et al 2012 the ccc values of ca2 are 11 and 9 mm for ag 3 nps and ag 4 nps respectively as for ag nps with smaller particle sizes no significant aggregation was detected even for a ca2 concentration of 100 mm in the medium as the ag shell thickness increases the ccc values of au ag nps are 21 20 6 and 6 mm respectively moreover the au core was observed to significantly reduce the ccc values of ca2 for au ag nps the ccc values of ca2 for au ag nps and ag nps gradually approach each other with an increase in the ag shell thickness similarly the hydrodynamic diameter of au ag nps and ag nps under different ph conditions also gradually tends to be the same with an increase in the ag shell thickness the aggregation behavior of nps in freshwater could be analyzed using the dlvo theory two forces between nps electrostatic double layer repulsion and van der waals attraction are mainly accounted for in the dlvo theory handy et al 2008 as previously described the zeta potential of au ag nps was more negative than that of ag nps which might result in more ca2 adsorbed on the surface besides the au core might affect the van der waals forces between nps van der waals forces are dependent on the particle size and the hamaker constant the hamaker constant defines the strength of interactions pinchuk et al reported that the hamaker constant of au was significantly higher than that of ag pinchuk et al 2015 so the van der waals attraction between au ag nps is higher than that of ag nps with the same size with an increase in the ag shell thickness an increased distance between au cores and a decrease in the au atomic ratio lower the differences in van der waals forces between au ag nps and ag nps the ros generation ability of different nps under light conditions was analyzed to evaluate the effect of the au core on the ros generation of ag nps fig 3d superoxide radicals o2 are detected in ag nps and au ag nps solution under irradiation for 30 min it was suggested that o2 could mediate the photo oxidation and reduction processes on the surface of ag nps jones et al 2011 liu and hurt 2010 schmidt et al 2003 the au core exhibited a significant effect on the o2 generation ability of ag nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness the generation ability of au ag nps to produce o2 was higher than that of ag nps several studies reported similar results chang et al 2014 kamimura et al 2017 it was reported that au ag nps showed stronger surface enhanced raman scattering sers and photocatalytic activity due to the stronger localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect chang et al 2014 feng et al 2019 kamimura et al 2017 wang et al 2005 we suggest that the stronger lspr effect enhances the production of o2 by au ag nps 3 3 influence of au core labeling on the biological effects of ag nps as shown in fig s9 the ag au mass ratio in au ag nps exposure groups was close to the ag au mass ratio in au ag nps these results revealed that the uptake of particulate ag played a significant role in the uptake of ag by t thermophila cells wang and wang 2022 this finding was consistent with our previous study liang et al 2020a liang et al 2020b next we studied the effect of au core labeling on the uptake of ag nps by t thermophila cells the accumulation of au ag nps and ag nps was calculated based on the total ag accumulation because the uptake of ag was negligible fig s9 the results fig 4 showed that the au core exhibits no effect on the biological uptake of nps and such effect is independent of the particle size the internalization process of nps is influenced by surface properties such as chemical composition particle size and morphology hydrophobicity surface charge and functionalization angioletti uberti 2017 kennedy et al 2014 murugan et al 2015 compared to au core labeling some labeling methods including fluorescence labeling and dopants would inevitably modulate the surface of metal metal oxide nps which could affect their interactions with ambient substances and cell tissues deline and nason 2019 rodriguez lorenzo et al 2014 for instance yan et al found that the dissolution rate biological uptake and toxicity of emission fluorogen coated ag nps significantly differed from citrate coated ag nps yan and wang 2021 zhang and wang 2019 our results indicate that au core labeling could be well applicable for studying the uptake of ag nps as it would preserve the surface physicochemical properties in addition it should be noted that the aggregation state of nps in the medium was also one of key factors affecting the biological accumulation of nps liang et al 2020a tan et al 2017 as our previous results showed that au core labeling could promote the aggregation of nps fig 3c it is suggested that the exposure concentration of au ag nps should be as low as possible to minimize the adverse effect of aggregation next the au core labeling effect on the toxicity of ag nps was evaluated fig 5 as shown in fig 5a b the effects of ag 1 nps on cell lysosomal membrane damage and mortality are significantly higher than those of au ag 1 nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness the toxicity differences between ag nps and au ag nps with similar sizes become insignificant in particular the toxicity effects of ag nps and au ag nps to t thermophila are not consistent until the ag shell thickness reaches 21 8 nm the uptake results indicate that the au core does not affect the internalization of ag nps fig 4 therefore the differences in the toxicity of ag nps and au ag nps should be induced by the dissolved extent of nps or the particulate effect of au ag nps a previous study has proved that the ag release from the ag nps surface was responsible for the toxicity of ag nps to t thermophila including the released ag in the exposed medium and intracellular environment liang et al 2020a the linear correlation analysis between the dissolution proportion of nps and lysosomal membrane damage cell mortality fig 5c demonstrated a strong correlation confirming this speculation the au core labeling effect on the toxicity of ag nps was further evaluated using c vulgaris due to its critical role in the ecosystem the toxicity results fig 6 a showed that the influence of ag nps on the growth inhibition of c vulgaris is more significantly that of au ag nps with the thinnest ag shell remarkably the toxicity of ag nps decreases with the particle size while the toxicity of au ag nps increases at first and then decreases with the particle size fig 6 numerous studies indicated that the toxicity mechanisms of ag nps included oxidative stress induced by nps and the metal toxicity induced by released ag du et al 2018 gao et al 2021 unlike the toxicity mechanisms of ag nps to t thermophila there is no consistent trend between the dissolution proportion of nps and growth inhibition of c vulgaris fig s10 suggesting that the oxidative stress induced by ag nps may play an important role in the toxicity to algae the esr results fig 3d have indicated that the ability of au ag nps to produce ros is much higher than that of ag nps with an increase in the ag shell thickness excessive ros change the permeability of the cell membrane destroy chloroplasts and inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments inhibiting the intensity of chlorophyll fluorescence fig s11 and the growth of c reinhardtii zhao et al 2021 many studies using labeling methods do not fully compare between labeled and unlabeled nps chowdhury et al 2012 deline and nason 2019 yan et al 2019 although au core labeling used in this study may change the environmental behavior and toxicity of ag nps in some cases it still has significant advantages especially in the evaluation of bioavailability and bioaccumulation in complex scenarios on the one hand au core labeling could distinguish between different forms of nps and released ions which could help solve many controversial problems in the study of the biological fate of nps drobne et al 2018 kuehr et al 2020b for instance the ag au mass ratio in our results fig s9 can be used to estimate the primary uptake way of ag by cells and labeling can easily distinguish the primary and secondary nps by determining the presence of au or not drobne et al 2018 on the other hand au core labeling can help differentiate natural or engineered nps and reduce the background interference because it is almost impossible that environmental and biological matrices to contain au deline and nason 2019 drobne et al 2018 kuehr et al 2020a zeumer et al 2019 the known ti au ratio of the au tio2 nps could be used to determine which portion of the total titanium was attributable to the sample background deline et al 2018 moreover au core labeling can decrease the detection limit of nps for instance the size detection limit of au nps below 20 nm is lower than tio2 nps 30 40 nm using sp icp ms dan et al 2015 kuehr et al 2020c taboada lopez et al 2019 finally the internal labeling is especially appropriate for long term experiments including trophic transfer and chronic toxicity studies in organisms as the au core labeling is not time sensitive deline and nason 2019 deline et al 2018 4 conclusion in general the au core labeling effects on the environmental behavior and biological performance of ag nps were systematically studied for the first time it was found that most of the environmental behavior and biological effects of au ag nps and pristine ag nps gradually converged with an increase in the ag shell thickness furthermore it is worth noting that regardless of the ag shell the au core did not affect the biological uptake of ag nps in t thermophila these results implied that au core labeling could help track the uptake behavior of pristine nps and the toxicity mechanism of nps with au core also remained unchanged although au could influence the toxicity effect considering its significant advantages in complex media au core labeling could be a promising quantitative method for tracking nps in environmental and biological systems credit authorship

transportation pipelines and underground storage tanks put the groundwater a major drinking water resource in arid and semi arid areas su et al 2016 yeh et al 2010 at risk of contamination when accidental leakage of crude oil occurs in the area located above the aquifer the oil hydrocarbons such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex can infiltrate the unsaturated zone to reach the groundwater table sheng et al 2016a 2016b shores et al 2017 posing a severe threat to the local water ecosystems due to the low permeability high hydrophobicity and high ecotoxicity in tandem with the

hydraulic fracturing flowback fluids al ghouti et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 produced water intrusion is primarily due to the hydraulic connectivity caused by hydraulic fracturing between the gas oil formations belowground and the overlying shallow aquifers warner et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 the produced water is typically characterized by high salt content measured as salinity up to 270 000 mg l

et al 2013 li et al 2017a rogers et al 2019 and crude oil contaminated groundwater langille et al 2013 sheng et al 2016a yet the response of the shallow groundwater microbial communities and functions to produced water contamination remains unknown on one hand elevated levels of btex and salinity may directly or indirectly alter the microbial community assembly and metabolic function by affecting the microbe per se or the bioavailability of nutrients for microbial growth liang et al 2011 sheng et al 2021b 2016b yang et al 2018a on the other hand unique microbial communities in produced water

btex degradation is considered efficient under aerobic conditions lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a while under anaerobic conditions e g aquifers the btex degraders have to rely on gaining energy from the terminal electron acceptors including nitrate fe3 mn4 sulfate and or co2 h2 lueders 2017 sheng et al 2016a 2016b in other words the presence and absence of these electron acceptors are key to biodegradation however how denitrifies fe iii reducer sulfate reducer and methanogens mediate these energy processes are not sufficiently studied majone et al 2015 sheng et al 2016a 2016b particularly

spearman correlations were conducted to investigate the relationship between environmental parameters and microbial communities functional genes using canoco 5 0 and r v3 6 3 software respectively because the archaeal targeting primer sometimes detected additional bacterial and eukaryotic sequences we excluded non archaeal taxa in calculating the archaeal composition wei et al 2020 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater groundwater hydrogeochemistry exhibited site specific variations table 1 the lowest orp 118 mv and the highest concentration of btex 30 20 μg l were detected in groundwater in well hsb 1 as btex concentration increased opr approached the minimum 118 mv the tds in groundwater in the north of the study area 2331 0 8312 0 mg l was generally higher than in the south area 783 8 1906 0 mg l with the highest tds in hsb 2 followed by hsb 1 the na ca2 cl nh3 n no2 n fe2 tmn and s2 showed similar higher levels in the north which contrasted to the so4

xylene were rarely detected in addition phenols were detected in hsb 1 and hsb 2 table s2 while other vocs and svocs were barely detected in all samples in summary hsb 1 and hsb 2 had the highest levels of btex contamination notably the lower levels of potential electron acceptors do no3 and so4 2 and higher concentrations of their end products nh3 n no2 n and s2 were also identified in hsb 1 and hsb 2 to investigate whether the shallow groundwater was affected by produced water indicators for the diagnosis of produced water intrusion such as desulfurization coefficient 100rso4 2 rcl coefficient of sodium and chloride rna rcl and coefficient of magnesium and chloride rmg2 rcl were calculated table 2 wang et al 2015 the 100rso4 2 rcl and rna rcl in both hsb 1 and hsb 2 bracketed the ranges of local produced water 0 to 10 1 and 0 16 to 0 6 zhang et al 2017 the values of rmg2 rcl in hsb 1 39 89 and hsb 2 52 28 were apparently higher than other samples also in line with produced water 2 8 to 409 2 the produced water intrusion in hsb 1 and hsb 2 was supported by the highest salinity and btex table 1 although btex was not detected in hs relative to other samples salinity and ion ratios in hs were more comparable to those in hsb 1 and hsb 2 indicating that hs might suffer a low level of produced water contamination considering that only trace amounts of btex and low salinity were detected in lb 1 and lb 2 they were not contaminated by produced water but possibly by aboveground oil leaks hence only rw was determined as a pristine groundwater environment hereafter served as a reference well without contamination 3 2 microbial diversity and community structure of groundwater rarefaction analysis revealed sufficient sequencing depth fig s1 the number of otus shannon indices and chao1 of the bacterial community were higher than the archaeal community table 3 the lowest archaeal alpha diversities were observed in produced water contaminated groundwater hsb

for the highest relative abundance in archaeal community in hsb 1 95 9 hsb 2 96 8 and lb 2 45 1 while thaumarchaeota diapherotrites and euryarchaeota dominated in rw 51 8 lb 1 53 9 and hs 39 6 respectively fig 2d the archaeal classes included woesearchaeia 95 89 in hsb 1 96 39 in hsb 2 25 in other wells nitrososphaeria 0 31 to 51 80 iainarchaeia 0 17 to 53 56 micrarchaeia 0 07 to 25 75 halobacteria 0 83 to 39 26 methanomicrobia 2 10 and nanohaloarchaeia 1 53 fig 2e 3 3 functional gene composition of groundwater microbial communities to explore the energy metabolisms of groundwater microbial communities the relative abundance of genes encoding nitrate reduction sulfate reduction methane metabolism fermentation and benzene toluene degradation were probed fig 3 the annotations of

ammonia dnra narghi napab nirbd and nrfah no3 nh4 and denitrification narghi napab nirks norbc and nosz no3 n2 were shown in fig 3 in rw and hs the abundance of narghi and nirbd were higher than nitrite reductase nirks the key enzyme for denitrification braker et al 2000 similarly the high abundance of napab and nrfah and the low abundance of nirks were detected in hsb 1 consistent with a high no2 n and nh3 n accumulations table 1 in contrast a higher abundance of nirks was observed in hsb 2 lb 1 and lb 2 3 3 2 sulfate reduction the relative abundance of marker genes encoding dissimilatory sulfate reduction so4 2 h2s i e aprab adenylyl sulfate reductase and dsrab dissimilatory sulfite reductase li et al 2017a were detected in all samples with higher abundance in lb 1 and lb 2 fig 3 the abundance of assimilatory sulfate reduction genes so4 2 so3 2 i e cysij sulfite reductase hemoprotein and cysnc bifunctional enzyme were higher in hs and lb 1 than in other samples 3 3 3 methane metabolism the abundance of genes mcr har mvh involved in the methane metabolism was high in hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 3 while was low in the groundwater without produced water contamination e g rw in particular methyl coenzyme m reductase mcrabg the key enzyme in methane metabolism evans et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 reached the highest abundance in hsb 1 in addition the higher abundance of mta and pta acka which catalyze the conversion of methanol to methyl com and acetate to acetyl coa in methylotrophic x ch3 methanogenesis and aceticlastic acetate methanogenesis respectively were identified in the two produced water contaminated samples the fwd gene catalyzing the first step of hydrogenotrophic co2 and h2 methanogenesis was also found but not enriched in hsb 1 and hsb 2 3 3 4 benzene and toluene degradation benzene toluene degradation genes were abundantly observed in hsb 1 hsb 2 lb 1 and hs but rarely identified in the reference well rw fig 3 the dmpklmnop which encodes for phenol toluene 2 monooxygenase nadh was of high abundance in hsb 1 and hs suggesting the aerobic benzene degradation pathway from benzene toluene to catechol lueders 2017 the high abundance of genes bbsabcdefgh lueders 2017 which catalyze methyl to carboxyl conversion on the aromatic ring under anaerobic conditions were found in hsb 2 and lb 1 3 3 5 fermentation the genes involved in acetate fermentation and hydrogen production had the highest abundance in hsb 1 fig 3 the pta acka genes catalyzing acetate production via pta ack pathway castano cerezo et al 2009 were enriched in hsb 1 and hs followed by hsb 2 the hyda fefe hydrogenase was only detected in two produced water contaminated samples hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 3 the genes nuoef encoding nadh quinone oxidoreductase were also abundant in hsb 1 and hsb 2 3 4 relationships between the microbial community compositions functional genes and environmental variables 3 4 1 the impact of environmental variables on microbial community compositions distinct environmental variables shaped the bacterial and archaeal community fig 4 rda results showed that orp 27 6 p 0 05 salinity 26 7 and nh3 n 27 1 were the primary drivers for variations of the bacterial community fig 4a comparably nh3 n 48 4 fe2 42 5 p 0 05 salinity 36 7 and btex 24 3 explained the archaeal community composition fig 4b the bacterial communities did not cluster together fig 4a while the archaeal communities in hsb 1 and hsb 2 were similar fig 4b the salinity tds ca2 cl and na were negatively correlated with the relative abundance of peredibacter sphingopyxis and fimbriiglobus while positively correlated with desulfatiferula desulfomicrobium ruminiclostridium etc collectively salinity exhibited more positive correlations with archaeal communities than bacterial communities potential end products of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction in groundwater i e no2 n nh3 n fe2 and s2 were positively correlated with the relative abundance of ferribacterium and ruminiclostridium fig 4c similarly these variables were also positively correlated with the archaea woesearchaeia and nanohaloarchaeia fig 4d 3 4 2 the impact of environmental variables on functional genes the distribution of nitrate reduction genes was significantly explained by orp 53 0 p 0 05 followed by so4 2 44 1 p 0 05 fig 5 a consistently orp was found to be significantly correlated with the abundance of nasa napab narghi and nrfah fig 5e btex was positively corrected with nrfah in contrast rda showed that no environmental variable significantly explained the variation of sulfate reduction genes fig 5b even so a significant negative linear relationship between btex and cysh phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase so4 2 so3 2 was observed p 0 001 fig 5f in addition so4 2 was positively corrected with cysc adenylylsulfate kinase so4 2 so3 2 for methane metabolism genes orp 58 0 p 0 05 and btex 41 0 p 0 05 were two of the most significant explanatory variables fig 5c similarly btex was positively correlated with the relative abundance of marker genes for methane metabolism i e mcrabg mtra mttc and hdrb2c2 fig 5g to be noted although microbial community structures were similar in hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 2 benzene toluene degradation genes in hsb 1 and hsb 2 did not cluster together fig 5d the no3 so4 2 and hco3 substrates for nitrate reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a had positive correlations with most of the genes involved in benzene toluene degradation fig 5h do was significantly and negatively corrected with bambc benzoyl coa reductase carmona et al 2009 salinity and btex were positively correlated with fermentative genes fig s3 overall salinity showed more significant correlations with the relative abundance of dominant taxa than functional genes 4 discussion 4 1 effects of produced water contamination on bacterial and archaeal communities our results for the first time unravel that produced water contamination significantly altered microbial community and functional gene composition in shallow groundwater the decreased archaeal alpha diversity and more similar archaeal community compositions than bacterial communities in the produced water contaminated samples suggested that archaeal communities were more sensitive to btex and salinity contaminations fig 2b table s3 the chao1 of archaeal communities in hsb 1 and hsb 2 116 8 and 118 6 was in line with those in the aqueous phase of the production fluid 80 to 120 liang et al 2018 which is lower than that in the oil phase li et al 2017b also report that archaeal distribution in petroleum reservoirs is less diverse than bacteria which may result in less community stability sheng et al 2021a past studies have shown that the increase in salinity decreases the diversity of microorganisms kim et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and rates of nitrification nelson et al 2018 carbohydrate metabolism yang et al 2021 and methanogenesis baldwin et al 2006 the more positive effects of salinity on archaeal communities in the current study fig 4d might be due to i the difference in cell wall structures between bacteria and archaea kandler and konig 1998 and ii salinity favor the growth of particular archaea valentine 2007 for instance recently discovered woesearchaeia currently also proposed as ca woesearchaeota hiraoka et al 2020 which were predominant in hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 2e possesses a high salt tolerance huang et al 2021b ortiz alvarez and casamayor 2016 wei et al 2020 the occurrence of woesearchaeia in different biotopes is summarized in table s9 several studies support that the woesearchaeia correlates with salinity consistent with our results huang et al 2021b ortiz alvarez and casamayor 2016 wei et al 2020 nonetheless woesearchaeia was also identified in the low salinity environments table s9 because of the occurrence of woesearchaeia in the reference well rw fig 2e woesearchaeia might be indigenous groundwater microorganisms while they were enriched by produced water contamination btex is considered a strong driving force shaping subsurface microbial community compositions eze et al 2021 huang et al 2021a sheng et al 2016a past studies illustrate that btex contaminations reduce microbial diversity eze 2021 eze et al 2021 griebler and lueders 2009 lee et al 2019 conversely up to 77 51 mg l btex is found to be positively correlated with bacterial diversity huang et al 2021a sheng et al 2016b as such the btex concentration 30 20 μg l in the present study may facilitate the bacterial growth as bioavailable substrates the importance of orp in driving bacterial community fig 4a is likely due to its significant impact on the way microorganisms obtain energy guo et al 2019 such as controlling whether microorganisms degrade btex aerobically or anaerobically lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a this was also evidenced by the negative correlation between orp and btex concentration because nh3 n as an end product of dissimilatory nitrate reduction was accumulated in produced water contaminated samples table 1 the high explanation of nh3 n in microbial communities might result from the enrichment of nitrate dependent btex degrading microbes fig 3 in addition to the driving forces of salinity and btex intrusion of exogenous microorganisms by produced water can be another possibility for the variation of microbial community diversity and compositions however although woesearchaeia is found in deep petroleum reservoirs liu et al 2021 produced water in shengli oilfield shandong china 0 02 and 0 2 zhou et al 2019b and oilfield of jingsu china 0 1 and 3 9 li et al 2017a their abundance was relatively low table s9 additionally methanogenic archaea such as methanobacteria liu et al 2020 and methanomicrobia 2 1 in hsb 1 xiang et al 2017 are found in the produced water and petroleum reservoir liang et al 2018 shelton et al 2016 thus produced water intrusion might possibly carry a few exogenous microorganisms to the shallow groundwater liang et al 2018 magot et al 2000 while they were then enriched in shallow groundwater 4 2 effects of produced water on functional genes and identification of btex degrading bacteria the lower concentrations of potential electron acceptors do no3 and so4 2 and accumulation of the end products of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction nh3 n no2 n fe ii and s2 in groundwater contaminated by produced water indicated that the btex degradation could link to these processes rojas et al 2021 table 1 both the aerobic and anaerobic benzene toluene degradation genes were found in groundwater although hsb 2 contained more anaerobic benzene toluene degradation genes and hsb 1 contained more aerobic benzene toluene degradation genes fig 3 the enrichment of btex degradation genes has been found to be directly linked to the enrichment of corresponding degrading bacteria hidalgo et al 2020 since the strictly anaerobic microbes in produced water likely mix with the indigenous microbes in shallow groundwater during intrusion aerobic anaerobic and facultative microbial communities may all be observed aburto et al 2009 jeevanandam et al 2012 nitrate reduction and btex degradation are often coupled dou et al 2008 many nitrate reducers have been reported to degrade btex not only anaerobically but aerobically lovley 1997 such as pseudomonas mosqueda and ramos 2000 a difference in nitrate reduction genes between hsb 1 dnra and hsb 2 denitrification was similar to a low dissolved inorganic carbon dic petroleum contaminated aquifer cai et al 2019 the difference in btex and doc concentrations was a potential reason denitrification is more likely to occur than dnra when nitrate supply is higher than organic carbon kelso et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 consistent with the situation in hsb 2 the opposite situation occurred in hsb 1 where dnra was more likely to happen than denitrification with limitation of nitrate supply kelso et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 in addition both denitrification and dnra are sensitive to the redox conditions rivett et al 2008 coincidence with the high explanation of orp for the nitrate reducing genes fig 5a a series of laboratory cultivation and in situ experiment studies confirmed that after long term domestication of btex anaerobic fe iii dependent btex degrading microorganisms are gradually enriched including geobacter sp 0 03 1 00 coates et al 2001 and ferribacterium sp 0 01 1 5 cummings et al 1999 geobacter sp which was relatively abundant in hsb 1 can degrade btex completely till co2 and water coupling with the dissimilatory fe iii reduction hidalgo et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 ferribacterium sp which was positively correlated with fe ii and btex concentrations and relatively abundant in hsb 2 is able to oxidize benzoate and formate under dissimilatory fe iii reducing condition cummings et al 1999 hence we posited that geobacter and ferribacterium acted as fe iii dependent btex degraders the effect of btex concentration on both dissimilatory and assimilatory sulfate reduction genes was not straightforward consistent with hidalgo et al 2020 and cai et al 2019 nonetheless sulfate reducing bacteria were still found including desulfatiferula and desulfomicrobium in hsb 1 and hsb 2 both of which can decompose complex organic hydrocarbons hakil et al 2014 wang et al 2013 in addition the members of actinobacteria 0 34 6 0 e g rhodococcus sp 0 03 0 68 are widely found at petroleum contaminated sites hidalgo et al 2020 sheng et al 2016a rhodococcus sp is capable of mineralizing btex feng et al 2021 li et al 2020 and is largely enriched in a sulfate reducing environment koronelli et al 2002 clostridia zoogloea sp hydrogenophaga sp and arcobacter sp were other putative btex degraders fowler et al 2014 nitz et al 2020 the highest abundance of acetate fermentative genes and hydrogen production genes including fefe hydrogenases and nuoef genes known to be critical for fermentation in other organisms in the two produced water contaminated samples suggested a potential fermentative process fig 3 because woesearchaeia harbors these fermentative genes it is considered anaerobic fermentative heterotrophs huang et al 2021b more importantly the significant positive correlation between btex and methane metabolism genes including mcrabg and genes coding for the aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis highlighted that the btex degraders had intimate associations with methanogens using acetate hydrogen and methanol as substrates fig 5c consistent with the previous studies showing that fermentation and methane metabolism are often found in oil hydrocarbon contaminated environments yang et al 2018a 2018b 4 3 integrating inferred bacterial and archaeal synergies in groundwater contaminated by produced water syntrophic biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants through hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea is commonly found in methanogenic environment borrel 2021 gieg et al 2014 sieber et al 2012 based on the geochemical evidence i e the accumulation of end product of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction in produced water contaminated groundwater and metagenomic evidence i e the enrichment of btex degrading fermentative and methane metabolism genes our results suggested a metabolic mutualism among different functional members played a significant role in coupled carbon nitrogen sulfur and iron biogeochemical cycles fig 6 both complete and incomplete degradations of btex have been found in aquifers meckenstock et al 2015b it can therefore be postulated that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such are nitrate dependent fe iii dependent sulfate dependent btex degrading bacteria are decomposing and or have decomposed btex to co2 and water and or more bioavailable organic molecules e g pyruvate and other organic acids that were excreted to facilitate microbial syntropy sieber et al 2012 woesearchaeia and other fermenters might use some of those molecules to produce acetate and hydrogen castelle et al 2015 huang et al 2021b the benzene degrading bacteria such as clostridia can also degrade benzene to acetate and hydrogen gieg et al 2014 herrmann et al 2010 kunapuli et al 2007 then methanogens including methanomicrobia likely use hydrogen and co2 acetate and methanol for methane metabolism liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2017 this was evidenced by a significant correlation p 0 001 between woesearchaeia methanogens and some oil degrading bacteria fig s4 consistently the co occurrence network analyzed by zhou et al 2019a showed that woesearchaeia had positively associated with methanobacterium methanogens moreover woesearchaeia tends to be the co indicator lineage of methanogens and biochemically function as a partner with methanogens e g methanomicrobia liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2017 in addition the direct interspecies electron transfer was also possible between geobacter and methanogens aulenta et al 2021 the precise mechanisms governing these syntrophic pathways remain to be elucidated through a combined geochemical stable isotopic probing dna protein stable isotopic probing and omics strategy e g metatranscriptomics and single cell genomics 5 conclusions our study extends previous observations of microbial compositional and functional traits in btex or salinity contaminated groundwater to those in salinity and btex co contaminated groundwater by produced water the archaeal diversity and community exhibit stronger relevance to the btex and salinity than the bacteria salinity has more impact on the community structure but less impact on the functional genes the positive correlation between methane metabolism genes and btex indicated a potential increase in the methanogenic environment with the decrease of other terminal electron acceptors woesearchaeia which was highly enriched in btex and salinity contaminated groundwater may cooperate with btex degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea to couple btex degradation with methanogenesis these results provide theoretical support for groundwater bioresource management in a long term oil and gas extraction area

16184,intrusion of salinity and petroleum hydrocarbons e g benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex into shallow groundwater by so called produced water the water associated with oil and gas production has recently drawn much attention however how this co contamination affects the groundwater microbial community remains unknown herein geochemical methods e g ion ratios and high throughput sequencing amplicon and shotgun metagenomic were used to study the contaminant source hydrogeochemical conditions microbial community and function in salinity and btex co contaminated shallow groundwater in an oil field northwest china the desulfurization coefficient 100rso4 2 rcl coefficient of sodium and chloride rna rcl and coefficient of magnesium and chloride rmg2 rcl revealed an intrusion of produced water into groundwater resulting in elevated levels of salinity and btex the consumption of terminal electron acceptors e g no3 fe3 and so4 2 was likely coupled with btex degradation relative to the bacteria decreased archaeal diversity and enriched community in produced water contaminated groundwater suggested that archaea were more susceptible to elevated btex and salinity relative to the nitrate and sulfate reduction genes the abundance of marker genes encoding fermentation acetate and hydrogen production and methanogenesis aceticlastic and methylotrophic was more proportional to btex concentration the produced water intrusion significantly enriched the salt tolerant anaerobic fermentative heterotroph woesearchaeia in shallow groundwater and its co occurrence with btex degrading bacteria and methanogen methanomicrobia suggested mutualistic interactions among the archaeal and bacterial communities to couple btex degradation with fermentation and

to produced water contamination remains unknown on one hand elevated levels of btex and salinity may directly or indirectly alter the microbial community assembly and metabolic function by affecting

btex degradation is considered efficient under aerobic conditions lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a while under anaerobic conditions e g aquifers the btex degraders have to rely on gaining energy from the terminal electron acceptors including nitrate fe3 mn4 sulfate and or co2 h2 lueders 2017 sheng et al 2016a 2016b in other words the presence and absence of these electron acceptors are key to biodegradation however how denitrifies fe iii reducer sulfate reducer and methanogens mediate these energy processes are not sufficiently studied majone et al 2015 sheng et al 2016a 2016b particularly

exploration areas the working pump units were built before 1970s over 300 m belowground drilling depths and a natural gas plant with an area of approximately 0 8 km2 were found on site totally six wells near the oil pump units were selected fig 1 with shallow groundwater buried depths ranging between 15 and 30 m the hsb 1 and hsb 2 wells had been abandoned and others are now pumping for irrigation the names of wells were defined according to contamination levels 2 2 groundwater sampling and in situ measurements six groundwater samples were collected from six wells in october 2019

spearman correlations were conducted to investigate the relationship between environmental parameters and microbial communities functional genes using canoco 5 0 and r v3 6 3 software respectively because the archaeal targeting primer sometimes detected additional bacterial and eukaryotic sequences we excluded non archaeal taxa in calculating the archaeal composition wei et al 2020 3 results 3

levels of btex contamination notably the lower levels of potential electron acceptors do no3 and so4 2 and higher concentrations of their end products nh3 n no2 n and s2 were also identified in hsb 1

coefficient of sodium and chloride rna rcl and coefficient of magnesium and chloride rmg2 rcl were calculated table 2 wang et al 2015 the 100rso4 2 rcl and rna rcl in both hsb 1 and hsb 2 bracketed the ranges of local produced water 0 to 10 1 and 0 16 to 0 6 zhang et al 2017 the values of rmg2 rcl in hsb 1 39 89 and hsb 2 52 28 were apparently higher than other samples also in line with produced water 2 8 to 409 2 the produced water intrusion in hsb 1 and hsb 2 was supported by the highest salinity and btex table 1 although btex was not detected in hs relative to other samples salinity and ion ratios in hs were more comparable to those in hsb 1 and hsb 2 indicating that hs might suffer a low level of produced water contamination considering that only trace amounts of btex and low salinity were detected in lb 1 and lb 2 they were not contaminated by produced water but possibly by aboveground oil leaks hence only rw was determined as a pristine groundwater environment hereafter

shannon indices and chao1 of the bacterial community were higher than the archaeal community table 3 the lowest archaeal alpha diversities were observed in produced water contaminated groundwater hsb

for the highest relative abundance in archaeal community in hsb 1 95 9 hsb 2 96 8 and lb 2 45 1 while thaumarchaeota diapherotrites and euryarchaeota dominated in rw 51 8 lb 1 53 9 and hs 39 6 respectively fig 2d the archaeal classes included woesearchaeia 95 89 in hsb 1 96 39 in hsb 2 25 in other wells nitrososphaeria 0 31 to 51 80 iainarchaeia 0 17 to 53 56 micrarchaeia 0 07 to 25 75

nitrite reductase nirks the key enzyme for denitrification braker et al 2000 similarly the high abundance of napab and nrfah and the low abundance of nirks were detected in hsb 1 consistent with a high no2 n and nh3 n accumulations table 1 in contrast a higher abundance of nirks was observed in hsb 2 lb 1 and lb 2 3 3 2 sulfate reduction the relative abundance of marker genes encoding dissimilatory sulfate reduction so4 2 h2s i e aprab adenylyl sulfate reductase and dsrab dissimilatory sulfite reductase li et al 2017a were detected in all samples with higher abundance in lb 1 and

genes bbsabcdefgh lueders 2017 which catalyze methyl to carboxyl conversion on the aromatic ring under anaerobic conditions were found in hsb 2 and lb 1 3 3 5 fermentation the genes involved in acetate fermentation and hydrogen production had the highest abundance in hsb 1 fig 3 the pta acka genes catalyzing acetate production via pta ack pathway castano cerezo et al 2009 were enriched in hsb 1 and hs followed by hsb 2 the hyda fefe hydrogenase was only detected in two produced water contaminated samples hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 3 the genes nuoef encoding nadh quinone oxidoreductase were also abundant in hsb 1 and hsb 2 3 4 relationships between the microbial community compositions functional genes and environmental variables 3 4 1 the impact of environmental variables on microbial community compositions distinct environmental variables shaped the bacterial and archaeal community fig 4 rda results showed that orp 27 6 p 0 05 salinity 26 7 and nh3 n 27 1 were the primary drivers for variations of the bacterial community fig 4a comparably nh3 n 48 4 fe2 42 5 p 0 05 salinity 36 7 and btex 24 3 explained the archaeal community composition fig 4b the bacterial communities did not cluster together fig 4a while the archaeal communities in hsb 1 and hsb 2 were similar fig 4b the salinity tds ca2 cl and na were negatively correlated with the relative abundance of peredibacter sphingopyxis and fimbriiglobus while positively correlated with desulfatiferula desulfomicrobium ruminiclostridium etc collectively salinity exhibited more positive correlations with archaeal communities than bacterial communities potential end products of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction in groundwater i e no2 n nh3 n fe2 and s2 were positively correlated with the relative abundance of ferribacterium and ruminiclostridium fig 4c similarly these variables were also positively correlated with the archaea woesearchaeia and nanohaloarchaeia fig 4d 3 4 2 the impact of environmental variables on functional genes the distribution of nitrate reduction genes was significantly explained by orp 53 0 p 0 05 followed by so4 2 44 1 p 0 05 fig 5 a consistently orp was found to be significantly correlated with the abundance of nasa napab narghi and nrfah fig 5e btex was positively corrected with nrfah in contrast rda showed that no environmental variable significantly explained the variation of sulfate reduction genes fig 5b even so a significant negative linear relationship between btex and cysh phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase so4 2 so3 2 was observed p 0 001 fig 5f in addition so4 2 was positively corrected with cysc adenylylsulfate kinase so4 2 so3 2 for methane metabolism genes orp 58 0 p 0 05 and btex 41 0 p 0 05 were two of the most significant explanatory variables fig 5c similarly btex was positively correlated with the relative abundance of marker genes for methane metabolism i e mcrabg mtra mttc and hdrb2c2 fig 5g to be noted although microbial community structures were similar in hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 2 benzene toluene degradation genes in hsb 1 and hsb 2 did not cluster together fig 5d the no3 so4 2 and hco3 substrates for nitrate reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a had positive correlations with most of the genes involved in benzene toluene degradation fig 5h do was significantly and negatively corrected with bambc benzoyl coa reductase carmona et al 2009 salinity and btex were positively correlated with fermentative genes fig s3 overall salinity showed more significant correlations with the relative abundance of dominant taxa than functional genes 4 discussion 4 1 effects of produced water contamination on bacterial and archaeal communities our results for the first time unravel that produced water contamination significantly altered microbial community and functional gene composition in shallow groundwater the decreased archaeal alpha diversity and more similar archaeal community compositions than bacterial communities in the produced water contaminated samples suggested that archaeal communities were more sensitive to btex and salinity contaminations fig 2b table s3 the chao1 of archaeal communities in hsb 1 and hsb 2 116 8 and 118 6 was in line with those in the aqueous phase of the production fluid 80 to 120 liang et al 2018 which is lower than that in the oil phase li et al 2017b also report that archaeal distribution in petroleum reservoirs is less diverse than bacteria which may result in less community stability sheng et al 2021a past studies have shown that the increase in salinity decreases the diversity of microorganisms kim et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and rates of nitrification nelson et al 2018 carbohydrate metabolism yang et al 2021 and methanogenesis baldwin et al 2006 the more positive effects of salinity on archaeal communities in the current study fig 4d might be due to i the difference in cell wall structures between bacteria and archaea kandler and konig 1998 and ii salinity favor the growth of particular archaea valentine 2007 for instance recently discovered woesearchaeia currently also proposed as ca woesearchaeota hiraoka et al 2020 which were predominant in hsb 1 and hsb 2 fig 2e possesses a high salt tolerance huang et al 2021b ortiz alvarez and casamayor 2016 wei et al 2020 the occurrence of woesearchaeia in different biotopes is summarized in table s9 several studies support that the woesearchaeia correlates with salinity consistent with our results huang et al 2021b ortiz alvarez and casamayor 2016 wei et al 2020 nonetheless woesearchaeia was also identified in the low salinity environments table s9 because of the occurrence of woesearchaeia in the reference well rw fig 2e woesearchaeia might be indigenous groundwater microorganisms while they were enriched by produced water contamination btex is considered a strong driving force shaping subsurface microbial community compositions eze et al 2021 huang et al 2021a sheng et al 2016a past studies illustrate that btex contaminations reduce microbial diversity eze 2021 eze et al 2021 griebler and lueders 2009 lee et al 2019 conversely up to 77 51 mg l btex is found to be positively correlated with bacterial diversity huang et al 2021a sheng et al 2016b as such the btex concentration 30 20 μg l in the present study may facilitate the bacterial growth as bioavailable substrates the importance of orp in driving bacterial community fig 4a is likely due to its significant impact on the way microorganisms obtain energy guo et al 2019 such as controlling whether microorganisms degrade btex aerobically or anaerobically lueders 2017 meckenstock et al 2015a this was also evidenced by the negative correlation between orp and btex concentration because nh3 n as an end product of dissimilatory nitrate reduction was accumulated in produced water contaminated samples table 1 the high explanation of nh3 n in microbial communities might result from the enrichment of nitrate dependent btex degrading microbes fig 3 in addition to the driving forces of salinity and btex intrusion of exogenous microorganisms by produced water can be another possibility for the variation of microbial community diversity and compositions however although woesearchaeia is found in deep petroleum reservoirs liu et al 2021 produced water in shengli oilfield shandong china 0 02 and 0 2 zhou et al 2019b and oilfield of jingsu china 0 1 and 3 9 li et al 2017a their abundance was relatively low table s9 additionally methanogenic archaea such as methanobacteria liu et al 2020 and methanomicrobia 2 1 in hsb 1 xiang et al 2017 are found in the produced water and petroleum reservoir liang et al 2018 shelton et al 2016 thus produced water intrusion might possibly carry a few exogenous microorganisms to the shallow groundwater liang et al 2018 magot et al 2000 while they were then enriched in shallow groundwater 4 2 effects of produced water on functional genes and identification of btex degrading bacteria the lower concentrations of potential electron acceptors do no3 and so4 2 and accumulation of the end products of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction nh3 n no2 n fe ii and s2 in groundwater contaminated by produced water indicated that the btex degradation could link to these processes rojas et al 2021 table 1 both the aerobic and anaerobic benzene toluene degradation genes were found in groundwater although hsb 2 contained more anaerobic benzene toluene degradation genes and hsb 1 contained more aerobic benzene toluene degradation genes fig 3 the enrichment of btex degradation genes has been found to be directly linked to the enrichment of corresponding degrading bacteria hidalgo et al 2020 since the strictly anaerobic microbes in produced water likely mix with the indigenous microbes in shallow groundwater during intrusion aerobic anaerobic and facultative microbial communities may all be observed aburto et al 2009 jeevanandam et al 2012 nitrate reduction and btex degradation are often coupled dou et al 2008 many nitrate reducers have been reported to degrade btex not only anaerobically but aerobically lovley 1997 such as pseudomonas mosqueda and ramos 2000 a difference in nitrate reduction genes between hsb 1 dnra and hsb 2 denitrification was similar to a low dissolved inorganic carbon dic petroleum contaminated aquifer cai et al 2019 the difference in btex and doc concentrations was a potential reason denitrification is more likely to occur than dnra when nitrate supply is higher than organic carbon kelso et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 consistent with the situation in hsb 2 the opposite situation occurred in hsb 1 where dnra was more likely to happen than denitrification with limitation of nitrate supply kelso et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 in addition both denitrification and dnra are sensitive to the redox conditions rivett et al 2008 coincidence with the high explanation of orp for the nitrate reducing genes fig 5a a series of laboratory cultivation and in situ experiment studies confirmed that after long term domestication of btex anaerobic fe iii dependent btex degrading microorganisms are gradually enriched including geobacter sp 0 03 1 00 coates et al 2001 and ferribacterium sp 0 01 1 5 cummings et al 1999 geobacter sp which was relatively abundant in hsb 1 can degrade btex completely till co2 and water coupling with the dissimilatory fe iii reduction hidalgo et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 ferribacterium sp which was positively correlated with fe ii and btex concentrations and relatively abundant in hsb 2 is able to oxidize benzoate and formate under dissimilatory fe iii reducing condition cummings et al 1999 hence we posited that geobacter and ferribacterium acted as fe iii dependent btex degraders the effect of btex concentration on both dissimilatory and assimilatory sulfate reduction genes was not straightforward consistent with hidalgo et al 2020 and cai et al 2019 nonetheless sulfate reducing bacteria were still found including desulfatiferula and desulfomicrobium in hsb 1 and hsb 2 both of which can decompose complex organic hydrocarbons hakil et al 2014 wang et al 2013 in addition the members of actinobacteria 0 34 6 0 e g rhodococcus sp 0 03 0 68 are widely found at petroleum contaminated sites hidalgo et al 2020 sheng et al 2016a rhodococcus sp is capable of mineralizing btex feng et al 2021 li et al 2020 and is largely enriched in a sulfate reducing environment koronelli et al 2002 clostridia zoogloea sp hydrogenophaga sp and arcobacter sp were other putative btex degraders fowler et al 2014 nitz et al 2020 the highest abundance of acetate fermentative genes and hydrogen production genes including fefe hydrogenases and nuoef genes known to be critical for fermentation in other organisms in the two produced water contaminated samples suggested a potential fermentative process fig 3 because woesearchaeia harbors these fermentative genes it is considered anaerobic fermentative heterotrophs huang et al 2021b more importantly the significant positive correlation between btex and methane metabolism genes including mcrabg and genes coding for the aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis highlighted that the btex degraders had intimate associations with methanogens using acetate hydrogen and methanol as substrates fig 5c consistent with the previous studies showing that fermentation and methane metabolism are often found in oil hydrocarbon contaminated environments yang et al 2018a 2018b 4 3 integrating inferred bacterial and archaeal synergies in groundwater contaminated by produced water syntrophic biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants through hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea is commonly found in methanogenic environment borrel 2021 gieg et al 2014 sieber et al 2012 based on the geochemical evidence i e the accumulation of end product of nitrate reduction fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction in produced water contaminated groundwater and metagenomic evidence i e the enrichment of btex degrading fermentative and methane metabolism genes our results suggested a metabolic mutualism among different functional members played a significant role in coupled carbon nitrogen sulfur and iron biogeochemical cycles fig 6 both complete and incomplete degradations of btex have been found in aquifers meckenstock et al 2015b it can therefore be postulated that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such are nitrate dependent fe iii dependent sulfate dependent btex degrading bacteria are decomposing and or have decomposed btex to co2 and water and or more bioavailable organic molecules e g pyruvate and other organic acids that were excreted to facilitate microbial syntropy sieber et al 2012 woesearchaeia and other fermenters might use some of those molecules to produce acetate and hydrogen castelle et al 2015 huang et al 2021b the benzene degrading bacteria such as clostridia can also degrade benzene to acetate and hydrogen gieg et al 2014 herrmann et al 2010 kunapuli et al 2007 then methanogens including methanomicrobia likely use hydrogen and co2 acetate and methanol for methane metabolism liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2017 this was evidenced by a significant correlation p 0 001 between woesearchaeia methanogens and some oil degrading bacteria fig s4 consistently the co occurrence network analyzed by zhou et al 2019a showed that woesearchaeia had positively associated with methanobacterium methanogens moreover woesearchaeia tends to be the co indicator lineage of methanogens and biochemically function as a partner with methanogens e g methanomicrobia liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2017 in addition the direct interspecies electron transfer was also possible between geobacter and methanogens aulenta et al 2021 the precise mechanisms governing these syntrophic pathways remain to be elucidated through a combined geochemical stable isotopic probing dna protein stable isotopic probing and omics strategy e g metatranscriptomics and single cell genomics 5 conclusions our study extends previous observations of microbial compositional and functional traits in btex or salinity contaminated groundwater to those in salinity and btex co contaminated groundwater by produced water the archaeal diversity and community exhibit stronger relevance to the btex and salinity than the bacteria salinity has more impact on the community structure but less impact on the functional genes the positive correlation between methane metabolism genes and btex indicated a potential increase in the methanogenic environment with the decrease of other terminal electron acceptors woesearchaeia which was highly enriched in btex and salinity contaminated groundwater may cooperate with btex degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea to couple btex degradation with methanogenesis these results provide theoretical support for groundwater bioresource management in a long term oil and gas extraction area
