3275,suspended sediment and nutrients following forest management activities or wildfires are transported to streams and lakes via surface runoff and are a major threat to water quality land and water managers resort to hydrologic models to test hypotheses that can help them make informed decisions to minimize disturbances and protect water resources we present applications of an online interface weppcloud for the water erosion prediction project wepp model as a pre and post disturbance management tool to model various gauged and ungauged forested watersheds throughout the western u s we compare simulated streamflow sediment and phosphorus to observations at usgs gauging stations and assess the accuracy of the online interface with minimal or no calibration specifically we present modeling results from 28 relatively undisturbed forested watersheds in the states of california nevada oregon washington and idaho across all watersheds the nses based on the daily streamflow values were in the range of 0 43 to 0 64 indicating satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed values similarly annual average nse for sediment yield was 0 61 while for phosphorus it was 0 75 0 71 and 0 66 for total particulate and soluble reactive phosphorus respectively additionally we demonstrate the utility of the weppcloud interface as a tool to compare model results for ungauged watersheds from various disturbed conditions including prescribed fire thinning and wildfire to undisturbed model results to better understand the effects of forest management and wildfires on water quality and quantity keywords decision support tools weppcloud gauged ungauged watersheds soil erosion forest management phosphorous sediment yield 1 introduction consequences of fire suppression and climate change on wildfire risks and forest health have been extensively researched in recent years and there is a consensus among scientists and managers that fuel treatments specifically mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are necessary to restore forest structure and to decrease wildfire risks collins et al 2017 graham et al 2010 higuera and abatzoglou 2021 kolden 2019 krofcheck et al 2018 miller et al 2005 miller et al 2010 weisberg 2004 most forest disturbances will result in partial or total removal of the over and under story vegetation and decrease soil ground cover which in turn will decrease snow interception forest evapotranspiration and soil hydraulic conductivity and increase soil erodibility among many other effects on soil properties elliot 2013 srivastava et al 2018 these changes will cause an increase in streamflow peaks neary et al 2003 niemeyer et al 2020 and soil erosion elliot 2013 srivastava et al 2018 especially in the first year following disturbance and will return to pre disturbance conditions as the vegetation recovers usually within five years following the disturbance elliot 2013 robichaud et al 2007 land and water managers are now faced with complex management decisions compounded by increased pressure on natural resources due to population growth wildfires and climate change decision support tools are software or information systems developed to aid managers in the decision process this is accomplished by including the best available scientific knowledge into tools that are accessible easy to use and that require minimal training to support management decisions the weppcloud interface lew et al 2022 is such a decision support tool developed to facilitate hydrologic model runs with the water erosion prediction project wepp watershed model flanagan and livingston 1995 flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan et al 2007 flanagan et al 2012 and to help land managers assess the effects of forest management treatments and wildfire on runoff sediment and phosphorus yield at hillslope and watershed scale the wepp model is a process based hydrology and erosion model based on the fundamentals of infiltration theory hydrology soil physics plant science hydraulics and erosion mechanics flanagan and nearing 1995 a detailed description of the modeled processes is provided in flanagan and nearing 1995 as well as in other papers describing recent improvements to the model specifically for forested applications dun et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 brooks et al 2016 miller et al 2011 miller et al 2019 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2015 a summary of these processes as well as more detailed information on the weppcloud interface can be found in lew et al 2022 part i of this two part manuscript the weppcloud interface has two major advantages compared to the wepp model besides the online applicability and the easiness of the model runs first weppcloud includes a baseflow component similar to srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 which is a major hydrologic process important in modeling larger watersheds and second weppcloud incorporates simplistic algorithms that allow users to simulate pollutant e g phosphorus transport based on known concentrations of the respective pollutant in surface runoff lateral flow baseflow and attached to sediment lew et al 2022 forests are considered sinks for nutrients rather than sources and therefore are not impacted by the major fertilizer management as with agricultural soils piatek and allen 2001 miller et al 2005 however wildfire disturbances and management activities such as timber harvest site preparation road construction and maintenance have the potential to increase nutrient concentration in streams through increased runoff and soil erosion deval et al 2021 gravelle et al 2009 ice and binkley 2003 streamflow from undisturbed watersheds with old forest cover can generate large nutrient concentrations binkley 2001 therefore incorporating capabilities to simulate water quality pollutants into decision support tools is critical for forest management weppcloud automatically builds input files for the wepp model based on publicly available national databases model outputs are generated in both tabular and gis formats that are easy to interpret by users the wepp model requires four main input files for each hillslope and channel topography soil management and weather topography or slope structure is extracted from a 10 or 30 m dem using the topaz topographic parameterization program garbrecht and martz 1997 model the topaz model is also used to delineate a watershed in hillslopes and channels based on a critical source area csa and a minimal channel length mcl selected by the user soil files are created by automatically extracting the necessary soil properties from the high resolution ssurgo sss nrcs reybold and teselle 1989 database with the additional ability to extract soil properties from the coarser resolution state soil geographic statsgo schwartz and alexander 1995 databases for regions where ssurgo data are missing pre built management files for various current land use e g forest shrub rangeland etc are assigned to each hillslope based on the 2016 usgs national land cover database nlcd dewitz 2019 proposed land managements can be selected by the user from a dropdown list of pre defined management files e g forest thinned low severity fire prescribed fire etc lastly daily weather files can be created from various climate options including a stochastically generated weather file using the climate generator cligen weather generator model nicks et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 interpolated historical weather from grid based daymet thornton et al 2016 or gridmet abatzoglou 2013 databases and future climate scenarios downscaled from coupled model intercomparison project general circulation model 5 cmip5 gcm models abatzoglou and brown 2012 a single storm event can also be specified by the user in the 1990s and early 2000s a significant effort was invested by the usda forest service rocky mountain research station rmrs to determine soil hydraulic conductivity and rill and interrill erodibility values for both undisturbed and disturbed forested conditions elliot and hall 1997 elliot 2004 elliot and robichaud 2010 moffet et al 2007 robichaud et al 2007 robichaud et al 2010 2016a robichaud et al 2016b wagenbrenner et al 2010 these studies found that the land cover had more influence on soil erodibility properties than texture management specific soil properties measured in those studies and in other more recent studies elliot et al 2013 robichaud et al 2016a also found that soil depth was another important property the results of the rmrs studies relating erodibility to land cover and four soil textural categories have been merged with the nrcs ssurgo and statsgo reybold and teselle 1989 databases to generate wepp input files with rmrs erodibility values and nrcs soil profile properties lew et al 2022 this merged database is part of the weppcloud interface and is the basis for evaluating the impacts of wildfire and forest management activities on soil erosion the database can be easily modified should new data become available or expanded to include results from future studies in this paper we assess the ability of the weppcloud interface to adequately represent the hydrologic response to management in forested ecosystems across the western u s and summarize the strengths and challenges of the use of weppcloud to guide land and water management decisions in data poor environments specifically we demonstrate model performance when applied to simulate surface runoff sediment and phosphorus yield under current conditions in selected case study watersheds with no or minimal calibration and discuss sensitive calibrating parameters when applied to various geographic regions in the western u s we focus on phosphorus as a pollutant in this manuscript as it is a nutrient found in streams in both adsorbed and dissolved form and therefore is well suited to demonstrate the pollutant loading capabilities with weppcloud but also because it is a nutrient of interest for managers for our test watersheds and there were long term usgs data available for model parameterization and assessment we demonstrate that when key topographic weather soils and vegetative properties are well represented the wepp model can be successfully used in management applications especially when a quick assessment of a study area is desired we also demonstrate how the interface can be further parameterized for pre and post wildfire management scenarios testing in ungauged watersheds we will not discuss specific model results from the management scenarios testing here rather we will describe the methodology for running such simulations with the weppcloud interface lastly we discuss the current limitations of the weppcloud interface and the challenges in applying process based models for directing management applications the paper is presented in two parts part i model description lew et al 2022 and part ii model performance assessment and applications to forest management and wildfires this paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites for this study we selected 28 forested watersheds in the western u s fig 1 table 1 representing a wide range of physiographic conditions these watersheds are involved in unique ongoing land and water management decision making where stakeholders are interested in the potential benefits of applying geospatial hydrologic modeling to assess the impacts of alternative forest management or natural disturbance on water quantity and quality the modeling included comparing the effects of proposed forest treatments and wildfires on sediment and phosphorus yield lake tahoe basin california nevada understanding the risks associated with wildfires to drinking water supply watersheds bull run watershed oregon cedar river and taylor creek washington and evaluating the effects of forest treatments such as thinning clear cutting and broadcast burning on water quantity and quality mica creek experimental watershed mcew idaho lake tahoe is an alpine lake situated in the sierra nevada mountain range and is known for its lake clarity fig 1a the basin is comprised of 63 watersheds that drain directly into the lake and two thirds of these watersheds are located in california while the rest are in nevada climate is wet in the winters and dry in the summers with mean annual precipitations of 1400 mm yr 1 in the west and 670 mm yr 1 near the lake in the east side of the basin coats et al 2016 table 1 most of the precipitation falls as snow between november and april the basin is moderately to densely vegetated consisting of mixed coniferous forests that are actively managed through thinning and prescribed fire operations soils are derived from volcanic parent material in the northern and northwestern part of the basin and granitic parent material in the rest of the basin the bull run watershed is located on the western side of the cascade mountain range and since 1895 has been the primary water supply watershed for the city of portland oregon fig 1b the mean annual air temperature in bull run is 10 ⁰c usda fs u s department of agriculture forest service 1997 and the overall climate is maritime with wet cold winters and dry cool summers the annual average precipitation is 3500 mm and approximately 70 of the annual precipitation occurs between november and april pwb portland water bureau 2003 table 1 most of the precipitation in the catchment falls as rain pwb portland water bureau 2003 the vegetation is comprised of densely mixed coniferous forests that have been under strict protection since 1996 the soils are derived from columbia river basalt and andesite mixed with volcanic ash and are predominantly deep and well drained gravelly loam and silty loam snyder and brownwell 1996 burns et al 2015 found that 21 and 15 of the watershed is highly susceptible to shallow and deep landslides respectively the upper cedar river and taylor creek are located in the cascade mountain range and are two of the three municipal water supply watersheds for the city of seattle washington fig 1c the climate in these two watersheds is wet and mild with annual average precipitation of more than 2500 mm most of the precipitation occurring from november to april srivastava et al 2017 table 1 soils in cedar river are loamy sand and gravely sandy loam srivastava et al 2017 and the vegetation is comprised of old growth and second growth coniferous forest the mcew is located in northern idaho in the northern rockies and is part of a long term paired and nested catchment study designed by the potlach deltic corporation lewiston idaho to assess the direct and cumulative impacts of forest management practices on water quantity and quality deval et al 2021 hubbart et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 srivastava et al 2020 fig 1d for our study we selected two watersheds from the mcew study that were assigned as undisturbed reference watersheds from 1990 2007 namely ws3 and ws6 the annual average temperature at mcew is 5 ⁰c and the annual average precipitation is 450 mm yr 1 with more than 70 of all precipitation falling as snow from november to may table 1 vegetation is comprised of a naturally regenerated second growth mixed coniferous forest of approximately 90 100 years old soils are predominantly deep silt loam weathered from schist gneiss granitic and quartzite bedrock 2 2 model setup we used the weppcloud interface to automatically delineate watersheds prepare the input data and run the wepp model all watersheds were discretized into hillslopes and channels internally with the topaz model using a 30 m usgs national elevation dataset ned except for the smaller mcew watersheds where a 10 m resolution was used weppcloud is designed to access via python modules that reside on the interface locally stored databases or to access freely available national databases to create all input files required by wepp including the topography soils management and weather files at the centroid of each hillslope and channel since our goal was to run the model with minimal calibration it was imperative that the input data and local hydrologic conditions were well represented therefore where available we supplemented the weppcloud interface database with additional information from other databases or previous hydrologic studies soil input files were assigned to each hillslope from the 1 12000 scale ssurgo database except for the bull run watershed where ssurgo soils were missing in the lower half of the watershed the missing soils were assigned based on a local soil survey map developed by the forest service as presented in the 1997 bull run watershed analysis brwa usda fs u s department of agriculture forest service 1997 the brwa database includes similar soil mapping units as ssurgo and provides fundamental information on soil texture and basic topographic attributes however it does not include all soil parameters required by wepp we assigned the remaining soil attributes by matching similar ssurgo and brwa map units based on similarities in soil name texture and slope and then uploaded the newly created map into the weppcloud interface the management parameter files were assigned to each hillslope by the weppcloud interface based on the default 2016 national land cover database nlcd categories e g forest shrubs grass etc for the bull run watershed we replaced the default nlcd map with a map provided by the portland water bureau which was generated from landsat based on the gradient nearest neighbor gnn method ohmann and gregory 2002 a weppcloud equivalent nlcd management parameter file was assigned to each gnn map class wepp weather files were created automatically from two available options on the weppcloud interface for watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we used the daymet option while for all other watersheds we selected the gridmet option with prism revisions the daymet option is at 1 km spatial resolution and generated weather files based on daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature for each hillslope based on a cubic interpolation at the centroid of the hillslopes the gridmet with prism revision option generated a weather file based on daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature wind speed and direction for the centroid of the watershed the gridmet dataset has a course 4 km grid while prism has a higher resolution of 800 m the prism revisions option in weppcloud is used to distribute daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature with elevation similar to brooks et al 2016 all other weather data required by the model including precipitation characteristics duration of storm time to peak intensity and peak intensity dew point temperature solar radiation wind speed and direction were stochastically generated within weppcloud with cligen v5 3 2 nicks et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 frankenberger 2021 from the nearest ncdc long term historic weather data the weather files were built for the time period that matched the streamflow and water quality data available at the outlet of the modeled watersheds table 1 2 3 model calibration and performance assessment the minimal calibration that was conducted on these watersheds followed a simple manual stepwise calibration process boyle et al 2000 this is consistent with the approach in brooks et al 2016 and will be a typical approach adopted by most users of the weppcloud tool it is possible to fully calibrate the key model parameters using parameter estimation pest doherty 2005 after downloading weppcloud projects to a desktop computer however we did not adopt this approach in this study as it was not an appropriate assessment of the predictive capabilities of the model and may not necessarily provide increased understanding based on equifinality issues beven 2001 moreover most land and water managers will have limited skills and time to perform advanced model calibrations therefore the goal of the model calibration was to identify the most sensitive calibrating parameters that would produce acceptable results in all modeled watersheds to calibrate the model we ran the weppcloud interface with default parameters and downloaded all the model runs including all the input and output data with the wepppy win bootstrap lew 2021 this is a freely available python package developed to allow advanced users to download modify and run weppcloud projects locally on windows computers we first calibrated daily streamflow and total water yield as described below and then calibrated key parameters related to sediment and phosphorus yield model performance was assessed for each watershed simulation by utilizing a variety of publicly available usgs data sources daily streamflow data measured at usgs gauging stations daily streamflow data recorded with flumes flow weighted annual loads of sediment and phosphorus processed in previous studies and flow weighted monthly concentrations of phosphorus model performance efficiency was assessed using several goodness of fit statistics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 these indices were calculated with the hydrogof r package zambrano bigiarini 2020 2 3 1 streamflow and water yield streamflow calibration was performed using only the linear baseflow recession coefficient kb the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology ksub and the rain snow temperature threshold t rain snow the kb coefficient represents the fixed proportion of the total water stored in a dynamic groundwater reservoir that provides baseflow to the stream on any given day and typically varies between 0 01 d 1 and 0 1 d 1 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2014 brooks et al 2016 determined that the observed streamflow recessions on the western side of lake tahoe could be represented by a linear reservoir coefficient kb of 0 04 d 1 however due to a complex hydrogeology of the east side of the lake tahoe basin attributed to large geologic faults and high permeability rates nolan and hill 1991 the authors proposed that additional deep seepage losses of groundwater were occurring and suggested that the rate of groundwater loss from the reservoir could be quantified by calibrating a second deep seepage reservoir coefficient ks for groundwater lost from the system for our simulations we assigned a default kb value of 0 04 d 1 to all modeled watersheds except to the watersheds from the mcew where we assigned a value of 0 02 d 1 based on srivastava et al 2020 and to those from the east side of lake tahoe basin where we followed the brooks et al 2016 approach the ksub values for the subsurface geology in the lake tahoe basin were based on default weppcloud values and for the soils in the mcew they were set to 0 02 mm h 1 based on srivastava et al 2020 for watersheds in the bull run watershed we manually calibrated ksub based on a combination of the bedrock geology specifically the distribution of the rhododendron layer trimble 1963 and a map of shallow landslide susceptibility burns et al 2015 of three classes low medium and high based on the assumption that regions most highly susceptible to landslides would have poorer subsurface drainage into the underlying bedrock the t rain snow is the threshold temperature at which wepp partitions precipitation between rain and snow srivastava et al 2017 the default value in wepp is 0 c and no calibration of this parameter was necessary for the watersheds in lake tahoe california and nevada which we simulated with weather files based on the daymet climate database in contrast the t rain snow was calibrated to 2 c for watersheds in oregon washington and idaho where the gridmet climate database was used daily streamflow observations were measured at usgs gauging stations at all watersheds except at two watersheds in the mcew where they were recorded with large h flumes more information on the equipment used to collect the mcew data can be found in hubbart et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 and srivastava et al 2020 for the streamflow model performance assessment we used a maximum of 25 years 1990 2014 of observed daily streamflow data in the watersheds from the lake tahoe basin 39 years 1980 2018 of observed daily streamflow data measured at seven stream gauges in the bull run and at the cedar river and taylor creek watersheds and 18 years 1990 2007 of observed daily streamflow data measured with flumes at the two undisturbed watersheds from the mcew table 1 2 3 2 sediment yield the wepp model can simulate soil erosion from hillslopes and channels soil deposition within the hillslope and channel profile and sediment yield at the watershed outlet the most important calibrating variables for simulating soil erosion are effective hydraulic conductivity rill and interrill erodibilities hillslope critical shear percent ground cover and channel bed critical shear stress τc nearing et al 1990 for hillslopes these parameters were set by default in the weppcloud interface based on previous field observations in forest soils of various textures lew et al 2022 similarly for channel erosion srivastava et al 2020 demonstrated good agreement between observed and model simulations in the mcew by varying only the channel τc the authors found a direct relationship between wepp calibrated τc and the median particle size d50 and suggested that pebble count data can be used to parametrize the channel τc in forested watersheds for the watersheds in the mcew we used τc values recommended by srivastava et al 2020 in the lake tahoe watersheds pebble count data were available at few locations which were provided by the land managers from the lake tahoe basin we calculated the d50 from the observed pebble count data and identified the channel bed critical shear stress equivalent following berenbrock and tranmer 2008 observations of event based suspended sediment concentrations ssc were available at the usgs gauging stations for all watersheds in the lake tahoe basin and the two flumes in mcew additionally for watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we also had available flow weighted annual loads of ssc estimated in a previous study in the basin by coats et al 2016 the authors estimated and compared annual loads from several regression equations after correcting the sources of bias in the usgs water quality database 2 3 3 phosphorus yield simulated phosphorus yield in weppcloud is based on simple static phosphorus concentrations in each of the three components of the streamflow hydrograph surface runoff subsurface lateral flow and baseflow and particulate phosphorus concentration on the delivered sediment due to data limitations at most other watersheds these static concentrations were calculated only for the lake tahoe watersheds based on long term observed streamflow usgs code 00060 discharge ft3 s 1 and event based total phosphorus tp concentrations usgs code 00665 phosphorus water unfiltered mg l 1p soluble reactive phosphorus srp usgs code 00671 orthophosphate water filtered mg l 1p ssc usgs code 80154 suspended sediment concentration mg l 1 and streamflow usgs code 00061 discharge instantaneous ft3 s 1 measured at the usgs stream gauging stations and bias corrected by coats et al 2016 particulate phosphorus pp mg l 1 is not typically measured at the usgs stream gauging stations and was calculated by subtracting srp from tp since these observations were event based we calculated the flow adjusted daily concentrations with the load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 model which is a usgs model used to derive relationships between event based streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations based on eleven pre defined regression equations for each watershed we ran the loadest model with an automated regression model selection on 1 january 1997 and 31 december 2005 a few watersheds on the western side of the lake tahoe experienced significant rain on snow events that caused record peak streamflow events for example blackwood creek usgs code 10336660 recorded 83 m3 s 1 247 mm in 1997 and 64 m3 s 1 191 mm in 2005 peak streamflow therefore when using the entire data record generated bias model results we ran seasonally piecewise loadest models for all years except for wy 1997 and wy 2006 and then separately for years wy 1997 and wy 2006 gao et al 2018 found that the seasonally piecewise method performed better than the year round method in estimating monthly nitrogen loads static phosphorus concentrations needed as input to the weppcloud interface were further calculated from the flow weighted concentrations for each watershed we assumed the phosphorus concentrations in the surface runoff are typical of the streamflow srp concentrations mg l 1 during spring snowmelt months april and may and that the phosphorus concentrations in the baseflow are typical of the streamflow srp concentrations mg l 1 in the fall september and october for the phosphorus concentrations in lateral flow we averaged the srp streamflow concentrations mg l 1 for the remaining months we calculated the particulate phosphorus concentrations adsorbed to sediments with equation 1 1 psediment tp s r p ssc 10 6 where psediment pp is the particulate phosphorus concentration mg kg 1 calculated for may which is the month with the highest runoff and ssc we used the phosphorus concentrations determined from the observed data as initial input to the model and further calibrated these values to match simulated values with observed annual average flow adjusted loads of tp srp and pp 2 4 model parameterization for management scenario testing to demonstrate weppcloud s ability to assess the impact of various management and wildfire scenarios we selected as a case study the lake tahoe basin where land managers are considering increasing the use of forest thinning and prescribed fires to reduce wildfire risks specifically managers were interested in exploring the benefits of expanding fuel management into remote forested areas and estimating the tradeoffs in long term sediment yield between fuel management and wildfire for this analysis we modeled upland erosion for 11 management scenarios or conditions including current conditions do nothing three thinning scenarios with 96 92 and 85 ground cover post thinning one prescribed fire scenario and erosion following three different wildfire severity low moderate and high scenarios the management parameters used to simulate these treatments are provided in table s2 in supplementary material thinning was only allowed on forested hillslopes while prescribed fires or wildfires were also allowed to occur on areas covered by shrubs the lake tahoe basin is comprised of 63 watersheds that drain directly into the lake but only 17 watersheds have water quality observations for calibration the kb and ks channel τc and phosphorus concentrations in surface runoff subsurface lateral flow baseflow and sediment for the calibrated watershed runs were distributed to uncalibrated watersheds across the basin based on the watershed s similarities parent material and proximity all simulations were performed using python batch processing scripts that generate weppcloud compatible projects and results were further compiled in tabular data files and gis data files in the current version of the weppcloud interface users can perform similar scenario testing for only individual watersheds however future interface developments will allow select users to perform similar batch hydrologic modeling for multiple watersheds and scenarios at the same time 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance assessment 3 1 1 streamflow and water yield assessment the wepp model via the weppcloud interface was applied to several western u s watersheds of varying sizes with a wide variety of climatic and physiographic settings exhibiting distinct runoff regimes the overall goodness of fit statistics for the wepp simulated and observed daily streamflow comparisons for the watersheds indicate reasonable results table 2 across the watersheds nses based on daily streamflow values were in the range of 0 43 to 0 64 indicating satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed values table 2 the only exception was the logan house creek watershed lh1 located on the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin with an nse of 0 09 signifying poor model performance brooks et al 2016 reported similar results for the lh1 watershed which the authors attributed to water loss through fractures in the bedrock the wepp model was not able to simulate this complex hydrogeology without additional calibration positive kge values in the range of 0 39 to 0 79 table 2 suggest reasonable model performance when considering mean flow as a kge estimation criterion pbias within 13 across all watersheds indicated slight over and under prediction of streamflow table 2 the wepp model captured runoff regimes across all watersheds reasonably well and the simulated annual trends of water yield were similar to the trends of observed yield figs 2 and 3 and figs s4 and s5 in supplementary material compared to daily streamflow monthly and annual goodness of fit statistics showed improved model performance for all watersheds table 2 while the streamflow and water yield assessment provided good evidence that the weppcloud interface can accurately represent the hydrology of distinct geographic regions many water resources management issues require an understanding of a watershed s streamflow regime and the impacts of forest management on peak flows e g for protecting culverts and roads daily peak flows were overestimated in most watersheds except in the watersheds from the western side of lake tahoe figs s1 s3 in supplementary material using a similar modeling approach as automated on the weppcloud interface brooks et al 2016 and srivastava et al 2017 2020 reported that the discrepancies between the modeled and observed peak hydrograph could be arising from inaccuracies in wepp s snow accumulation and melt processes currently wepp partitions precipitation into rain and snow using a single threshold approach usace u s army corps of engineers 1956 research on snow hydrology suggests a double threshold approach in partitioning precipitation is more appropriate to better represent snow accumulation and melt processes dai 2008 another potential source of daily peak flow overestimation may be that within the wepp code there is a flag that sets the infiltration rate to zero for the day if the soil is saturated at the end of the previous day s water balance this suggests that if there are several rainy days in succession the runoff of the second or third wet day could be overestimated due to saturation excess runoff miller et al 2011 found that the flag for the infiltration rate in the wepp code resulted in overestimation of runoff and erosion from only the wettest climates in the pacific nw but did not appear to affect results elsewhere in the western u s nevertheless uncalibrated model results in this study suggest that the weppcloud interface can satisfactorily represent the hydrology of distinct geographic regions and that water resources managers could apply the interface to ungauged watersheds for forest management decisions future efforts to improve hydrologic simulations with the weppcloud interface are underway to improve the snow hydrology routines in wepp a linear groundwater reservoir with a default kb of 0 04 d 1 was appropriate to model low summer streamflow in most watersheds of this study except in the drier watersheds on the east side of lake tahoe basin and in the watersheds at mcew for the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin the initial model results showed overestimations in water yield similar results were reported by brooks et al 2016 in logan house lh1 and glenbrook creek gc1 watersheds located on the eastern portion of the lake tahoe basin in their study the authors used a secondary reservoir to simulate water yield by allowing groundwater loss through hydrogeological fractures and therefore bypassing the usgs stream gauge in this study the addition of a second aquifer reservoir in nine watersheds located in the ne e and se of the lake tahoe basin improved water yield simulations supporting the hypothesis that these watersheds could be characterized by complex hydrogeology hyne et al 1972 for mcew watersheds a single linear reservoir with a default value of 0 02 d 1 as suggested by srivastava et al 2020 was appropriate to simulate streamflow calibrated kb and ks for all watersheds are shown in table 3 sánchez murillo et al 2015 demonstrated that in the inland pacific northwest the baseflow recession coefficients depend on several climatic and terrain attributes including the geologic substrate results and recommendations from sánchez murillo et al 2015 work will be incorporated in future versions of the weppcloud interface to further reduce the data parameterization required from users for watersheds in the bull run catchment we manually calibrated the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive bedrock ksub based on maps of the rhododendron geologic layer trimble 1963 and landslide susceptibility burns et al 2015 of three classes low medium and high specifically we assumed the ksub was highest 0 5 mm h 1 where landslide susceptibility was the lowest and low 0 005 mm h 1 where landslide susceptibility was the highest for the moderate landslide susceptibility we assigned a middle value of 0 05 mm h 1 since the rhododendron layer in these watersheds is associated with landslides and bank erosion rinella 1987 peterson et al 1995 we assigned it the lowest ksub value 0 0001 mm h 1 the ksub for the soils in cedar river and taylor creek watersheds were calibrated to 0 05 mm h 1 and 0 15 mm h 1 respectively while for the two watersheds in mcew we used a value of 0 02 mm h 1 as suggested by srivastava et al 2020 for all the watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we used ksub values of the restrictive layer as reported in the ssurgo database t rain snow threshold was calibrated in the model to 2 c for watersheds where the gridmet climate database was used the gridmet product utilizes the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell et al 2004 for temporal daily data and the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 for spatial interpolation at 4 km resolution the daymet product uses the global historical climatology network ghcn for temporal daily data and is spatially interpolated at 1 km resolution our results suggest that the use of different climate products of varying spatial resolution in conjunction with wepp could potentially influence snow accumulation melt processes and thereby hydrologic modeling a detailed investigation of the impact of using different climate products with wepp is recommended to guide users in selecting appropriate climate products for hydrologic simulations 3 1 2 sediment load overall we were able to estimate the magnitudes of annual average sediment load in watersheds from both the lake tahoe basin and mcew fig 4 table 4 observed annual average sediment loads in the lake tahoe basin generally varied between the west and the east side and from watershed to watershed eastern watersheds generated considerably less sediment compared to watersheds from the western side of the basin observed annual average sediment loads ranged from 5 mg yr 1 at logan house creek lh1 to 2852 mg yr 1 from blackwood creek bc1 this difference is mainly due to differences in area and precipitation since the lh1 watershed received less than half of the precipitation recorded in the bc1 657 mm yr 1 precipitation in lh1 compared to 1476 mm yr 1 recorded in bc1 table 1 other watershed characteristics such as watershed soils geology and vegetation likely contributed to the difference in sediment loads between the two watersheds albeit to a lesser extent model results showed an underestimation of annual sediment loads at three watersheds on the western side of the lake tahoe basin namely at blackwood creek bc1 ward creek wc8 and general creek gc1 figs 4 and 5 the main reason for this underestimation was the observed sediment delivery associated with a few high peak flow events from 1 and 2 january 1997 wy 1997 and on 31 december 2005 wy 2006 which were not captured by the model these high peak flow rates were caused by rain on snow events that are often observed in the mid winter in pacific northwest marks et al 2001 and in watersheds in the sierra nevada mountains kattelmann 1997 mccabe et al 2007 in the lake tahoe basin the 1997 event was considered a 100 year flood event tetra tech 2007 which caused peak suspended sediment loads with return periods ranging from 40 to 60 years only in streams from the western side of the lake tahoe basin simon et al 2004 brooks et al 2016 demonstrated that the wepp model can accurately simulate the 1997 high peak flow in the upper truckee river utr5 when scaling the weather data across the watershed based on data from a lower elevation snotel station which recorded a slightly different rain distribution for the day since most of the sediment is delivered during these high peak flow events an accurate representation of weather data is essential to model such events another potential source of underestimation of sediment load by wepp may be sediment delivery from landslides as the wepp model does not consider mass wasting sources of sediment there is some evidence of mass wasting particularly in the steeper upland portions of the blackwood creek bc1 watershed gavigan 2007 additional sediment during peak flows may also be from channel erosion processes not fully addressed by the wepp model like side sloughing during channel drawdown following flood flows that would have saturated the stream banks simon et al 2009 the goodness of fit statistics based on annual sediment loads for all simulated years show that wepp predictions were in reasonable agreement with observed data except for wc8 bc1 and gc1 watersheds table 4 results for the three watersheds improved substantially when the water years with high peak flow events 1997 and 2006 were omitted from the analysis for example nse kge and pbias for watershed bc1 improved from 0 05 to 0 63 0 15 to 0 48 and 60 to 7 respectively we manually calibrated the τc in the lake tahoe watersheds to match the simulated to observed annual sediment loads at the watershed outlets assuming minimal upland erosion these values ranged from 10 n m 2 in the blackwood creek watershed to 180 n m 2 in the headwaters of the upper truckee river utr5 watershed table 3 lower values of the τc are associated with smaller d50 particle size srivastava et al 2020 and therefore higher soil erodibility for channel beds conversely higher values of τc are associated with larger d50 particle sizes and result in lower erodibility values indeed the blackwood creek watershed is known in the lake tahoe basin as the top contributor of sediment yield to the lake and has been the subject of several channel restoration efforts norman et al 2014 oehrli 2013 the headwater portion of the upper truckee river watershed is characterized by rock outcrops of low infiltration rates and erodibilities brooks et al 2016 which can be an explanation for the higher τc calibrated by the model median pebble count data d50 was available for two of the modeled watersheds in the lake tahoe basin and τc equivalents for these two watersheds approximately matched the calibrated values τc calibrated blackwood creek mainstream d50 42 τc 26 τc calibrated 10 ward creek d50 68 τc 54 τc calibrated 30 3 1 3 phosphorus yield the magnitudes of all three phosphorus constituents simulated by the wepp model were in close agreement with the observed across all watersheds fig 6 a and 6b and fig s7 in the supplementary material the goodness of fit statistics based on annual values for watersheds in lake tahoe were very good for all three phosphorus constituents table 5 tp nse 0 75 kge 0 71 pbias 0 5 pp nse 0 71 kge 0 70 pbias 1 3 and srp nse 0 66 kge 0 66 pbias 4 6 table 5 the simulated annual loads of tp pp and srp followed the trends of observed load figs 7 and s8 and s9 in supplementary material which is expected since pp is the major form of phosphorus transport in streams from lake tahoe hatch et al 2001 therefore similar to the sediment load the tp and pp load for the three watersheds wc8 bc1 and gc1 that experienced the rain on snow events in wy 1997 and 2006 were also underestimated fig 6a simulated annual srp load was better captured by the model except in logan house lh1 where the model underestimated the observed loads pbias 95 table 5 however it is worth noting that the difference between the observed and simulated phosphorus load for this watershed is insignificant 1 5 kg yr 1 the simplistic coefficient based phosphorus algorithms implemented in the weppcloud interface were sufficient to capture the general trends of annual phosphorus loads associated with surface runoff subsurface lateral flow baseflow and sediment in our study watersheds figs 6 and 7 most process based phosphorus models use complex processes involving mineralization decomposition and immobilization pools and their interaction among them for phosphorus transport computations hydrologic simulations with such algorithms may improve the spatial and temporal estimates of phosphorus for watershed simulation studies a version of the wepp model with a water quality module is under development personal communication d c flanagan and would likely be available for the evaluation of nutrient transport in forest settings in a future version of weppcloud in watersheds from the lake tahoe basin p concentration values in surface runoff inferred from the observed data varied between 0 0028 mg l 1 in general creek gc1 to 0 013 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 the lateral flow and baseflow p concentrations were higher than those in the runoff and ranged between 0 026 mg l 1 in logan house lh1 to 0 0153 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 for lateral flow and from 0 0024 mg l 1 in logan house lh1 to 0 0228 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 for baseflow respectively in general these values were lower in watersheds located on the western side and higher in those from the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin the observed p concentrations in the sediments varied between 840 mg kg 1 in third creek th1 to 4397 mg kg 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 similarly as with the streamflow p concentrations sediment p concentrations varied among watersheds with lower values in watersheds on the northern western and southern sides of the basin and higher values in watersheds from the eastern side of the basin table 6 the significant difference in p concentration in runoff and sediment between watersheds on the west and east sides of lake tahoe respectively is likely due to differences in the parent material specifically watersheds located on the nw and w of lake tahoe are mainly underlying volcanic soils with poorly crystalline iron and aluminum oxides that retain p and limit the p movement in water heron et al 2021 watersheds on the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin however are developed mainly on granitic parent material with greater potential for p mobilization to streamflow heron et al 2021 we found a strong linear relationship r2 0 93 between the p runoff concentrations values determined from the observed data and the calibrated values in watersheds from lake tahoe fig 8 similarly the p concentration values in the sediment determined from observed data were linearly related to the calibrated values r2 0 75 the dissolved p concentrations in lateral flow and baseflow however were only linearly related to the calibrated values from wepp for watersheds with a second aquifer reservoir r2 0 94 for lateral flow r2 0 86 for baseflow and not for watersheds with a single reservoir r2 0 05 for lateral flow r2 0 08 for baseflow the poor agreement between observed and calibrated p concentrations for both lateral flow and baseflow for the watersheds with a single reservoir is a surprising result we were expecting this mismatch for watersheds that were calibrated with a second aquifer as those watersheds are believed to have complex hydrogeology and lose water either to a second reservoir through fractures or to areas outside of the basin brooks et al 2016 and therefore the observed p concentrations at the watershed outlets would be smaller further investigation is required to understand how the complex groundwater system is contributing to inconsistencies in the analysis of p concentrations in all stream locations across the lake tahoe the observed dissolved p concentrations were very low 0 020 mg l 1 and even using a single constant dissolved p concentration in runoff lateral flow and baseflow produced similar annual p loading results at watersheds with both single and double aquifers data not shown 3 2 management scenario testing the model calibration for 17 watersheds in the lake tahoe basin allowed us to identify the minimum number of critical calibrating parameters in the model to confidently simulate streamflow and sediment and phosphorus yield model results suggested that most of the calibrated parameters are fairly consistent across each ecosystem where a calibrated value in one watershed is also reasonable for a neighboring watershed in the same ecosystem for example eight watersheds in the western side of the basin were calibrated with a single linear reservoir aquifer and a baseflow recession coefficient of 0 04 day 1 conversely all watersheds located ne e and se were calibrated with a second linear reservoir and various deep seepage coefficients these similarities among watersheds allowed us to apply the calibrated values to model the rest of the ungauged watersheds within the basin regional differences were also observed for the channel critical shear and phosphorus concentrations which were similarly distributed across the basin the supplementary material contains maps of the groundwater baseflow and seepage coefficients critical shear and phosphorus concentrations for all watersheds in the basin figs s10 s11 s12 weppcloud simulated output can be downloaded as tables and gis shapefiles and managers can use this information to compare runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yields from individual hillslopes and watersheds https wepp cloud weppcloud lt for example maps of sediment yield output suggest that under undisturbed conditions there are erosion hot spots within several watersheds in the basin e g blackwood creek ward creek the upland portion of the upper truckee river and third creek and that sediment yield from these areas tends to increase with disturbance severity fig 9 another observation with great implications for management is that for the eastern watersheds the model simulated minimal to no erosion even after a wildfire 1 kg ha 1 two of the eastern watersheds have been identified in previous research studies as sinks rather than sources of sediments mainly due to their small size and low precipitation and runoff rates simon et al 2004 this finding could be useful for managers that are seeking to prioritize areas for treatment in the basin previous research in the basin suggested that high peak flows associated with rain on snow events e g year 1997 can flush stored sediment from the stream channels and reduce the sediment load in the following years simon et al 2004 since forest disturbances have the potential to increase peak flows grant et al 2008 we could expect rill and interrill erodibilities and the channel critical shear to change immediately post disturbance however without clear guidelines from the available literature we were unable to parameterize the weppcloud interface to reflect these complex changes within the channel streambed post disturbance similarly forest treatments and wildfire have the potential to increase p concentrations in forested ecosystems mainly through increases in soil erosion and increased availability of ash that has an elevated p concentration santín et al 2018 however studies have found little effects from thinning deval et al 2021 or from a combination of thinning and prescribed fires on p delivery kaye et al 2005 martin and harr 1989 since forest wildfires especially those that result in high soil burn severity affect soil properties there is more evidence that p concentrations post wildfire increase lane et al 2008 murphy et al 2006 santín et al 2018 smith et al 2011 however because this information is limited in the research literature we did not attempt to include in the model any temporal changes in phosphorus concentrations with treatment moreover even if such changes were implemented we lacked post disturbance phosphorus observations at the modeled watersheds to validate model results 3 3 advantages and limitations the weppcloud interface overcomes several challenges that users faced in the past when applying the wepp model to forested watersheds major advantages and limitations of the weppcloud interface for forest applications are presented in table 7 4 summary and conclusion for many years the application of complex hydrologic models for land management was limited to trained hydrologists and modelers with extensive knowledge of computer programming and data manipulation transferability of knowledge from the modeler to the manager was slow and oftentimes hindered by managers limited accessibility to the actual model for further scenario testing or model parameterization with additional observed data increased accessibility to national databases via web applications is now facilitating the development of online decision support tools such as weppcloud that provide managers with more flexibility in modeling and interpreting results to better understand watershed processes and to evaluate the effects of forest management actions on water resources in the current study we demonstrated that the weppcloud interface can successfully simulate general trends in streamflow sediment and phosphorus in watersheds with different physiographic settings with minimal calibration additionally we demonstrated the applicability of the interface to various forest fuel treatments and wildfire scenarios which can provide land and water resources managers with site specific information of the spot areas in their watersheds to control soil erosion and phosphorus transport with forest management practices the minimal calibration performed in this study involved manual alterations of calibrating parameters that are not easily found in national databases i e kb ksub τc p concentrations however previous research and the current study demonstrate that at least some of these parameters could be inferred from geology kb or could be determined from observed data at nearby watersheds kb τc p concentrations future applications of the interface to watersheds located in different ecoregions of u s will help with the identification of regional calibrating parameters that could improve model simulations there is also a need to improve the wepp model hydrologic routines to improve peak flow estimation in wet climates perhaps the most obvious limitation to any hydrologic model is an accurate representation of the weather patterns or climatic conditions specifically precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature despite performing simulations with the best available spatially distributed climate datasets our results show that we are still not able to accurately capture extreme peak flow events which are needed in many management applications however increased access to remotely sensed data and the tendency to improve the spatial resolution of such observations such as radar should provide evidence that we are getting closer to providing accurate hydrologic simulations in ungauged basins in near real time although there will most certainly be needs and opportunities in the future to reduce uncertainty in geospatial model predictions the technology incorporated within weppcloud provides managers with a comprehensive physically based hydrologic tool developed based on the most accurate readily available geospatial and climatic data weppcloud results provide managers with long term historic or future hillslope and watershed specific simulated streamflow sediment and nutrient outputs in the manner of minutes with a large forestry and wildfire management database parameterized with the latest region specific scientifically defensible experimental studies and a user friendly interface capable of storing multiple scenario runs weppcloud has great potential to be a useful decision support tool for many forestry management applications credit authorship contribution

3275,suspended sediment and nutrients following forest management activities or wildfires are transported to streams and lakes via surface runoff and are a major threat to water quality land and water managers resort to hydrologic models to test hypotheses that can help them make informed decisions to minimize disturbances and protect water resources we present applications of an online interface weppcloud for the water erosion prediction project wepp model as a pre and post disturbance management tool to model various gauged and ungauged forested watersheds throughout the western u s we compare simulated streamflow sediment and phosphorus to observations at usgs gauging stations and assess the accuracy of the online interface with minimal or no calibration specifically we present modeling results from 28 relatively undisturbed forested watersheds in the states of california nevada oregon washington and idaho across all watersheds the nses based on the daily streamflow values were in the range of 0 43 to 0 64 indicating satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed values similarly annual average nse for sediment yield was 0 61 while for phosphorus it was 0 75 0 71 and 0 66 for total particulate and soluble reactive phosphorus respectively additionally we demonstrate the utility of the weppcloud interface as a tool to compare model results for ungauged watersheds from various disturbed conditions including prescribed fire thinning and wildfire to undisturbed model results to better understand the effects of forest management and wildfires on water quality and quantity keywords decision support tools weppcloud gauged ungauged watersheds soil erosion forest management phosphorous sediment yield 1 introduction consequences of fire suppression and climate change on wildfire risks and forest health have been extensively researched in recent years and there is a consensus among scientists and managers that fuel treatments specifically mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are necessary to restore forest structure and to decrease wildfire risks collins et al 2017 graham et al 2010 higuera and abatzoglou 2021 kolden 2019 krofcheck et al 2018 miller et al 2005 miller et al 2010 weisberg 2004 most forest disturbances will result in partial or total removal of the over and under story vegetation and decrease soil ground cover which in turn will decrease snow interception forest evapotranspiration and soil hydraulic conductivity and increase soil erodibility among many other effects on soil properties elliot 2013 srivastava et al 2018 these changes will cause an increase in streamflow peaks neary et al 2003 niemeyer et al 2020 and soil erosion elliot 2013 srivastava et al 2018 especially in the first year following disturbance and will return to pre disturbance conditions as the vegetation recovers usually within five years following the disturbance elliot 2013 robichaud et al 2007 land and water managers are now faced with complex management decisions compounded by increased pressure on natural resources due to population growth wildfires and climate change decision support tools are software or information systems developed to aid managers in the decision process this is accomplished by including the best available scientific knowledge into tools that are accessible easy to use and that require minimal training to support management decisions the weppcloud interface lew et al 2022 is such a decision support tool developed to facilitate hydrologic model runs with the water erosion prediction project wepp watershed model flanagan and livingston 1995 flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan et al 2007 flanagan et al 2012 and to help land managers assess the effects of forest management treatments and wildfire on runoff sediment and phosphorus yield at hillslope and watershed scale the wepp model is a process based hydrology and erosion model based on the fundamentals of infiltration theory hydrology soil physics plant science hydraulics and erosion mechanics flanagan and nearing 1995 a detailed description of the modeled processes is provided in flanagan and nearing 1995 as well as in other papers describing recent improvements to the model specifically for forested applications dun et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 brooks et al 2016 miller et al 2011 miller et al 2019 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2015 a summary of these processes as well as more detailed information on the weppcloud interface can be found in lew et al 2022 part i of this two part manuscript the weppcloud interface has two major advantages compared to the wepp model besides the online applicability and the easiness of the model runs first weppcloud includes a baseflow component similar to srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 which is a major hydrologic process important in modeling larger watersheds and second weppcloud incorporates simplistic algorithms that allow users to simulate pollutant e g phosphorus transport based on known concentrations of the respective pollutant in surface runoff lateral flow baseflow and attached to sediment lew et al 2022 forests are considered sinks for nutrients rather than sources and therefore are not impacted by the major fertilizer management as with agricultural soils piatek and allen 2001 miller et al 2005 however wildfire disturbances and management activities such as timber harvest site preparation road construction and maintenance have the potential to increase nutrient concentration in streams through increased runoff and soil erosion deval et al 2021 gravelle et al 2009 ice and binkley 2003 streamflow from undisturbed watersheds with old forest cover can generate large nutrient concentrations binkley 2001 therefore incorporating capabilities to simulate water quality pollutants into decision support tools is critical for forest management weppcloud automatically builds input files for the wepp model based on publicly available national databases model outputs are generated in both tabular and gis formats that are easy to interpret by users the wepp model requires four main input files for each hillslope and channel topography soil management and weather topography or slope structure is extracted from a 10 or 30 m dem using the topaz topographic parameterization program garbrecht and martz 1997 model the topaz model is also used to delineate a watershed in hillslopes and channels based on a critical source area csa and a minimal channel length mcl selected by the user soil files are created by automatically extracting the necessary soil properties from the high resolution ssurgo sss nrcs reybold and teselle 1989 database with the additional ability to extract soil properties from the coarser resolution state soil geographic statsgo schwartz and alexander 1995 databases for regions where ssurgo data are missing pre built management files for various current land use e g forest shrub rangeland etc are assigned to each hillslope based on the 2016 usgs national land cover database nlcd dewitz 2019 proposed land managements can be selected by the user from a dropdown list of pre defined management files e g forest thinned low severity fire prescribed fire etc lastly daily weather files can be created from various climate options including a stochastically generated weather file using the climate generator cligen weather generator model nicks et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 interpolated historical weather from grid based daymet thornton et al 2016 or gridmet abatzoglou 2013 databases and future climate scenarios downscaled from coupled model intercomparison project general circulation model 5 cmip5 gcm models abatzoglou and brown 2012 a single storm event can also be specified by the user in the 1990s and early 2000s a significant effort was invested by the usda forest service rocky mountain research station rmrs to determine soil hydraulic conductivity and rill and interrill erodibility values for both undisturbed and disturbed forested conditions elliot and hall 1997 elliot 2004 elliot and robichaud 2010 moffet et al 2007 robichaud et al 2007 robichaud et al 2010 2016a robichaud et al 2016b wagenbrenner et al 2010 these studies found that the land cover had more influence on soil erodibility properties than texture management specific soil properties measured in those studies and in other more recent studies elliot et al 2013 robichaud et al 2016a also found that soil depth was another important property the results of the rmrs studies relating erodibility to land cover and four soil textural categories have been merged with the nrcs ssurgo and statsgo reybold and teselle 1989 databases to generate wepp input files with rmrs erodibility values and nrcs soil profile properties lew et al 2022 this merged database is part of the weppcloud interface and is the basis for evaluating the impacts of wildfire and forest management activities on soil erosion the database can be easily modified should new data become available or expanded to include results from future studies in this paper we assess the ability of the weppcloud interface to adequately represent the hydrologic response to management in forested ecosystems across the western u s and summarize the strengths and challenges of the use of weppcloud to guide land and water management decisions in data poor environments specifically we demonstrate model performance when applied to simulate surface runoff sediment and phosphorus yield under current conditions in selected case study watersheds with no or minimal calibration and discuss sensitive calibrating parameters when applied to various geographic regions in the western u s we focus on phosphorus as a pollutant in this manuscript as it is a nutrient found in streams in both adsorbed and dissolved form and therefore is well suited to demonstrate the pollutant loading capabilities with weppcloud but also because it is a nutrient of interest for managers for our test watersheds and there were long term usgs data available for model parameterization and assessment we demonstrate that when key topographic weather soils and vegetative properties are well represented the wepp model can be successfully used in management applications especially when a quick assessment of a study area is desired we also demonstrate how the interface can be further parameterized for pre and post wildfire management scenarios testing in ungauged watersheds we will not discuss specific model results from the management scenarios testing here rather we will describe the methodology for running such simulations with the weppcloud interface lastly we discuss the current limitations of the weppcloud interface and the challenges in applying process based models for directing management applications the paper is presented in two parts part i model description lew et al 2022 and part ii model performance assessment and applications to forest management and wildfires this paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites for this study we selected 28 forested watersheds in the western u s fig 1 table 1 representing a wide range of physiographic conditions these watersheds are involved in unique ongoing land and water management decision making where stakeholders are interested in the potential benefits of applying geospatial hydrologic modeling to assess the impacts of alternative forest management or natural disturbance on water quantity and quality the modeling included comparing the effects of proposed forest treatments and wildfires on sediment and phosphorus yield lake tahoe basin california nevada understanding the risks associated with wildfires to drinking water supply watersheds bull run watershed oregon cedar river and taylor creek washington and evaluating the effects of forest treatments such as thinning clear cutting and broadcast burning on water quantity and quality mica creek experimental watershed mcew idaho lake tahoe is an alpine lake situated in the sierra nevada mountain range and is known for its lake clarity fig 1a the basin is comprised of 63 watersheds that drain directly into the lake and two thirds of these watersheds are located in california while the rest are in nevada climate is wet in the winters and dry in the summers with mean annual precipitations of 1400 mm yr 1 in the west and 670 mm yr 1 near the lake in the east side of the basin coats et al 2016 table 1 most of the precipitation falls as snow between november and april the basin is moderately to densely vegetated consisting of mixed coniferous forests that are actively managed through thinning and prescribed fire operations soils are derived from volcanic parent material in the northern and northwestern part of the basin and granitic parent material in the rest of the basin the bull run watershed is located on the western side of the cascade mountain range and since 1895 has been the primary water supply watershed for the city of portland oregon fig 1b the mean annual air temperature in bull run is 10 ⁰c usda fs u s department of agriculture forest service 1997 and the overall climate is maritime with wet cold winters and dry cool summers the annual average precipitation is 3500 mm and approximately 70 of the annual precipitation occurs between november and april pwb portland water bureau 2003 table 1 most of the precipitation in the catchment falls as rain pwb portland water bureau 2003 the vegetation is comprised of densely mixed coniferous forests that have been under strict protection since 1996 the soils are derived from columbia river basalt and andesite mixed with volcanic ash and are predominantly deep and well drained gravelly loam and silty loam snyder and brownwell 1996 burns et al 2015 found that 21 and 15 of the watershed is highly susceptible to shallow and deep landslides respectively the upper cedar river and taylor creek are located in the cascade mountain range and are two of the three municipal water supply watersheds for the city of seattle washington fig 1c the climate in these two watersheds is wet and mild with annual average precipitation of more than 2500 mm most of the precipitation occurring from november to april srivastava et al 2017 table 1 soils in cedar river are loamy sand and gravely sandy loam srivastava et al 2017 and the vegetation is comprised of old growth and second growth coniferous forest the mcew is located in northern idaho in the northern rockies and is part of a long term paired and nested catchment study designed by the potlach deltic corporation lewiston idaho to assess the direct and cumulative impacts of forest management practices on water quantity and quality deval et al 2021 hubbart et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 srivastava et al 2020 fig 1d for our study we selected two watersheds from the mcew study that were assigned as undisturbed reference watersheds from 1990 2007 namely ws3 and ws6 the annual average temperature at mcew is 5 ⁰c and the annual average precipitation is 450 mm yr 1 with more than 70 of all precipitation falling as snow from november to may table 1 vegetation is comprised of a naturally regenerated second growth mixed coniferous forest of approximately 90 100 years old soils are predominantly deep silt loam weathered from schist gneiss granitic and quartzite bedrock 2 2 model setup we used the weppcloud interface to automatically delineate watersheds prepare the input data and run the wepp model all watersheds were discretized into hillslopes and channels internally with the topaz model using a 30 m usgs national elevation dataset ned except for the smaller mcew watersheds where a 10 m resolution was used weppcloud is designed to access via python modules that reside on the interface locally stored databases or to access freely available national databases to create all input files required by wepp including the topography soils management and weather files at the centroid of each hillslope and channel since our goal was to run the model with minimal calibration it was imperative that the input data and local hydrologic conditions were well represented therefore where available we supplemented the weppcloud interface database with additional information from other databases or previous hydrologic studies soil input files were assigned to each hillslope from the 1 12000 scale ssurgo database except for the bull run watershed where ssurgo soils were missing in the lower half of the watershed the missing soils were assigned based on a local soil survey map developed by the forest service as presented in the 1997 bull run watershed analysis brwa usda fs u s department of agriculture forest service 1997 the brwa database includes similar soil mapping units as ssurgo and provides fundamental information on soil texture and basic topographic attributes however it does not include all soil parameters required by wepp we assigned the remaining soil attributes by matching similar ssurgo and brwa map units based on similarities in soil name texture and slope and then uploaded the newly created map into the weppcloud interface the management parameter files were assigned to each hillslope by the weppcloud interface based on the default 2016 national land cover database nlcd categories e g forest shrubs grass etc for the bull run watershed we replaced the default nlcd map with a map provided by the portland water bureau which was generated from landsat based on the gradient nearest neighbor gnn method ohmann and gregory 2002 a weppcloud equivalent nlcd management parameter file was assigned to each gnn map class wepp weather files were created automatically from two available options on the weppcloud interface for watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we used the daymet option while for all other watersheds we selected the gridmet option with prism revisions the daymet option is at 1 km spatial resolution and generated weather files based on daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature for each hillslope based on a cubic interpolation at the centroid of the hillslopes the gridmet with prism revision option generated a weather file based on daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature wind speed and direction for the centroid of the watershed the gridmet dataset has a course 4 km grid while prism has a higher resolution of 800 m the prism revisions option in weppcloud is used to distribute daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature with elevation similar to brooks et al 2016 all other weather data required by the model including precipitation characteristics duration of storm time to peak intensity and peak intensity dew point temperature solar radiation wind speed and direction were stochastically generated within weppcloud with cligen v5 3 2 nicks et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 frankenberger 2021 from the nearest ncdc long term historic weather data the weather files were built for the time period that matched the streamflow and water quality data available at the outlet of the modeled watersheds table 1 2 3 model calibration and performance assessment the minimal calibration that was conducted on these watersheds followed a simple manual stepwise calibration process boyle et al 2000 this is consistent with the approach in brooks et al 2016 and will be a typical approach adopted by most users of the weppcloud tool it is possible to fully calibrate the key model parameters using parameter estimation pest doherty 2005 after downloading weppcloud projects to a desktop computer however we did not adopt this approach in this study as it was not an appropriate assessment of the predictive capabilities of the model and may not necessarily provide increased understanding based on equifinality issues beven 2001 moreover most land and water managers will have limited skills and time to perform advanced model calibrations therefore the goal of the model calibration was to identify the most sensitive calibrating parameters that would produce acceptable results in all modeled watersheds to calibrate the model we ran the weppcloud interface with default parameters and downloaded all the model runs including all the input and output data with the wepppy win bootstrap lew 2021 this is a freely available python package developed to allow advanced users to download modify and run weppcloud projects locally on windows computers we first calibrated daily streamflow and total water yield as described below and then calibrated key parameters related to sediment and phosphorus yield model performance was assessed for each watershed simulation by utilizing a variety of publicly available usgs data sources daily streamflow data measured at usgs gauging stations daily streamflow data recorded with flumes flow weighted annual loads of sediment and phosphorus processed in previous studies and flow weighted monthly concentrations of phosphorus model performance efficiency was assessed using several goodness of fit statistics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 these indices were calculated with the hydrogof r package zambrano bigiarini 2020 2 3 1 streamflow and water yield streamflow calibration was performed using only the linear baseflow recession coefficient kb the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying geology ksub and the rain snow temperature threshold t rain snow the kb coefficient represents the fixed proportion of the total water stored in a dynamic groundwater reservoir that provides baseflow to the stream on any given day and typically varies between 0 01 d 1 and 0 1 d 1 beck et al 2013 sánchez murillo et al 2014 brooks et al 2016 determined that the observed streamflow recessions on the western side of lake tahoe could be represented by a linear reservoir coefficient kb of 0 04 d 1 however due to a complex hydrogeology of the east side of the lake tahoe basin attributed to large geologic faults and high permeability rates nolan and hill 1991 the authors proposed that additional deep seepage losses of groundwater were occurring and suggested that the rate of groundwater loss from the reservoir could be quantified by calibrating a second deep seepage reservoir coefficient ks for groundwater lost from the system for our simulations we assigned a default kb value of 0 04 d 1 to all modeled watersheds except to the watersheds from the mcew where we assigned a value of 0 02 d 1 based on srivastava et al 2020 and to those from the east side of lake tahoe basin where we followed the brooks et al 2016 approach the ksub values for the subsurface geology in the lake tahoe basin were based on default weppcloud values and for the soils in the mcew they were set to 0 02 mm h 1 based on srivastava et al 2020 for watersheds in the bull run watershed we manually calibrated ksub based on a combination of the bedrock geology specifically the distribution of the rhododendron layer trimble 1963 and a map of shallow landslide susceptibility burns et al 2015 of three classes low medium and high based on the assumption that regions most highly susceptible to landslides would have poorer subsurface drainage into the underlying bedrock the t rain snow is the threshold temperature at which wepp partitions precipitation between rain and snow srivastava et al 2017 the default value in wepp is 0 c and no calibration of this parameter was necessary for the watersheds in lake tahoe california and nevada which we simulated with weather files based on the daymet climate database in contrast the t rain snow was calibrated to 2 c for watersheds in oregon washington and idaho where the gridmet climate database was used daily streamflow observations were measured at usgs gauging stations at all watersheds except at two watersheds in the mcew where they were recorded with large h flumes more information on the equipment used to collect the mcew data can be found in hubbart et al 2007 karwan et al 2007 and srivastava et al 2020 for the streamflow model performance assessment we used a maximum of 25 years 1990 2014 of observed daily streamflow data in the watersheds from the lake tahoe basin 39 years 1980 2018 of observed daily streamflow data measured at seven stream gauges in the bull run and at the cedar river and taylor creek watersheds and 18 years 1990 2007 of observed daily streamflow data measured with flumes at the two undisturbed watersheds from the mcew table 1 2 3 2 sediment yield the wepp model can simulate soil erosion from hillslopes and channels soil deposition within the hillslope and channel profile and sediment yield at the watershed outlet the most important calibrating variables for simulating soil erosion are effective hydraulic conductivity rill and interrill erodibilities hillslope critical shear percent ground cover and channel bed critical shear stress τc nearing et al 1990 for hillslopes these parameters were set by default in the weppcloud interface based on previous field observations in forest soils of various textures lew et al 2022 similarly for channel erosion srivastava et al 2020 demonstrated good agreement between observed and model simulations in the mcew by varying only the channel τc the authors found a direct relationship between wepp calibrated τc and the median particle size d50 and suggested that pebble count data can be used to parametrize the channel τc in forested watersheds for the watersheds in the mcew we used τc values recommended by srivastava et al 2020 in the lake tahoe watersheds pebble count data were available at few locations which were provided by the land managers from the lake tahoe basin we calculated the d50 from the observed pebble count data and identified the channel bed critical shear stress equivalent following berenbrock and tranmer 2008 observations of event based suspended sediment concentrations ssc were available at the usgs gauging stations for all watersheds in the lake tahoe basin and the two flumes in mcew additionally for watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we also had available flow weighted annual loads of ssc estimated in a previous study in the basin by coats et al 2016 the authors estimated and compared annual loads from several regression equations after correcting the sources of bias in the usgs water quality database 2 3 3 phosphorus yield simulated phosphorus yield in weppcloud is based on simple static phosphorus concentrations in each of the three components of the streamflow hydrograph surface runoff subsurface lateral flow and baseflow and particulate phosphorus concentration on the delivered sediment due to data limitations at most other watersheds these static concentrations were calculated only for the lake tahoe watersheds based on long term observed streamflow usgs code 00060 discharge ft3 s 1 and event based total phosphorus tp concentrations usgs code 00665 phosphorus water unfiltered mg l 1p soluble reactive phosphorus srp usgs code 00671 orthophosphate water filtered mg l 1p ssc usgs code 80154 suspended sediment concentration mg l 1 and streamflow usgs code 00061 discharge instantaneous ft3 s 1 measured at the usgs stream gauging stations and bias corrected by coats et al 2016 particulate phosphorus pp mg l 1 is not typically measured at the usgs stream gauging stations and was calculated by subtracting srp from tp since these observations were event based we calculated the flow adjusted daily concentrations with the load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 model which is a usgs model used to derive relationships between event based streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations based on eleven pre defined regression equations for each watershed we ran the loadest model with an automated regression model selection on 1 january 1997 and 31 december 2005 a few watersheds on the western side of the lake tahoe experienced significant rain on snow events that caused record peak streamflow events for example blackwood creek usgs code 10336660 recorded 83 m3 s 1 247 mm in 1997 and 64 m3 s 1 191 mm in 2005 peak streamflow therefore when using the entire data record generated bias model results we ran seasonally piecewise loadest models for all years except for wy 1997 and wy 2006 and then separately for years wy 1997 and wy 2006 gao et al 2018 found that the seasonally piecewise method performed better than the year round method in estimating monthly nitrogen loads static phosphorus concentrations needed as input to the weppcloud interface were further calculated from the flow weighted concentrations for each watershed we assumed the phosphorus concentrations in the surface runoff are typical of the streamflow srp concentrations mg l 1 during spring snowmelt months april and may and that the phosphorus concentrations in the baseflow are typical of the streamflow srp concentrations mg l 1 in the fall september and october for the phosphorus concentrations in lateral flow we averaged the srp streamflow concentrations mg l 1 for the remaining months we calculated the particulate phosphorus concentrations adsorbed to sediments with equation 1 1 psediment tp s r p ssc 10 6 where psediment pp is the particulate phosphorus concentration mg kg 1 calculated for may which is the month with the highest runoff and ssc we used the phosphorus concentrations determined from the observed data as initial input to the model and further calibrated these values to match simulated values with observed annual average flow adjusted loads of tp srp and pp 2 4 model parameterization for management scenario testing to demonstrate weppcloud s ability to assess the impact of various management and wildfire scenarios we selected as a case study the lake tahoe basin where land managers are considering increasing the use of forest thinning and prescribed fires to reduce wildfire risks specifically managers were interested in exploring the benefits of expanding fuel management into remote forested areas and estimating the tradeoffs in long term sediment yield between fuel management and wildfire for this analysis we modeled upland erosion for 11 management scenarios or conditions including current conditions do nothing three thinning scenarios with 96 92 and 85 ground cover post thinning one prescribed fire scenario and erosion following three different wildfire severity low moderate and high scenarios the management parameters used to simulate these treatments are provided in table s2 in supplementary material thinning was only allowed on forested hillslopes while prescribed fires or wildfires were also allowed to occur on areas covered by shrubs the lake tahoe basin is comprised of 63 watersheds that drain directly into the lake but only 17 watersheds have water quality observations for calibration the kb and ks channel τc and phosphorus concentrations in surface runoff subsurface lateral flow baseflow and sediment for the calibrated watershed runs were distributed to uncalibrated watersheds across the basin based on the watershed s similarities parent material and proximity all simulations were performed using python batch processing scripts that generate weppcloud compatible projects and results were further compiled in tabular data files and gis data files in the current version of the weppcloud interface users can perform similar scenario testing for only individual watersheds however future interface developments will allow select users to perform similar batch hydrologic modeling for multiple watersheds and scenarios at the same time 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance assessment 3 1 1 streamflow and water yield assessment the wepp model via the weppcloud interface was applied to several western u s watersheds of varying sizes with a wide variety of climatic and physiographic settings exhibiting distinct runoff regimes the overall goodness of fit statistics for the wepp simulated and observed daily streamflow comparisons for the watersheds indicate reasonable results table 2 across the watersheds nses based on daily streamflow values were in the range of 0 43 to 0 64 indicating satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed values table 2 the only exception was the logan house creek watershed lh1 located on the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin with an nse of 0 09 signifying poor model performance brooks et al 2016 reported similar results for the lh1 watershed which the authors attributed to water loss through fractures in the bedrock the wepp model was not able to simulate this complex hydrogeology without additional calibration positive kge values in the range of 0 39 to 0 79 table 2 suggest reasonable model performance when considering mean flow as a kge estimation criterion pbias within 13 across all watersheds indicated slight over and under prediction of streamflow table 2 the wepp model captured runoff regimes across all watersheds reasonably well and the simulated annual trends of water yield were similar to the trends of observed yield figs 2 and 3 and figs s4 and s5 in supplementary material compared to daily streamflow monthly and annual goodness of fit statistics showed improved model performance for all watersheds table 2 while the streamflow and water yield assessment provided good evidence that the weppcloud interface can accurately represent the hydrology of distinct geographic regions many water resources management issues require an understanding of a watershed s streamflow regime and the impacts of forest management on peak flows e g for protecting culverts and roads daily peak flows were overestimated in most watersheds except in the watersheds from the western side of lake tahoe figs s1 s3 in supplementary material using a similar modeling approach as automated on the weppcloud interface brooks et al 2016 and srivastava et al 2017 2020 reported that the discrepancies between the modeled and observed peak hydrograph could be arising from inaccuracies in wepp s snow accumulation and melt processes currently wepp partitions precipitation into rain and snow using a single threshold approach usace u s army corps of engineers 1956 research on snow hydrology suggests a double threshold approach in partitioning precipitation is more appropriate to better represent snow accumulation and melt processes dai 2008 another potential source of daily peak flow overestimation may be that within the wepp code there is a flag that sets the infiltration rate to zero for the day if the soil is saturated at the end of the previous day s water balance this suggests that if there are several rainy days in succession the runoff of the second or third wet day could be overestimated due to saturation excess runoff miller et al 2011 found that the flag for the infiltration rate in the wepp code resulted in overestimation of runoff and erosion from only the wettest climates in the pacific nw but did not appear to affect results elsewhere in the western u s nevertheless uncalibrated model results in this study suggest that the weppcloud interface can satisfactorily represent the hydrology of distinct geographic regions and that water resources managers could apply the interface to ungauged watersheds for forest management decisions future efforts to improve hydrologic simulations with the weppcloud interface are underway to improve the snow hydrology routines in wepp a linear groundwater reservoir with a default kb of 0 04 d 1 was appropriate to model low summer streamflow in most watersheds of this study except in the drier watersheds on the east side of lake tahoe basin and in the watersheds at mcew for the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin the initial model results showed overestimations in water yield similar results were reported by brooks et al 2016 in logan house lh1 and glenbrook creek gc1 watersheds located on the eastern portion of the lake tahoe basin in their study the authors used a secondary reservoir to simulate water yield by allowing groundwater loss through hydrogeological fractures and therefore bypassing the usgs stream gauge in this study the addition of a second aquifer reservoir in nine watersheds located in the ne e and se of the lake tahoe basin improved water yield simulations supporting the hypothesis that these watersheds could be characterized by complex hydrogeology hyne et al 1972 for mcew watersheds a single linear reservoir with a default value of 0 02 d 1 as suggested by srivastava et al 2020 was appropriate to simulate streamflow calibrated kb and ks for all watersheds are shown in table 3 sánchez murillo et al 2015 demonstrated that in the inland pacific northwest the baseflow recession coefficients depend on several climatic and terrain attributes including the geologic substrate results and recommendations from sánchez murillo et al 2015 work will be incorporated in future versions of the weppcloud interface to further reduce the data parameterization required from users for watersheds in the bull run catchment we manually calibrated the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive bedrock ksub based on maps of the rhododendron geologic layer trimble 1963 and landslide susceptibility burns et al 2015 of three classes low medium and high specifically we assumed the ksub was highest 0 5 mm h 1 where landslide susceptibility was the lowest and low 0 005 mm h 1 where landslide susceptibility was the highest for the moderate landslide susceptibility we assigned a middle value of 0 05 mm h 1 since the rhododendron layer in these watersheds is associated with landslides and bank erosion rinella 1987 peterson et al 1995 we assigned it the lowest ksub value 0 0001 mm h 1 the ksub for the soils in cedar river and taylor creek watersheds were calibrated to 0 05 mm h 1 and 0 15 mm h 1 respectively while for the two watersheds in mcew we used a value of 0 02 mm h 1 as suggested by srivastava et al 2020 for all the watersheds in the lake tahoe basin we used ksub values of the restrictive layer as reported in the ssurgo database t rain snow threshold was calibrated in the model to 2 c for watersheds where the gridmet climate database was used the gridmet product utilizes the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell et al 2004 for temporal daily data and the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 for spatial interpolation at 4 km resolution the daymet product uses the global historical climatology network ghcn for temporal daily data and is spatially interpolated at 1 km resolution our results suggest that the use of different climate products of varying spatial resolution in conjunction with wepp could potentially influence snow accumulation melt processes and thereby hydrologic modeling a detailed investigation of the impact of using different climate products with wepp is recommended to guide users in selecting appropriate climate products for hydrologic simulations 3 1 2 sediment load overall we were able to estimate the magnitudes of annual average sediment load in watersheds from both the lake tahoe basin and mcew fig 4 table 4 observed annual average sediment loads in the lake tahoe basin generally varied between the west and the east side and from watershed to watershed eastern watersheds generated considerably less sediment compared to watersheds from the western side of the basin observed annual average sediment loads ranged from 5 mg yr 1 at logan house creek lh1 to 2852 mg yr 1 from blackwood creek bc1 this difference is mainly due to differences in area and precipitation since the lh1 watershed received less than half of the precipitation recorded in the bc1 657 mm yr 1 precipitation in lh1 compared to 1476 mm yr 1 recorded in bc1 table 1 other watershed characteristics such as watershed soils geology and vegetation likely contributed to the difference in sediment loads between the two watersheds albeit to a lesser extent model results showed an underestimation of annual sediment loads at three watersheds on the western side of the lake tahoe basin namely at blackwood creek bc1 ward creek wc8 and general creek gc1 figs 4 and 5 the main reason for this underestimation was the observed sediment delivery associated with a few high peak flow events from 1 and 2 january 1997 wy 1997 and on 31 december 2005 wy 2006 which were not captured by the model these high peak flow rates were caused by rain on snow events that are often observed in the mid winter in pacific northwest marks et al 2001 and in watersheds in the sierra nevada mountains kattelmann 1997 mccabe et al 2007 in the lake tahoe basin the 1997 event was considered a 100 year flood event tetra tech 2007 which caused peak suspended sediment loads with return periods ranging from 40 to 60 years only in streams from the western side of the lake tahoe basin simon et al 2004 brooks et al 2016 demonstrated that the wepp model can accurately simulate the 1997 high peak flow in the upper truckee river utr5 when scaling the weather data across the watershed based on data from a lower elevation snotel station which recorded a slightly different rain distribution for the day since most of the sediment is delivered during these high peak flow events an accurate representation of weather data is essential to model such events another potential source of underestimation of sediment load by wepp may be sediment delivery from landslides as the wepp model does not consider mass wasting sources of sediment there is some evidence of mass wasting particularly in the steeper upland portions of the blackwood creek bc1 watershed gavigan 2007 additional sediment during peak flows may also be from channel erosion processes not fully addressed by the wepp model like side sloughing during channel drawdown following flood flows that would have saturated the stream banks simon et al 2009 the goodness of fit statistics based on annual sediment loads for all simulated years show that wepp predictions were in reasonable agreement with observed data except for wc8 bc1 and gc1 watersheds table 4 results for the three watersheds improved substantially when the water years with high peak flow events 1997 and 2006 were omitted from the analysis for example nse kge and pbias for watershed bc1 improved from 0 05 to 0 63 0 15 to 0 48 and 60 to 7 respectively we manually calibrated the τc in the lake tahoe watersheds to match the simulated to observed annual sediment loads at the watershed outlets assuming minimal upland erosion these values ranged from 10 n m 2 in the blackwood creek watershed to 180 n m 2 in the headwaters of the upper truckee river utr5 watershed table 3 lower values of the τc are associated with smaller d50 particle size srivastava et al 2020 and therefore higher soil erodibility for channel beds conversely higher values of τc are associated with larger d50 particle sizes and result in lower erodibility values indeed the blackwood creek watershed is known in the lake tahoe basin as the top contributor of sediment yield to the lake and has been the subject of several channel restoration efforts norman et al 2014 oehrli 2013 the headwater portion of the upper truckee river watershed is characterized by rock outcrops of low infiltration rates and erodibilities brooks et al 2016 which can be an explanation for the higher τc calibrated by the model median pebble count data d50 was available for two of the modeled watersheds in the lake tahoe basin and τc equivalents for these two watersheds approximately matched the calibrated values τc calibrated blackwood creek mainstream d50 42 τc 26 τc calibrated 10 ward creek d50 68 τc 54 τc calibrated 30 3 1 3 phosphorus yield the magnitudes of all three phosphorus constituents simulated by the wepp model were in close agreement with the observed across all watersheds fig 6 a and 6b and fig s7 in the supplementary material the goodness of fit statistics based on annual values for watersheds in lake tahoe were very good for all three phosphorus constituents table 5 tp nse 0 75 kge 0 71 pbias 0 5 pp nse 0 71 kge 0 70 pbias 1 3 and srp nse 0 66 kge 0 66 pbias 4 6 table 5 the simulated annual loads of tp pp and srp followed the trends of observed load figs 7 and s8 and s9 in supplementary material which is expected since pp is the major form of phosphorus transport in streams from lake tahoe hatch et al 2001 therefore similar to the sediment load the tp and pp load for the three watersheds wc8 bc1 and gc1 that experienced the rain on snow events in wy 1997 and 2006 were also underestimated fig 6a simulated annual srp load was better captured by the model except in logan house lh1 where the model underestimated the observed loads pbias 95 table 5 however it is worth noting that the difference between the observed and simulated phosphorus load for this watershed is insignificant 1 5 kg yr 1 the simplistic coefficient based phosphorus algorithms implemented in the weppcloud interface were sufficient to capture the general trends of annual phosphorus loads associated with surface runoff subsurface lateral flow baseflow and sediment in our study watersheds figs 6 and 7 most process based phosphorus models use complex processes involving mineralization decomposition and immobilization pools and their interaction among them for phosphorus transport computations hydrologic simulations with such algorithms may improve the spatial and temporal estimates of phosphorus for watershed simulation studies a version of the wepp model with a water quality module is under development personal communication d c flanagan and would likely be available for the evaluation of nutrient transport in forest settings in a future version of weppcloud in watersheds from the lake tahoe basin p concentration values in surface runoff inferred from the observed data varied between 0 0028 mg l 1 in general creek gc1 to 0 013 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 the lateral flow and baseflow p concentrations were higher than those in the runoff and ranged between 0 026 mg l 1 in logan house lh1 to 0 0153 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 for lateral flow and from 0 0024 mg l 1 in logan house lh1 to 0 0228 mg l 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 for baseflow respectively in general these values were lower in watersheds located on the western side and higher in those from the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin the observed p concentrations in the sediments varied between 840 mg kg 1 in third creek th1 to 4397 mg kg 1 in glenbrook creek gl1 similarly as with the streamflow p concentrations sediment p concentrations varied among watersheds with lower values in watersheds on the northern western and southern sides of the basin and higher values in watersheds from the eastern side of the basin table 6 the significant difference in p concentration in runoff and sediment between watersheds on the west and east sides of lake tahoe respectively is likely due to differences in the parent material specifically watersheds located on the nw and w of lake tahoe are mainly underlying volcanic soils with poorly crystalline iron and aluminum oxides that retain p and limit the p movement in water heron et al 2021 watersheds on the eastern side of the lake tahoe basin however are developed mainly on granitic parent material with greater potential for p mobilization to streamflow heron et al 2021 we found a strong linear relationship r2 0 93 between the p runoff concentrations values determined from the observed data and the calibrated values in watersheds from lake tahoe fig 8 similarly the p concentration values in the sediment determined from observed data were linearly related to the calibrated values r2 0 75 the dissolved p concentrations in lateral flow and baseflow however were only linearly related to the calibrated values from wepp for watersheds with a second aquifer reservoir r2 0 94 for lateral flow r2 0 86 for baseflow and not for watersheds with a single reservoir r2 0 05 for lateral flow r2 0 08 for baseflow the poor agreement between observed and calibrated p concentrations for both lateral flow and baseflow for the watersheds with a single reservoir is a surprising result we were expecting this mismatch for watersheds that were calibrated with a second aquifer as those watersheds are believed to have complex hydrogeology and lose water either to a second reservoir through fractures or to areas outside of the basin brooks et al 2016 and therefore the observed p concentrations at the watershed outlets would be smaller further investigation is required to understand how the complex groundwater system is contributing to inconsistencies in the analysis of p concentrations in all stream locations across the lake tahoe the observed dissolved p concentrations were very low 0 020 mg l 1 and even using a single constant dissolved p concentration in runoff lateral flow and baseflow produced similar annual p loading results at watersheds with both single and double aquifers data not shown 3 2 management scenario testing the model calibration for 17 watersheds in the lake tahoe basin allowed us to identify the minimum number of critical calibrating parameters in the model to confidently simulate streamflow and sediment and phosphorus yield model results suggested that most of the calibrated parameters are fairly consistent across each ecosystem where a calibrated value in one watershed is also reasonable for a neighboring watershed in the same ecosystem for example eight watersheds in the western side of the basin were calibrated with a single linear reservoir aquifer and a baseflow recession coefficient of 0 04 day 1 conversely all watersheds located ne e and se were calibrated with a second linear reservoir and various deep seepage coefficients these similarities among watersheds allowed us to apply the calibrated values to model the rest of the ungauged watersheds within the basin regional differences were also observed for the channel critical shear and phosphorus concentrations which were similarly distributed across the basin the supplementary material contains maps of the groundwater baseflow and seepage coefficients critical shear and phosphorus concentrations for all watersheds in the basin figs s10 s11 s12 weppcloud simulated output can be downloaded as tables and gis shapefiles and managers can use this information to compare runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yields from individual hillslopes and watersheds https wepp cloud weppcloud lt for example maps of sediment yield output suggest that under undisturbed conditions there are erosion hot spots within several watersheds in the basin e g blackwood creek ward creek the upland portion of the upper truckee river and third creek and that sediment yield from these areas tends to increase with disturbance severity fig 9 another observation with great implications for management is that for the eastern watersheds the model simulated minimal to no erosion even after a wildfire 1 kg ha 1 two of the eastern watersheds have been identified in previous research studies as sinks rather than sources of sediments mainly due to their small size and low precipitation and runoff rates simon et al 2004 this finding could be useful for managers that are seeking to prioritize areas for treatment in the basin previous research in the basin suggested that high peak flows associated with rain on snow events e g year 1997 can flush stored sediment from the stream channels and reduce the sediment load in the following years simon et al 2004 since forest disturbances have the potential to increase peak flows grant et al 2008 we could expect rill and interrill erodibilities and the channel critical shear to change immediately post disturbance however without clear guidelines from the available literature we were unable to parameterize the weppcloud interface to reflect these complex changes within the channel streambed post disturbance similarly forest treatments and wildfire have the potential to increase p concentrations in forested ecosystems mainly through increases in soil erosion and increased availability of ash that has an elevated p concentration santín et al 2018 however studies have found little effects from thinning deval et al 2021 or from a combination of thinning and prescribed fires on p delivery kaye et al 2005 martin and harr 1989 since forest wildfires especially those that result in high soil burn severity affect soil properties there is more evidence that p concentrations post wildfire increase lane et al 2008 murphy et al 2006 santín et al 2018 smith et al 2011 however because this information is limited in the research literature we did not attempt to include in the model any temporal changes in phosphorus concentrations with treatment moreover even if such changes were implemented we lacked post disturbance phosphorus observations at the modeled watersheds to validate model results 3 3 advantages and limitations the weppcloud interface overcomes several challenges that users faced in the past when applying the wepp model to forested watersheds major advantages and limitations of the weppcloud interface for forest applications are presented in table 7 4 summary and conclusion for many years the application of complex hydrologic models for land management was limited to trained hydrologists and modelers with extensive knowledge of computer programming and data manipulation transferability of knowledge from the modeler to the manager was slow and oftentimes hindered by managers limited accessibility to the actual model for further scenario testing or model parameterization with additional observed data increased accessibility to national databases via web applications is now facilitating the development of online decision support tools such as weppcloud that provide managers with more flexibility in modeling and interpreting results to better understand watershed processes and to evaluate the effects of forest management actions on water resources in the current study we demonstrated that the weppcloud interface can successfully simulate general trends in streamflow sediment and phosphorus in watersheds with different physiographic settings with minimal calibration additionally we demonstrated the applicability of the interface to various forest fuel treatments and wildfire scenarios which can provide land and water resources managers with site specific information of the spot areas in their watersheds to control soil erosion and phosphorus transport with forest management practices the minimal calibration performed in this study involved manual alterations of calibrating parameters that are not easily found in national databases i e kb ksub τc p concentrations however previous research and the current study demonstrate that at least some of these parameters could be inferred from geology kb or could be determined from observed data at nearby watersheds kb τc p concentrations future applications of the interface to watersheds located in different ecoregions of u s will help with the identification of regional calibrating parameters that could improve model simulations there is also a need to improve the wepp model hydrologic routines to improve peak flow estimation in wet climates perhaps the most obvious limitation to any hydrologic model is an accurate representation of the weather patterns or climatic conditions specifically precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature despite performing simulations with the best available spatially distributed climate datasets our results show that we are still not able to accurately capture extreme peak flow events which are needed in many management applications however increased access to remotely sensed data and the tendency to improve the spatial resolution of such observations such as radar should provide evidence that we are getting closer to providing accurate hydrologic simulations in ungauged basins in near real time although there will most certainly be needs and opportunities in the future to reduce uncertainty in geospatial model predictions the technology incorporated within weppcloud provides managers with a comprehensive physically based hydrologic tool developed based on the most accurate readily available geospatial and climatic data weppcloud results provide managers with long term historic or future hillslope and watershed specific simulated streamflow sediment and nutrient outputs in the manner of minutes with a large forestry and wildfire management database parameterized with the latest region specific scientifically defensible experimental studies and a user friendly interface capable of storing multiple scenario runs weppcloud has great potential to be a useful decision support tool for many forestry management applications credit authorship contribution

3276,understanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences furthermore improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application this study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction fs and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter n within the budyko framework employing 1576 globally investigated catchments results showed that the budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors ns 0 76 rmse 181 01 mm a 1 when incorporating the fs compared with no snow fraction incorporated it ns 0 54 rmse 248 85 mm a 1 especially for catchments with higher fs in these catchments a higher fs was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow q while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation e p under the budyko framework n and fs distribution generally exhibited opposite trends moreover higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries while higher fs represented lower p q p i e the mean p q p was 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with lower fs 0 15 medium 0 15 fs 0 50 and higher fs 0 50 fs statistical relationships among ecohydrological processes and catchment parameter suggested that i higher storm depth α generally indicated higher normalized mean q ii a higher plant available water

in a changing world especially in the ungauged catchment keywords budyko hypothesis snow fraction streamflow ecohydrological processes 1 introduction catchment hydrology studies the foundation of climate soil vegetation and terrestrial interactions berry et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014a liu et al 2016 yang et al 2021a traditionally hydrological behavior has been extrapolated under the assumption that catchments regulate their own stability or stationarity for example under the budyko hypothesis long term water balance is used to limit the effects of a non stationarity catchment state changes in catchment water storage are be negligible budyko 1974 in this way the budyko framework has been successfully applied to water partitioning as a function of the relative magnitude of water supplies and available energy e g yang et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2017 however for water balance at regional scales important challenges exist in explaining the non stationarity of climate and other associated catchment characteristics i e vegetation and the soil water holding capacity e g chiew et al 2013 saft et al 2015 saft et al 2016 firstly changes to precipitation p regimes i e intensity frequency and the snow fraction fs compared to other factors under climate warming play a vital role in regulating streamflow q particularly perennial drought herein referred to as the p deficit has led to a shift in rainfall runoff partitioning from what was previously encountered during shorter drought events under considerably less predicted runoff saft et al 2016 meanwhile changes in p phases also play a critical role in the global hydrologic cycle and the climate system e g zhang et al 2015a jennings et al 2018 secondly vegetation which imposes complex and varying limitations through its interactions with temperature as well as solar radiation and water regulates the partitioning of p into q and evapotranspiration et nemani et al 2003 donohue et al 2007 2010 penuelas et al 2009 zhang et al 2015b since the 1980s a greening trend has been observed in vegetation in most regions around the world zhu et al 2016 piao et al 2019 as a consequence of anthropogenic induced climate change e g carbon dioxide co2 fertilization effects caused by elevated co2 concentrations zhu et al 2016 and intensifying anthropogenic activities e g the revegetation of china s loess plateau feng et al 2016 finally physical catchment characteristics i e soil porosity infiltration rate catchment slope and catchment storage which were traditionally assumed to be under a steady state control both hydrological processes and hydrological responses sankarasubramanian vogel 2003 yang et al 2006 variability in catchment storage resulting from intensifying anthropogenic activities i e groundwater pumping and the building of reservoirs under a background of climate change has led to complex hydrological responses on both regional and global scales mao et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 long et al 2020 yang et al 2021b additionally catchment storage dynamics control the hydrological connectivity among different landscape components carrer et al 2019 which precipitates a threshold in the regulation of q response spence 2007 yang et al 2017 along these lines ecohydrological processes have been incorporated into the budyko framework equipping it with a new physical perception and broadening its application in describing hydrological behavior in a non stationary world e g donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 moussa lhomme 2016 mianabadi et al 2020 recently climate warming has proportionally decreased the ratio between snowfall and rainfall knowles et al 2006 trenberth 2011 krasting et al 2013 jennings et al 2018 considering the divergent effects associated with p phase alterations on land surface water and energy fluxes e g zhang et al 2015a jennings et al 2018 the fs has been used in combination with the budyko framework to explain its effects on regional water balances deducing that a p shift from snow to rain causes a decrease in q berghuijs et al 2014b zhang et al 2015a previous studies found a lower fs followed by slower and earlier snowmelt would lead to a decreased q in a warmer climate e g berghuijs et al 2014b liu et al 2022 due to complex snowmelt mechanisms e g snowpack disappearance related to the sinusoidal shape of the annual cycle of temperature evan eisenman 2021 q response with fs alteration is still highly uncertain for example the positive relationship between q variability and fs may have resulted from asymmetric hydrological effects of snowfall in the wet and dry years liu et al 2022 motivated by the initial success in describing regional water balances the objectives of this study were i to incorporate the fs into the budyko framework and to assess its global application ii to estimate the sensitivity of q to the fs and iii to explore catchment parameter n response to the fs and its statistical relationship to ecohydrological processes in 1576 catchments globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background of the budyko hypothesis following schreiber 1904 and ol dekop 1911 budyko 1948 1974 developed a hydroclimatic framework to predict the partitioning of catchment p into q and evaporation e under average climatic conditions this framework partitions the steady state water balance as a function of the relative magnitudes of water supply and energy supply usually expressed as potential evaporation ep which can be expressed as follows 1 e p e p p t a n h p e p 1 e x p e p p to broaden the budyko framework adjustable catchment parameters were incorporated into it e g fu et al 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 among of formulations some of them were analytically derived from simple physical assumptions e g mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008 the analytical equation for the budyko framework explored by mezentsev 1955 and choudhury s 1999 can be expressed 2 e p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is the catchment parameter choudhury s 1999 equation is used to deduce catchment parameters applying the nonlinear fitting method ignoring storage changes donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the steady state water balance model can be expressed by the following equation 3 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n donohue et al 2012 based on porporato et al s 2004 ecohydrological model estimated choudhury s n by considering the effects of the effective rooting depth ze the mean storm depth α and the fractional plant available water holding capacity κ and deduced the relationship between n and these three variables as follows yang et al 2016 4 n a l o g γ 2 b l o g γ c where 5 α 0 003 log 2 0 247 l o g 0 190 6 b 0 022 0 403 7 c 0 071 log 2 0 332 l o g

choudhury porporato model bcp model liu et al 2016 later extended the steady state bcp model by incorporating dynamic ecohydrological processes into it and then combining it with a typical soil water balance bucket model manabe 1969 which subsequently resulted in the dynamic bcp or dbcp model see donohue et al 2012 and liu et al 2016 for more detail on the bcp model or the dbcp model accounting for snowmelt i e melting energy rm and the effective energy available for et zhang et al 2015 designed an equation to estimate the melting energy and the effective energy available for et eq 2 9 r m ρ

kj kg 1 according to ding et al 2014 the overlapping range of the daily mean air temperature tm i e from 0 5 c to 5 c was set to isolate p into the rain sleet and snow this study adopted the empirical discrimination scheme ding et al 2014 derived from 110 000 samples collected from different climate regimes and elevations across china between 1951 and 1979 sleet was then separated into rain and snow as the linearly dependent function of their variables air temperature p was categorized according to the following 11 t y p e s n o w i f t m t m i n s n o w 2 9 t m 10 9 s l e e t r a i n 2 9 t

partitioning of snowmelt water into e and q can be explained i snowmelt rates in excess of e rate may bring the soil to field capacity facilitating below root zone percolation and streamflow anderson 1976 barnhart et al 2016 and ii surface flow is preferred during the snow melting period due to extremely low permeability for frozen ground dunne black 1971 there underlies complex mechanism in q generation with alteration of fs in different hydroclimatic conditions e g liu et al 2022 while rapid snowmelt rate increased with increasing fs trujillo molotch 2014 tends to cause higher q production following these mechanism we assume that most of snowmelt water converts to streamflow the effective available water for e at annual or mean annual scale is 1 fs p rather than total p zhang et al 2015 the bcp model can be revised as follows which is renamed as the bcp fs model in the following analyses 12 e 1 f s p e p 1 f s p n e p n 1 n 13 q p e p 1 f s p e p 1 f s p n e p n 1 n where fs is the snow fraction the p phase was calculated according to ding et al 2014 which was used to estimate fs the adjustable catchment parameter n for the 1576 catchments investigated in this study was subsequently estimated which was then used to explore statistical relationships with ecohydrological parameters i e α κ and ze the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients ns coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse slope of the linear fitted model and the coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate model performance between the bcp model and the bcp fs

simulated streamflow i is the ith catchment n is the number of catchments 2 2 estimation of effective rooting depth using guswa s carbon cost benefit model the ze was estimated using a carbon cost benefit model developed by guswa 2008 the fundamental assumption of guswa s model is if a plant can identify its root depth it will thus be able to delegate a trade off between the cost of adding deeper fine roots that will barely be counterbalanced by the benefit of the additional carbon that will be assimilated by captured auxiliary soil water 16 c z r 0 z r γ r d r lr d z r 17 b z r w u e f

following donohue et al 2012 changes to the catchment parameter n also can be shown as follows 21 dn n α d α n κ d κ n z e d z e n ϕ d ϕ where the direct sensitivity of n to changes in α κ and ze can

the ramp function method simple linear ramp functions have been developed to scale the impact of each factor between 0 and 1 depending on the threshold nemani et al 2003 in this study we used simple linear ramp functions to scale the impacts of α κ and ze on n thresholds were defined as the maximum and minimum sensitivity coefficient values of α κ and ze at a global scale 25 v i x i x min x max x min where vi is the impact variable on n ranging from 0 to 1 xi is the sensitivity coefficient of α κ and ze xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum values of the sensitivity coefficients for α κ and ze respectively 2 5 data description we collected daily or monthly q observations from 3347 catchments globally from the three following databases i the united states geological survey usgs

the global runoff data centre https www bafg de grdc lehner 2012 and iii a compilation of q data and associated boundaries from 321 australian catchments reported by peel et al 2000 the 1576 catchments shown in fig 1 were selected from all available catchments however we only included those that satisfied the following criteria i catchments with areas between 10 km2 10 000 km2 to reduce channel routing effects van dijk et al 2013 ii catchments that included 2 of urban area based on the globcover v2 map bontemps et al 2011 and catchments that included 2 of irrigated area using the

its monthly maximum 3 results 3 1 incorporating the snow fraction fs into the budyko framework verification of the budyko model incorporating the fs was evaluated by comparing qsim from the original bcp model and the bcp fs model the bcp fs model provided better q estimation results as well as better captured q dynamics on a mean annual scale with a slope of 0 82 r 2 0 79 compared with slope of 0 66 r 2 0 81 for original bcp model fig 2 the ns coefficient and rmse of the bcp fs model were 0 76 and 181 01 mm a 1 respectively fig 2 which indicated that the bcp fs model was better than the original bcp model in describing hydrological behavior thus incorporating the fs improved agreement in describing hydrological behavior of the budyko framework with observed data the bcp fs model was further evaluated using various fs and the dryness indexes ep p fig 2c d as predicted the budyko model incorporating the fs provided stratified simulated results with fs increased from 0 15 to 0 5 i e fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 50 and fs 0 50 slope were 0 73 0 86 and 0 95 ns were 0 64 0 83 and 0 60 respectively it is interesting to note that the relationship between qob and qsim in catchments with ep p 1 presented more accurate results with a slope of 0 83 r 2 0 74 num 576 compared to water limited catchments with a slope of 0 81 r 2 0 42 num 1000 and the ns coefficient reached 0 67 and 0 40 for catchments with ep p 1 and ep p 1 respectively 3 2 streamflow q sensitivity to precipitation p regimes the catchments stratified by fs exhibited a decrease in mean normalized evaporation p q p values with an increase in the fs for example mean p q p values were 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with an fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 50 and fs 0 5 respectively fig 3 a additionally the fs reflected the effects of actual water and energy conditions while lower fs was observed on the left hand and near to the water limited line generally higher fs is associated with lower e p normalized evaporation e p and higher normalized mean streamflow q p overall observation patterns were consistent with the budyko curve interestingly sensitivity coefficients of q to the fs qfs under the budyko framework showed that qfs ranged from 539 mm 1 0 15 fs 0 50 to 606 mm 1 fs 0 5 which means alteration of fs can dramatically alter p partitioning fig 3b as expected normalized mean streamflow q p from bcp fs model presented clear stratification pattern compared to original bcp model higher fs meant higher normalized mean streamflow fig 4 a b and more accurate hydrological behavior slope 0 84 were captured compared with the tenuous relationship described by original bcp model slope 0 54 fig 3c d interestingly q p were underestimated with small magnitude between different fs catchments e g 0 26 0 26 and 0 25 in catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 and fs 0 5 respectively fig 4c on the contrary the bcp fs model captured effects of fs on water balances with 0 30 0 42 and 0 65 for catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 and fs 0 5 respectively in all this was particularly true for the bcp fs model which underestimated q p by only 0 03 for catchments with fs 0 05 compared to the original bcp model which underestimated q p by approx 0 19 3 3 catchment parameter n response to the snow fraction fs and associated statistical relationships with ecohydrological processes fig 5 shows the distributions of n and ecohydrological parameter e g α κ and ze across the 1576 catchments within the budyko framework interestingly α κ and ze exhibited decreasing trends under an increasing fs for example α was 6 57 mm 4 95 mm and 4 31 mm for catchments with low medium and higher fs fig 6 respectively the κ was 0 13 0 11 and 0 90 and ze was 396 mm 321 mm 303 mm for catchments with low medium and higher fs respectively fig 6 as predicted higher n distributions were observed near water limited boundaries which were consistent with theoretical derivations associated with the budyko equation i e the higher the n the higher the e p which was deduced from choudhury s equation 1999 n 2 29 fig 5a to further evaluate ecohydrological processual effects on catchment parameters we investigated the relationship between α κ and ze with nonlinear fitted n in all 1576 catchments fig 5b d for α it generally increased with an increase in p q ep particularly at the time when linear fitted slopes reached 4 72 when p q ep was 0 4 fig 5b interestingly lower α were observed when p q ep ranged from 4 to 4 5 and near the water limited line moreover κ first increased with an increase in p q ep reaching a peak when p q ep was approximately 0 6 and then decreased with an increase in p q ep fig 5c the distribution of ze exhibited an increasing trend with an increase in p q ep particularly at the time when ze values were observed near the right hand boundary and near the water limited line fig 5d interestingly catchment n and the ecohydrological parameters α κ and ze increased with increasing fs values for example catchment n values were 2 30 2 23 and 1 96 in the lower medium and higher fs regions respectively fig 7 shows the sensitivity of n to α κ and ze which was assessed by eqs 23 25 the catchment parameter n was more sensitive to ze 4 11 followed by α 2 54 and κ 1 28 moreover n was more sensitive to α near the left hand water limited line when p q ep was 0 6 fig 7a for κ the sensitivity of n to κ showed a decreasing trend with an increase in p q ep fig 7b overall the distribution pattern of ze was similar to α and higher ze sensitivity was observed near the left hand water limited line fig 7c interestingly although n exhibited greater sensitivity to ze followed by α and κ in different fs regions n was more sensitive to ecohydrological parameters α κ and ze in regions with higher fs fig 8 overall the sensitivity coefficient of n to α increased with an increase in p q ep while the opposite trend was observed for changes in κ and ze with an increase in p q ep fig 7 by applying the simple linear ramp function i e a method used to scale the impact of each factor between 0 and 1 depending on the threshold at which ranges of q to changes in α κ and ze were defined the sensitivity of α κ and ze was scaled between 0 and 1 depending on the minimum and maximum thresholds among these indices n was extremely sensitive to α in 65 of the catchments while ze controlled 22 and κ in 13 of catchments fig 7d 4 discussion 4 1 explication for deviations in the budyko curve our above results show that the budyko framework incorporating fs can improve accuracy in describing catchment hydrological behaviors fig 2 in fact after being motivated by the initial success in describing water balances at larger spatial and temporal scales using the budyko hypothesis numerous efforts have been conducted to endow physical attributes to the budyko framework in describing catchment hydrological behaviors e g zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2009 donohue et al 2012 mianabadi et al 2020 considering the deviation between observed variability and the budyko curve explanations can be categorized as follows i climate variability e g seasonal variation in energy and water including the fs berghuijs et al 2014b zhang et al 2015a overall an increase in fs will inevitably lead to a reduction in e p and an increase in q p showed in fig 3e e g q p is 0 41 0 43 and 0 62 for catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 fs 0 5 respectively fig 4 which is consistent berghuijs et al 2014b ii physical catchment processes can also result in deviations i e the plant available water coefficient κ the soil moisture holding capacity water storage and landscapes e g zhang et al 2001 sankarasubramanian vogel 2003 greve et al 2016 berghuijs woods 2016 as shown in fig 5c κ combined with α and ze can reflect the effects of ecohydrological parameter on partitioning of p and iii this is also the case for vegetation functions e g vegetation cover ze and the leaf area index i e donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the budyko framework incorporating parameters that reflect catchment physical and ecohydrological attributes provides an effective way to reduce systemic errors by reflecting the variability among catchments e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 mianabadi et al 2020 for example the bcp fs model provides higher agreement with qob compared to the original bcp model as showed in fig 2a b and fig 4a b in addition to nagnitude of fs snowmelt regimes e g snowmelt rate timing of snowmelt also play a role in altering catchment hydrological behaviors and controlling the q response to external forcing e g trujillo molotch 2014 barnhart et al 2016 liu et al 2022 for example snowmelt rate of a catchment with a high fs is more rapid than that in a catchment with a low fs and rapid snowmelt would generate more excess soil water i e more surface flow and less partioning to evaporation that further increases the streamflow trujillo molotch 2014 this mechanism has been used to explain the positive relation between normalized mean annual streamflow q p and fs barnhart et al 2016 as changing fs plays a complex role in regulating catchment available energy and available water asymmetric hydrological effects of fs in wet and dry years has also been reported that is streamflow increases in wet years and decreases in dry years when fs increases liu et al 2022 generally streamflow variability in water limited environment amplified the percentage changes in precipitation chiew et al 2006 saft et al 2015 which resulted in a larger divergence from a budyko type curve as showed in fig 2d endowing budyko framework with specific physical and ecohydrological processes will help us elucidate the catchment hydrological behavior in a changing world e g liu et al 2019 for example sankarasubramanian et al 2020 extended the supply and demand concept of the budyko framework for anthropogenically altered catchments and landscapes to describe spatiotemporal land surface flux variability and vegetation functions i e vegetation cover ze and the leaf area index 4 2 hydrological response to vegetation variation vegetation plays a vital role in regulating hydrologic partitioning by altering the leaf area the physiological capacity and the rooting depth i e donohue et al 2007 ye et al 2015 as shown in fig 5d p q ep increased with an increase in ze which indicated that deeper root systems allow plants to access more soil moisture subsequently avoiding water stress for longer periods during drought events yang et al 2016 traditionally functional vegetation effects combined with climate change and physical catchment processes were used to explain physical and ecohydrological conditions in determining adjustable parameters e g zhou et al 2015 while estimating parameters using nonlinear fitting or regression methods e g yang et al 2009 for example the empirical formula of parameter n in choudhury s equation 1999 used the relative infiltration capacity vegetation cover and the average slope by applying stepwise regression to analyze regional water balances yang et al 2009 while the hydrological regulation of vegetation at annual or inter annual timescales is not currently fully understood we know that temperature and solar radiation and water interact which enforces complex and varying limitations on vegetation activity nemani et al 2003 liu et al 2016 thus making the hydrological regulation of vegetation more uncertain for example an increase in the intensity and frequency of meteorological drought will weaken plant processes i e photosynthesis vanlerberghe et al 2016 and reduce terrestrial ecosystem evapotranspiration processes joo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 through means of disturbing the distribution of the water balance as well as carbon and water cycling paths furthermore ecosystem restoration and reclamation activities e g the grain for green program in loess plateau of china can dramatically alter vegetation structure and functions ultimately inducing hydrological alterations at both temporal and spatial scales mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7d changes in α will control the catchment parameter n in 65 of studied catchments as it pertains to ze this is mainly represented by the effects of a combination of ecohydrological process e g the growing season a and κ in controlling hydrological behavior guswa 2008 in other words changes in ze are extremely small moreover α was more unsteady compared to other variables namely a 1 mm change in α constituted a reasonably large proportion of average q donohue et al 2012 furthermore errors in the sensitivity coefficients as pointed by yang et al 2014 could be caused by ignoring the higher orders of the taylor expansion in the first order taylor approximation in addition uncertainties in the sensitivity coefficients calculated from equation 21 can also be caused by i effects of changes in α κ and ze on sensitivity coefficient ii changes ϕ was regarded as constant in deducing sensitivity coefficient which also can bring uncertainty in describing effects of ecohydrological parameters on n 4 3 uncertainty in deducing the contribution of the catchment parameter it is noteworthy that spatiotemporal asymmetry undermines water yield assessments berghuijs woods 2016 in most cases the

processes and catchment parameters were also investigated in 1576 catchments globally as predicted by incorporating the fs and ecohydrological processes in regulating water and energy the budyko hypothesis can be used to help capture regional dynamic water balances changes of fs reflecting changes in water and energy regimes will dramatically alter water balance due to high sensitivity of q to fs generally higher fs produces higher streamflow q and vice versa i e the mean p q p was 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with lower medium and higher fs respectively in this study ecohydrological parameters i e storm depth α plant available water holding capacity κ and the effective rooting depth ze had a complex regulatory effect on choudhury s catchment parameter n in p partitioning according to the ramp function α ze and κ controlled 65 22 and 13 of catchment parameters respectively in regulating q in the 1576 catchments selected for this study undoubtedly some uncertainty remains in determining ecohydrological processes however it is worth noting that non steady states under the budyko framework incorporating ecohydrological processes will help to capture hydrological behavior while also helping us to better understand hydrological regulations resulting from climate change and anthropogenic activities credit authorship contribution statement qiang liu

3276,understanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences furthermore improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application this study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction fs and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter n within the budyko framework employing 1576 globally investigated catchments results showed that the budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors ns 0 76 rmse 181 01 mm a 1 when incorporating the fs compared with no snow fraction incorporated it ns 0 54 rmse 248 85 mm a 1 especially for catchments with higher fs in these catchments a higher fs was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow q while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation e p under the budyko framework n and fs distribution generally exhibited opposite trends moreover higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries while higher fs represented lower p q p i e the mean p q p was 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with lower fs 0 15 medium 0 15 fs 0 50 and higher fs 0 50 fs statistical relationships among ecohydrological processes and catchment parameter suggested that i higher storm depth α generally indicated higher normalized mean q ii a higher plant available water

by 65 22 and 13 respectively in all catchments the ecohydrological processes incorporated into catchment parameters will broaden the ability of the budyko hypothesis to describe hydrological behavior

climate soil vegetation and terrestrial interactions berry et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014a liu et al 2016 yang et al 2021a traditionally hydrological behavior has been extrapolated under the assumption that catchments regulate their own stability or stationarity for example under the budyko hypothesis long term water balance is used to limit the effects of a non stationarity catchment state changes in catchment water storage are be negligible budyko 1974 in this way the budyko framework has been successfully applied to water partitioning as a function of the relative magnitude of water supplies and available energy e g yang et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2017 however for water balance at regional scales important challenges exist in explaining the non stationarity of climate and other associated catchment characteristics i e vegetation and the soil water holding capacity e g chiew et al 2013 saft et al 2015 saft et al 2016 firstly changes to precipitation p regimes i e intensity frequency and the snow fraction fs compared to other factors under climate warming play a vital role in regulating streamflow q particularly perennial drought herein referred to as the p deficit has led to a shift in rainfall runoff partitioning from what was previously encountered during shorter drought events under considerably less predicted runoff saft et al 2016 meanwhile changes in p phases also play a critical role in the global hydrologic cycle and the climate system e g zhang et al 2015a jennings et al 2018 secondly vegetation which imposes complex and varying limitations through its interactions with temperature as well as solar radiation and water regulates the partitioning of p into q and evapotranspiration et nemani et al 2003 donohue et al 2007 2010 penuelas et al 2009 zhang et al 2015b since the 1980s a greening trend has been observed in vegetation in most regions around the world zhu et al 2016 piao et al 2019 as a consequence of anthropogenic induced climate change e g carbon dioxide co2 fertilization effects caused by elevated co2 concentrations zhu et al 2016 and intensifying anthropogenic activities e g the revegetation of china s loess plateau feng et al 2016 finally physical catchment characteristics i e soil porosity infiltration rate catchment slope and catchment storage which were traditionally assumed to be under a steady state control both hydrological processes and hydrological responses sankarasubramanian vogel 2003 yang et al 2006 variability in catchment storage resulting from intensifying anthropogenic activities i e groundwater pumping and the building of reservoirs under a background of climate change has led to complex hydrological responses on both regional and global scales mao et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 long et al 2020 yang et al 2021b additionally catchment storage dynamics control the hydrological connectivity among different landscape components carrer et al 2019 which precipitates a threshold in the regulation of q response spence 2007 yang et al 2017 along these lines ecohydrological processes have been incorporated into the budyko framework equipping it with a new physical perception and broadening its application in describing hydrological behavior in a non stationary world e g donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 moussa lhomme 2016

framework to explain its effects on regional water balances deducing that a p shift from snow to rain causes a decrease in q berghuijs et al 2014b zhang et al 2015a previous studies found a lower fs

to the sinusoidal shape of the annual cycle of temperature evan eisenman 2021 q response with fs alteration is still highly uncertain for example the positive relationship between q variability and fs may have resulted from asymmetric hydrological effects of snowfall in the wet and dry years liu et al 2022 motivated by the initial success in describing regional water balances the objectives of this study were i to incorporate the fs into the budyko framework and to assess its global application ii to estimate the sensitivity of q to the fs and iii to explore catchment parameter n response to the fs and its statistical relationship to ecohydrological processes in 1576 catchments globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background of the budyko hypothesis following schreiber 1904 and ol dekop 1911 budyko 1948 1974 developed a hydroclimatic framework to predict the partitioning of catchment p into q and evaporation e under average climatic conditions this framework partitions the steady state water balance as a function of the relative magnitudes of water supply and energy supply usually expressed as potential evaporation ep which can be expressed as follows 1 e p e p p t a n h p e p 1 e x p e p p to broaden the budyko framework adjustable catchment parameters were incorporated into it e g fu et al 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 among of formulations some of them were analytically derived from simple physical assumptions e g mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008 the analytical equation for the budyko framework explored by mezentsev 1955 and choudhury s 1999 can be expressed 2 e p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is the catchment parameter choudhury s 1999 equation is used to deduce catchment parameters applying the nonlinear fitting method ignoring storage changes donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 the steady state water balance model can be expressed by the following equation 3 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n donohue et al 2012 based on porporato et al s 2004 ecohydrological model estimated choudhury s n by considering the effects of the effective rooting depth ze the mean storm depth α and the fractional plant available water holding capacity κ and deduced the relationship between n and these three variables as follows yang et al 2016 4 n a l o g γ 2 b l o g γ c where 5 α 0 003 log 2 0 247 l o g 0 190 6 b 0 022 0 403 7 c 0 071 log 2 0 332 l o g

choudhury porporato model bcp model liu et al 2016 later extended the steady state bcp model by incorporating dynamic ecohydrological processes into it and then combining it with a typical soil water balance bucket model manabe 1969 which subsequently resulted in the dynamic bcp or dbcp model see donohue et al 2012 and liu et al 2016 for more detail on the bcp model or the dbcp model accounting for snowmelt i e melting energy rm and the effective energy available for et zhang et al 2015 designed an equation to estimate the melting energy and the effective energy available for et eq 2 9 r m ρ

kj kg 1 according to ding et al 2014 the overlapping range of the daily mean air temperature tm i e from 0 5 c to 5 c was set to isolate p into the rain sleet and snow this study adopted the empirical discrimination scheme ding et al 2014 derived from 110 000 samples collected from different climate regimes and elevations across china between 1951 and 1979 sleet was then separated into rain and snow as the linearly dependent function of their variables air temperature p was categorized according to the following 11 t y p e s n o w i f t m t m i n s n o w 2 9 t m 10 9 s l e e t r a i n 2 9 t

partitioning of snowmelt water into e and q can be explained i snowmelt rates in excess of e rate may bring the soil to field capacity facilitating below root zone percolation and streamflow anderson 1976 barnhart et al 2016 and ii surface flow is preferred during the snow melting period due to extremely low permeability for frozen ground dunne black 1971 there underlies complex mechanism in q generation with alteration of fs in different hydroclimatic conditions e g liu et al 2022 while rapid snowmelt rate increased with increasing fs trujillo molotch 2014 tends to cause higher q production following these mechanism we assume that most of snowmelt water converts to streamflow the effective available water for e at annual or mean annual scale is 1 fs p rather than total p zhang et al 2015 the bcp model can be revised as follows which is renamed as the bcp fs model in the following analyses 12 e 1 f s p e p 1 f s p n e p n 1 n 13 q p e p 1 f s p e p 1 f s p n e p n 1 n where fs is the snow fraction the p phase was calculated according to ding et al 2014 which was used to estimate fs the adjustable catchment parameter n for the 1576 catchments investigated in this study was subsequently estimated which was then used to explore statistical relationships with ecohydrological parameters i e α κ and ze the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients ns coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse slope of the linear fitted model and the coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate model performance between the bcp model and the bcp fs

simulated streamflow i is the ith catchment n is the number of catchments 2 2 estimation of effective rooting depth using guswa s carbon cost benefit model the ze was estimated using a carbon cost benefit model developed by guswa 2008 the fundamental assumption of guswa s model is if a plant can identify its root depth it will thus be able to delegate a trade off between the cost of adding deeper fine roots that will barely be counterbalanced by the benefit of the additional carbon that will be assimilated by captured auxiliary soil water 16 c z r 0 z r γ r d r lr d z r 17 b z r w u e f

following donohue et al 2012 changes to the catchment parameter n also can be shown as follows 21 dn n α d α n κ d κ n z e d z e n ϕ d ϕ where the direct sensitivity of n to changes in α κ and ze can be isolated as follows 22 n α 2 0 003 log 2 0 247 l o g 0 190 α 0 022 0 403 α 23 n κ 2 0 003 log 2 0 247 l o g 0 190 κ 0 022 0 403 κ 24 n z e 2 0 003 log 2 0 247 l o g 0 190 z e 0 022 0 403 z e 2 4 the ramp function method simple linear ramp functions have been developed to scale the impact of each factor between 0 and 1 depending on the threshold nemani et al 2003 in this study we used simple linear ramp functions to scale the impacts of α κ and ze on n thresholds were defined as the maximum and minimum sensitivity coefficient values of α κ and ze at a global scale 25 v i x i x min x max x min where vi is the impact variable on n ranging from 0 to 1 xi is the sensitivity coefficient of α κ and ze xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum values of the sensitivity coefficients for α κ and ze respectively 2 5 data description we collected daily or monthly q observations from 3347 catchments globally from the three following databases i the united states geological survey usgs

the global runoff data centre https www bafg de grdc lehner 2012 and iii a compilation of q data and associated boundaries from 321 australian catchments reported by peel et al 2000 the 1576 catchments shown in fig 1 were selected from all available catchments however we only included those that satisfied the following criteria i catchments with areas between 10 km2 10 000 km2 to reduce channel routing effects van dijk et al 2013 ii catchments that included 2 of urban area based on the globcover v2 map bontemps et al 2011 and catchments that included 2 of irrigated area using the global irrigated area map https www iwmigiam org siebert et al 2005 iii catchments that included a dam or reservoir capacity of 10 annual q iv catchments that included snowfall fs 5 daily p ep and air

ze calculations were deduced from monthly gross primary productivity gpp data jung et al 2011 using the method reported by wu et al 2014 the period between which gpp initially and ultimately reached its monthly maximum 3 results 3 1 incorporating the snow fraction fs into the budyko framework verification of the budyko model incorporating the fs was evaluated by comparing qsim from the original bcp model and the bcp fs model the bcp fs model provided better q estimation results as well as better captured q dynamics on a mean annual scale with a slope of 0 82 r 2 0 79 compared with slope of 0 66 r 2 0 81 for original bcp model fig 2 the ns coefficient and rmse of the bcp fs model were 0 76 and 181 01 mm a 1 respectively fig 2 which indicated that the bcp fs model was better than the original bcp model in describing hydrological behavior thus incorporating the fs improved agreement in describing hydrological behavior of the budyko framework with observed data the bcp fs model was further evaluated using various fs and the dryness indexes ep p fig 2c d as predicted the budyko model incorporating the fs provided stratified simulated results with fs increased from 0 15 to 0 5 i e fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 50 and fs 0 50 slope were 0 73 0 86 and 0 95 ns were 0 64 0 83 and 0 60 respectively it is interesting to note that the relationship between qob and qsim in catchments with ep p 1 presented more accurate results with a slope of 0 83 r 2 0 74 num 576 compared to water limited catchments with a slope of 0 81 r 2 0 42 num 1000 and the ns coefficient reached 0 67 and 0 40 for catchments with ep p 1 and ep p 1 respectively 3 2 streamflow q sensitivity to precipitation p regimes the catchments stratified by fs exhibited a decrease in mean normalized evaporation p q p values with an increase in the fs for example mean p q p values were 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with an fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 50 and fs 0 5 respectively fig 3 a additionally the fs reflected the effects of actual water and energy conditions while lower fs was observed on the left hand and near to the water limited line generally higher fs is associated with lower e p normalized evaporation e p and higher normalized mean streamflow q p overall observation patterns were consistent with the budyko curve interestingly sensitivity coefficients of q to the fs qfs under the budyko framework showed that qfs ranged from 539 mm 1 0 15 fs 0 50 to 606 mm 1 fs 0 5 which means alteration of fs can dramatically alter p partitioning fig 3b as expected normalized mean streamflow q p from bcp fs model presented clear stratification pattern compared to original bcp model higher fs meant higher normalized mean streamflow fig 4 a b and more accurate hydrological behavior slope 0 84 were captured compared with the tenuous relationship described by original bcp model slope 0 54 fig 3c d interestingly q p were underestimated with small magnitude between different fs catchments e g 0 26 0 26 and 0 25 in catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 and fs 0 5 respectively fig 4c on the contrary the bcp fs model captured effects of fs on water balances with 0 30 0 42 and 0 65 for catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 and fs 0 5 respectively in all this was particularly true for the bcp fs model which underestimated q p by only 0 03 for catchments with fs 0 05 compared to the original bcp model which underestimated q p by approx 0 19 3 3 catchment parameter n response to the snow fraction fs and associated statistical relationships with ecohydrological processes fig 5 shows the distributions of n and ecohydrological parameter e g α κ and ze across the 1576 catchments within the budyko framework interestingly α κ and ze exhibited decreasing trends under an increasing fs for example α was 6 57 mm 4 95 mm and 4 31 mm for catchments with low medium and higher fs fig 6 respectively the κ was 0 13 0 11 and 0 90 and ze was 396 mm 321 mm 303 mm for catchments with low medium and higher fs respectively fig 6 as predicted higher n distributions were observed near water limited boundaries which were consistent with theoretical derivations associated with the budyko equation i e the higher the n the higher the e p which was deduced from choudhury s equation 1999 n 2 29 fig 5a to further evaluate ecohydrological processual effects on catchment parameters we investigated the relationship between α κ and ze with nonlinear fitted n in all 1576 catchments fig 5b d for α it generally increased with an increase in p q ep particularly at the time when linear fitted slopes reached 4 72 when p q ep was 0 4 fig 5b interestingly lower α were observed when p q ep ranged from 4 to 4 5 and near the water limited line moreover κ first increased with an increase in p q ep reaching a peak when p q ep was approximately 0 6 and then decreased with an increase in p q ep fig 5c the distribution of ze exhibited an increasing trend with an increase in p q ep particularly at the time when ze values were observed near the right hand boundary and near the water limited line fig 5d interestingly catchment n and the ecohydrological parameters α κ and ze increased with increasing fs values for example catchment n values were 2 30 2 23 and 1 96 in the lower medium and higher fs regions respectively fig 7 shows the sensitivity of n to α κ and ze which was assessed by eqs 23 25 the catchment parameter n was more sensitive to ze 4 11 followed by α 2 54 and κ 1 28 moreover n was more sensitive to α near the left hand water limited line when p q ep was 0 6 fig 7a for κ the sensitivity of n to κ showed a decreasing trend with an increase in p q ep fig 7b overall the distribution pattern of ze was similar to α and higher ze sensitivity was observed near the left hand water limited line fig 7c interestingly although n exhibited greater sensitivity to ze followed by α and κ in different fs regions n was more sensitive to ecohydrological parameters α κ and ze in regions with higher fs fig 8 overall the sensitivity coefficient of n to α increased with an increase in p q ep while the opposite trend was observed for changes in κ and ze with an increase in p q ep fig 7 by applying the simple linear ramp function i e a method used to scale the impact of each factor between 0 and 1 depending on the threshold at which ranges of q to changes in α κ and ze were defined the sensitivity of α κ and ze was scaled between 0 and 1 depending on the minimum and maximum thresholds among these indices n was extremely sensitive to α in 65 of the catchments while ze controlled 22 and κ in 13 of catchments fig 7d 4 discussion 4 1 explication for deviations in the budyko curve our above results show that the budyko framework incorporating fs can improve accuracy in describing catchment hydrological behaviors fig 2 in fact after being motivated by the initial success in describing water balances at larger spatial and temporal scales using the budyko hypothesis numerous efforts have been conducted to endow physical attributes to the budyko framework in describing catchment hydrological behaviors e g zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2009 donohue et al 2012 mianabadi et al 2020 considering the deviation between observed variability and the budyko curve explanations can be categorized as follows i climate variability e g seasonal variation in energy and water including the fs berghuijs et al 2014b zhang et al 2015a overall an increase in fs will inevitably lead to a reduction in e p and an increase in q p showed in fig 3e e g q p is 0 41 0 43 and 0 62 for catchments with fs 0 15 0 15 fs 0 5 fs 0 5 respectively fig 4 which is consistent berghuijs et al 2014b ii physical catchment processes can also result in deviations i e the plant available water coefficient κ the soil moisture holding capacity water storage and landscapes e g zhang et al 2001 sankarasubramanian vogel 2003 greve et al 2016 berghuijs woods 2016 as shown in fig 5c κ combined with α and ze can reflect the effects of ecohydrological parameter on partitioning of p and iii this is also the case for vegetation functions e g vegetation cover ze and the leaf area index i e donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the budyko framework incorporating parameters that reflect catchment physical and ecohydrological attributes provides an effective way to reduce systemic errors by reflecting the variability among catchments e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 mianabadi et al 2020 for example the bcp fs model provides higher agreement with qob compared to the original bcp model as showed in fig 2a b and fig 4a b in addition to nagnitude of fs snowmelt regimes e g snowmelt rate timing of snowmelt also play a role in altering catchment hydrological behaviors and controlling the q response to external forcing e g trujillo molotch 2014 barnhart et al 2016 liu et al 2022 for example snowmelt rate of a catchment with a high fs is more rapid than that in a catchment with a low fs and rapid snowmelt would generate more excess soil water i e more surface flow and less partioning to evaporation that further increases the streamflow trujillo molotch 2014 this mechanism has been used to explain the positive relation between normalized mean annual streamflow q p and fs barnhart et al 2016 as changing fs plays a complex role in regulating catchment available energy and available water asymmetric hydrological effects of fs in wet and dry years has also been reported that is streamflow increases in wet years and decreases in dry years when fs increases liu et al 2022 generally streamflow variability in water limited environment amplified the percentage changes in precipitation chiew et al 2006 saft et al 2015 which resulted in a larger divergence from a budyko type curve as showed in fig 2d endowing budyko framework with specific physical and ecohydrological processes will help us elucidate the catchment hydrological behavior in a changing world e g liu et al 2019 for example sankarasubramanian et al 2020 extended the supply and demand concept of the budyko framework for anthropogenically altered catchments and landscapes to describe spatiotemporal land surface flux variability and vegetation functions i e vegetation cover ze and the leaf area index 4 2 hydrological response to vegetation variation vegetation plays a vital role in regulating hydrologic partitioning by altering the leaf area the physiological capacity and the rooting depth i e donohue et al 2007 ye et al 2015 as shown in fig 5d p q ep increased with an increase in ze which indicated that deeper root systems allow plants to access more soil moisture subsequently avoiding water stress for longer periods during drought events yang et al 2016 traditionally functional vegetation effects combined with climate change and physical catchment processes were used to explain physical and ecohydrological conditions in determining adjustable parameters e g zhou et al 2015 while estimating parameters using nonlinear fitting or regression methods e g yang et al 2009 for example the empirical formula of parameter n in choudhury s equation 1999 used the relative infiltration capacity vegetation cover and the average slope by applying stepwise regression to analyze regional water balances yang et al 2009 while the hydrological regulation of vegetation at annual or inter annual timescales is not currently fully understood we know that temperature and solar radiation and water interact which enforces complex and varying limitations on vegetation activity nemani et al 2003 liu et al 2016 thus making the hydrological regulation of vegetation more uncertain for example an increase in the intensity and frequency of meteorological drought will weaken plant processes i e photosynthesis vanlerberghe et al 2016 and reduce terrestrial ecosystem evapotranspiration processes joo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 through means of disturbing the distribution of the water balance as well as carbon and water cycling paths furthermore ecosystem restoration and reclamation activities e g the grain for green program in loess plateau of china can dramatically alter vegetation structure and functions ultimately inducing hydrological alterations at both temporal and spatial scales mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7d changes in α will control the catchment parameter n in 65 of studied catchments as it pertains to ze this is mainly represented by the effects of a combination of ecohydrological process e g the growing season a and κ in controlling hydrological behavior guswa 2008 in other words changes in ze are extremely small moreover α was more unsteady compared to other variables namely a 1 mm change in α constituted a reasonably large proportion of average q donohue et al 2012 furthermore errors in the sensitivity coefficients as pointed by yang et al 2014 could be caused by ignoring the higher orders of the taylor expansion in the first order taylor approximation in addition uncertainties in the sensitivity coefficients calculated from equation 21 can also be caused by i effects of changes in α κ and ze on sensitivity coefficient ii changes ϕ was regarded as constant in deducing sensitivity coefficient which also can bring uncertainty in describing effects of ecohydrological parameters on n 4 3 uncertainty in deducing the contribution of the catchment parameter it is noteworthy that spatiotemporal asymmetry undermines water yield assessments berghuijs woods 2016 in most cases the budyko framework focused on natural basins and assumed that catchment storage at a mean annual scale was negligible sankarasubramanian et al 2020 while the budyko framework as it is described in the original monograph climate and life considered anthropogenic influences on climate including reservoir storage and irrigation effects on et budyko 1974 in fact anthropogenic activities e g constructed reservoirs groundwater pumping practices have dramatically altered the groundwater levels and associated storage and inevitable resulted in the changes in catchment et e g mao et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 furthermore an increase in both the frequency and the severity of drought under a background of climate warming is forecasted to take place in many terrestrial regions particularly temperate zones dai et al 2012 wu et al 2018 wilcox et al 2020 in this context rainfall runoff partitioning triggered by a certain threshold associated with the water storage capacity of a catchment spence 2007 can shift alongside shifts in climate conditions e g multiyear drought events saft et al 2016 uncertainty in the status of catchments caused by climate change and anthropogenic activities will inevitably result in steady state deviations in the budyko framework kampf et al 2020 as predicted the role of κ was vital in determining n approx 13 in fig 7d therefore κ should be assessed on finer spatial and temporal scales to reflect actual catchment storage capacities furthermore changes in the cryosphere that include frozen soil snowmelt and glacial melting rates a shift in p from snow to rain under a background of climate warming shown in figs 3 4 and the response of vegetation to climate change e g elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations and an increase in drought intensity and severity e g liu et al 2016 andresen et al 2016 can also weaken steady state conditions as per the assumption of the traditional budyko framework the non steady state of a catchment brings uncertainties and may reduce the accuracy in applying the budyko framework kampf et al 2020 for example alteration of streamflow with changes in snowfall may relate to complex physical and biophysical processes e g changes in the infiltration capacity of soils the growing season length and the duration of infiltration periods berghuijs et al 2015 the budyko framework incorporated with catchment

reflected the changes of catchment storage using the ze and κ there are several limitations that required additional research these include but are not limited to i catchment water storage e g daly et al 2019 ii changes of frozen soil and snowmelt and glacial melting rates barnhart et al 2016 liu et al 2016 and iii physiological and ecological response of vegetation to climate changes e g long term drought elevated co2 concentration e g cheng et al 2017 furthermore improved the bcp fs model incorporated physical catchment property parameter n would be help to understand the hydrological behavior especially in the ungagged catchment 5 conclusions this study investigated snow fraction effects i e snow fraction fs on the budyko framework moreover statistical relationships between ecohydrological processes and catchment parameters were also investigated in 1576 catchments globally as predicted by incorporating the fs and ecohydrological processes in regulating water and energy the budyko hypothesis can be used to help capture regional dynamic water balances changes of fs reflecting changes in water and energy regimes will dramatically alter water balance due to high sensitivity of q to fs generally higher fs produces higher streamflow q and vice versa i e the mean p q p was 0 59 0 57 and 0 38 for catchments with lower medium and higher fs respectively in this study ecohydrological parameters i e storm depth α plant available water holding capacity κ and the effective rooting depth ze had a complex regulatory effect on choudhury s catchment parameter n in p partitioning according to the ramp function α ze and κ controlled 65 22 and 13 of catchment parameters respectively in regulating q in the 1576 catchments selected for this study undoubtedly some uncertainty remains in determining ecohydrological processes however it is worth noting that non steady states under the budyko framework incorporating ecohydrological processes will help to capture hydrological behavior while also helping us to better understand hydrological regulations resulting from climate change and anthropogenic activities credit authorship contribution statement qiang liu

3277,reference crop evapotranspiration eto is a key factor for estimating crop water requirements which guide agricultural irrigation to improve the accuracy of predicting eto in different climate zones in china that lack meteorological data an eto hybrid model based on k nearest neighbour knn machine learning algorithm for extracting factor contribution rates is proposed in this study meteorological factors with large contribution rates were selected as input and a prediction model for eto was established using the elman daily eto prediction model the eto prediction model was optimised using three optimisation algorithms genetic optimization algorithm ga cuckoo optimization algorithm cs and whale optimization algorithm woa to improve the accuracy of eto prediction the results revealed that surface radiation rs is the most important factor in estimating eto contribution rate 0 392 0 626 followed by temperature factors t including maximum minimum and average temperatures and each model has the highest accuracy with the input combination of rs and t for the different machine learning models the cs elman model had the highest accuracy rmse 0 468 2 235 r2 0 567 0 928 mae 0 363 1 343 and nse 0 345 0 923 and the machine learning model had higher accuracy than the experience model the cs elman model performed more favourably in tropical monsoon and subtropical monsoon regions than that in other areas and the model performed best at the junction of two climatic zones the results can provide a theoretical basis for high precision prediction of eto in different climate zones in china keywords reference crop evapotranspiration elman algorithm hybrid optimisation algorithm k nearest neighbour algorithm climate zones in china 1 introduction eto is a key factor in assessing crop water requirements and is a required parameter in various fields such as hydrology meteorology and agriculture akpootu and iliyasu 2017 accurate estimation of eto can improve crop irrigation decision making and regional water resource management balve and patel 2016 although traditional evapotranspiration monitoring systems can provide high precision evapotranspiration data these systems are expensive and cannot be widely implemented thus scholars have developed simple models based on meteorological data to enable the estimation of eto at a low cost of these models the fao 56pm model is the most accurate in estimating eto and the united nations food and agriculture organization recommends it as a standard method for such estimation however the fao 56 pm model requires numerous parameters for calculation of eto such as sunshine duration air temperature radiation humidity and other meteorological factors in several applications of the fao 56pm model some of the aforementioned meteorological data were missing from stations reports which affected calculations djaman et al 2016 dou yang 2018 in situations in which some meteorological data were unavailable several scholars applied simpler empirical models for the prediction of eto such as the radiation based priestley taylor model and the temperature based hargreaves samani model feng et al 2016 however these empirical models could not predict eto with high accuracy feng et al 2017a b by contrast machine learning models can adequately evaluate nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables and they have been applied in many studies involving the estimation of eto abdullah et al 2015 machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate daily eto with higher estimation accuracy than that of empirical models such as the hargreaves samani tabari and makkink models fan et al 2019 feng et al 2019a b c gao et al 2016 moreover in the absence of some meteorological variables the results of machine learning models for eto estimation are more robust than those of empirical formulas zhu et al 2020 farias et al demonstrated that in the absence of some meteorological variables the results of machine learning methods are more consistent than those of empirical formulas farias et al 2020 elman neural network is based on the neural network with additional local feedback with strong computing power and network stability and the algorithm has a very wide range of applications so this study uses the more advantageous elman algorithm to build the eto model however when eto machine learning models are developed selection of relevant factors is mostly based on experience it lacks a theoretical basis therefore to reduce calculation costs the key factors affecting eto prediction must be identified the linear contribution rate can be calculated by selecting the principal factors for example path analysis can be employed to determine the dominant meteorological factors that affect eto xing et al 2016 or principal component analysis and feature importance analysis can be employed to calculate the sensitivity of meteorological parameters with respect to eto munawar and wang 2020 in recent years significance analysis based on machine learning was applied for the selection of main factors affecting eto and machine learning has a good performance in dealing with nonlinear problems mohammadi mehdizadeh 2020 neural networks use multi layer network design to build models for prediction and the developed models have the advantages of low parameter input nonlinearity and simple model structure which have certain advantages in machine learning algorithms zou et al 2010 for example yan et al established a soil moisture prediction model based on bp neural network and obtained high accuracy ge et al 2010 while the elman neural network is based on the neural network with an additional local feedback which makes it better than the neural network in terms of computational power and network stability so this study uses the more advantageous elman algorithm to build the eto model however because machine learning model parameters are not optimised eto prediction models based on machine learning still have low accuracy therefore to achieve satisfactory results model parameters must be optimised zhao et al 2021 several scholars have applied optimisation algorithms to optimise model parameters and to develop mixed models which have somewhat improved model accuracy particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm was able to optimise the weight and threshold between the input and hidden layers and thereby improve the performance of extreme learning machine elm algorithms liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 yan et al used a whale optimisation algorithm woa to construct an eto model to estimate eto at eight stations in arid and humid regions of china and the woa xgb model demonstrated advantages compared with previous optimisation models yan et al 2020 the genetic algorithm ga and cuckoo search cs algorithm have also demonstrated favourable performance for parameter optimisation leading to considerable improvements in model efficiency and accuracy mohd et al 2013 the ga has a simple process with better results and faster optimization with fewer parameters the woa is easy to understand and implement and generalized and the two optimization algorithms have been widely used in previous studies therefore in order to construct an eto prediction model with higher accuracy this study uses these two optimization algorithms to optimize the weights and thresholds of the elman model the cs has fewer and simpler parameters compared with the genetic algorithm and the whale optimization algorithm and the search mechanism is more effective and less likely to fall into local optimal solutions because the step size of the lévy flight followed by the cuckoo in the algorithm satisfies the stable distribution of heavy tail in summary ga cs and woa are selected in this study in this study to develop a model with high precision prediction of eto requiring fewer factors key meteorological factors recorded at 16 chinese weather stations under different climatic conditions were integrated with the elman hybrid optimisation algorithm to determine eto the purpose of this study was 1 to screen key meteorological parameters that affect eto by using the knn machine learning algorithm 2 to develop an independent elman model and a hybrid optimisation model based on the combination of key factors that affect eto to estimate eto and 3 to comprehensively compare the performance of different eto models in different climate zones in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area climate zones in china can be categorised into temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz tropical monsoon zone tpmz and subtropical monsoon zone smz as presented in fig 1 the tcz zone is located inland it is dry with an average annual precipitation of less than 500 mm which mainly occurs in summer the tmz is characterised by short term drought in spring and autumn and long cold winters more than 70 of the annual precipitation in the tmz occurs in june august the average temperature in the hottest month is 20 mpz and the average altitude of the climatic zone is over 4000 m this results in low year round temperatures abundant sunshine and less than 400 mm of annual average precipitation the tpmz has high temperatures throughout the year and the average temperature in the coldest month is over 18 c precipitation mainly occurs in summer with an annual precipitation of 1500 2000 mm in most areas by comparison the smz is affected by differences in sea and land temperatures in summer and by the cold winds of siberia in winter the four seasons in the smz are distinct although rain and high temperatures occur in all seasons the average amount of annual precipitation decreases from southeast coast to its northwest inland and the difference between day and night temperatures is large 2 2 data collection data from 16 typical weather stations alshan

dongfang 59838 were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn in this paper we use five fold cross validation for prediction analysis of eto five fold cross validation is often used for error assessment and the process is to divide the data into five equal parts take one copy of each experiment as the test set and use the remaining years as the training set and finally combine the results for error analysis of the model daily surface climatic data sets from 1960 to 2019 comprising mean temperature tmean maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed at

evapotranspiration 2 3 1 fao 56pm the fao 56pm model was used to calculate the daily eto of the 16 meteorological stations in different climate zones in china which provided a basis for evaluation of

is a simple supervised learning algorithm for data classification the knn algorithm selects features by allocating samples from training data that is when a new sample appears in the allocated range the distance between the sample and the data set is calculated and the object is assigned to the class of its k nearest neighbour the knn model is locally approximate and all processes are submitted for classification no actual model or model learning is performed in the training phase although training the database is indispensable in knn it is used only to populate the search space sample with patterns of known classes because of this this algorithm is often referred to as the lazy learning algorithm saini et al 2013 as illustrated in the fig 2 when the selected sample is 3 the closest neighbours to the test point the green dot of the sample are one orange data set and two blue data sets when further refined based on the number of neighbour data sets the blue data sets are given priority however as indicated in the figure the orange data set is near to the test point therefore the neighbour must be determined based on weight in addition to number in such simple evaluations the reciprocal of the distance between the points can be used to reflect the weight which is calculated as follows 4 ω x x i e x p λ x x i 2 2 the procedure for calculating the importance of various meteorological factors is in the space composed of random variables x and y for a given n samples first find its k nearest neighbors and then find the number of other samples whose distances to the current sample in the x and y directions respectively are less than the maximum of the distances from the current sample to the k nearest neighbors and estimate the mutual information by the statistical number in this study the parameters were chosen with the values n informative 5 leaf size 30 euclidean metric p 2 ah e hegazy et al 2018 boulesteix and strobl 2009 the data source of the manuscript is day by day weather parameters from 1960 to 2019 as the knn algorithm for machine learning has superior results compared to linear feature correlation algorithm or nonlinear machine learning feature correlation algorithm for the processing of problems with large amount of data supporting nonlinear correlation between features and eto 2 5 machine learning model in this study elman woa elman ga elman cs elman models were constructed to predict eto woa ga and cs are used to improve the accuracy of the model by optimizing the initial thresholds and weights in the elman model the parameter values for the optimization of the three hybrid models are shown in fig 3 2 5 1 elman neural network the elman neural network is an optimisation of the back propagation bp neural network the elman neural network has favourable dynamic characteristics and strong global stability because it contains a context layer in the hidden layer of its feed forward neural network the elman neural network is widely adopted for nonlinear dynamic and complex data the structural diagram of the elman neural network is displayed as follows in fig 4 the mathematical model of the elman neural network is as follows 5 x k f w i 1 x c k w i 2 u k 1 6 x c k α x c k 1 x k 1 7 y k g w i 3 x k where w i 1 is the weight between the context layer and the hidden layer w i 2 is the weight between the input layer and the hidden layer w i 3 is the weight between the hidden layer and the output layer x c k and x k are the outputs of the context layer and the hidden layer respectively y k is the output of the output layer and α is the self connecting gain factor of the feedback layer 2 5 2 cs the cs is a new optimisation algorithm its development was inspired by cuckoo birds unique habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds the cs algorithm identifies the best nest location through iterative optimisation of the nest group the mantegna algorithm is then used to realise the stable distribution

they are social carnivores that prey on krill and small fish using bubble nets three mathematical models were developed by simulating the process of whales exploring hunting and surrounding prey the woa assumes the existence of a group of whales these whales in their hunting grounds hone in on the location of prey through communication with the location of prey corresponding to an optimal solution the mathematical model for surrounding the prey is 12 x t 1 x t a d a 2 a r a 13 d c x t x t c 2 â r where the t in eq 12 represents the current iteration number x t is the location of the prey and x t is the location of the whale both a and c are coefficient vectors the random value of r is 0 1 and a is the convergence factor which linearly decays from 2 to 0 with the number of iterations whale bubble net hunting involves manoeuvres in which whales encircle prey and contract that circle and swim in spirals around the prey accordingly in the shrinking encircling mechanism and spiral updating position of woa the convergence factor a is reduced to achieve a shrink wrap mechanism the spiral updating position algorithm is established by calculating the distance between the whale and its prey to mimic whales bubble net foraging the probability of selecting the constriction encircling mechanism and the spiral updating position to update the position of the whales is set

meteorological factors was analysed using the knn algorithm the results for the importance of these factors in different climatic zones are displayed in fig 6 these knn results were then used to obtain the degree of different parameter combinations contributions to eto which was then used as an input parameter in the eto forecasting model of the proposed hybrid elman algorithm as presented in fig 6 rs was the primary factor influencing eto prediction at almost all sites with the exception of the harbin site and its importance range was 0 391 0 884 many studies show that rs is a key calculation factor in fao 56pm and many other empirical models temperature was the second most important with an importance range of 0 1823 0 5122 previous studies have also demonstrated that t is an important meteorological factor affecting eto in constructing an eto model wu et al found the contribution rate of t to eto estimation to be very high wu et al 2019 the third most important influencing factor was different across climatic zones sunshine n was the third most important factor in the tpmz smz zone tmz and mpz its contribution ranged between 0 056 and 0 209 however in the tcz rh was the third most important factor and its importance ranged between 0 073 and 0 162 unlike other sites in the same climate zone at harbin station the contribution rate of temperature factors tmax tmin and tmean was higher than that of rs and the third most important factor was rh this may be because in spring and winter the temperature at the station increased and decreased rapidly which may have affected the calculations of the temperature contribution to the summer precipitation set in addition rh at harbin station increased to 77 78 in july and august although winter humidity and temperature was low humidity in the rest of the year was high which affected the temperature influence at this station several studies have also demonstrated that models established using n and rh factors can achieve higher accuracy for estimating eto xing et al 2016 the contribution rates of the top three factors were 0 805 1 216 rs t and rh and 0 819 1 184 rs t n on this basis the increases in contribution rates were small when other input factors were considered the obtained eto important influencing factors were used to develop a low factor eto prediction model table 2 3 2 analysis of daily eto forecast model a daily scale eto prediction model was constructed based on machine learning algorithms scatter plots of predicted et0 values using four models against their corresponding fao56 pm values are shown in appendix 2 the accuracy of four models elman cs elman woa elman and ga elman at different stations on a daily scale is displayed in fig 7 and the specific accuracy indicators are listed in appendix 1 as indicated in the figure although only a single factor rs was input the precision of the elman model was within the expected range of estimation rmse 0 793 3 149 r2 0 068 0 594 mae 0 654 2 034 and nse 0 277 0 593 the optimisation algorithms were used to adjust the model parameters thus minimising the loss function and improving the stability of the algorithm the accuracy of the elman algorithm significantly improved after optimisation with ga woa and cs this was especially true for the cs elman model rmse 0 468 2 235 r2 0 567 0 928 mae 0 363 1 343 and nse 0 345 0 923 the precision of the woa elman model was higher than that of the elman model although the woa algorithm has low precision and slow convergence speed this model can also easily be affected by local optima in addition the woa and its variants cannot fully solve high dimensional optimisation problems fan et al 2020 and its ability to optimise the elman algorithm is less favourable than that of the ga and cs algorithm although their accuracies accuracy of ga elman and woa elman model were similar the accuracy of the ga elman model was higher than that of woa elman with the accuracy of the two models as rmse 0 737 3 209 r2 0 056 0 675 mae 0 595 2 053 and nse 0 279 0 675 and rmse 0 735 3 156 r2 0 068 0 674 mae 0 594 2 032 and nse 0 518 0 671 respectively the ga is optimal for exploiting and navigating massive potential search spaces to identify the best combinations of items and solutions panchal and panchal 2015 although the ga has evolved through its practical application it has poor local search ability which causes simple transmission algorithms to become time consuming and late search efficiency to be lower this often leads to premature convergence furui et al 2019 the cs optimisation algorithm has fewer parameters than the other algorithms of this study and its convergence speed is not sensitive to parameter changes the cs is not easily influenced by local optimal solutions which indicates it has higher applicability than the ga the cs has strong global search ability and the optimised cs elman model had the highest accuracy for eto prediction when the input conditions are the same when rs and temperature factors ta tmax and tmin were input into the model the number of input factors increased and the accuracy of the model considerably improved the precision ranking of the four eto models was the same as that of models with a single input the precision index range of the four models was rmse 0 302 1 906 r2 0 517 0 942 mae 0 223 1 079 and nse 0 658 0 941 among the four models the cs elman hybrid optimisation had the highest precision rmse 0 302 1 097 r2 0 844 0 942 mae 0 223 0 622 and nse 0 837 0 941 on the basis of inputting rs and t the rh factor or n factor was introduced which slightly improved the accuracy of the model under different inputs all three algorithms had favourable optimisation performance with cs ga woa the accuracy of the cs elman model was the most satisfactory with the accuracy under the input of rs t and rh and rs t and n inputs as rmse 0 282 1 031 r2 0 891 0 960 mae 0 207 0 574 and nse 0 887 0 960 and rmse 0 273 0 993 r2 0 914 0 980 mae 0 199 0 556 and nse 0 904 0 979 respectively to construct a high precision eto model with the least number of parameters the accuracies of the eto models under different input conditions were compared fig 8 the accuracies of the four models were satisfactory when rs alone was input however when other meteorological factors were introduced in addition to rs the model accuracy significantly improved this indicates that although rs was the most important factor affecting eto the model constructed using a single input was over simplified and the model accuracy could still be improved with the introduction of more factors the accuracy of the elman model significantly improved the highest accuracy was achieved when five factors including rs t and n were input the hybrid algorithms had higher stability than the regular models did and the accuracy of the three hybrid algorithms improved when the number of input factors increased however compared with the fao 56 pm standard calculation value the hybrid model constructed with rs and t as inputs had a fairly good fit and the accuracy of the model was slightly improved by adding other parameters when rs t and rh and when rs t and n were the inputs the model accuracy increased as indicated by increases in the rmse r2 mae and nse by 0 137 11 194 0 199 5 224 0 656 10 769 and 0 2 1 913 and by 7 163 24 44 0 985 4 194 7 409 24 244 and 1 137 4 363 respectively in the cs elman model precision was the highest when rs t and n were input with rmse 0 273 0 993 r2 0 914 0 980 mae 0 199 0 556 and nse 0 904 0 979 however high accuracy was also achieved when the model was constructed with only rs and t as the input with rmse 0 302 0 197 r2 0 844 0 942 mae 0 223 0 622 and nse 0 837 0 941 see fig 9 in summary these three optimisation models have favourable performance for eto prediction the models were ranked in terms of highest to lowest accuracy as follows cs elman ga elman and woa elman the model accuracy was further evaluated using taylor diagrams fig 8 in the taylor diagrams the fao 56pm model is used as a reference point with the model accuracy increasing with its proximity to the reference point the diagrams indicate results consistent with those of evaluations of the four indexes rmse r2 mae and nse that is model accuracy can be ranked as cs elman ga elman woa elman elman from the metaheuristic s perspective the woa is easy to fall into the local optimal solution and slow convergence speed leads to a high operating cost the ga can find the global optimal solution of the problem but there is also the problem of poor local search ability and the algorithm has more control variables and slow search speed the cs has fewer and simpler parameters compared with the ga and the woa mohd et al 2013 and the search mechanism is more effective and less likely to fall into a local optimal solution because the step size of the levi s flight followed by the cuckoo in the algorithm satisfies a stable heavy tail distribution therefore cs performs better than ga and woa in optimizing the elman model and the comparison of the results of the three hybrid models in this study also shows that the cs elman model performs better than the other eto models when the same input five factors were used to construct the eto model the accuracy of eto predicted by some scholars using wnn algorithm r2 0 796 and rf algorithm r2 0 776 was significantly lower than the independent elman model in this study mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 feng et al constructed eto models based on hybrid algorithm the accuracies of the three hybrid models were rl svr r2 average indicator is 0 663 rl svr woa r2 average indicator is 0 796 and pca svr r2 average indicator is 0 841 respectively the accuracy of these models is significantly lower than the accuracy of the hybrid model in this study when the number of input factors is the same feng et al 2019a b c compared with previous studies the cs elman model proposed in this study is more effective in predicting eto by inputting knn selected principal factors 3 3 performance of eto model in different climatic zones the statistical performance of the three hybrid elman models and the independent elman models in different climatic zones is listed in table 4 the performance of the model was affected by meteorological differences and therefore differed across climatic zones rmse r2 mae nse and the overall evaluation index gpi were used to evaluate the applicability of the model in a given climatic zone the gpi scores and gpi rankings of the 16 stations under different inputs are listed in table 3 and the visualization of gpi in different climatic zones is shown in fig 9 when only rs was used as an input the elman model performed best in the smz with the luochuan and jingxi stations near the smz having higher accuracy than other stations in the same zone the values of rmse r2 mae nse and gpi in the smz were 0 909 1 094 0 303 0 559 and 0 747 0 897 0 428 0 549 0 402 0 775 and 27 48 respectively the elman model constructed using rs and t as inputs had high prediction accuracy in the western tcz and northern mpz with tacheng cold lake and chabcha serving as the representative stations its rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values were 0 646 0 77 0 873 1 002 0 509 0 593 0 806 0 884 0 645 1 087 and 37 45 respectively the three hybrid models woa elman ga elman and cs elman demonstrated strong consistency across climatic zones and compared with the independent elman model the hybrid models were more stable across climatic zones and were less affected by changes in input factors the three hybrid models constructed using single factor rs input or multifactor rs and t inputs all performed favourably in the smz and tpmz and the stations with the highest accuracy were concentrated near the intersection of the smz and tpmz guizhou dinghai and jingxi the rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values of the woa elman ga elman and cs elman models were 0 302 0 92 0 584 0 942 0 224 0 756 0 581 0 941 and 1 135 1 25 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 0 302 0 918 0 585 0 942 0 224 0 754 0 582 0 94 and 1 142 1 249 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 and 0 302 0 59 0 786 0 942 0 223 0 466 0 795 0 94 and 1 623 1 811 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 respectively the mpz and tcz have considerable vertical temperature variation and large annual differences which partially affect model calculations therefore the accuracies of the hybrid models were low in these two climate zones when four meteorological parameters were input the hybrid algorithm had high stability however the independent elman model had stability only when five meteorological factors were input when five factors were used as input parameters the combination of rs t and rh or rs t and n the independent elman model and the optimised hybrid models had strong prediction consistency all four models demonstrated the highest accuracy at the intersection of the smz and tpmz which was similar to the results of the mixed models for the first two input combinations the smz has four seasons and an average temperature between 13 c and 20 c in the tpmz monsoons are significant and the average annual temperature is above 22 c temperature was identified as the primary factor in the feature importance analysis and relatively little changes occur in the temperature factors of the smz and tpmz throughout the year this numerical stability may be the reason for the higher accuracy of the mixed models in these two climate zones after the input of rs t and rh and of rs t and n the rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values of the elman woa elman ga elman and cs elman models at the intersection of these climate zones at the guizhou dinghai and jingxi stations were 0 301 0 393 0 925 0 943 0 222 0 294 0 924 0 941 and 0 862 1 834 with a gpi ranking of 4 29 0 302 0 396 0 924 0 943 0 224 0 297 0 922 0 941 and 0 841 1 83 with a gpi ranking of 6 30 0 278 0 389 0 926 0 958 0 206 0 289 0 925 0 958 and 1 175 1 897 with a gpi ranking of 3 20 and 0 273 0 359 0 936 0 958 0 199 0 27 0 936 0 958 and 1 267 1 932 with a gpi ranking of 1 18 respectively these results indicate that the hybrid algorithm is far superior to the independent elman model in terms of accuracy and stability 4 conclusions to establish a high precision low factor eto model the knn factor analysis algorithm was used to identify a few factors of high importance as input factors furthermore the elman cs elman ga elman and woa elman algorithms were used to construct an eto estimation model the results revealed that rs is the primary factor affecting eto estimation and its importance ranges from 0 391 to 0 885 the importance of rs and t to eto estimation is not lower than 0 723 compared with empirical models the eto model based on elman algorithm achieves higher precision and the three optimisation algorithms cs ga and woa have favourable optimisation effects on the elman model among the hybrid optimisation models the cs elman model has the highest prediction accuracy the cs elman model demonstrates high accuracy in the smz and tpmz and it has the highest adaptability at stations

3277,reference crop evapotranspiration eto is a key factor for estimating crop water requirements which guide agricultural irrigation to improve the accuracy of predicting eto in different climate zones in china that lack meteorological data an eto hybrid model based on k nearest neighbour knn machine learning algorithm for extracting factor contribution rates is proposed in this study meteorological factors with large contribution rates were selected as input and a prediction model for eto was established using the elman daily eto prediction model the eto prediction model was optimised using three optimisation algorithms genetic optimization algorithm ga cuckoo optimization algorithm cs and whale optimization algorithm woa to improve the accuracy of eto prediction the results revealed that surface radiation rs is the most important factor in estimating eto contribution rate 0 392 0 626 followed by temperature factors t including maximum minimum and average temperatures and each model has the highest accuracy with the input combination of rs and t for the different machine learning models the cs elman model had the highest accuracy rmse 0 468 2 235 r2 0 567 0 928 mae 0 363 1 343 and nse 0 345 0 923 and the machine learning model had higher accuracy than the experience model the cs elman model performed more favourably in tropical monsoon and subtropical monsoon regions than that in other areas and the model performed best at the junction of two climatic zones the results can provide a theoretical basis for high precision prediction of eto in different climate zones in china keywords reference crop evapotranspiration elman algorithm hybrid optimisation algorithm k nearest neighbour algorithm climate zones in china 1 introduction eto is a key factor in assessing crop water requirements and is a required parameter in various fields such as hydrology meteorology and agriculture akpootu and iliyasu 2017 accurate estimation of eto can improve crop irrigation decision making and regional water resource management balve and patel 2016 although traditional evapotranspiration monitoring systems can provide high precision evapotranspiration data these systems are expensive and cannot be widely implemented thus scholars have developed simple models based on meteorological data to enable the estimation of eto at a low cost of these models the fao 56pm model is the most accurate in estimating eto and the united nations food and agriculture organization recommends it as a standard method for such estimation however the fao 56 pm model requires numerous parameters for calculation of eto such as sunshine duration air temperature radiation humidity and other meteorological factors in several applications of the fao 56pm model some of the aforementioned meteorological data were missing from stations reports which affected calculations djaman et al 2016 dou yang 2018 in situations in which some meteorological data were unavailable several scholars applied simpler empirical models for the prediction of eto such as the radiation based priestley taylor model and the temperature based hargreaves samani model feng et al 2016 however these empirical models could not predict eto with high accuracy feng et al 2017a b by contrast machine learning models can adequately evaluate nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables and they have been applied in many studies involving the estimation of eto abdullah et al 2015 machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate daily eto with higher estimation accuracy than that of empirical models such as the hargreaves samani tabari and makkink models fan et al 2019 feng et al 2019a b c gao et al 2016 moreover in the absence of some meteorological variables the results of machine learning models for eto estimation are more robust than those of empirical formulas zhu et al 2020 farias et al demonstrated that in the absence of some meteorological variables the results of machine learning methods are more consistent than those of empirical formulas farias et al 2020 elman neural network is based on the neural network with additional local feedback with strong computing power and network stability and the algorithm has a very wide range of applications so this study uses the more advantageous elman algorithm to build the eto model however when eto machine learning models are developed selection of relevant factors is mostly based on experience it lacks a theoretical basis therefore to reduce calculation costs the key factors affecting eto prediction must be identified the linear contribution rate can be calculated by selecting the principal factors for example path analysis can be employed to determine the dominant meteorological factors that affect eto xing et al 2016 or principal component analysis and feature importance analysis can be employed to calculate the sensitivity of meteorological parameters with respect to eto munawar and wang 2020 in recent years significance analysis based on machine learning was applied for the selection of main factors affecting eto and machine learning has a good performance in dealing with nonlinear problems mohammadi mehdizadeh 2020 neural networks use multi layer network design to build models for prediction and the developed models have the advantages of low parameter input nonlinearity and simple model structure which have certain advantages in machine learning algorithms zou et al 2010 for example yan et al established a soil moisture prediction model based on bp neural network and obtained high accuracy ge et al 2010 while the elman neural network is based on the neural network with an additional local feedback which makes it better than the neural network in terms of computational power and network stability so this study uses the more advantageous elman algorithm to build the eto model however because machine learning model parameters are not optimised eto prediction models based on machine learning still have low accuracy therefore to achieve satisfactory results model parameters must be optimised zhao et al 2021 several scholars have applied optimisation algorithms to optimise model parameters and to develop mixed models which have somewhat improved model accuracy particle swarm optimisation pso algorithm was able to optimise the weight and threshold between the input and hidden layers and thereby improve the performance of extreme learning machine elm algorithms liu et al 2017 feng et al 2020 yan et al used a whale optimisation algorithm woa to construct an eto model to estimate eto at eight stations in arid and humid regions of china and the woa xgb model demonstrated advantages compared with previous optimisation models yan et al 2020 the genetic algorithm ga and cuckoo search cs algorithm have also demonstrated favourable performance for parameter optimisation leading to considerable improvements in model efficiency and accuracy mohd et al 2013 the ga has a simple process with better results and faster optimization with fewer parameters the woa is easy to understand and implement and generalized and the two optimization algorithms have been widely used in previous studies therefore in order to construct an eto prediction model with higher accuracy this study uses these two optimization algorithms to optimize the weights and thresholds of the elman model the cs has fewer and simpler parameters compared with the genetic algorithm and the whale optimization algorithm and the search mechanism is more effective and less likely to fall into local optimal solutions because the step size of the lévy flight followed by the cuckoo in the algorithm satisfies the stable distribution of heavy tail in summary ga cs and woa are selected in this study in this study to develop a model with high precision prediction of eto requiring fewer factors key meteorological factors recorded at 16 chinese weather stations under different climatic conditions were integrated with the elman hybrid optimisation algorithm to determine eto the purpose of this study was 1 to screen key meteorological parameters that affect eto by using the knn machine learning algorithm 2 to develop an independent elman model and a hybrid optimisation model based on the combination of key factors that affect eto to estimate eto and 3 to comprehensively compare the performance of different eto models in different climate zones in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area climate zones in china can be categorised into temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz tropical monsoon zone tpmz and subtropical monsoon zone smz as presented in fig 1 the tcz zone is located inland it is dry with an average annual precipitation of less than 500 mm which mainly occurs in summer the tmz is characterised by short term drought in spring and autumn and long cold winters more than 70 of the annual precipitation in the tmz occurs in june august the average temperature in the hottest month is 20 mpz and the average altitude of the climatic zone is over 4000 m this results in low year round temperatures abundant sunshine and less than 400 mm of annual average precipitation the tpmz has high temperatures throughout the year and the average temperature in the coldest month is over 18 c precipitation mainly occurs in summer with an annual precipitation of 1500 2000 mm in most areas by comparison the smz is affected by differences in sea and land temperatures in summer and by the cold winds of siberia in winter the four seasons in the smz are distinct although rain and high temperatures occur in all seasons the average amount of annual precipitation decreases from southeast coast to its northwest inland and the difference between day and night temperatures is large 2 2 data collection data from 16 typical weather stations alshan

dongfang 59838 were collected from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn in this paper we use five fold cross validation for prediction analysis of eto five fold cross validation is often used for error assessment and the process is to divide the data into five equal parts take one copy of each experiment as the test set and use the remaining years as the training set and finally combine the results for error analysis of the model daily surface climatic data sets from 1960 to 2019 comprising mean temperature tmean maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed at

is a simple supervised learning algorithm for data classification the knn algorithm selects features by allocating samples from training data that is when a new sample appears in the allocated range the distance between the sample and the data set is calculated and the object is assigned to the class of its k nearest neighbour the knn model is locally approximate and all processes are submitted for classification no actual model or model learning is performed in the training phase although training the database is indispensable in knn it is used only to populate the search space sample with patterns of known classes because of this this algorithm is often referred to as the lazy learning algorithm saini et al 2013 as illustrated in the fig 2 when the selected sample is 3 the closest neighbours to the test point the green dot of the sample are one orange data set and two blue data sets when further refined based on the number of neighbour data sets the blue data sets are given priority however as indicated in the figure the orange data set is near to the test point therefore the neighbour must be determined based on weight in addition to number in such simple evaluations the reciprocal of the distance between the points can be used to reflect the weight which is calculated as follows 4 ω x x i e x p λ x x i 2 2 the procedure for calculating the importance of various meteorological factors is in the space composed of random variables x and y for a given n samples first find its k nearest neighbors and then find the number of other samples whose distances to the current sample in the x and y directions respectively are less than the maximum of the distances from the current sample to the k nearest neighbors and estimate the mutual information by the statistical number in this study the parameters were chosen with the values n informative 5 leaf size 30 euclidean metric p 2 ah e hegazy et al 2018 boulesteix and strobl 2009 the data source of the manuscript is day by day weather parameters from 1960 to 2019 as the knn algorithm for machine learning has superior results compared to linear feature correlation algorithm or nonlinear machine learning feature correlation algorithm for the processing of problems with large amount of data supporting nonlinear correlation between features and eto 2 5 machine learning model in this study elman woa elman ga elman cs elman models were constructed to predict eto woa ga and cs are used to improve the accuracy of the model by optimizing the initial thresholds and weights in the elman model the parameter values for the optimization of the three hybrid models are shown in fig 3 2 5 1 elman neural network the elman neural network is an optimisation of the back propagation bp neural network the elman neural network has favourable dynamic characteristics and strong global stability because it contains a context layer in the hidden layer of its feed forward neural network the elman neural network is widely adopted for nonlinear dynamic and complex data the structural diagram of the elman neural network is displayed as follows in fig 4 the mathematical model of the elman neural network is as follows 5 x k f w i 1 x c k w i 2 u k 1 6 x c k α x c k 1 x k 1 7 y k g w i 3 x k where w i 1 is the weight between the context layer and the hidden layer w i 2 is the weight between the input layer and the hidden layer w i 3 is the weight between the hidden layer and the output layer x c k and x k are the outputs of the context layer and the hidden layer respectively y k is the output of the output layer and α is the self connecting gain factor of the feedback layer 2 5 2 cs the cs is a new optimisation algorithm its development was inspired by cuckoo birds unique habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds the cs algorithm identifies the best nest location through iterative optimisation of the nest group the mantegna algorithm is then used to realise the stable distribution

they are social carnivores that prey on krill and small fish using bubble nets three mathematical models were developed by simulating the process of whales exploring hunting and surrounding prey the woa assumes the existence of a group of whales these whales in their hunting grounds hone in on the location of prey through communication with the location of prey corresponding to an optimal solution the mathematical model for surrounding the prey is 12 x t 1 x t a d a 2 a r a 13 d c x t x t c 2 â r where the t in eq 12 represents the current iteration number x t is the location of the prey and x t is the location of the whale both a and c are coefficient vectors the random value of r is 0 1 and a is the convergence factor which linearly decays from 2 to 0 with the number of iterations whale bubble net hunting involves manoeuvres in which whales encircle prey and contract that circle and swim in spirals around the prey accordingly in the shrinking encircling mechanism and spiral updating position of woa the convergence factor a is reduced to achieve a shrink wrap mechanism the spiral updating position algorithm is established by calculating the distance between the whale and its prey to mimic whales bubble net foraging the probability of selecting the constriction encircling mechanism and the spiral updating position to update the position of the whales is set

meteorological factors was analysed using the knn algorithm the results for the importance of these factors in different climatic zones are displayed in fig 6 these knn results were then used to obtain the degree of different parameter combinations contributions to eto which was then used as an input parameter in the eto forecasting model of the proposed hybrid elman algorithm as presented in fig 6 rs was the primary factor influencing eto prediction at almost all sites with the exception of the harbin site and its importance range was 0 391 0 884 many studies show that rs is a key calculation factor in fao 56pm and many other empirical models temperature was the second most important with an importance range of 0 1823 0 5122 previous studies have also demonstrated that t is an important meteorological factor affecting eto in constructing an eto model wu et al found the contribution rate of t to eto estimation to be very high wu et al 2019 the third most important influencing factor was different across climatic zones sunshine n was the third most important factor in the tpmz smz zone tmz and mpz its contribution ranged between 0 056 and 0 209 however in the tcz rh was the third most important factor and its importance ranged between 0 073 and 0 162 unlike other sites in the same climate zone at harbin station the contribution rate of temperature factors tmax tmin and tmean was higher than that of rs and the third most important factor was rh this may be because in spring and winter the temperature at the station increased and decreased rapidly which may have affected the calculations of the temperature contribution to the summer precipitation set in addition rh at harbin station increased to 77 78 in july and august although winter humidity and temperature was low humidity in the rest of the year was high which affected the temperature influence at this station several studies have also demonstrated that models established using n and rh factors can achieve higher accuracy for estimating eto xing et al 2016 the contribution rates of the top three factors were 0 805 1 216 rs t and rh and 0 819 1 184 rs t n on this basis the increases in contribution rates were small when other input factors were considered the obtained eto important influencing factors were used to develop a low factor eto prediction model table 2 3 2 analysis of daily eto forecast model a daily scale eto prediction model was constructed based on machine learning algorithms scatter plots of predicted et0 values using four models against their corresponding fao56 pm values are shown in appendix 2 the accuracy of four models elman cs elman woa elman and ga elman at different stations on a daily scale is displayed in fig 7 and the specific accuracy indicators are listed in appendix 1 as indicated in the figure although only a single factor rs was input the precision of the elman model was within the expected range of estimation rmse 0 793 3 149 r2 0 068 0 594 mae 0 654 2 034 and nse 0 277 0 593 the optimisation algorithms were used to adjust the model parameters thus minimising the loss function and improving the stability of the algorithm the accuracy of the elman algorithm significantly improved after optimisation with ga woa and cs this was especially true for the cs elman model rmse 0 468 2 235 r2 0 567 0 928 mae 0 363 1 343 and nse 0 345 0 923 the precision of the woa elman model was higher than that of the elman model although the woa algorithm has low precision and slow convergence speed this model can also easily be affected by local optima in addition the woa and its variants cannot fully solve high dimensional optimisation problems fan et al 2020 and its ability to optimise the elman algorithm is less favourable than that of the ga and cs algorithm although their accuracies accuracy of ga elman and woa elman model were similar the accuracy of the ga elman model was higher than that of woa elman with the accuracy of the two models as rmse 0 737 3 209 r2 0 056 0 675 mae 0 595 2 053 and nse 0 279 0 675 and rmse 0 735 3 156 r2 0 068 0 674 mae 0 594 2 032 and nse 0 518 0 671 respectively the ga is optimal for exploiting and navigating massive potential search spaces to identify the best combinations of items and solutions panchal and panchal 2015 although the ga has evolved through its practical application it has poor local search ability which causes simple transmission algorithms to become time consuming and late search efficiency to be lower this often leads to premature convergence furui et al 2019 the cs optimisation algorithm has fewer parameters than the other algorithms of this study and its convergence speed is not sensitive to parameter changes the cs is not easily influenced by local optimal solutions which indicates it has higher applicability than the ga the cs has strong global search ability and the optimised cs elman model had the highest accuracy for eto prediction when the input conditions are the same when rs and temperature factors ta tmax and tmin were input into the model the number of input factors increased and the accuracy of the model considerably improved the precision ranking of the four eto models was the same as that of models with a single input the precision index range of the four models was rmse 0 302 1 906 r2 0 517 0 942 mae 0 223 1 079 and nse 0 658 0 941 among the four models the cs elman hybrid optimisation had the highest precision rmse 0 302 1 097 r2 0 844 0 942 mae 0 223 0 622 and nse 0 837 0 941 on the basis of inputting rs and t the rh factor or n factor was introduced which slightly improved the accuracy of the model under different inputs all three algorithms had favourable optimisation performance with cs ga woa the accuracy of the cs elman model was the most satisfactory with the accuracy under the input of rs t and rh and rs t and n inputs as rmse 0 282 1 031 r2 0 891 0 960 mae 0 207 0 574 and nse 0 887 0 960 and rmse 0 273 0 993 r2 0 914 0 980 mae 0 199 0 556 and nse 0 904 0 979 respectively to construct a high precision eto model with the least number of parameters the accuracies of the eto models under different input conditions were compared fig 8 the accuracies of the four models were satisfactory when rs alone was input however when other meteorological factors were introduced in addition to rs the model accuracy significantly improved this indicates that although rs was the most important factor affecting eto the model constructed using a single input was over simplified and the model accuracy could still be improved with the introduction of more factors the accuracy of the elman model significantly improved the highest accuracy was achieved when five factors including rs t and n were input the hybrid algorithms had higher stability than the regular models did and the accuracy of the three hybrid algorithms improved when the number of input factors increased however compared with the fao 56 pm standard calculation value the hybrid model constructed with rs and t as inputs had a fairly good fit and the accuracy of the model was slightly improved by adding other parameters when rs t and rh and when rs t and n were the inputs the model accuracy increased as indicated by increases in the rmse r2 mae and nse by 0 137 11 194 0 199 5 224 0 656 10 769 and 0 2 1 913 and by 7 163 24 44 0 985 4 194 7 409 24 244 and 1 137 4 363 respectively in the cs elman model precision was the highest when rs t and n were input with rmse 0 273 0 993 r2 0 914 0 980 mae 0 199 0 556 and nse 0 904 0 979 however high accuracy was also achieved when the model was constructed with only rs and t as the input with rmse 0 302 0 197 r2 0 844 0 942 mae 0 223 0 622 and nse 0 837 0 941 see fig 9 in summary these three optimisation models have favourable performance for eto prediction the models were ranked in terms of highest to lowest accuracy as follows cs elman ga elman and woa elman the model accuracy was further evaluated using taylor diagrams fig 8 in the taylor diagrams the fao 56pm model is used as a reference point with the model accuracy increasing with its proximity to the reference point the diagrams indicate results consistent with those of evaluations of the four indexes rmse r2 mae and nse that is model accuracy can be ranked as cs elman ga elman woa elman elman from the metaheuristic s perspective the woa is easy to fall into the local optimal solution and slow convergence speed leads to a high operating cost the ga can find the global optimal solution of the problem but there is also the problem of poor local search ability and the algorithm has more control variables and slow search speed the cs has fewer and simpler parameters compared with the ga and the woa mohd et al 2013 and the search mechanism is more effective and less likely to fall into a local optimal solution because the step size of the levi s flight followed by the cuckoo in the algorithm satisfies a stable heavy tail distribution therefore cs performs better than ga and woa in optimizing the elman model and the comparison of the results of the three hybrid models in this study also shows that the cs elman model performs better than the other eto models when the same input five factors were used to construct the eto model the accuracy of eto predicted by some scholars using wnn algorithm r2 0 796 and rf algorithm r2 0 776 was significantly lower than the independent elman model in this study mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 feng et al constructed eto models based on hybrid algorithm the accuracies of the three hybrid models were rl svr r2 average indicator is 0 663 rl svr woa r2 average indicator is 0 796 and pca svr r2 average indicator is 0 841 respectively the accuracy of these models is significantly lower than the accuracy of the hybrid model in this study when the number of input factors is the same feng et al 2019a b c compared with previous studies the cs elman model proposed in this study is more effective in predicting eto by inputting knn selected principal factors 3 3 performance of eto model in different climatic zones the statistical performance of the three hybrid elman models and the independent elman models in different climatic zones is listed in table 4 the performance of the model was affected by meteorological differences and therefore differed across climatic zones rmse r2 mae nse and the overall evaluation index gpi were used to evaluate the applicability of the model in a given climatic zone the gpi scores and gpi rankings of the 16 stations under different inputs are listed in table 3 and the visualization of gpi in different climatic zones is shown in fig 9 when only rs was used as an input the elman model performed best in the smz with the luochuan and jingxi stations near the smz having higher accuracy than other stations in the same zone the values of rmse r2 mae nse and gpi in the smz were 0 909 1 094 0 303 0 559 and 0 747 0 897 0 428 0 549 0 402 0 775 and 27 48 respectively the elman model constructed using rs and t as inputs had high prediction accuracy in the western tcz and northern mpz with tacheng cold lake and chabcha serving as the representative stations its rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values were 0 646 0 77 0 873 1 002 0 509 0 593 0 806 0 884 0 645 1 087 and 37 45 respectively the three hybrid models woa elman ga elman and cs elman demonstrated strong consistency across climatic zones and compared with the independent elman model the hybrid models were more stable across climatic zones and were less affected by changes in input factors the three hybrid models constructed using single factor rs input or multifactor rs and t inputs all performed favourably in the smz and tpmz and the stations with the highest accuracy were concentrated near the intersection of the smz and tpmz guizhou dinghai and jingxi the rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values of the woa elman ga elman and cs elman models were 0 302 0 92 0 584 0 942 0 224 0 756 0 581 0 941 and 1 135 1 25 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 0 302 0 918 0 585 0 942 0 224 0 754 0 582 0 94 and 1 142 1 249 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 and 0 302 0 59 0 786 0 942 0 223 0 466 0 795 0 94 and 1 623 1 811 with a gpi ranking of 15 22 respectively the mpz and tcz have considerable vertical temperature variation and large annual differences which partially affect model calculations therefore the accuracies of the hybrid models were low in these two climate zones when four meteorological parameters were input the hybrid algorithm had high stability however the independent elman model had stability only when five meteorological factors were input when five factors were used as input parameters the combination of rs t and rh or rs t and n the independent elman model and the optimised hybrid models had strong prediction consistency all four models demonstrated the highest accuracy at the intersection of the smz and tpmz which was similar to the results of the mixed models for the first two input combinations the smz has four seasons and an average temperature between 13 c and 20 c in the tpmz monsoons are significant and the average annual temperature is above 22 c temperature was identified as the primary factor in the feature importance analysis and relatively little changes occur in the temperature factors of the smz and tpmz throughout the year this numerical stability may be the reason for the higher accuracy of the mixed models in these two climate zones after the input of rs t and rh and of rs t and n the rmse r2 mae nse and gpi values of the elman woa elman ga elman and cs elman models at the intersection of these climate zones at the guizhou dinghai and jingxi stations were 0 301 0 393 0 925 0 943 0 222 0 294 0 924 0 941 and 0 862 1 834 with a gpi ranking of 4 29 0 302 0 396 0 924 0 943 0 224 0 297 0 922 0 941 and 0 841 1 83 with a gpi ranking of 6 30 0 278 0 389 0 926 0 958 0 206 0 289 0 925 0 958 and 1 175 1 897 with a gpi ranking of 3 20 and 0 273 0 359 0 936 0 958 0 199 0 27 0 936 0 958 and 1 267 1 932 with a gpi ranking of 1 18 respectively these results indicate that the hybrid algorithm is far superior to the independent elman model in terms of accuracy and stability 4 conclusions to establish a high precision low factor eto model the knn factor analysis algorithm was used to identify a few factors of high importance as input factors furthermore the elman cs elman ga elman and woa elman algorithms were used to construct an eto estimation model the results revealed that rs is the primary factor affecting eto estimation and its importance ranges from 0 391 to 0 885 the importance of rs and t to eto estimation is not lower than 0 723 compared with empirical models the eto model based on elman algorithm achieves higher precision and the three optimisation algorithms cs ga and woa have favourable optimisation effects on the elman model among the hybrid optimisation models the cs elman model has the highest prediction accuracy the cs elman model demonstrates high accuracy in the smz and tpmz and it has the highest adaptability at stations

3278,groundwater is a key component of the global hydrological cycle quantitative approaches to estimate the spatial and temporal changes in groundwater storage gws could provide solid foundation for sustainable management this study made a comprehensive comparison of gws changes based on two independent approaches the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission data the feasibility of using these two estimation methods to quantify shallow groundwater variations in the haihe river basin of china a globally representative overexploited area was assessed the grace derived gws changes were calculated based on independent component analysis and a joint inversion method the results showed that the grace estimated shallow gws anomalies during 2003 2012 agree well with the swat simulated data for the variations in the long term gws depletion rate we found that heterogeneity at 22 subbasin approximately 500 to 1500 km2 scales was detected by the grace data and these results were spatially coherent with the swat simulations based on the distributed modeling units and multiple inputs the grace estimates could adequately replicate the general trends of gws depletion in the winter wheat triticum aestivum l growth period and recovery in the summer maize zea mays l growth period specifically comparisons between grace based and swat simulated results indicated that the signals of pumping for winter wheat irrigation in several key water requirement periods in april may and november were identified by grace as were seasonal changes in shallow gws e g an obvious depletion in spring despite an overestimation of the scope of the fluctuations in grace estimates compared with those of swat simulations from the perspective of the water flux the effective identification of the impact of anthropogenic exploitation on shallow gws in grace suggests that this monitoring tool could be applied in the groundwater management of this plain this study demonstrated a good agreement between swat simulated and grace based shallow gws changes from the perspectives of long term trends and variations in crop seasons additionally satisfactory consistency was observed from the perspective of the water flux in this semiarid and semihumid study region considering the influence of human activities keywords groundwater storage change swat model grace satellite well irrigation haihe river basin 1 introduction groundwater is the largest global freshwater resource and is considered to be the most productive component of agricultural production systems maidment 1993 döll et al 2014 de graaf et al 2019 long et al 2020 xie et al 2020 however the high use of groundwater has created extensive concerns about overdraft and depletion in many irrigated regions around the world giordano 2009 wada et al 2012 scanlon et al 2012a jasechko and perrone 2021 hence quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial variations in groundwater storage gws is critically important for the sustainable management of water resources shah et al 2000 yin et al 2020 since its launch in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission has provided valuable information on gws changes in global hotspots of depletion such as the u s high plains and california s central valley strassberg et al 2007 longuevergne et al 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012b northwest india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 long et al 2016 the middle east voss et al 2013 and north china feng et al 2013 moiwo et al 2013 tang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 the grace mission presents a new opportunity to monitor large scale gws changes and compensates for the shortage of ground based measurements which only provide point specific estimates feng et al 2013 hu and jiao 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 moreover hydrological models have been proven to be robust and useful tools for analyzing groundwater regimes and are thus widely applied for decision support in areas with major aquifers globally nakayama et al 2006 faunt 2009 hu et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012a shu et al 2012 cao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 cheema et al 2014 reshmidevi and kumar 2014 zhang et al 2016 a calibrated hydrological model has many advantages and can provide distributed simulations ground on the physically based characterization of real hydrological features maidment 1993 gws change a key representation of the water balance in aquifers has long been the focus of hydrological modeling studies in groundwater overdraft areas faunt 2009 scanlon et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 2018 zhang and ren 2021 thus hydrological models and grace satellite data should be mutually independent but complementary tools for estimating gws change at the regional scale however to date most studies that have assessed the validity of gws change estimates based on grace satellite data have been limited to in situ groundwater level observations yeh et al 2006 rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012b feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and few studies have compared grace based gws estimates with those of hydrological models notably gws change can be simulated by many hydrological models especially those based on water balance methods which provide a direct reference for grace data comparisons this approach could avoid possible errors associated with unknown specific yields during the conversion from observed water level fluctuations to water storage values additionally ground based measurements generally exhibit many gaps over time and space but this issue could be solved by obtaining flexible estimates at different spatiotemporal scales through the use of distributed hydrological models döll et al 2014 simulated groundwater depletion using the global hydrological model watergap and compared the results to grace satellite data india the united states iran saudi arabia and china were the countries with the highest groundwater depletion rates in the first decade of the 21st century but the low spatial resolution of grace data remains a challenge for groundwater analyses as groundwater depletion is often local in scale döll et al 2014 in this context focusing on a typical groundwater depletion region and conducting a detailed comparison between model and grace based gws changes at a fine spatial scale should provide abundant information and a comprehensive analysis of hydrological processes with respect to groundwater overdraft the north china plain ncp has long been a global hotspot for groundwater resource studies due to the extensive overexploitation for irrigation that occurs there feng et al 2013 quantified groundwater depletion in north china 370 000 km2 from grace satellite data and estimated gws loss at a rate of 22 3 mm a from 2003 to 2010 huang et al 2015 explored the capability of grace to detect heterogeneous gws variations in two subregions of the ncp they found that the piedmont plain 54 000 km2 mainly exploiting shallow groundwater exhibited a shallow gws loss at a rate of 46 5 6 8 mm a from 2003 to 2013 huang et al 2015 the region of interest in this study is the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province 23 000 km2 see fig 1 which is a typical area facing a dilemma between shallow groundwater drawdown and crop production zhang et al 2016 established a groundwater module enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model in this study area and used abundant data including groundwater resource assessment results and data of the depth to water table to conduct detailed calibration and validation multisource verification demonstrated that the modified swat model was acceptable for simulating shallow gws within a well considered generalization of the historical irrigation schedules in time and space zhang et al 2016 in this study we explored the consistency and dissimilarity in the spatial and temporal patterns of shallow gws changes in this study area estimated by the swat model and grace satellite data specifically we compared 1 the long term gws trends 2 the variability in gws trends during different crop growth periods for a winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l double cropping system and 3 the gws changes at monthly seasonal and annual scales from the perspective of the water flux the novel aspects of this analysis include exploring the reliability of grace derived gws at an unprecedented scale but also providing a case study for other irrigated regions based on monitoring groundwater depletion jointly using a distributed hydrological model and remote sensing data 2 methods and data 2 1 the study area the study area fig 1 is consistent with that used in our previous related research zhang et al 2016 2018 zhang and ren 2021 and it is located on the piedmont plain of mount taihang in the haihe river basin and a main part of ncp cropland is the dominant land use type in this region and the average cultivation ratio has been maintained at 80 since the 1990s hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the predominant planting pattern irrigation is essential for winter wheat growth because only 30 of annual precipitation occurs in this crop growth period and is less than one third of the water requirement collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 zhang et al 2006 wang 2011 from the 1990s to 2010s most rivers in the study area became seasonal or even dry year round due to a lack of precipitation and the effects of human activities e g reservoir construction in the upstream reaches of the basin liu 2002 haihe river water conservancy commission 2006 2013 in the context of limited surface water resources more than 80 of the water used in this plain area is supplied by groundwater resources cgs 2009 zheng et al 2009 consequently the long term variations in water storage in this region are mainly associated with the water storage changes in the aquifer ren et al 2007 huang et al 2015 the quaternary aquifer fig 1 in the study area contains abundant pore water and shallow groundwater see zhang et al 2016 ren and zhang 2020 stored in the upper unconfined aquifer is the main supplementary water source due to its good quality chen and ni 1987 chen 1999 deep aquifers in the study area mainly provide urban domestic water sources but compared to the volume of shallow groundwater pumping for extensive irrigation the exploitation of deep groundwater is minimal accounting for only approximately 6 of shallow groundwater withdrawals national groundwater resources assessment project office 2004 hence the gws variations estimated by grace data approximate shallow gws variations in this study substantial pumping for irrigation in this region has resulted in rapid shallow groundwater table decline at a rate of approximately 1 m a zhang et al 2016 according to a related assessment the general office of the hebei people s government 2014 all of this well irrigated plain was located in areas of shallow groundwater overexploitation see fig 1 reflecting unsustainable utilization quantitatively estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal and interannual changes in shallow gws in this semiarid and subhumid continental monsoon climate area especially focusing on shallow groundwater depletion related to irrigation could provide comprehensive information to support policy making in this watershed 2 2 data processing for comparisons the study period was between january 2003 and december 2012 with a total of 115 monthly records for comparison grace based gws variation data were missing for the months of june 2003 january 2011 june 2011 may 2012 and october 2012 due to a lack of satellite observations first the swat simulated and grace based shallow gws anomalies were calculated separately 1 g w s a s w a t i sast i sast 2 g w s a g r a c e i e w h i e w h where gwsaswat i is the swat simulated shallow gws anomaly in the ith month mm sasti is the shallow aquifer storage in the ith month simulated by the swat model mm sast is the monthly average shallow aquifer storage in the analysis period simulated by the swat model mm gwsagrace i is the grace based shallow gws anomaly in the ith month mm ewhi is the equivalent water height in the ith month estimated from the grace satellite data mm and ewh is the monthly average equivalent water height in the analysis period estimated from the grace satellite data mm note that the average values were calculated during the study period of 2003 2012 and removed to derive the gws anomalies from the swat model and the grace data based on the time series of gwsaswat and gwsagrace results the long term trend of shallow gws over 10 years and the variability in the shallow gws trend during the crop growth period i e the slope of the linear approximations of gwsaswat and gwsagrace during the crop growth period estimated with the swat model and grace products were calculated and compared most of the published papers related to the evaluation of groundwater depletion using grace satellite data focused on variations in the gws trend however for the concept of water storage change another view considered grace data as flux information i e a flux perspective based on the water balance equation longuevergne 2016 as an important concept in hydrology the water balance approach is the driving force behind everything that occurs in a watershed in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 for the hydrological cycle in the groundwater system simulated in this model the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i was calculated based on the amount on day i 1 and the flows of water in to and out of the aquifer including recharge groundwater flow pumping etc on day i neitsch et al 2011 from this perspective the shallow gws change during a time step was equal to the difference in shallow aquifer storage between the beginning and the end of the selected time period hence to further explore the consistency of swat simulated and grace based estimations shallow gws changes based on the water flux were calculated as follows 3 δ g w s s w a t i sast i sast i 1 4 δ g w s g r a c e i e w h i e w h i 1 where δgwsswat i is the swat simulated shallow gws change in month season year i sast is the shallow aquifer storage simulated by the swat model δgwsgrace i is the grace based shallow gws change in month season year i ewh is the equivalent water height estimated by the grace satellite data the shallow aquifer storage water heights at seasonal and interannual scales were calculated by averaging the monthly results over the corresponding time steps the storage variations estimated by grace were converted from a 0 5 grid to subbasins see fig 1 in the swat model based on the weighted approach to provide storage values at the same spatial scale for comparison moreover to explore the different effects of the comparisons for varying area sizes and provide a convenient water management reference the estimated results in 22 subbasins approximately 500 to 1500 km2 were further aggregated into two hydrological regions approximately 10 000 to 15000 km2 i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp as well as the whole study area approximately 23 000 km2 in subsequent analyses fig 2 2 3 swat data swat is a physically based comprehensive river basin model that has been successfully applied globally including in agricultural water management e g kim et al 2008 xie et al 2008 2011 dhar and mazumdar 2009 oeurng et al 2011 the swat model includes a groundwater module that is represented into the shallow and deep aquifers neitsch et al 2011 the water stored in each aquifer is calculated at a daily time step based on the water balance equation however since the depth to water table is neither computed nor output directly in the basic model version it is difficult to calibrate the parameters of the groundwater module using water table fluctuation data hence we modified the shallow groundwater module by adding some new parameters e g the specific yield bottom bed burial depth porosity of the shallow aquifer and lateral groundwater recharge and applied it to the study area we used shallow groundwater table data from 16 national wells continuous monthly data from 1993 to 2010 and 148 investigation wells annual data from 2006 to 2012 to perform a detailed calibration and validation of the model zhang et al 2016 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 which is an effective method for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour et al 2004 2007 was used to conduct the calculations the values of the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the modified version of the efficiency criterion φ and the p factors and r factors statistical indices of the sufi 2 method indicated that the calibrated parameters were satisfactory see zhang et al 2016 notably the shallow aquifer water storage result output by the swat model was also validated by comparison to the groundwater resources assessment values national groundwater resources assessment project office 2004 and a relative deviation of 3 6 was observed demonstrating the rationality and reliability of the model in simulating the variations in shallow gws zhang et al 2016 therefore the modified swat model with appropriate boundary conditions can reasonably simulate the depletion of shallow gws in the studied agricultural district with intensive well irrigation zhang et al 2016 in this study the swat simulated shallow gws changes at different spatial and temporal scales were used as distributed hydrological modeling data to conduct comparisons 2 4 grace data to estimate gws changes over the study area we used the monthly grace level 2 rl06 spherical harmonic sh coefficient products from 2002 to 2014 provided by the center for space research csr of the university of texas at austin usa the degree 1 and zonal degree 2 sh coefficients were replaced as suggested in previous studies swenson et al 2008 cheng et al 2013 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction was applied based on the model from a et al 2013 in addition the ddk3 decorrelation filter was applied to reduce the correlated errors among the original grace sh coefficients kusche et al 2009 to further downscale and disaggregate the grace derived gws changes we used independent component analysis ica and a joint inversion method forootan et al 2017 firstly the different tws components with a spatial resolution of 0 5 in the watergap hydrological model wghm including surface water soil moisture groundwater etc were decomposed into temporal components and spatial modes based on the ica method then the spatial modes from these different tws components were smoothed with the ddk3 filter as grace data further these filtered spatial modes were used jointly to fit the grace derived twsa based on a least squares approach to derive robust temporal components for different tws components forootan et al 2017 finally the estimated temporal gws components were further combined with the original gws spatial modes from the wghm to obtain downscaled 0 5 0 5 gridded gws changes in addition we used the forward modeling method from chen et al 2015 with spatial constraints to derive gws changes in the study area in this method non groundwater tws components based on the gldas model were removed from grace derived twsa and then the forward modeling method was used to recover the gwsa signal in the study area additional details were provided by feng et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term gws trends the time series of swat simulated and grace based shallow gws anomalies from 2003 to 2012 in the 22 subbasins the two hydrological regions and the whole study area are shown in fig 3 similar trends in shallow gws were found for these two approaches fig 3 the average values of the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were 0 70 and 0 69 respectively in the study area even at the subbasin scale the evaluation indices still indicated good correspondence the r2 coefficients for all 22 subbasins ranged from 0 67 to 0 72 fig 3 displaying satisfactory consistency approximately 88 of the subbasins exhibited nses 0 6 and values 0 7 were observed in 20 of the subbasins only two subbasins zy1 and zy3 located in the wester central part of the study area displayed an nse below 0 5 fig 3 over the period from 2003 to 2012 the shallow gws anomalies exhibited a prolonged declining trend and the depletion rates were estimated to be 175 37 mm a by the swat model and 131 25 mm a by the grace satellite data the spatial patterns of the long term depletion rates in shallow gws by the swat model fig 4 a 1 and grace satellite data fig 4 a 2 were generally similar with a relatively slow rate of depletion in the subbasins located in the northern dxp and the southern zyhp regions and a relatively sharp rate of depletion in the mid eastern region of the study area the plots in fig 4 b 1 and b 2 provide the relative errors of the grace based depletion rate compared with the swat simulated results regrace swat in the 22 subbasins in subbasins zy1 and zy3 the depletion rate estimated by the grace satellites was 25 50 higher than that simulated by the swat model indicating an overestimation effect for the other 20 subbasins we found that the grace satellite data underestimated the shallow groundwater depletion rate eleven subbasins displayed regrace swat values in the range of 25 to 0 and 9 subbasins exhibited regrace swat values in the range of 50 to 25 in general the grace based and swat simulated long term depletion rates in shallow gws were in good agreement the grace based rate estimate for the whole study area was approximately 3 4 of that simulated by the swat model even at the subbasin scale the deviation between these two data series was less than 50 3 2 variability in gws trends during the two crop growth periods the variations in precipitation and well irrigation intensity in different periods are the main factors that influence the seasonal shallow groundwater change considering the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in this region in the study area the winter wheat ww growth period usually lasts from october to june of the next year and the summer maize sm growth period is july to september the plots in fig 5 provide a comparison of the variations in shallow gws anomalies during ww and sm growth periods separately notably both the grace based and swat simulated shallow gws trends indicate depletion in the ww growth period and recovery in the sm growth period in all the subbasins fig 5 implying that grace can capture the general trends phase changes of shallow gws for the double cropping system in this well irrigated plain region specifically the variations in shallow gws during the ww growth period estimated by grace and swat were 39 75 mm month and 23 39 mm month respectively and the corresponding results for the sm growth period were 50 17 mm month and 23 45 mm month respectively we noted that there was a mismatch in the variation in shallow gws during the sm growth period in 2007 2008 and 2009 with a loss trend estimated by grace and a recovery trend outputted by swat fig 5 in addition the grace based variations in shallow gws during the sm growth period in 2010 were much higher than those simulated by the swat model fig 5 which indicated obvious overestimation however for the estimation during the ww growth period much better agreement was observed for the depletion trend and the depletion rate between the grace based and swat simulated results fig 5 this finding implied that the grace satellites could better capture the variations in shallow gws during the ww growing season which is characterized by less precipitation and higher irrigation amounts than those during the sm growing season the point plots in fig 6 also indicate that good correspondence i e points close to the 1 1 line tends to be associated with a high irrigation amount during both the ww and sm growth periods the high pumping intensity required to irrigate winter wheat was the main factor that led to groundwater drawdown in the study region grace based estimates reflected the impact of anthropogenic exploitation on groundwater resources thus grace satellite remote sensing products might have potential for applications in hydrology as monitoring tools for assessing groundwater utilization in this typical well irrigated plain region 3 3 gws changes from the perspective of the water flux 3 3 1 monthly variations fig 7 shows the grace based and swat simulated monthly shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux calculated on the basis of equations 3 and 4 in section 2 2 for the swat simulation results decreases in shallow gws were found in april may june and november in almost every year while in january march july to october and december shallow gws mainly exhibited a recovery trend fig 7 a 1 for the grace satellite estimates depletion in shallow gws was found in january march april may and november in almost every year while in june august october and december shallow groundwater recovery signals were observed fig 7 a 2 notably april may and november corresponded to the jointing stage the heading and filling stage and the overwintering stage respectively which are the key water requirement periods for winter wheat wang 2011 li and yang 2017 the generalized historical irrigation schedule for winter wheat in this study area based on multiple sources haihe river water conservancy commission 1986 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 also suggested that from 2003 2012 farmers utilized irrigation in these four growth periods for winter wheat i e approximately mid april mid may late may and mid november zhang et al 2016 analyzed the simulated shallow groundwater variations at the daily step in a typical hydrological response unit hru in the study area and found that these periods of well irrigation constituted the main cause of groundwater decline in this plain region the above comparisons in this section indicate that the grace satellites can precisely capture the depletion signal for shallow gws caused by the four stages of irrigation pumping for winter wheat it should be noted that this finding implies that even at the monthly timescale grace estimates of shallow gws changes in the study area are still relatively useful especially for monitoring irrigation pumping activities during the key water requirement periods of winter wheat however compared to the swat simulated results the grace based estimates exhibited a large scope of fluctuation in the monthly flux of shallow gws grace based estimates of the gws flux were larger than 100 mm month in approximately 3 5 of the 110 months analyzed fig 7 a 2 the swat simulated results were less than 100 mm month in most months except for may fig 7 a 1 to smooth the amplitude of grace estimates of monthly gws changes a three month moving average was applied and the results are presented in fig 7 b 2 the same process was applied to the swat simulated data for comparison fig 7 b 1 the shallow gws changes estimated by the swat model after smoothing exhibited deficit variations from march to june and october to december and these variations were effectively captured by grace in addition the discrepancies in the ranges of monthly changes estimated with these two approaches were much reduced by using the three month moving average fig 7 b 1 and b 2 3 3 2 seasonal variations from the perspective of seasonal variations similar shallow gws trends between the swat simulated and grace based models were found as shown in fig 8 a 1 and a 2 specifically shallow gws decreased markedly in the spring march to may but partially recovered in summer june to august and this trend was successfully detected by grace in the study area spring and summer are the most representative seasons with intensive irrigation pumping and precipitation respectively the irrigation in spring 250 mm on average and precipitation in summer 320 mm on average account for approximately 65 of the corresponding annual amounts fig 8 b 1 and b 2 in other words the shallow gws changes were lowest deficit in spring due to irrigation pumping and highest surplus in summer because of rainfall recharge in this plain region with a crop rotation system confirming the grace results in addition in autumn september to november and winter december to february next year with comparatively low precipitation and irrigation amounts fig 8 b 3 the variations in shallow gws estimated by grace exhibited a trend similar to that of the swat simulated results fig 8 a 1 and a 2 in general the plots based on both the swat model and grace data indicated that shallow gws decreased slightly in the fall and increased slightly in the winter fig 8 a 1 and a 2 overall despite the overestimation of the grace based seasonal variations good correspondence was found between the variation trends in the four seasons fig 8 a 1 and a 2 3 3 3 annual variations based on the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from 22 weather stations see zhang et al 2016 2018 the precipitation exceedance probability pep in each year during the analysis period was calculated using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 fig 9 shows the comparisons of interannual changes in shallow gws based on swat and grace in wet years pep 25 normal years 25 pep 75 and dry years pep 75 we found that in 2004 and 2011 the grace based results in all subbasins reflected an increase in shallow gws which was contrary to the actual depletion that occurred for consecutive years in this region it should be noted that for the 22 subbasins the peps in these two years were different including wet normal and dry years implying that the discrepancies might be related to the uncertainty of the grace satellite signal during these periods but not the real hydrological variables however in the other eight years in the analysis period a similar annual decreasing trend was found between the grace based and swat simulated results fig 9 the points in the area between the two dotted lines i e y 2x and y 1 2 x in fig 9 indicate that the annual changes in shallow gws estimated by grace are in the range of half to double the swat simulated changes illustrating good correspondence in the 22 subbasins the frequency of these points during the eight years was 37 5 subbasin zy10 at a minimum 87 5 subbasins dx8 and dx9 at a maximum and 61 4 on average suggesting that grace provided satisfactory estimates in most years from 2003 to 2012 the average annual variations in shallow gws in the 10 subbasins of the dxp simulated by the swat model were 117 mm 171 mm and 175 mm in wet years normal years and dry years respectively the corresponding grace estimated results for the 10 subbasins of the dxp were 142 mm 141 mm and 152 mm as a result the relative error of grace estimates compared with swat simulations was 21 4 in wet years 17 5 in normal years and 13 1 in dry years for the 12 subbasins of the zyhp the relative errors in wet years normal years and dry years were 38 4 swat simulation 135 mm grace estimation 219 mm 26 0 swat simulation 181 mm grace estimation 134 mm and 31 2 swat simulation 176 mm grace estimation 121 mm respectively better agreement between the interannual changes in shallow gws based on swat and grace was observed in normal and dry years than in wet years and better agreement was observed in the hydrological region of the dxp than in the zyhp region 4 discussion the haihe river basin is a typical hotspot of groundwater depletion globally with intensive well irrigated agriculture obtaining quantitative estimates of gws changes has become an important step in promoting sustainability in this region measurements of the water storage variations in underground aquifers remains a challenge especially in reference to measurements for surface water bodies such as rivers lakes and reservoirs there is increasing interest in using grace satellite data to remotely monitor gws changes additionally hydrological modeling based on numerical simulations has been a traditional approach for assessing the groundwater balance döll et al 2014 compared the groundwater depletion simulated by the global hydrological model watergap with grace estimated results at the global scale at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 what distinguishes our study from other grace applications is that our comprehensive comparisons highlight the distributed subbasin results rather than using ground based or in situ data and focus on fine spatial and temporal scales the plots in fig 10 provide a comprehensive comparison of the correspondence between grace based and swat simulated shallow gws changes with regard to the long term trend and rate of variation during the crop growth period at different spatiotemporal scales long term trends in shallow gws series from 2003 2012 estimated by these two approaches were in good agreement at both regional and subbasin scales fig 10 with all the fit points distributed in the area of satisfactory correspondence between the lines of y 2x and y 1 2 x this finding highlights the potential of remote sensing based hydrological analyses in this well irrigated plain region notably the area of each of the 22 subbasins is only approximately 500 to 1500 km2 much less than the grace footprint therefore grace can not only detect gws depletion but also quantify the rate of depletion at fine spatial scales in addition because the gws depletion rate is a major concern for national governments and policy makers the good performance of the grace satellite based approach supports the use of grace products for obtaining independent estimates that can be combined with data from groundwater level monitoring networks it should be another interesting finding that the grace satellites can capture the depletion trends in shallow gws during winter wheat growth periods fig 10 implying good identifiability of anthropogenic groundwater use for irrigation which is a typical agrohydrological characteristic in this region from the water flux perspective we found that there were large oscillations in the monthly changes in grace data fig 11 with an overestimation in shallow gws variations at the monthly temporal scale this discrepancy between grace based and swat simulated results was found at the subbasin scale and the regional scale fig 11 however according to a previous analysis section 3 3 1 several irrigation periods i e key water requirement periods for winter wheat and associated gws depletion in april may and november were detected by the grace satellites fig 7 although the grace estimated gws variations were sharp at the monthly scale the key signals of gws depletion by intensive pumping were captured during the main irrigation periods additionally through a calculation of the moving average every three months the discrepancies in monthly changes between swat simulations and grace estimates were reduced to a satisfactory range fig 7 this result implied that in the study area if pumping were reduced for instance if irrigation were to be prohibited in may grace data might have the capacity to reflect this action through variations in gws in fact since 2014 the chinese government has released several regulations to control groundwater extraction in this region the results of this study indicate that the grace satellites could serve as a monitoring tool and grace products could be used to establish regulatory measures and pumping regulations which would independently provide important and useful information for groundwater management the seasonal variations in grace data were smoothed to some extent but gws variations were overestimated in comparison with the swat simulation results fig 11 approximately 80 of the fitting points for the seasonal flux were distributed in the area with green shading i e the grace based and swat simulated data were positive or negative simultaneously implying that the grace estimates reflect the dynamics of shallow gws variations with the season fig 11 especially for the depletion signal during spring fig 8 when the temporal scale was aggregated to the interannual scale the correspondence between the grace based and swat simulated gws estimates improved significantly in terms of both the variation trend and amount fig 11 the satisfactory performance of grace products in estimating annual gws changes in subbasins and at the regional scale suggests that these data can be further applied in quantitative estimates of groundwater resources from a water balance perspective in this study we also calculated the grace estimated shallow gws changes based on a forward modeling method hereafter fm grace and compared the corresponding results i e the long term trends variations during crop growth periods and changes in the water flux to the swat simulated data for the time series of shallow gws anomalies in comparison with swat simulated data the average values of r2 and nse were 0 6 and 0 56 respectively for the fm grace results fig s1 in the supplementary material these values were lower correlations than those obtained with the joint inversion method hereafter ji grace fig 3 notably the ji grace results displayed better agreement with the swat simulated data than did the fm grace results for estimates of the long term gws depletion rate and its spatial distribution in all subbasins the relative errors of the grace based depletion rate compared with swat simulated results regrace swat were in the range of 50 to 50 using the joint inversion method fig 4 whereas for fm grace estimates only 10 subbasins displayed a regrace swat value within this range fig s2 in the supplementary material for the estimation of the variations in gws during the crop growth period fm grace data in the zyhp indicated that gws was depleted in the ww growth period but recovered in the sm growth period fig s3 in the supplementary material which agreed with the swat simulated results however in the dxp these typical trends phase changes in the ww sm double cropping system could not be detected by the fm grace data fig s3 in the supplementary material accordingly the ji grace estimates exhibited a better agreement with swat simulations fig 5 for the shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux both the monthly results and seasonal results of fm grace tended to exhibit less agreement with the swat simulated data than did the ji grace estimates the important signals of gws depletion in april may and november as well as the variations in spring figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material could not be detected by fm grace data this result suggests that ability of grace to consider the impacts of anthropogenic exploitation in this well irrigated plain region was improved significantly by applying the joint inversion method figs 7 and 8 because the ji grace estimates were sensitive to the irrigation intensity especially during the ww growth period fig 6 at the annual temporal scale although the water flux discrepancy between the swat simulated data and fm grace estimates was smaller than the monthly and seasonally variations fig s6 in the supplementary material the consistency between the annual change obtained with the forward modeling method and with swat was worse than that for the ji grace and swat estimates in most cases fig 9 overall in this well irrigated plain region the accuracy of grace based estimates using the joint inversion method of estimating shallow gws was significantly higher than that achieved with the forward modeling method especially from the water flux perspective notably this perspective has not been considered in most grace satellite studies the analysis period in this study was 2003 2012 and this ten year period was selected for conducting comparisons for several reasons first grace data availability 2003 present and swat data availability 1993 2012 overlap in this period the swat simulation period is limited by parameter calibration constraints and 1993 2012 is the optimal period for aggregating data from multiple sources e g groundwater resource assessments hydrogeological investigations and crop growth observations second after 2012 some surface water projects such as the south to north water diversion project and diversion project from the yellow river to baiyangdian were successively implemented these projects influenced multiperiod comparisons of groundwater storage changes in the study area third after 2012 some limited irrigation schemes were implemented by local authorities and series of policies were released by the chinese government to protect groundwater however it was difficult to generalize the variable irrigation schedule across this region which limited the extension of the swat simulation period future work will be required to conduct further comparisons over longer time periods if more detailed data are obtained uncertainties may be introduced when the spatial scale is transformed including the upscaling from the hydrological response unit hru the basic calculation unit in the swat model to the subbasin and the downscaling from the original resolution of the grace data to the 0 5 0 5 and further conversion to the subbasin scale a detailed and specialized uncertainty analysis needs to be further conducted which should be supported by more collectible data and advanced numerical algorithms 5 conclusions this study compared the shallow gws estimated by the grace satellite mission and the swat hydrological model which are two mutually independent and complementary approaches for exploring the consistency of gws estimates at different spatial and temporal scales a typical well irrigated plain region in the haihe river basin was investigated based on the data obtained between january 2003 and december 2012 good agreement was found between swat simulated and grace estimated shallow gws anomaly fluctuations with r2 and nse values of approximately 0 70 and 0 69 respectively satisfactory consistency was also observed in the comparison of the long term depletion rate and the spatial distribution of shallow gws suggesting that grace can be applied to fine spatial scales in this region approximately 23 000 km2 in particular the grace based variations in shallow gws during the crop growth period could adequately replicate the general trends of depletion in the winter wheat season and recovery in the summer maize season this result suggests that grace data could be used in studies of groundwater storage change in this groundwater fed agricultural area because the most typical hydrological characteristics were effectively captured another finding was related to the shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux which was often proved to have a relatively poor accuracy in previous grace based studies through comparisons of grace based and swat simulated results similarity in the seasonal variations and satisfactory estimates of annual variations were observed in most years despite an overestimation of the scope of fluctuations in the monthly variations several important signals of groundwater depletion by pumping for irrigating winter wheat in april may and november were detected by grace the good agreement regarding the water flux was achieved with the joint inversion method used for grace data processing compared to the grace based estimates obtained using a forward modeling method the estimates obtained for grace using joint inversion were significantly improved in terms of capturing gws depletion due to pumping for irrigation during the winter wheat growing period especially in spring the above results demonstrate that the grace estimates based on the joint inversion method could capture gws depletion in the study area thus grace could serve as a monitoring tool and be combined with the swat predictive model to quantify the anthropogenic impacts of irrigation on groundwater resources in the studied region of shallow groundwater overexploitation credit

3278,groundwater is a key component of the global hydrological cycle quantitative approaches to estimate the spatial and temporal changes in groundwater storage gws could provide solid foundation for sustainable management this study made a comprehensive comparison of gws changes based on two independent approaches the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission data the feasibility of using these two estimation methods to quantify shallow groundwater variations in the haihe river basin of china a globally representative overexploited area was assessed the grace derived gws changes were calculated based on independent component analysis and a joint inversion method the results showed that the grace estimated shallow gws anomalies during 2003 2012 agree well with the swat simulated data for the variations in the long term gws depletion rate we found that heterogeneity at 22 subbasin approximately 500 to 1500 km2 scales was detected by the grace data and these results were spatially coherent with the swat simulations based on the distributed modeling units and multiple inputs the grace estimates could adequately replicate the general trends of gws depletion in the winter wheat triticum aestivum l growth period and recovery in the summer maize zea mays l growth period specifically comparisons between grace based and swat simulated results indicated that the signals of pumping for winter wheat irrigation in several key water requirement periods in april may and november were identified by grace as were seasonal changes in shallow gws e g an obvious depletion in spring despite an overestimation of the scope of the fluctuations in grace estimates compared with those of swat simulations from the perspective of the water flux the effective identification of the impact of anthropogenic exploitation on shallow gws in grace suggests that this monitoring tool could be applied in the groundwater management of this plain this study demonstrated a good agreement between swat simulated and grace based shallow gws changes from the perspectives of long term trends and variations in crop seasons additionally satisfactory consistency was observed from the perspective of the water flux in this semiarid and semihumid study region considering the influence of human activities keywords groundwater storage change swat model grace satellite well irrigation haihe river basin 1 introduction groundwater is the largest global freshwater resource and is considered to be the most productive component of agricultural production systems maidment 1993 döll et al 2014 de graaf et al 2019 long et al 2020 xie et al 2020 however the high use of groundwater has created extensive concerns about overdraft and depletion in many irrigated regions around the world giordano 2009 wada et al 2012 scanlon et al 2012a jasechko and perrone 2021 hence quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial variations in groundwater storage gws is critically important for the sustainable management of water resources shah et al 2000 yin et al 2020 since its launch in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission has provided valuable information on gws changes in global hotspots of depletion such as the u s high plains and california s central valley strassberg et al 2007 longuevergne et al 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 scanlon et al 2012b northwest india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 long et al 2016 the middle east voss et al 2013 and north china feng et al 2013 moiwo et al 2013 tang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 the grace mission presents a new opportunity to monitor large scale gws changes and compensates for the shortage of ground based measurements which only provide point specific estimates feng et al 2013 hu and jiao 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 moreover hydrological models have been proven to be robust and useful tools for analyzing groundwater regimes and are thus widely applied for decision support in areas with major aquifers globally nakayama et al 2006 faunt 2009 hu et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012a shu et al 2012 cao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 cheema et al 2014 reshmidevi and kumar 2014 zhang et al 2016 a calibrated hydrological model has many advantages and can provide distributed simulations ground on the physically based characterization of real hydrological features maidment 1993 gws change a key representation of the water balance in aquifers has long been the focus of hydrological modeling studies in groundwater overdraft areas faunt 2009 scanlon et al 2012a zhang et al 2016 2018 zhang and ren 2021 thus hydrological models and grace satellite data should be mutually independent but complementary tools for estimating gws change at the regional scale however to date most studies that have assessed the validity of gws change estimates based on grace satellite data have been limited to in situ groundwater level observations yeh et al 2006 rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012b feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and few studies have compared grace based gws estimates with those of hydrological models notably gws change can be simulated by many hydrological models especially those based on water balance methods which provide a direct reference for grace data comparisons this approach could avoid possible errors associated with unknown specific yields during the conversion from observed water level fluctuations to water storage values additionally ground based measurements generally exhibit many gaps over time and space but this issue could be solved by obtaining flexible estimates at different spatiotemporal scales through the use of distributed hydrological models döll et al 2014 simulated groundwater depletion using the global hydrological model watergap and compared the results to grace satellite data india the united states iran saudi arabia and china were the countries with the highest groundwater depletion rates in the first decade of the 21st century but the low spatial resolution of grace data remains a challenge for groundwater analyses as groundwater depletion is often local in scale döll et al 2014 in this context focusing on a typical groundwater depletion region and conducting a detailed comparison between model and grace based gws changes at a fine spatial scale should provide abundant information and a comprehensive analysis of hydrological processes with respect to groundwater overdraft the north china plain ncp has long been a global hotspot for groundwater resource studies due to the extensive overexploitation for irrigation that occurs there feng et al 2013 quantified groundwater depletion in north china 370 000 km2 from grace satellite data and estimated gws loss at a rate of 22 3 mm a from 2003 to 2010 huang et al 2015 explored the capability of grace to detect heterogeneous gws variations in two subregions of the ncp they found that the piedmont plain 54 000 km2 mainly exploiting shallow groundwater exhibited a shallow gws loss at a rate of 46 5 6 8 mm a from 2003 to 2013 huang et al 2015 the region of interest in this study is the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province 23 000 km2 see fig 1 which is a typical area facing a dilemma between shallow groundwater drawdown and crop production zhang et al 2016 established a groundwater module enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model in this study area and used abundant data including groundwater resource assessment results and data of the depth to water table to conduct detailed calibration and validation multisource verification demonstrated that the modified swat model was acceptable for simulating shallow gws within a well considered generalization of the historical irrigation schedules in time and space zhang et al 2016 in this study we explored the consistency and dissimilarity in the spatial and temporal patterns of shallow gws changes in this study area estimated by the swat model and grace satellite data specifically we compared 1 the long term gws trends 2 the variability in gws trends during different crop growth periods for a winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l double cropping system and 3 the gws changes at monthly seasonal and annual scales from the perspective of the water flux the novel aspects of this analysis include exploring the reliability of grace derived gws at an unprecedented scale but also providing a case study for other irrigated regions based on monitoring groundwater depletion jointly using a distributed hydrological model and remote sensing data 2 methods and data 2 1 the study area the study area fig 1 is consistent with that used in our previous related research zhang et al 2016 2018 zhang and ren 2021 and it is located on the piedmont plain of mount taihang in the haihe river basin and a main part of ncp cropland is the dominant land use type in this region and the average cultivation ratio has been maintained at 80 since the 1990s hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the winter wheat

to its good quality chen and ni 1987 chen 1999 deep aquifers in the study area mainly provide urban domestic water sources but compared to the volume of shallow groundwater pumping for extensive irrigation the exploitation of deep groundwater is minimal accounting for only approximately 6 of shallow groundwater withdrawals national groundwater resources assessment project office 2004 hence the gws variations estimated by grace data approximate shallow gws variations in this study substantial pumping for irrigation in this region has resulted in rapid shallow groundwater table decline at a rate of approximately 1 m a zhang et al 2016 according to a related assessment the general office of the hebei people s government 2014 all of this well irrigated plain was located in areas of shallow groundwater overexploitation see fig 1 reflecting unsustainable utilization quantitatively estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal and interannual changes in shallow gws in this semiarid and subhumid continental monsoon climate area especially focusing on shallow groundwater depletion related to irrigation could provide comprehensive information to support policy making in this watershed 2 2 data processing for comparisons the study period was between january 2003 and december 2012 with a total of 115 monthly records for comparison grace based gws variation data were missing for the months of june 2003 january 2011 june 2011 may 2012 and october 2012 due to a lack of satellite observations first the swat simulated and grace based shallow gws anomalies were calculated separately 1 g w s a s w a t i sast i sast 2 g w s a g r a c e i e w h i e w h where gwsaswat i is the swat simulated shallow gws anomaly in the ith month mm sasti is the shallow aquifer

gws anomaly in the ith month mm ewhi is the equivalent water height in the ith month estimated from the grace satellite data mm and ewh is the monthly average equivalent water height in the analysis period estimated from the grace satellite data mm note that the average values were calculated during the study period of 2003 2012 and removed to derive the gws anomalies from the swat model and the grace data based on the time series of gwsaswat and gwsagrace results the long term trend of shallow gws over 10 years and the variability in the shallow gws trend during the crop growth period i e the slope of the linear approximations of gwsaswat and gwsagrace during the crop growth period estimated with the swat model and grace products were calculated and compared most of the published papers related to the evaluation of groundwater depletion using grace satellite data focused on variations in the gws trend however for the concept of water storage change another view considered grace data as flux information i e a flux perspective based on the water balance equation longuevergne 2016 as an important concept in hydrology the water balance approach is the driving force behind everything that occurs in a watershed in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 for the hydrological cycle in the groundwater system simulated in this model the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i was calculated based on the amount on day i 1 and the flows of water in to and out of the aquifer including recharge groundwater flow pumping etc on day i neitsch et al 2011 from this perspective the shallow gws change during a time step was equal to the difference in shallow aquifer storage between the beginning and the end of the selected time period hence to further explore the consistency of swat simulated and grace based estimations shallow gws changes based on the water flux were calculated as follows 3 δ g w s s w a t i sast i sast i 1 4 δ g w s g r a c e i e w h i e w h i 1 where δgwsswat i is the swat simulated shallow gws change in month season year i sast is the shallow aquifer storage simulated by the swat model δgwsgrace i is the grace based shallow gws change in month season year i ewh is the equivalent water height estimated by the grace satellite data the shallow aquifer storage water heights at seasonal and interannual scales were calculated by averaging the monthly results over the corresponding time steps the storage variations estimated by grace were converted from a 0 5 grid to subbasins see fig 1 in the swat model based on the weighted approach to provide storage values at the same spatial scale for comparison moreover to explore the different effects of the comparisons for varying area sizes and provide a convenient water management reference the estimated results in 22 subbasins approximately 500 to 1500 km2 were further aggregated into two hydrological regions approximately 10 000 to 15000 km2 i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp as well as the whole study area approximately 23 000 km2 in subsequent analyses fig 2 2 3 swat data swat is a physically based comprehensive river basin model that has been successfully applied globally including in agricultural water management e g kim et al 2008 xie et al 2008 2011 dhar and mazumdar 2009 oeurng et al 2011 the swat model includes a groundwater module that is represented into the shallow and deep aquifers neitsch et al 2011 the water stored in each aquifer is calculated at a daily time step based on the water balance equation however since the depth to water table is neither computed nor output directly in the basic model version it is difficult to calibrate the parameters of the groundwater module using water table fluctuation data hence we modified the shallow groundwater module by adding some new parameters e g the specific yield bottom bed burial depth porosity of the shallow aquifer and lateral groundwater recharge and applied it to the study area we used shallow groundwater table data from 16 national wells continuous monthly data from 1993 to 2010 and 148 investigation wells annual data from 2006 to 2012 to perform a detailed calibration and validation of the model zhang et al 2016 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 which is an effective method for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour et al 2004 2007 was used to conduct the calculations the values of the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the modified version of the efficiency criterion φ and the p factors and r factors statistical indices of the sufi 2 method indicated that the calibrated parameters were satisfactory see zhang et al 2016 notably the shallow aquifer water storage result output by the swat model was also validated by comparison to the groundwater resources assessment values national groundwater resources assessment project office 2004 and a relative deviation of 3 6 was observed demonstrating the rationality and reliability of the model in simulating the variations in shallow gws zhang et al 2016 therefore the modified swat model with appropriate boundary conditions can reasonably simulate the depletion of shallow gws in the studied agricultural district with intensive well irrigation zhang et al 2016 in this study the swat simulated shallow gws changes at different spatial and temporal scales were used as distributed hydrological modeling data to conduct comparisons 2 4 grace data to estimate gws changes over the study area we used the monthly grace level 2 rl06 spherical harmonic sh coefficient products from 2002 to 2014 provided by the center for space research csr of the university of texas at austin usa the degree 1 and zonal degree 2 sh coefficients were replaced as suggested in previous studies swenson et al 2008 cheng et al 2013 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction was applied based on the model from a et al 2013 in addition the ddk3 decorrelation filter was applied to reduce the correlated errors among the original grace sh coefficients kusche et al 2009 to further downscale and disaggregate the grace derived gws changes we used independent component analysis ica and a joint inversion method forootan et al 2017 firstly the different tws components with a spatial resolution of 0 5 in the watergap hydrological model wghm including surface water soil moisture groundwater etc were decomposed into temporal components and spatial modes based on the ica method then the spatial modes from these different tws components were smoothed with the ddk3 filter as grace data further these filtered spatial modes were used jointly to fit the grace derived twsa based on a least squares approach to derive robust temporal components for different tws components forootan et al 2017 finally the estimated temporal gws components were further combined with the original gws spatial modes from the wghm to obtain downscaled 0 5 0 5 gridded gws changes in addition we used the forward modeling method from chen et al 2015 with spatial constraints to derive gws changes in the study area in this method non groundwater tws components based on the gldas model were removed from grace derived twsa and then the forward modeling method was used to recover the gwsa signal in the study area additional details were provided by feng et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term gws trends the time series of swat simulated and grace based shallow gws anomalies from 2003 to 2012 in the 22 subbasins the two hydrological regions and the whole study area are shown in fig 3 similar trends in shallow gws were found for these two approaches fig 3 the average values of the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were 0 70 and 0 69 respectively in the study area even at the subbasin scale the evaluation indices still indicated good correspondence the r2 coefficients for all 22 subbasins ranged from 0 67 to 0 72 fig 3 displaying satisfactory consistency approximately 88 of the subbasins exhibited nses 0 6 and values 0 7 were observed in 20 of the subbasins only two subbasins zy1 and zy3 located in the wester central part of the study area displayed an nse below 0 5 fig 3 over the period from 2003 to 2012 the shallow gws anomalies exhibited a prolonged declining trend and the depletion rates were estimated to be 175 37 mm a by the swat model and 131 25 mm a by the grace satellite data the spatial patterns of the long term depletion rates in shallow gws by the swat model fig 4 a 1 and grace satellite data fig 4 a 2 were generally similar with a relatively slow rate of depletion in the subbasins located in the northern dxp and the southern zyhp regions and a relatively sharp rate of depletion in the mid eastern region of the study area the plots in fig 4 b 1 and b 2 provide the relative errors of the grace based depletion rate compared with the swat simulated results regrace swat in the 22 subbasins in subbasins zy1 and zy3 the depletion rate estimated by the grace satellites was 25 50 higher than that simulated by the swat model indicating an overestimation effect for the other 20 subbasins we found that the grace satellite data underestimated the shallow groundwater depletion rate eleven subbasins displayed regrace swat values in the range of 25 to 0 and 9 subbasins exhibited regrace swat values in the range of 50 to 25 in general the grace based and swat simulated long term depletion rates in shallow gws were in good agreement the grace based rate estimate for the whole study area was approximately 3 4 of that simulated by the swat model even at the subbasin scale the deviation between these two data series was less than 50 3 2 variability in gws trends during the two crop growth periods the variations in precipitation and well irrigation intensity in different periods are the main factors that influence the seasonal shallow groundwater change considering the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in this region in the study area the winter wheat ww growth period usually lasts from october to june of the next year and the summer maize sm growth period is july to september the plots in fig 5 provide a comparison of the variations in shallow gws anomalies during ww and sm growth periods separately notably both the grace based and swat simulated shallow gws trends indicate depletion in the ww growth period and recovery in the sm growth period in all the subbasins fig 5 implying that grace can capture the general trends phase changes of shallow gws for the double cropping system in this well irrigated plain region specifically the variations in shallow gws during the ww growth period estimated by grace and swat were 39 75 mm month and 23 39 mm month respectively and the corresponding results for the sm growth period were 50 17 mm month and 23 45 mm month respectively we noted that there was a mismatch in the variation in shallow gws during the sm growth period in 2007 2008 and 2009 with a loss trend estimated by grace and a recovery trend outputted by swat fig 5 in addition the grace based variations in shallow gws during the sm growth period in 2010 were much higher than those simulated by the swat model fig 5 which indicated obvious overestimation however for the estimation during the ww growth period much better agreement was observed for the depletion trend and the depletion rate between the grace based and swat simulated results fig 5 this finding implied that the grace satellites could better capture the variations in shallow gws during the ww growing season which is characterized by less precipitation and higher irrigation amounts than those during the sm growing season the point plots in fig 6 also indicate that good correspondence i e points close to the 1 1 line tends to be associated with a high irrigation amount during both the ww and sm growth periods the high pumping intensity required to irrigate winter wheat was the main factor that led to groundwater drawdown in the study region grace based estimates reflected the impact of anthropogenic exploitation on groundwater resources thus grace satellite remote sensing products might have potential for applications in hydrology as monitoring tools for assessing groundwater utilization in this typical well irrigated plain region 3 3 gws changes from the perspective of the water flux 3 3 1 monthly variations fig 7 shows the grace based and swat simulated monthly shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux calculated on the basis of equations 3 and 4 in section 2 2 for the swat simulation results decreases in shallow gws were found in april may june and november in almost every year while in january march july to october and december shallow gws mainly exhibited a recovery trend fig 7 a 1 for the grace satellite estimates depletion in shallow gws was found in january march april may and november in almost every year while in june august october and december shallow groundwater recovery signals were observed fig 7 a 2 notably april may and november corresponded to the jointing stage the heading and filling stage and the overwintering stage respectively which are the key water requirement periods for winter wheat wang 2011 li and yang 2017 the generalized historical irrigation schedule for winter wheat in this study area based on multiple sources haihe river water conservancy commission 1986 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 also suggested that from 2003 2012 farmers utilized irrigation in these four growth periods for winter wheat i e approximately mid april mid may late may and mid november zhang et al 2016 analyzed the simulated shallow groundwater variations at the daily step in a typical hydrological response unit hru in the study area and found that these periods of well irrigation constituted the main cause of groundwater decline in this plain region the above comparisons in this section indicate that the grace satellites can precisely capture the depletion signal for shallow gws caused by the four stages of irrigation pumping for winter wheat it should be noted that this finding implies that even at the monthly timescale grace estimates of shallow gws changes in the study area are still relatively useful especially for monitoring irrigation pumping activities during the key water requirement periods of winter wheat however compared to the swat simulated results the grace based estimates exhibited a large scope of fluctuation in the monthly flux of shallow gws grace based estimates of the gws flux were larger than 100 mm month in approximately 3 5 of the 110 months analyzed fig 7 a 2 the swat simulated results were less than 100 mm month in most months except for may fig 7 a 1 to smooth the amplitude of grace estimates of monthly gws changes a three month moving average was applied and the results are presented in fig 7 b 2 the same process was applied to the swat simulated data for comparison fig 7 b 1 the shallow gws changes estimated by the swat model after smoothing exhibited deficit variations from march to june and october to december and these variations were effectively captured by grace in addition the discrepancies in the ranges of monthly changes estimated with these two approaches were much reduced by using the three month moving average fig 7 b 1 and b 2 3 3 2 seasonal variations from the perspective of seasonal variations similar shallow gws trends between the swat simulated and grace based models were found as shown in fig 8 a 1 and a 2 specifically shallow gws decreased markedly in the spring march to may but partially recovered in summer june to august and this trend was successfully detected by grace in the study area spring and summer are the most representative seasons with intensive irrigation pumping and precipitation respectively the irrigation in spring 250 mm on average and precipitation in summer 320 mm on average account for approximately 65 of the corresponding annual amounts fig 8 b 1 and b 2 in other words the shallow gws changes were lowest deficit in spring due to irrigation pumping and highest surplus in summer because of rainfall recharge in this plain region with a crop rotation system confirming the grace results in addition in autumn september to november and winter december to february next year with comparatively low precipitation and irrigation amounts fig 8 b 3 the variations in shallow gws estimated by grace exhibited a trend similar to that of the swat simulated results fig 8 a 1 and a 2 in general the plots based on both the swat model and grace data indicated that shallow gws decreased slightly in the fall and increased slightly in the winter fig 8 a 1 and a 2 overall despite the overestimation of the grace based seasonal variations good correspondence was found between the variation trends in the four seasons fig 8 a 1 and a 2 3 3 3 annual variations based on the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from 22 weather stations see zhang et al 2016 2018 the precipitation exceedance probability pep in each year during the analysis period was calculated using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 fig 9 shows the comparisons of interannual changes in shallow gws based on swat and grace in wet years pep 25 normal years 25 pep 75 and dry years pep 75 we found that in 2004 and 2011 the grace based results in all subbasins reflected an increase in shallow gws which was contrary to the actual depletion that occurred for consecutive years in this region it should be noted that for the 22 subbasins the peps in these two years were different including wet normal and dry years implying that the discrepancies might be related to the uncertainty of the grace satellite signal during these periods but not the real hydrological variables however in the other eight years in the analysis period a similar annual decreasing trend was found between the grace based and swat simulated results fig 9 the points in the area between the two dotted lines i e y 2x and y 1 2 x in fig 9 indicate that the annual changes in shallow gws estimated by grace are in the range of half to double the swat simulated changes illustrating good correspondence in the 22 subbasins the frequency of these points during the eight years was 37 5 subbasin zy10 at a minimum 87 5 subbasins dx8 and dx9 at a maximum and 61 4 on average suggesting that grace provided satisfactory estimates in most years from 2003 to 2012 the average annual variations in shallow gws in the 10 subbasins of the dxp simulated by the swat model were 117 mm 171 mm and 175 mm in wet years normal years and dry years respectively the corresponding grace estimated results for the 10 subbasins of the dxp were 142 mm 141 mm and 152 mm as a result the relative error of grace estimates compared with swat simulations was 21 4 in wet years 17 5 in normal years and 13 1 in dry years for the 12 subbasins of the zyhp the relative errors in wet years normal years and dry years were 38 4 swat simulation 135 mm grace estimation 219 mm 26 0 swat simulation 181 mm grace estimation 134 mm and 31 2 swat simulation 176 mm grace estimation 121 mm respectively better agreement between the interannual changes in shallow gws based on swat and grace was observed in normal and dry years than in wet years and better agreement was observed in the hydrological region of the dxp than in the zyhp region 4 discussion the haihe river basin is a typical hotspot of groundwater depletion globally with intensive well irrigated agriculture obtaining quantitative estimates of gws changes has become an important step in promoting sustainability in this region measurements of the water storage variations in underground aquifers remains a challenge especially in reference to measurements for surface water bodies such as rivers lakes and reservoirs there is increasing interest in using grace satellite data to remotely monitor gws changes additionally hydrological modeling based on numerical simulations has been a traditional approach for assessing the groundwater balance döll et al 2014 compared the groundwater depletion simulated by the global hydrological model watergap with grace estimated results at the global scale at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 what distinguishes our study from other grace applications is that our comprehensive comparisons highlight the distributed subbasin results rather than using ground based or in situ data and focus on fine spatial and temporal scales the plots in fig 10 provide a comprehensive comparison of the correspondence between grace based and swat simulated shallow gws changes with regard to the long term trend and rate of variation during the crop growth period at different spatiotemporal scales long term trends in shallow gws series from 2003 2012 estimated by these two approaches were in good agreement at both regional and subbasin scales fig 10 with all the fit points distributed in the area of satisfactory correspondence between the lines of y 2x and y 1 2 x this finding highlights the potential of remote sensing based hydrological analyses in this well irrigated plain region notably the area of each of the 22 subbasins is only approximately 500 to 1500 km2 much less than the grace footprint therefore grace can not only detect gws depletion but also quantify the rate of depletion at fine spatial scales in addition because the gws depletion rate is a major concern for national governments and policy makers the good performance of the grace satellite based approach supports the use of grace products for obtaining independent estimates that can be combined with data from groundwater level monitoring networks it should be another interesting finding that the grace satellites can capture the depletion trends in shallow gws during winter wheat growth periods fig 10 implying good identifiability of anthropogenic groundwater use for irrigation which is a typical agrohydrological characteristic in this region from the water flux perspective we found that there were large oscillations in the monthly changes in grace data fig 11 with an overestimation in shallow gws variations at the monthly temporal scale this discrepancy between grace based and swat simulated results was found at the subbasin scale and the regional scale fig 11 however according to a previous analysis section 3 3 1 several irrigation periods i e key water requirement periods for winter wheat and associated gws depletion in april may and november were detected by the grace satellites fig 7 although the grace estimated gws variations were sharp at the monthly scale the key signals of gws depletion by intensive pumping were captured during the main irrigation periods additionally through a calculation of the moving average every three months the discrepancies in monthly changes between swat simulations and grace estimates were reduced to a satisfactory range fig 7 this result implied that in the study area if pumping were reduced for instance if irrigation were to be prohibited in may grace data might have the capacity to reflect this action through variations in gws in fact since 2014 the chinese government has released several regulations to control groundwater extraction in this region the results of this study indicate that the grace satellites could serve as a monitoring tool and grace products could be used to establish regulatory measures and pumping regulations which would independently provide important and useful information for groundwater management the seasonal variations in grace data were smoothed to some extent but gws variations were overestimated in comparison with the swat simulation results fig 11 approximately 80 of the fitting points for the seasonal flux were distributed in the area with green shading i e the grace based and swat simulated data were positive or negative simultaneously implying that the grace estimates reflect the dynamics of shallow gws variations with the season fig 11 especially for the depletion signal during spring fig 8 when the temporal scale was aggregated to the interannual scale the correspondence between the grace based and swat simulated gws estimates improved significantly in terms of both the variation trend and amount fig 11 the satisfactory performance of grace products in estimating annual gws changes in subbasins and at the regional scale suggests that these data can be further applied in quantitative estimates of groundwater resources from a water balance perspective in this study we also calculated the grace estimated shallow gws changes based on a forward modeling method hereafter fm grace and compared the corresponding results i e the long term trends variations during crop growth periods and changes in the water flux to the swat simulated data for the time series of shallow gws anomalies in comparison with swat simulated data the average values of r2 and nse were 0 6 and 0 56 respectively for the fm grace results fig s1 in the supplementary material these values were lower correlations than those obtained with the joint inversion method hereafter ji grace fig 3 notably the ji grace results displayed better agreement with the swat simulated data than did the fm grace results for estimates of the long term gws depletion rate and its spatial distribution in all subbasins the relative errors of the grace based depletion rate compared with swat simulated results regrace swat were in the range of 50 to 50 using the joint inversion method fig 4 whereas for fm grace estimates only 10 subbasins displayed a regrace swat value within this range fig s2 in the supplementary material for the estimation of the variations in gws during the crop growth period fm grace data in the zyhp indicated that gws was depleted in the ww growth period but recovered in the sm growth period fig s3 in the supplementary material which agreed with the swat simulated results however in the dxp these typical trends phase changes in the ww sm double cropping system could not be detected by the fm grace data fig s3 in the supplementary material accordingly the ji grace estimates exhibited a better agreement with swat simulations fig 5 for the shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux both the monthly results and seasonal results of fm grace tended to exhibit less agreement with the swat simulated data than did the ji grace estimates the important signals of gws depletion in april may and november as well as the variations in spring figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material could not be detected by fm grace data this result suggests that ability of grace to consider the impacts of anthropogenic exploitation in this well irrigated plain region was improved significantly by applying the joint inversion method figs 7 and 8 because the ji grace estimates were sensitive to the irrigation intensity especially during the ww growth period fig 6 at the annual temporal scale although the water flux discrepancy between the swat simulated data and fm grace estimates was smaller than the monthly and seasonally variations fig s6 in the supplementary material the consistency between the annual change obtained with the forward modeling method and with swat was worse than that for the ji grace and swat estimates in most cases fig 9 overall in this well irrigated plain region the accuracy of grace based estimates using the joint inversion method of estimating shallow gws was significantly higher than that achieved with the forward modeling method especially from the water flux perspective notably this perspective has not been considered in most grace satellite studies the analysis period in this study was 2003 2012 and this ten year period was selected for conducting comparisons for several reasons first grace data availability 2003 present and swat data availability 1993 2012 overlap in this period the swat simulation period is limited by parameter calibration constraints and 1993 2012 is the optimal period for aggregating data from multiple sources e g groundwater resource assessments hydrogeological investigations and crop growth observations second after 2012 some surface water projects such as the south to north water diversion project and diversion project from the yellow river to baiyangdian were successively implemented these projects influenced multiperiod comparisons of groundwater storage changes in the study area third after 2012 some limited irrigation schemes were implemented by local authorities and series of policies were released by the chinese government to protect groundwater however it was difficult to generalize the variable irrigation schedule across this region which limited the extension of the swat simulation period future work will be required to conduct further comparisons over longer time periods if more detailed data are obtained uncertainties may be introduced when the spatial scale is transformed including the upscaling from the hydrological response unit hru the basic calculation unit in the swat model to the subbasin and the downscaling from the original resolution of the grace data to the 0 5 0 5 and further conversion to the subbasin scale a detailed and specialized uncertainty analysis needs to be further conducted which should be supported by more collectible data and advanced numerical algorithms 5 conclusions this study compared the shallow gws estimated by the grace satellite mission and the swat hydrological model which are two mutually independent and complementary approaches for exploring the consistency of gws estimates at different spatial and temporal scales a typical well irrigated plain region in the haihe river basin was investigated based on the data obtained between january 2003 and december 2012 good agreement was found between swat simulated and grace estimated shallow gws anomaly fluctuations with r2 and nse values of approximately 0 70 and 0 69 respectively satisfactory consistency was also observed in the comparison of the long term depletion rate and the spatial distribution of shallow gws suggesting that grace can be applied to fine spatial scales in this region approximately 23 000 km2 in particular the grace based variations in shallow gws during the crop growth period could adequately replicate the general trends of depletion in the winter wheat season and recovery in the summer maize season this result suggests that grace data could be used in studies of groundwater storage change in this groundwater fed agricultural area because the most typical hydrological characteristics were effectively captured another finding was related to the shallow gws changes from the perspective of the water flux which was often proved to have a relatively poor accuracy in previous grace based studies through comparisons of grace based and swat simulated results similarity in the seasonal variations and satisfactory estimates of annual variations were observed in most years despite an overestimation of the scope of fluctuations in the monthly variations several important signals of groundwater depletion by pumping for irrigating winter wheat in april may and november were detected by grace the good agreement regarding the water flux was achieved with the joint inversion method used for grace data processing compared to the grace based estimates obtained using a forward modeling method the estimates obtained for grace using joint inversion were significantly improved in terms of capturing gws depletion due to pumping for irrigation during the winter wheat growing period especially in spring the above results demonstrate that the grace estimates based on the joint inversion method could capture gws depletion in the study area thus grace could serve as a monitoring tool and be combined with the swat predictive model to quantify the anthropogenic impacts of irrigation on groundwater resources in the studied region of shallow groundwater overexploitation credit

step in all aspects of hydrological and environmental sciences prior to water cycle scenario assessment azari et al 2015 meyer oliveira et al 2021 soil erosion simulation guo et al 2002 santos et al 2012 shirazi et al 2020 drought and flood monitoring chen et al 2016 reddy and singh 2014 as well as water pollution assessment and prevention cho and ha 2010 liang et al 2015 xia et al 2019 which is always accomplished through parameter optimization hydrological models primarily distributed ones have many parameters for a better description of the hydrological processes the values of model parameters vary significantly due to the spatial heterogeneities in soil land cover climate etc shi et al 2013 thus parameter optimization is essential for distributed hydrological models dhms to improve their regional practicality and applicability li et al 2021 unfortunately it remains a challenging task due to the computational burden and the equifinality issue from calibrating many parameters simultaneously clark et al 2011 renard et al 2010 a possible way to overcome these obstacles is to reduce parameter dimension through sensitivity analysis sa gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 which is a practical parameter screening approach by identifying the model parameters that have a significant effect on the output variability aparicio et al 2022 pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2004 benefiting from providing the total effect acquisition of input factors while maintaining computational efficiency the global sa gsa based on the design of experiment doe is more appropriate for qualitative and quantitative assessment of multi parameter dhms gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 liu et al 2020 xing et al 2021 it usually involves two steps 1 implementing the doe algorithms to generate a series of parameter samples in the feasible space and 2 inputting the samples into the model to obtain the model outputs that the performance indicators could evaluate significantly some doe based gsa methods require special sampling algorithms such as morris one at a time moat morris 1991 as tong and graziani 2008 suggested an appropriate combination of gsa method and doe algorithm is crucial for effective sa since it can save the computational cost visibly without sacrificing the model performance thus the first two issues we would like to address in this paper are which doe algorithm is appropriate for the gsa method and how many samples are required at least although much previous research focused on the parameter sa and optimization they were generally studied separately and rarely analyzed comprehensively for example some studies performed the effectiveness and the efficiency analysis of various gsa methods but none of them conducted the experiments to optimize the sensitive parameters sps gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 mulungu and munishi 2007 pang et al 2020 other studies performed both sa and optimization of parameters but they did not clarify the effect of sa in the optimization process or the diversity between optimizing only sps and all parameters aps gan et al 2018 goeury et al 2022 gou et al 2020 even if a few studies covered the above aspects it is a pity that they often considered only one doe algorithm or sample size setting li et al 2021 song et al 2012 remarkably most studies only chose one model performance indicator closely related to the doe process and directly affects the sa results lacking credibility from extensive evaluation with multi objective functions therefore the other points we aim to address are whether multiple indicators contribute to obtaining reliable sa results and how does parameter sa affect parameter optimization of the dhms to achieve the mentioned objectives a sa system named multiple global sensitivity analysis methods design of experiment algorithms indicators and sample size design combinations gdiscs is proposed in this paper specifically four doe algorithms are applied for collecting samples with varying sizes and three indicators are employed to evaluate the corresponding model performances using the collected parameter samples and the model outputs sa is performed using one qualitative gsa method and two quantitative methods to screen sps the gdiscs system is first applied to the block wise use of the topmodel btop model and verified in the upper min river basin umrb all related operations are achieved on the uncertainty quantification python laboratory uq pyl platform which has strengths in performing various uq tasks including experimental design statistical analysis sensitivity analysis surrogate modeling and parameter optimization duan et al 2017 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2016 then the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 which is the default optimization method of the btop model ao et al 2006 takeuchi et al 2008 is applied to calibrate aps and only sps respectively ultimately the following four questions need to be addressed to evaluate the proposed gdiscs system 1 effectiveness which doe algorithm could obtain reasonable samples to achieve reliable sa by the gsa method 2 efficiency how many samples from the applicable doe algorithm are sufficient for the robust sa results 3 credibility are the sps screening results of the samples with various model performance indicators consistent 4 significance can parameter sa with gdiscs system reduce the model runs to shorten the parameter optimization duration in the remaining part of this paper section 2 describes the materials and methods including the study area and datasets the btop model and its parameters the experimental setup and gdiscs system development and the evaluation approach in sps screening and model performance section 3 shows the sa and optimization results of the parameters the discussion of the effectiveness and efficiency of different gsa methods for the sps screening and the effect of sa on optimization are addressed in section 4 finally we present the conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area as the tributary of the yangtze river with abundant water resources the min river basin is the primary water source of the chengdu plain chen et al 2019 during the 13th five year plan of china the gdp of the chengdu plain economic zone increased from 1 91 trillion chinese yuan cny at the end of the 12th five year plan to 2 95 trillion cny accounting for more than 60 of sichuan province sichuan provincial bureau of statistics 2021 by 2025 technological innovation and the digital economy are planned to develop together and the total economic volume will exceed 4 trillion cny the people s government of sichuan province 2022 the water supply pressure of the min river basin will increase sharply with the rapid economic development accordingly strengthening water resource management to avoid unbalanced water supply ensuring water environment safety and promoting sustainable and coordinated development of the ecological environment are vital issues that need to be focused on hou et al 2018 xu et al 2019 on the other hand this river provides domestic water for about 23 million people and irrigation water for about 7260 km2 irrigation areas through the dujiangyan project huang et al 2021 thus understanding the hydrological process in the upper min river basin umrb above dujiangyan fig 1 latitudes 30 45 n 33 10 n and longitudes 102 35 e 103 57 e wgs 1984 utm zone 48n has significant benefits to the development of chengdu plain moreover the umrb transitions from the qinghai tibet plateau to the chengdu plain with obvious diversity advantages in the underlying surface and climate and is not affected by anthropogenic activities as much as the middle and lower reaches where the economic zone locates the umrb is about 22 569 km2 and the river length is about 340 km the northern and northwestern parts of the basin are the cold plateau with annual mean precipitation of about 650 810 mm under the influence of the foehn effect caused by subsidence warming the central regions have the least precipitation the annual mean rainfall is only 460 590 mm the southeastern area is warm and humid its annual mean temperature is about 15 and its annual mean precipitation is 1000 1600 mm zhang et al 2012 the average annual runoff in the umrb is about 14 5 billion m3 at the zipingpu site as shown in fig 1 the umrb was divided into eight blocks for numerical simulations in this paper based on the location of the eight river gauges including zipingpu zpp jiangsheba jsb sangping sap shaba sb zhenjiangguan zjg zagunao zgn heishui hs and songpan sp 2 1 2 hydro meteorological data and other inputs accurately simulating the runoff is a formidable challenge in the umrb due to the numerous hydraulic projects which greatly contribute to socio economic development fang and popole 2020 wu et al 2020 to minimize the simulation uncertainties from the dam reservoir module and the related module inputs we collected the daily runoff observations from jan 1st 1982 to dec 31st 1987 at eight river gauges from the hydrological data yearbooks and the daily precipitation of 21 rain gauges fig 1 table 1 shows the data which used for the evaporation module of btop model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 zhou et al 2006 to obtain the potential interception evaporation pet0 potential evapotranspiration pet and leaf area index lai for the hydrological simulation they were divided into a calibration period from jan 1st 1982 to dec 31st 1985 and a validation period from jan 1st 1986 to dec 31st 1987 as for other inputs we obtained the 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission and resampled it to 1 km for the hydrological simulation the land cover map fig s2 was from the version 2 international geosphere biosphere programme igbp global land cover dataset igbp discover with an original resolution of 1 km loveland et al 2000 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao provided the soil distribution in the study area and the soil types are reclassified into loam sandy clay loam clay loam and clay on the basis of the united states department of agriculture usda classification with a resolution of 1 km moreover these characteristics of each sub basin are summarized in table 2 2 2 btop model and parameters based on the well known topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 the btop model was firstly exploited by the university of yamanashi in 1999 for the simple and robust hydrology simulations ao et al 1999 takeuchi et al 1999 it simulates the rainfall runoff processes at each grid by reformulating the topographical index with the block wise concept moreover the btop model is developed and integrated several modules such as the core runoff generation topmodel parameterization sce ua flow routing muskingum cunge and evapotranspiration s w modules optional snow process soil freezing and dam reservoir modules takeuchi et al 2008 gusyev et al 2017 to date the btop model has been widely applied for the flood and drought evaluation water infrastructure land use planning pollutant transport and climate variability scenarios in nearly 2300 basins worldwide ao et al 2003 gusyev et al 2016 shrestha et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 as a semi physically based distributed hydrological model the btop model has seven types of parameters with specific physical interpretations as shown in table 3 ao et al 2006 takeuchi et al 2008 zhu et al 2021 in detail the parameters sdbar m n 0 and α are calibrated in each divided block and we denote these block scale parameters as bi ci di and ei respectively the parameter d 0 is estimated from the groundwater dischargebility of clay d 0 clay denoted as a1 sand d 0 sand denoted as a2 and silt d 0 silt denoted as a3 values gusyev et al 2017 takeuchi et al 2008 accordingly the number of the parameters to be optimized is 3 4nk nk is the number of the divided blocks this paper calls them parametric variables and the number is 35 nk 8 2 3 experimental setup and gdiscs system development we carry out four major steps in this study concerning how the gdiscs system executes an sa task as shown in fig 2 in step 1 we specify the model parameter file including parameter name range and distribution and apply varying doe algorithms of latin hypercube lh symmetric latin hypercube slh monte carlo mc and quasi monte carlo qmc to prepare parameter samples of the btop model in step 2 for breeding the parameter sensitivities the sample sets generated in the previous step are fed into the btop model to obtain the corresponding values of three model performance indicators in step 3 we carry out sa exercises with a qualitative method of morris one at a time moat quantitative derivative based global sensitivity measurement dgsm and response surface method based sobol rsmsobol to evaluate their effectiveness and efficiency in sps screening these steps complete the development of the gdiscs system as shown in the dashed orange frame in fig 2 in step 4 only sps are optimized by sce ua using the result of the gdiscs we compare the corresponding flow simulation with the case of optimizing aps to evaluate the impact of reducing parameter dimension on the parameter optimization process 2 3 1 doe algorithms doe is an experiment that observes the model outputs by flexibly changing the input factors as needed to identify the factors with significant influence effectively the most concerning issues in adopting doe are whether the sample points can fill the design space kuhnt and steinberg 2010 and how many sample points are sufficient loeppky et al 2009 uniform sampling algorithms are usually recommended for parameter sa as they can consistently generate spatially representative sample sets with a small size of sample points duan et al 2016 gan et al 2014 liu et al 2020 liu and sun 2010 in this paper we select four uniform doe algorithms that are available in the uq pyl platform including monte carlo mc quasi monte carlo qmc latin hypercube lh and symmetric latin hypercube slh mc metropolis and ulam 1949 is a frequently used doe algorithm it has advantages for high dimensional problems since it is only affected by the standard deviation and sample size however its error always converges slowly the method that replaces the random sequence in the mc sampling with a deterministic low deviation sequence is called qmc niederreiter and harald 1992 also known as the deterministic mc besides improving accuracy it can speed up the convergence for the cases with high dimensions the lh method proposed by mckay et al 1979 is suitable for the stratified sampling design of any dimension in theory both lh and slh can generate a sample point in the small hypercube in each row and column nonetheless the collected test points by lh are random while those by slh are symmetrical for good space filling property morris and mitchell 1995 2 3 2 gsa methods 2 3 2 1 qualitative moat method moat morris 1991 is a qualitative method suitable for models with many uncertainty factors and high calculation costs and the morris sampling is the special sampling algorithm of the qualitative moat method which tends to perform well in the qualitative sa gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 it can obtain the sensitivity information by the basic statistics for elementary effect ee of each input variable campolongo et al 2007 for an orthogonal input space with n dimension and p level the ee of the input variables is defined as 1 d i f x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x n f x δ where i is the i th input variable and δ is the predetermined multiple of 1 p 1 which usually takes p 2 p 1 as p is an even number the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the sample gradients are used to estimate the overall and interaction impact of x 2 μ i x j 1 r d i j r 3 σ i x j 1 r d i j μ i x 2 r where r is the trajectories number of the points in the input space given the possible negative effects on the mean in eq 2 campolongo et al 2007 pointed out that the modified mean μ is acceptable and convenient to provide a reliable gsa of the input factors assuming that the input changes at selected levels p in the input space the test area becomes an n dimensional p level grid and the formula of μ is 4 μ i x j 1 r d i j r in this research we set p to 4 which is the default value in the uq pyl platform and the value used in morris 1991 and campolongo et al 2007 moreover the modified mean denoted as si moat 1 and the standard deviation denoted as si moat 2 are construed as the sensitivity indices of the parameter variables in the btop model 2 3 2 2 quantitative methods 1 derivative based global sensitivity measurement dgsm dgsm is a quantitative gsa method based on the calculation of the response function partial derivative of the input factors at multiple points kucherenko et al 2009 and kucherenko and song 2016 have proved that the time required for a numerical evaluation of the dgsm method with the samples from the mc algorithm is significantly less than the commonly used sobol method defined a continuously differentiable function f x in the unit hypercube in there are some theorems related to the total sensitivity index sti dgsm and the derivative f xi 5 s t i d g s m 1 π 2 d i n f x x i 2 d x 6 d i n f 2 x d x f 0 2 i 1 n d i i j n n d ij i n n d 1 n where d is the total variance di is the first order effect for each factor and dij to di n are the interactions among the factors considering a set of values ν 1 νn such that 7 ν i i n f x x i 2 d x 1 i n where νi is similar to the si moat 1 in moat and the smaller νi the less sensitive the variable xi is moreover the utilization of νi can get the sti dgsm value without knowing the upper limit of the partial derivative kucherenko et al 2009 i e 8 s t i d g s m ν i π 2 d 2 response surface method based sobol rsmsobol with the rapid development of computer technology the parameter sa of the dhms has gradually involved surrogate modeling techniques such as the response surface method rsm ratto et al 2007 shahsavani and grimvall 2011 showed that the rsm based gsa method makes the importance estimation of model parameters more efficient based on the popular sobol method saltelli 2002 sobol 2001 rsmsobol method a non parametric response surface technology was built by combining with the support vector machine storlie et al 2009 define a square integrable function f x in the unit hypercube in 9 f x f 0 i 1 n f i x i i 1 n j i n f ij x i x j f 1 2 n x 1 x 2 x n where the items are defined by ratto et al 2007 10 f 0 e f x f i x i e f x x i f 0 f ij x i x j e f x x i x j e f x x i e f x x j f 0 the variance based methods like rsmsobol always estimate the importance of input factors with using a variance ratio and the total sensitivity index sti rsm was defined by homma and saltelli 1996 and song et al 2012 11 s t i r s m e d f x x i d where the subscript i refers to all of the inputs except the i th tong and graziani 2008 pointed that although the variance decomposition is no longer valid when the inputs are correlated eq 11 is still available for the sa 2 3 3 sample size setup the sample size required for sa is closely related to the number of experimental factors n in this paper the study area was divided into eight blocks fig 1 and the number of parameter variables is 35 by referring to table 3 morris 1991 proposed a practical design for constructing r trajectories of n 1 points in the input space so that the sample size needed for the moat method is r n 1 considering a sufficient sample size is necessary for the sps screening and the effectiveness evaluation of gsa methods the empirical rule believes that at least 10 n samples should be required levy and steinberg 2010 gan et al 2014 obtained reliable sa results of the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model with 13 tunable parameters by setting the maximum sample sizes between 2 777 and 3 000 which are more than twenty times the required minimum sample size i e 130 thus we set the maximum size of variable samples as 9 360 r 260 which is more than twenty six times the minimum size i e 350 as for the efficiency evaluation the sample sizes of parameter variables are set as 72 108 180 360 720 1 080 1 800 2 520 and 3 600 r 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 50 70 and 100 which are used for all gsa methods to avoid time waste for repeated sampling 2 3 4 parameter optimization method sce ua method which combines the advantages of the downhill simplex method and the steepest descent algorithm is one of the well behaved optimization algorithms for the parameter optimization of the nonlinear and complex dhms duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 it utilizes the concepts of controlled random search competitive evolution and the crucial complex shuffling to solve constrained optimization problems furthermore the optimal parameters will be found when the convergence criterion i e the function value is not improved after a certain shuffling loop number nloop is met after repeating the evolution and shuffling steps francés et al 2007 kan et al 2018 in this paper we set nloop is 20 which has been proved able to capture the changes between the optimization process of sps and aps by li et al 2021 in addition the maximum number of iterations nmaxr is set to 20 000 and the optimization will also stop once the model runs exceed this value 2 4 evaluation approach 2 4 1 evaluation criterion of sensitive parameter screening as described in section 2 2 only the parameter values of the blocks above the gauge site called sub basin in this paper impact its flow simulation and the number of the relevant blocks is denoted by nb for example there are two blocks above sb and the nb value of the sb sub basin is two correspondingly two new evaluation factors the number ratio rn and the sensitivity index ratio rs are employed for comparing the sa results from the gdiscs system the rn is expressed as follows 12 r n n s n b where ns is the number of the screened sensitive parameter variables and nb is the number of the blocks above the river gauge the rs is defined based on the sensitivity index si 13 r s i 1 n p s i i 1 4 n k 3 s i where nk is the number of the divided blocks which is 8 in this study and np is the number of the variables in each parameter which is 3 for the parameter d 0 and is equal to nk for the other four parameters for the qualitative moat method wang et al 2016 applied the rule of thumb that the si moat 1 ratio of the most sensitive parameter to the least sensitive one is less than a certain threshold say 15 20 for delineating sps from insensitive ones thus rn is used to count the parameter variables that satisfy the thumb rule in this study and if rn greater than 0 5 we can consider that the corresponding parameter is sensitive moreover rs is used for evaluating the sensitivity level of each parameter for the quantitative methods rn is no longer applicable due to the lack of empirical threshold that can be referred to a proper rs threshold will be set for the quantitative screening according to the rs values of the sps screened by the moat method concerning the efficiency evaluation sample size can be regarded as the minimum required if the sa results related to various model performance indicators are consistent well with that of the 9 360 samples in the effectiveness evaluation and remain unchanged with a larger size on the other hand there is some order of magnitude discrepancies in the sensitivity index values due to the varying doe algorithms and model performance indicators to facilitate the comparison we map the index values to the range from zero to one by the min max normalization jain et al 2005 inevitably the rule of thumb threshold of the moat method should also be normalized this paper considers the parameter variable sensitive if both si moat 1 and si moat 2 values exceed the normalized threshold approximately 0 050 0 065 2 4 2 performance assessment of btop model the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 are the two indicators widely applied for evaluation and calibration of the dhms 14 rmse t 1 n q sim t q obs t n 2 15 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the total number of time steps qt obs and qt sim are the observed and simulated runoff corresponding to the time step t q obs is the average value of the observed runoff it is easy to find that the nse is obtained by dividing the square of the rmse by the observation variance and subtracting that ratio from 1 0 knoben et al 2019 besides the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is becoming more and more popular in the performance evaluation of the dhms is also applied in this study it composes three items including correlation r bias ratio β and variability ratio γ kling et al 2012 16 kg e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 17 r t 1 n q obs t q obs q sim t q sim t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 t 1 n q sim t q sim 2 18 β q sim q obs γ σ sim q sim σ obs q obs where σsim and σobs are the standard deviation of the simulated and observed runoff respectively for the hydrological simulation we usually take an interest in reproducing temporal dynamics described by r and preserving the runoff distribution described by β and γ which makes it reasonable to use kge as a model performance indicator basheer 2018 kling et al 2012 in addition nse can be interpreted as the ability of a model to reproduce with regards to the mean of the observations i e the model performs better than using the observed mean as a predictor if the nse is greater than 0 gupta et al 2009 this is an equivalent of kge to be greater than 0 41 knoben et al 2019 to evaluate the simulation performance of the btop model with and without gdiscs system we also considered the relative bias rbias that can indicate an overestimation or underestimation of the observation by the model simulation 19 rbias i 1 n q sim t q obs t i 1 n q obs t 100 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the qualitative gsa method 3 1 1 sa results of the morris samples both normalized si moat 1 and si moat 2 values of each parameter are shown in fig 3 we initially collected the morris samples with a quantity size of 9 360 and fed them into the btop model successively to obtain the indicator values of nse rmse and kge due to the excellent performance in some sa studies of the morris sampling and the moat method combination gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 the corresponding sa result is regarded as an impermanent benchmark in this paper it can be seen that more and more sensitive variables are screened out as the number of the variables with larger si moat 1 and si moat 2 values gradually increase from upstream to downstream sub basins as shown by panels from fig 3 h to a moreover the parameter variables obviously detach from the lower left corner except a1 a2 and a3 are all belong to the blocks above the river gauge in order to avoid the unreliability of determining parameter sensitivity with a few parameter variables there should be at least two or more blocks in each sub basin accordingly zpp nb 8 jsb nb 5 sap nb 2 sb nb 2 and zjg nb 2 are eligible the screened sps are presented in table 4 mainly according to the rn values listed in table s1 with rs values the results show that both sdbar and m are sps in all sub basins using nse rmse and kge to assess the model performance while the parameter α is clearly identified as an insensitive parameter for simulated river discharge in all eight study blocks from downstream to the upstream gauges including sap zgn hs and sp where the influenced parameter variables decrease the most sensitive parameter is increasingly inclined to be sdbar based on nse and rmse values whereas the result of kge still in favor of m by referencing the physical interpretation of the model parameters both d 0 and m are related to the soil transmissivity t 0 and reflect the impact of the soil types on the model outputs gusyev et al 2017 for the saturated subsurface d 0 defined as hydraulic conductivity is the ratio of t 0 to the thickness of the saturated aquifer and m is the decay factor of t 0 ao et al 2006 it implies that the change of m will cause such evident impact on the model outputs than t 0 and d 0 the parameter sdbar mainly reflects the impact of the basin topography gusyev et al 2016 generally the saturation excess runoff will not occur until the saturation deficit drops to zero gusyev et al 2017 takeuchi et al 2008 therefore sdbar directly impacts the runoff in the umrb and can be reasonably considered as a sensitive parameter as the only parameter to be optimized in the confluence sub model n 0 reflects the frictional resistance of the water passage to the runoff shrestha et al 2007 it is affected by many factors such as river bed materials river channel structure river bank irregularity and vegetation coverage hence the model should also be sensitive to the change of n 0 ao et al 2006 however α is the parameter that affects the drying function to estimate actual only when the root zone s water storage is less than the maximum zhou et al 2006 it is related to the actual evapotranspiration thereby affecting the runoff process in this study α should not be a sensitive parameter as others in the high elevation headwater catchments therefore we provisionally consider m sdbar d 0 and n 0 are sps of the btop model to avoid missing on the other hand the screened sps in sap sb and zjg with the same nb were consistent well table 4 in order to reduce the experiment cost only sb was chosen for the following experiments together with zpp and jsb 3 1 2 effectiveness of the qualitative gsa method for the effectiveness evaluation of the moat method we respectively collected 9 360 samples by lh slh mc and qmc algorithms to obtain the normalized si moat 1 and si moat 2 values as shown in fig 4 the rn and rs values of each parameter are respectively listed in table s2 and table s3 and the screened sps are listed in table 5 unlike the morris sampling there are some rn values greater than 1 in jsb and sb sub basins in the study area taking parameter m as an example in fig 4 the normalized sensitivity index values of c1 c8 are all higher than the rule of thumb threshold 0 050 0 06 i e ns is 8 that greater than the nb of jsb and sb shown in eq 12 accordingly the parameters can be regarded as sensitive ones if their rn value is greater than 0 8 in jsb and greater than 2 in sb as we can see in fig 4 all four doe algorithms agree that m is a sensitive parameter and α is an insensitive parameter of the btop model from the slh samples the sensitivity of a1 is greatly overestimated although the matching parameter d 0 is still insensitive due to the small rn value similar to the other three algorithms both sdbar and n 0 are identified as insensitive parameters in the sa results corresponding to lh mc and qmc n 0 is sensitive and there are some divergences in the sensitivity distinguishing of sdbar for example all sa results of the lh samples in three sub basins consider sdbar sensitive as do the qmc samples except using nse as a model performance indicator in the zpp sub basin however the result of the mc samples always regards sdbar as an insensitive parameter from the rs values m is the most sensitive parameter which is indicated by the rs values of the included ci greater than 0 77 and sdbar and n 0 are almost equally sensitive in general the sa results of the samples from the lh algorithm are more stable in identifying sensitive and insensitive parameters which are the same as the morris sampling except for d 0 campolongo et al 2007 pointed out that when the samples come from the morris sampling the moat method may judge unimportant factors as important ones not vice versa therefore it may be possible that the sa results of morris samples could incorrectly regard d 0 as a sensitive parameter it is also possible that lh is unable to be used for the moat method to identify all sps effectively these two questions are further discussed in combination with the quantitative sa section 3 2 3 1 3 efficiency of the qualitative gsa method this section evaluates the efficiency of the qualitative moat method using varying size samples r 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 50 70 and 100 collected by the morris sampling and lh algorithm which performed well in sps screening only si moat 1 is applied as the sensitivity index later due to the similar sa results obtained by referencing both si moat 1 and si moat 2 values discussed in previous sections different from the morris sampling rn becomes the number ratio of the sensitive variables to all in each parameter for the lh algorithm to avoid its value greater than one as in the effectiveness evaluation thus the judgment basis that the parameter with the rn value greater than 0 5 is sensitive applies to both the morris and lh algorithms as shown in fig 5 it is evident that the sensitive parameter m square marker and insensitive parameter α cross marker are always clearly distinguished with all combinations of indicators doe algorithms and sample sizes concerning the other parameters of d 0 sdbar and n 0 the effective screening of sps requires at least 1 080 r 30 samples from the morris sampling and 144 r 4 samples from the lh algorithm in zpp and jsb fig 5 a and b however it needs at least 3 600 r 100 morris samples and 720 r 20 lh samples in sb fig 5 c owing to the slow recognition of n 0 as a sensitive parameter with applying kge 3 2 evaluation of the quantitative gsa methods 3 2 1 effectiveness of the quantitative gsa methods in this section 9 360 samples collected by the lh slh mc and qmc algorithms that have been used for the moat method are also employed for the dgsm and rsmsobol method to perform quantitative sa unlike the moat method there is no empirical threshold to obtain the rn values and only rs values related to sti dgsm and sti rsm eqs 8 and 11 are applied for the sps screening combined with the sa results obtained by the moat method we regard the parameters with rs value greater than 0 02 0 03 as sensitive ones 3 2 1 1 sa results of dgsm fig 6 shows the sensitivity of each parameter by the rs value related to sti dgsm all rs values are listed in table s4 and the screened sps are listed in table 5 according to fig 6 we can find that all parameters are classified as sensitive using the lh algorithm samples the parameter α even has a higher rs value than others especially in the jsb and sb sub basins fig 6 b and c a similar result is obtained with the samples from the qmc algorithm it indicates that all parameters except d 0 are sensitive and n0 and α have strong sensitivity looking at the slh samples the sti dgsm value of a1 is much higher than that of others making the rs value of d 0 close to 1 these sps screening results are almost opposite to that from the moat method as for the mc algorithm the sa result in the zpp sub basin fig 6 a shows that m the largest green bubbles is the most sensitive parameter of the btop model and the corresponding rs values with three model performance indicators are all greater than 0 5 d 0 and α are insensitive parameters as the rs values are less than 0 02 however the rs value of the parameter α increases in jsb and we can no longer consider it as an insensitive parameter similarly all parameters of sb are considered sensitive compared to other sampling algorithms the mc samples may have ideal sa results consistent with the moat method using lh samples but only in zpp it is not enough to convince us that the mc algorithm is the appropriate sampling algorithm for the dgsm method to screen sps of the btop model 3 2 1 2 sa results of rsmsobol fig 7 shows the rs values related to sti rsm of each parameter listed in table s5 and the screened sps are also listed in table 5 compared to the dgsm method the samples taken by the four chosen doe algorithms perform much better in quantitative sa with the rsmsobol method as shown in fig 7 regardless of the model performance indicator the parameter m is always judged as the most sensitive parameter in three sub basins with the highest rs values which are all greater than 0 5 and about 70 are greater than 0 8 the sa results obtained by the rsmsobol method can also identify α as an insensitive parameter effectively however there are some discrepancies in the sensitivity judgment of the parameters d 0 sdbar and n 0 as listed in table 5 when nse is used to indicate the model performance for the slh mc and qmc samples d 0 is considered as a sensitive parameter in jsb and sb and sdbar is identified as an insensitive parameter in zpp using the lh samples and the nse indicator these results are opposite to that when rmse and kge are applied however the lh and qmc samples using rmse as a model performance indicator cannot regard n 0 as a sensitive parameter similarly to nse and kge in contrast the performance of kge is extremely stable except for d 0 the other two parameters are both considered sensitive this is relatively close to the qualitative sa results with utilizing the moat method in general the rsmsobol method is commendable due to its excellent sa performance with kge as a model output indicator thus we evaluate the efficiency of rsmsobol method with the various sample sizes and the model performance is only indicated by kge it should be noted that the efficiency of the dgsm method is not evaluated due to the inconsistent sa results with the other two gsa methods although it is faster than the moat methods in our cases 3 2 2 efficiency of the quantitative gsa method since the sa results with three indicators are similar we present the rs values of model parameters with various sample sizes with kge as the model performance indicator in fig 8 while the results with indicator nse and rmse are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 except for the 108 r 3 slh samples and the 72 r 2 mc samples with null rs value caused by the unsuccessful surrogate modeling the sensitivity of the parameter m and α can always be correctly distinguished with the smallest size design i e 72 r 2 in all sub basins d 0 can also be effectively identified as an insensitive parameter with a small size when the samples are collected by lh mc and qmc algorithms however the slh samples cannot considered d 0 insensitive until the sample size reaches 1 080 r 30 in zpp and sb and even 1 800 r 50 in jsb as for the remaining parameters sdbar is a sensitive parameter apart from the sa results of the mc samples in zpp and jsb and n 0 is also considered sensitive apart from mc samples in zpp as well as slh samples in sb after the comprehensive comparison qmc is the most efficient and stable doe algorithm that applicable to the rsmsobol method and the required minimum sample sizes in zpp jsb and sb are 360 r 10 108 r 3 and 1080 r 30 respectively 3 3 evaluation of the gdiscs system to evaluate the applicability of the gdiscs system we compare the optimization experiments of sps versus aps in four sub basins including zpp jsb sb and hs that has not been reported in the previous sps screening to avoid missing sps many studies believed that the parameter is sensitive as long as it is not considered insensitive by all gsa methods bennett et al 2018 gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 li et al 2021 accordingly we set another optimization combination composed of sps and d 0 denoted as sps d 0 to further discuss whether d 0 should be regarded as a sensitive parameter to be adjusted during the btop model calibration the optimal objective function values and the required model runs number of optimizing sps sps d 0 and aps with varying objective functions are shown in fig 9 and the quantitative values and optimization durations are listed in table 6 in the zpp sub basin fig 9 a aps and sps d 0 were not optimized due to the insufficient nloop and accordingly the optimization duration accuracy as well as runoff simulation performance are not included in the following comparisons in the jsb fig 9 b sb fig 9 c and hs fig 9 d sub basins the sps optimization reaches the convergence with lesser model runs and shorter optimization duration than sps d 0 and aps it means that the optimal values can be identified quickly when only sps are optimized for example the minimum model runs of aps optimization is 8 965 the optimization duration is about 33 h when the kge value is nearly constant and cannot be further improved after 20 shuffling loops in hs see fig 9 d with kge on the vertical axis and table 6 it is more than 10 000 runs the optimization duration is more than 37 h in jsb and sb whether the objective function is nse or kge fig 9 b c and table 6 however the runs number and the required duration by the sps optimization are almost halved or even less for the combination sps d 0 the required model runs to reach convergence is sometimes higher or sometimes lower than aps but consistently significantly higher than sps in the early optimization stage both nse and kge values of the converged sps are higher than those of sps d 0 and aps and then sps gradually reach the optimal values satisfying the convergence condition but sps d 0 and aps continue to be optimized if the set values of nloop and nmaxr are sufficiently large the objective function values of aps eventually exceed sps and sps d 0 like in jsb and sb fig 9 b and c otherwise it means that larger nloop or nmaxr are required like in hs fig 9 d when the accuracy is considered there are some differences in the nse and kge values among the three parameter combinations the maximum nse and kge differences between aps and sps are 0 047 and 0 037 in jsb fig 9 a and the minimum differences are 0 003 and 0 001 in hs fig 9 d it indicates that sps can capture most optimization information of aps although the parameter variables number is reduced by nearly 1 3 sps include three parameters and corresponding 24 variables and aps include seven parameters and 35 variables the nse and kge differences between sps and sps d 0 are in smaller ranges that are 0 002 0 033 and 0 001 0 036 overall the optimization accuracy of sps is close to aps and sps d 0 and is sufficient to meet the practical application of hydrological simulations minimum nse is greater than 0 61 and minimum kge is greater than 0 72 however the optimization speed of sps is considerably faster than the other two combinations which makes it require lesser computational time and costs 3 4 evaluation of the parameters from sps optimization after optimizing the three combinations by the sce ua method with two objective functions nse and kge nse and kge are also applied as model performance indicators to evaluate the runoff simulation during calibration table 7 and validation table 8 moreover the obtained optimal values of the parameter variables are respectively shown in table s6 and table s7 where the unoptimized variables are assigned to the default values from gusyev et al 2017 the simulation with applying default values to all parameters is also performed to evaluate the parameter optimization in improving model performance when using nse as an objective function for parameter optimization the runoff simulation performance of optimal sps is close to that of optimal aps with maximum δnse and δkge of 0 047 and 0 029 in the jsb sub basin minimum δnse and δkge of 0 003 and 0 001 in the hs sub basin maximum δrbias is 2 70 in the sb sub basin and minimum δrbias is 0 50 in the jsb sub basin as well as to that of optimal sps d 0 maximum δnse is 0 033 in jsb and maximum δkge is 0 018 in sb maximum δrbias is 1 30 in jsb and sb minimum δnse δkge and δrbias are all in hs with the values of 0 002 0 001 and 0 036 although when kge was applied for parameter optimization the difference in the simulation performance of the optimal sps and aps is minor in jsb δnse is 0 137 δkge is 0 037 and δrbias is 0 30 the worst performance is also acceptable with nse of 0 591 kge of 0 797 and rbias of 9 70 compared to the simulations with default parameter values the model performance is greatly improved by optimizing only sps the evident improvements are in jsb δnse is 0 356 δkge is 0 139 and δrbias is 2 40 when nse is the objective function δnse is 0 260 δkge is 0 143 and δrbias is 5 00 when kge is the objective function during the validation period table 8 the runoff simulation performance of optimal sps and aps are also in a relatively small range δnse 0 003 0 022 δkge 0 005 0 034 and δrbias 0 7 4 9 when nse is the objective function δnse 0 001 0 145 δkge 0 001 0 038 and δrbias 0 1 11 5 when kge is the objective function however the simulation differences between sps and default parameters are more evident in the jsb sub basin the δnse δkge and δrbias increase to 0 764 0 321 and 15 40 when using nse as an objective function and increase to 0 604 0 246 and 20 8 when kge is used for the optimization due to the closed performance in flow simulations with the optimal parameters from different objective functions fig 10 only shows the simulated runoff processes using nse as the objective function while the hydrograph corresponding to kge is shown in fig s5 since the initial conditions of the btop model are default but not optimal the simulated runoff in 1982 and 1986 are not included in the following description fig 10 shows that the simulations from the final sps roughly coincide with those from aps and sps d 0 during calibration and validation periods especially in hs fig 10 c where the runoff curves from three parameter combinations almost overlap however the simulated flow always overestimates the peak flows due to the closely related fact that hs is located in the tibetan plateau with snow cover and frozen soil gradually to the downstream the peak simulation is closer and closer to the observations as it is less affected by the plateau characteristics in jsb fig 10 a and sb fig 10 b there are some differences between the simulations from optimal parameter combinations as well as default parameters the simulated peak flows with optimal aps and sps d 0 are always higher than sps and their low flows are the lowest and closest to the observations however the simulations with the default parameters are on the contrary these characteristics are more evident in the validation period than the calibration period overall sps can capture most of the hydrological information of aps and sps d 0 and are highly representative of them accordingly d 0 should not be regarded as a sensitive parameter of the btop model in this paper furthermore optimizing with only sps improves the runoff simulations with the default parameters significantly especially in reducing the overestimation of the low flows 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness which doe algorithm could obtain reasonable samples to achieve reliable sa by the gsa method combined with the effectiveness analysis of three gsa methods section 3 1 2 and 3 2 1 we found that whether the gsa method can effectively screen sensitive model parameters is closely related to the doe algorithms but not only to itself for the moat method the samples from the morris sampling tended to perform well in the qualitative sa according to similar reports gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 as well as in this study moreover the screened sps with the samples from the lh algorithm were the same as that of the morris sampling except for d 0 combined with the quantitative sa results from the well performed rsmsobol method using kge as the model performance indicator d 0 was regarded as an insensitive parameter of the btop model this implies that the moat method made a mistake in identifying the parameter d 0 as a sensitive one with the morris sampling in this study and similar results were reported by campolongo et al 2007 in addition the sa results of the morris samples corresponded well to the btop model s characteristic that only the parameters in the blocks above the river gauge have an impact in its flow simulation takeuchi et al 2008 but not lh samples it is probably owing to the principle of the various sampling algorithms in detail the morris sampling uses a design that changes one factor at a time individually and randomly which is suitable for the moat method in obtaining multiple elementary effects for every input morris 1991 but lh algorithm changes all factors at once mckay et al 1979 although it has no impact on the sps screening in this paper we still capture the information that there is a visible difference in the parameter sa with applying varying doe algorithms for the same gsa method as for the dgsm method it demonstrated time saving computations that was even faster than moat and the mc samples indeed had better sa results than other sampling algorithms in this paper this is consistent with kucherenko et al 2009 which have proved that the sa performance with using the samples from the mc algorithm was significantly decent nevertheless it is difficult to conclude that the mc algorithm is a suitable doe algorithm for the dgsm method due to the sensitivity misjudgment of the parameter α in summary for a complex model with many parameters multi gsa methods and multi doe algorithms are essential for more robust sa results specifically the qualitative gsa methods with multi doe algorithms can be used for rough parameter screening at the beginning and allow to differentiate the least and the most sensitive parameters at a lower evaluation cost then the quantitative ones and multi doe algorithms can be applied for further sa campolongo and saltelli 1997 campolongo et al 2007 the surrogate modeling techniques that can construct varying applicable models based on the samples and corresponding model outputs song et al 2012 storlie et al 2009 zhan et al 2013 deserve attention in future studies 4 2 efficiency how many samples from the applicable doe algorithm are sufficient for the robust sa results to evaluate the sa efficiency of the gsa methods with great effectiveness we collected varying size samples by the practicable doe algorithms section 3 1 3 and 3 2 2 although the morris sampling is a specific doe algorithm of the moat method gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 and its sa result can excellently display the parameter characteristic of the btop model the lh algorithm demonstrated higher efficiency and stability in sps screening in our cases it indicates that the morris sampling design changing one factor at a time often provides less information for sa when its sample size is the same as lh samples similarly for the river gauge with a small number of upstream blocks the qualitative moat method often requires a large sample to screen the sps effectively due to the less available information in each sample combination thus we suggest that the river gauges with multiple upstream blocks are chosen for similar studies and then the sample size can be designed as needed it can save both time and labor while avoiding the unreliability of determining parameter sensitivity due to limited information for the quantitative rsmsobol method shahsavani and grimvall 2011 qmc is the most efficient algorithm although the samples from all four doe algorithms performed well in the sps screening especially in the zpp sub basin this is inseparable from its ability to converge faster than mc and other random sequence sampling algorithms due to the deterministic low deviation sequence krykova 2004 lécot and tuffin 2004 zhan et al 2013 on the other hand it proves that the performance comparison of multiple doe algorithms is necessary for effective and efficient sa more importantly by comparing the required lh sample size of the two gsa methods we also observed that the quantitative methods usually require more model runs than the qualitative ones gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 li et al 2021 4 3 credibility are the sps screening results of the samples with various model performance indicators consistent as shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 the sa results corresponding to three indicators of rmse nse and kge were always different even though the gsa method and the doe algorithm were unchanged regarding the formula composition and implications of three indicators the total square error is firstly obtained in the calculation of rmse which indicates that each error affects the total in proportion to its square the total square error as a result is mainly affected by the larger errors and concentrates on the largest one chai and draxler 2014 after dividing by n and taking the square root the total squared error is scaled willmott and matsuura 2005 the numerator of the nse is the same as that of the square of rmse nash and sutcliffe 1970 it makes nse is sensitive to high values such as peak flows in the hydrograph similar to rmse li et al 2021 however the distinct denominators scale the total squared error in varying degrees murphy 1988 as for the gaining popularity kge is composed of three items correlation bias ratio and variability ratio making it distinguishable from the above two gupta et al 2009 it is equipped to measure the temporal dynamics and the distribution of flows kling et al 2012 in short the sa results on the basis of varying model performance indicators are hardly consistent and it is essential to apply multi indicators for the reliable screening of sps as for the sa performance in the effectiveness evaluation kge was stabilized and commendable for the well behaved combinations of the doe algorithm and the gsa method such as the morris algorithm and the moat method the mc algorithm and the dgsm method as well as all doe algorithms and the rsmsobol method it is closely related to the superior character of kge which covers many model performance evaluation indexes and is able to capture the model performance characteristics more comprehensively thus kge can be widely used as the model performance indicator in the sa of the model parameters choubin et al 2018 kling et al 2012 mathevet et al 2020 rojas et al 2020 tsai et al 2021 however after the efficiency evaluation the river gauge with fewer upstream sub basins often required more samples when kge is used therefore if kge is applied as the model performance indicator it is recommended to have more sub basins above the studied river gauges to avoid large samples requirements 4 4 significance can parameter sa with gdiscs system reduce the model runs to shorten the parameter optimization duration from the evaluation of the required model runs number and optimization duration as well as the simulation performance based on the gdiscs system in section 3 3 the optimal parameter values could be identified quickly with lower computational costs only 1 2 or even less runs number and optimization duration when sps were optimized and sps could capture most optimization information of aps moreover the optimization accuracy of sps was close to aps and it was also sufficient for practical application in hydrological simulations this is consistent with the conclusion obtained by li et al 2021 thus the sps obtained by gdiscs system contribute to shortening the parameter optimization process well with satisfactory model performance although the sps optimization is on the basis of sa that needs to take time in collecting parameter samples the obtained sa results can also provide reference information for other related studies such as dhm parameter regionalization and model uncertainty analysis in this or other basins with similar characteristics in addition the choice of the doe algorithm the gsa method and the model performance indicators all affect the required sample size and thus the efficiency of sa as we have discovered this is helpful to improve the parameter sa efficiency of all dynamic models such as environmental models and dhms besides the impact of the gdiscs system on improving model calibration efficiency and reducing model computational burden it also has some potentials in reducing the uncertainty of model parameter optimization called equifinality for different parameters it has been proven that this uncertainty comes from the interaction between many parameters calibrated together clark et al 2011 renard et al 2010 screening the sps that are utilized with a significant effect on the model output variability is also a process of reducing the parameter dimensionality to be optimized and thus reducing the interactions between the parameters gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 moreover the insensitive parameters that have little effect on model outputs are likely to cause excessive noise fitting and over parameterization problems sheikholeslami et al 2021 it is necessary to further analyze the effectiveness of the gdiscs system in reducing the parameter uncertainty and the over parameterization risk quantitatively and comprehensively 5 conclusions we proposed the gdiscs system to obtain the robust sps and evaluate the effect of sps optimization on flow simulation in this system three gsa methods moat dgsm and rsmsobol four doe algorithms lh slh mc and qmc which are used to obtain samples with varying sizes and three indicators rmse nse and kge were integrated for a comprehensive evaluation of parameter importance and model calibration the gdiscs system was verified with the btop model at the eight blocks of the umrb china to apply gdiscs system in future studies it is important to understand our findings of four raised issues as summarized below the effectiveness of the gsa method in screening sps is closely related to itself as well as the doe algorithms in terms of the qualitative sa by the moat method which has the morris sampling as its special doe algorithm the screened sps m sdbar and n0 with the samples from lh algorithm were consistent well with the quantitative results from the rsmsobol method which had a great sa performance using all doe algorithms however the dgsm method mistakenly considered d 0 and α sensitive even though the most appropriate mc algorithm was used thus the gdiscs system with multi gsa methods and multi doe algorithms is essential for obtaining robust sa results especially for a complex model with many parameters as for the efficiency evaluation the quantitative gsa methods usually require more model runs than the qualitative methods for reliable sa results in our study using the samples from lh algorithm the robust screened sps required 144 r 4 samples in the zpp and jsb sub basins and 720 r 20 in the sb sub basin by the qualitative moat method however for the quantitative rsmsobol method the identical results needed 1 800 r 50 samples in jsb and at least 3 600 r 100 samples in zpp and sb moreover the stable sa results by the moat method always required more samples due to the insufficient sensitivity information in the sub basins with few blocks and the morris samples that change only one factor at a time in question 3 it is easy to notice that the sa results corresponding to three indicators were always different when the gsa method and the doe algorithm were unchanged during the effectiveness evaluation the sa performances using kge as a model output indicator were stabilized and commendable for the well behaved doe algorithm and gsa method combinations such as the morris algorithm and moat method the mc algorithm and dgsm method as well as the qmc algorithm and rsmsobol method therefore kge is recommended for the parameter sa considering practical applications using numerical models in other basins the sps obtained from the gdiscs system can considerably shorten the parameter optimization process with satisfactory runoff simulation performance as demonstrated in this study the optimal parameter values can be identified quickly with almost halved or even lesser number of the model runs when only sps are optimized and sps can capture most optimization information of aps although the parameter variables number is reduced by nearly one third the optimization accuracy of sps is close to aps with slight differences i e the maximum nse kge and rbias differences are 0 137 0 037 and 2 70 and it is sufficient to meet the practical application of hydrological simulations in summary the gdiscs system that includes multiple gsa methods doe algorithms model performance indicators and sample size designs is applicable and practical for obtaining robust sa results moreover optimizing only sps can significantly improve model calibration efficiency and reduce model computational burden while ensuring satisfactory simulation performance furthermore as long as the btop model is concerned it is promising that assign the sps to each grid and keep insensitive parameters in blocks for a more reasonable efficient and accurate simulation which would be our following study shortly credit authorship contribution statement lingxue liu

3279,parameter optimization is mandatory in many numerical modeling studies of hydrology sciences however optimizing all parameters aps is highly inefficient including the equifinality phenomenon this paper proposes an integrated sensitivity analysis system consisting of multiple global sensitivity analysis methods design of experiment algorithms indicators and sample size design combinations gdiscs for screening the sensitive parameters sps robustly and reducing parameter optimization burden efficaciously in this study four design of experiment doe algorithms are applied to collect samples with varying sizes and the corresponding three indicator values we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of one qualitative and two quantitative global sensitivity analysis gsa methods by identifying the appropriate doe algorithm and the sufficient sample size to apply the gdiscs the block wise use of the topmodel btop model is set up for the hydrological simulation in the upper min river basin china the results show that the gdiscs system robustly screens out three sps of the btop model and the doe algorithms significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the gsa methods the sa performance with applying the modified kling gupta efficiency kge as the indicator is more robust than the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse compared to the traditional aps optimization the optimal values are identified quickly through almost 1 2 or even fewer model runs and duration for the sps optimization with a very close accuracy the maximum nse kge and relative bias rbias differences are 0 137 0 037 and 2 70 and the minimum are 0 002 0 001 and 0 20 optimizing sps also has a noticeable improvement for the default parameter values and the maximum differences of nse kge and rbias reach 0 764 0 321 and 20 80 in summary the gdiscs system is especially applicable for obtaining the robust sa results to considerably improve model calibration

step in all aspects of hydrological and environmental sciences prior to water cycle scenario assessment azari et al 2015 meyer oliveira et al 2021 soil erosion simulation guo et al 2002 santos et al 2012 shirazi et al 2020 drought and flood monitoring chen et al 2016 reddy and singh 2014 as well as water pollution assessment and prevention cho and ha 2010 liang et al 2015 xia et al 2019 which is always accomplished through parameter optimization hydrological models primarily distributed ones have many parameters for a better description of the hydrological processes the values of model parameters vary significantly due to the spatial heterogeneities in soil land cover climate etc shi et al 2013 thus parameter optimization is essential for distributed hydrological models dhms to improve their regional practicality and applicability li et al 2021 unfortunately it remains a challenging task due to the computational burden and the equifinality issue from calibrating many parameters simultaneously clark et al 2011 renard et al 2010 a possible way to overcome these obstacles is to reduce parameter dimension through sensitivity analysis sa gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 which is a practical parameter screening approach by identifying the model parameters that have a significant effect on the output variability aparicio et al 2022 pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2004 benefiting from providing the total effect acquisition of input factors while maintaining computational efficiency the global sa gsa based on the design of experiment doe is more appropriate for qualitative and quantitative assessment of multi parameter dhms gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 liu et al 2020 xing et al 2021 it usually involves two steps 1 implementing the doe algorithms to generate a series of parameter samples in the feasible space and 2 inputting the samples into the model to obtain the model outputs that the performance indicators could evaluate significantly some doe based gsa methods require special sampling algorithms such as morris one at a time moat morris 1991 as tong and graziani 2008 suggested an appropriate combination of gsa method and doe algorithm is crucial for effective sa since it can save the computational cost visibly without sacrificing the model performance thus the first two issues we would like to address in this paper are which doe algorithm is appropriate for the gsa method and how many samples are required at least although much previous research focused on the parameter sa and optimization they were generally studied separately and rarely analyzed comprehensively for example some studies performed the effectiveness and the efficiency analysis of various gsa methods but none of them conducted the experiments to optimize the sensitive parameters sps gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 mulungu and munishi 2007 pang et al 2020 other studies performed both sa and optimization of parameters but they did not clarify the effect of sa in the optimization process or the diversity between optimizing only sps and all parameters aps gan et al 2018 goeury et al 2022 gou et al 2020 even if a few studies covered the above aspects it is a pity that they often considered only one doe algorithm or sample size setting li et al 2021 song et al 2012 remarkably most studies only chose one model performance indicator closely related to the doe process and directly affects the sa results lacking credibility from extensive evaluation with multi objective functions therefore the other points we aim to address are whether multiple indicators contribute to obtaining reliable sa results and how does parameter sa affect parameter optimization of the dhms to achieve the mentioned objectives a sa system named multiple global sensitivity analysis methods design of experiment algorithms indicators and sample size design combinations gdiscs is proposed in this paper specifically four doe algorithms are applied for collecting samples with varying sizes and three indicators are employed to evaluate the corresponding model performances using the collected parameter samples and the model outputs sa is performed using one qualitative gsa method and two quantitative methods to screen sps the gdiscs system is first applied to the block wise use of the topmodel btop model and verified in the upper min river basin umrb all related operations are achieved on the uncertainty quantification python laboratory uq pyl platform which has strengths in performing various uq tasks including experimental design statistical analysis sensitivity analysis surrogate modeling and parameter optimization duan et al 2017 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2016 then the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 which is the default optimization method of the btop model ao et al 2006 takeuchi et al 2008 is applied to calibrate aps and only sps respectively ultimately the following four questions need to be addressed to

finally we present the conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area as the tributary of the yangtze river with abundant water resources the min river basin is the primary water source of the chengdu plain chen et al 2019 during the 13th five year plan of china the gdp of the chengdu plain economic zone increased from 1 91 trillion chinese yuan cny at the end of the 12th five year plan to 2 95 trillion cny accounting for more than 60 of sichuan province sichuan provincial bureau of statistics 2021 by 2025 technological innovation and the digital economy are planned to develop together and the total economic volume will exceed 4 trillion cny the people s government of sichuan province 2022 the water supply pressure of the min river basin will increase sharply with the rapid economic development accordingly strengthening water resource management to avoid unbalanced water supply ensuring water environment safety and promoting sustainable and coordinated development of the ecological environment are vital issues that need to be focused on hou et al 2018 xu et al 2019 on the other hand this river provides domestic water for about 23 million people and irrigation water for about 7260 km2 irrigation areas through the dujiangyan project huang et al 2021 thus understanding the hydrological process in the upper min river basin umrb above dujiangyan fig 1 latitudes 30 45 n 33 10 n and longitudes 102 35 e 103 57 e wgs 1984 utm zone 48n has significant benefits to the development of chengdu plain moreover the umrb transitions from the qinghai tibet plateau to the chengdu plain with obvious diversity advantages in the underlying surface and climate and is not affected by anthropogenic activities as much as the middle and lower reaches where the economic zone locates the umrb is about 22 569 km2 and the river length is about 340 km the northern and northwestern parts of the basin are the cold plateau with annual mean precipitation of about 650 810 mm under the influence of the foehn effect caused by subsidence warming the central regions have the least precipitation the annual mean rainfall is only 460 590 mm the southeastern area is warm and humid its annual mean temperature is about 15 and its annual mean precipitation is 1000 1600 mm zhang et al 2012 the average annual runoff in the umrb is about 14 5 billion m3 at the zipingpu site as shown in fig 1 the umrb was divided into eight blocks for numerical simulations in this paper based on the location of the eight river gauges including zipingpu zpp jiangsheba jsb sangping sap shaba sb zhenjiangguan zjg zagunao zgn heishui hs and songpan sp 2 1 2 hydro meteorological data and other inputs accurately simulating the runoff is a formidable challenge in the umrb due to the numerous hydraulic projects which greatly contribute to socio economic development fang and popole 2020 wu et al 2020 to minimize the simulation uncertainties from the dam reservoir module and the related module inputs we collected the daily runoff observations from jan 1st 1982 to dec 31st 1987 at eight river gauges from the hydrological data yearbooks and the daily precipitation of 21 rain gauges fig 1 table 1 shows the data which used for the evaporation module of btop model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 zhou et al 2006 to obtain the potential interception evaporation pet0 potential evapotranspiration pet and leaf area index lai for the hydrological simulation they were divided into a calibration period from jan 1st 1982 to dec 31st 1985 and a validation period from jan 1st 1986 to dec 31st 1987 as for other inputs we obtained the 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission and resampled it to 1 km for the hydrological simulation the land cover map fig s2 was from the version 2 international geosphere biosphere programme igbp global land cover dataset igbp discover with an original resolution of 1 km loveland et al 2000 food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao provided the soil distribution in the study area and the soil types are reclassified into loam sandy clay loam clay loam and clay on the basis of the united states department of agriculture usda classification with a resolution of 1 km moreover these characteristics of each sub basin are summarized in table 2 2 2 btop model and parameters based on the well known topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 the btop model was firstly exploited by the university of yamanashi in 1999 for the simple and robust hydrology simulations ao et al 1999 takeuchi et al 1999 it simulates the rainfall runoff processes at each grid by reformulating the topographical index with the block wise concept moreover the btop model is developed and integrated several modules such as the core runoff generation topmodel parameterization sce ua flow routing muskingum cunge and evapotranspiration s w modules optional snow process soil freezing and dam reservoir modules takeuchi et al 2008 gusyev et al 2017 to date the btop model has been widely applied for the flood and drought evaluation water infrastructure land use planning pollutant transport and climate variability scenarios in nearly 2300 basins worldwide ao et al 2003 gusyev et al 2016 shrestha et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 as a semi physically based distributed hydrological model the btop model has seven types of parameters with specific physical interpretations as shown in table 3 ao et al 2006 takeuchi et al 2008 zhu et al 2021 in detail the parameters sdbar m n 0 and α are calibrated in each divided block and we denote these block scale parameters as bi ci di and ei respectively the parameter d 0 is estimated from the groundwater dischargebility of clay d 0 clay denoted as a1 sand d 0 sand denoted as a2 and silt d 0 silt denoted as a3 values gusyev et al 2017 takeuchi et al 2008 accordingly the number of the parameters to be optimized is 3 4nk nk is the number of the divided blocks this paper calls them parametric variables and the number is 35 nk 8 2 3 experimental setup and gdiscs system development we carry out four major steps in this study concerning how the gdiscs system executes an sa task as shown in fig 2 in step 1 we specify the model parameter file including parameter name range and distribution and apply varying doe algorithms of latin hypercube lh symmetric latin hypercube slh monte carlo mc and quasi monte carlo qmc to prepare parameter samples of the btop model in step 2 for breeding the parameter sensitivities the sample sets generated in the previous step are fed into the btop model to obtain the corresponding values of three model performance indicators in step 3 we carry out sa exercises with a qualitative method of morris one at a time moat quantitative derivative based global sensitivity measurement dgsm and response surface method based sobol rsmsobol to evaluate their effectiveness and efficiency in sps screening these steps complete the development of the gdiscs system as shown in the dashed orange frame in fig 2 in step 4 only sps are optimized by sce ua using the result of the gdiscs we compare the corresponding flow simulation with the case of optimizing aps to evaluate the impact of reducing parameter dimension on the parameter optimization process 2 3 1 doe algorithms doe is an experiment that observes the model outputs by flexibly changing the input factors as needed to identify the factors with significant influence effectively the most concerning issues in adopting doe are whether the sample points can fill the design space kuhnt and steinberg 2010 and how many sample points are sufficient loeppky et al 2009 uniform sampling algorithms are usually recommended for parameter sa as they can consistently generate spatially representative sample sets with a small size of sample points duan et al 2016 gan et al 2014 liu et al 2020 liu and sun 2010 in this paper we select four uniform doe algorithms that are available in the uq pyl platform including monte carlo mc quasi monte carlo qmc latin hypercube lh and symmetric latin hypercube slh mc metropolis and ulam 1949 is a frequently used doe algorithm it has advantages for high dimensional problems since it is only affected by the standard deviation and sample size however its error always converges slowly the method that replaces the random sequence in the mc sampling with a deterministic low deviation sequence is called qmc niederreiter and harald 1992 also known as the deterministic mc besides improving accuracy it can speed up the convergence for the cases with high dimensions the lh method proposed by mckay et al 1979 is suitable for the stratified sampling design of any dimension in theory both lh and slh can generate a sample point in the small hypercube in each row and column nonetheless the collected test points by lh are random while those by slh are symmetrical for good space filling property morris and mitchell 1995 2 3 2 gsa methods 2 3 2 1 qualitative moat method moat morris 1991 is a qualitative method suitable for models with many uncertainty factors and high calculation costs and the morris sampling is the special sampling algorithm of the qualitative moat method which tends to perform well in the qualitative sa gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 it can obtain the sensitivity information by the basic statistics for elementary effect ee of each input variable campolongo et al 2007 for an orthogonal input space with n dimension and p level the ee of the input variables is defined as 1 d i f x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x n f x δ where i is the i th input variable and δ is the predetermined multiple of 1 p 1 which usually takes p 2 p 1 as p is an even number the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the sample gradients are used to estimate the overall and interaction impact of x 2 μ i x j 1 r d i j r 3 σ i x j 1 r d i j μ i x 2 r where r is the trajectories number of the points in the input space given the possible negative effects on the mean in eq 2 campolongo et al 2007 pointed out that the modified mean μ is acceptable and convenient to provide a reliable gsa of the input factors assuming that the input changes at selected levels p in the input space the test area becomes an n dimensional p level grid and the formula of μ is 4 μ i x j 1 r d i j r in this research we set p to 4 which is the default value in the uq pyl platform and the value used in morris 1991 and campolongo et al 2007 moreover the modified mean denoted as si moat 1 and the standard deviation denoted as si moat 2 are construed as the sensitivity indices of the parameter variables in the btop model 2 3 2 2 quantitative methods 1 derivative based global sensitivity measurement dgsm dgsm is a quantitative gsa method based on the calculation of the response function partial derivative of the input factors at multiple points kucherenko et al 2009 and kucherenko and song 2016 have proved that the time required for a numerical evaluation of the dgsm method with the samples from the mc algorithm is significantly less than the commonly used sobol method defined a continuously differentiable function f x in the unit hypercube in there are some theorems related to the total sensitivity index sti dgsm and the derivative f xi 5 s t i d g s m 1 π 2 d i n f x x i 2 d x 6 d i n f 2 x d x f 0 2 i 1 n d i i j n n d ij i n n d 1 n where d is the total variance di is the first order effect for each factor and dij to di n are the interactions among the factors considering a set of values ν 1 νn such that 7 ν i i n f x x i 2 d x 1 i n where νi is similar to the si moat 1 in moat and the smaller νi the less sensitive the variable xi is moreover the utilization of νi can get the sti dgsm value without knowing the upper limit of the partial derivative kucherenko et al 2009 i e 8 s t i d g s m ν i π 2 d 2 response surface method based sobol rsmsobol with the rapid development of computer technology the parameter sa of the dhms has gradually involved surrogate modeling techniques such as the response surface method rsm ratto et al 2007 shahsavani and grimvall 2011 showed that the rsm based gsa method makes the importance estimation of model parameters more efficient based on the popular sobol method saltelli 2002 sobol 2001 rsmsobol method a non parametric response surface technology was built by combining with the support vector machine storlie et al 2009 define a square integrable function f x in the unit hypercube in 9 f x f 0 i 1 n f i x i i 1 n j i n f ij x i x j f 1 2 n x 1 x 2 x n where the items are defined by ratto et al 2007 10 f 0 e f x f i x i e f x x i f 0 f ij x i x j e f x x i x j e f x x i e f x x j f 0 the variance based methods like rsmsobol always estimate the importance of input factors with using a variance ratio and the total sensitivity index sti rsm was defined by homma and saltelli 1996 and song et al 2012 11 s t i r s m e d f x x i d where the subscript i refers to all of the inputs except the i th tong and graziani 2008 pointed that although the variance decomposition is no longer valid when the inputs are correlated eq 11 is still available for the sa 2 3 3 sample size setup the sample size required for sa is closely related to the number of experimental factors n in this paper the study area was divided into eight blocks fig 1 and the number of parameter variables is 35 by referring to table 3 morris 1991 proposed a practical design for constructing r trajectories of n 1 points in the input space so that the sample size needed for the moat method is r n 1 considering a sufficient sample size is necessary for the sps screening and the effectiveness evaluation of gsa methods the empirical rule believes that at least 10 n samples should be required levy and steinberg 2010 gan et al 2014 obtained reliable sa results of the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model with 13 tunable parameters by setting the maximum sample sizes between 2 777 and 3 000 which are more than twenty times the required minimum sample size i e 130 thus we set the maximum size of variable samples as 9 360 r 260 which is more than twenty six times the minimum size i e 350 as for the efficiency evaluation the sample sizes of parameter variables are set as 72 108 180 360 720 1 080 1 800 2 520 and 3 600 r 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 50 70 and 100 which are used for all gsa methods to avoid time waste for repeated sampling 2 3 4 parameter optimization method sce ua method which combines the advantages of the downhill simplex method and the steepest descent algorithm is one of the well behaved optimization algorithms for the parameter optimization of the nonlinear and complex dhms duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 it utilizes the concepts of controlled random search competitive evolution and the crucial complex shuffling to solve constrained optimization problems furthermore the optimal parameters will be found when the convergence criterion i e the function value is not improved after a certain shuffling loop number nloop is met after repeating the evolution and shuffling steps francés et al 2007 kan et al 2018 in this paper we set nloop is 20 which has been proved able to capture the changes between the optimization process of sps and aps by li et al 2021 in addition the maximum number of iterations nmaxr is set to 20 000 and the optimization will also stop once the model runs exceed this value 2 4 evaluation approach 2 4 1 evaluation criterion of sensitive parameter screening as described in section 2 2 only the parameter values of the blocks above the gauge site called sub basin in this paper impact its flow simulation and the number of the relevant blocks is denoted by nb for example there are two blocks above sb and the nb value of the sb sub basin is two correspondingly two new evaluation factors the number ratio rn and the sensitivity index ratio rs are employed for comparing the sa results from the gdiscs system the rn is expressed as follows 12 r n n s n b where ns is the number of the screened sensitive parameter variables and nb is the number of the blocks above the river gauge the rs is defined based on the sensitivity index si 13 r s i 1 n p s i i 1 4 n k 3 s i where nk is the number of the divided blocks which is 8 in this study and np is the number of the variables in each parameter which is 3 for the parameter d 0 and is equal to nk for the other four parameters for the qualitative moat method wang et al 2016 applied the rule of thumb that the si moat 1 ratio of the most sensitive parameter to the least sensitive one is less than a certain threshold say 15 20 for delineating sps from insensitive ones thus rn is used to count the parameter variables that satisfy the thumb rule in this study and if rn greater than 0 5 we can consider that the corresponding parameter is sensitive moreover rs is used for evaluating the sensitivity level of each parameter for the quantitative methods rn is no longer applicable due to the lack of empirical threshold that can be referred to a proper rs threshold will be set for the quantitative screening according to the rs values of the sps screened by the moat method concerning the efficiency evaluation sample size can be regarded as the minimum required if the sa results related to various model performance indicators are consistent well with that of the 9 360 samples in the effectiveness evaluation and remain unchanged with a larger size on the other hand there is some order of magnitude discrepancies in the sensitivity index values due to the varying doe algorithms and model performance indicators to facilitate the comparison we map the index values to the range from zero to one by the min max normalization jain et al 2005 inevitably the rule of thumb threshold of the moat method should also be normalized this paper considers the parameter variable sensitive if both si moat 1 and si moat 2 values exceed the normalized threshold approximately 0 050 0 065 2 4 2 performance assessment of btop model the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 are the two indicators widely applied for evaluation and calibration of the dhms 14 rmse t 1 n q sim t q obs t n 2 15 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the total number of time steps qt obs and qt sim are the observed and simulated runoff corresponding to the time step t q obs is the average value of the observed runoff it is easy to find that the nse is obtained by dividing the square of the rmse by the observation variance and subtracting that ratio from 1 0 knoben et al 2019 besides the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is becoming more and more popular in the performance evaluation of the dhms is also applied in this study it composes three items including correlation r bias ratio β and variability ratio γ kling et al 2012 16 kg e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 17 r t 1 n q obs t q obs q sim t q sim t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 t 1 n q sim t q sim 2 18 β q sim q obs γ σ sim q sim σ obs q obs where σsim and σobs are the standard deviation of the simulated and observed runoff respectively for the hydrological simulation we usually take an interest in reproducing temporal dynamics described by r and preserving the runoff distribution described by β and γ which makes it reasonable to use kge as a model performance indicator basheer 2018 kling et al 2012 in addition nse can be interpreted as the ability of a model to reproduce with regards to the mean of the observations i e the model performs better than using the observed mean as a predictor if the nse is greater than 0 gupta et al 2009 this is an equivalent of kge to be greater than 0 41 knoben et al 2019 to evaluate the simulation performance of the btop model with and without gdiscs system we also considered the relative bias rbias that can indicate an overestimation or underestimation of the observation by the model simulation 19 rbias i 1 n q sim t q obs t i 1 n q obs t 100 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the qualitative gsa method 3 1 1 sa results of the morris samples both normalized si moat 1 and si moat 2 values of each parameter are shown in fig 3 we initially collected the morris samples with a quantity size of 9 360 and fed them into the btop model successively to obtain the indicator values of nse rmse and kge due to the excellent performance in some sa studies of the morris sampling and the moat method combination gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 the corresponding sa result is regarded as an impermanent benchmark in this paper it can be seen that more and more sensitive variables are screened out as the number of the variables with larger si moat 1 and si moat 2 values gradually increase from upstream to downstream sub basins as shown by panels from fig 3 h to a moreover the parameter variables obviously detach from the lower left corner except a1 a2 and a3 are all belong to the blocks above the river gauge in order to avoid the unreliability of determining parameter sensitivity with a few parameter variables there should be at least two or more blocks in each sub basin accordingly zpp nb 8 jsb nb 5 sap nb 2 sb nb 2 and zjg nb 2 are eligible the screened sps are presented in table 4 mainly according to the rn values listed in table s1 with rs values the results show that both sdbar and m are sps in all sub basins using nse rmse and kge to assess the model performance while the parameter α is clearly identified as an insensitive parameter for simulated river discharge in all eight study blocks from downstream to the upstream gauges including sap zgn hs and sp where the influenced parameter variables decrease the most sensitive parameter is increasingly inclined to be sdbar based on nse and rmse values whereas the result of kge still in favor of m by referencing the physical interpretation of the model parameters both d 0 and m are related to the soil transmissivity t 0 and reflect the impact of the soil types on the model outputs gusyev et al 2017 for the saturated subsurface d 0 defined as hydraulic conductivity is the ratio of t 0 to the thickness of the saturated aquifer and m is the decay factor of t 0 ao et al 2006 it implies that the change of m will cause such evident impact on the model outputs than t 0 and d 0 the parameter sdbar mainly reflects the impact of the basin topography gusyev et al 2016 generally the saturation excess runoff will not occur until the saturation deficit drops to zero gusyev et al 2017 takeuchi et al 2008 therefore sdbar directly impacts the runoff in the umrb and can be reasonably considered as a sensitive parameter as the only parameter to be optimized in the confluence sub model n 0 reflects the frictional resistance of the water passage to the runoff shrestha et al 2007 it is affected by many factors such as river bed materials river channel structure river bank irregularity and vegetation coverage hence the model should also be sensitive to the change of n 0 ao et al 2006 however α is the parameter that affects the drying function to estimate actual only when the root zone s water storage is less than the maximum zhou et al 2006 it is related to the actual evapotranspiration thereby affecting the runoff process in this study α should not be a sensitive parameter as others in the high elevation headwater catchments therefore we provisionally consider m sdbar d 0 and n 0 are sps of the btop model to avoid missing on the other hand the screened sps in sap sb and zjg with the same nb were consistent well table 4 in order to reduce the experiment cost only sb was chosen for the following experiments together with zpp and jsb 3 1 2 effectiveness of the qualitative gsa method for the effectiveness evaluation of the moat method we respectively collected 9 360 samples by lh slh mc and qmc algorithms to obtain the normalized si moat 1 and si moat 2 values as shown in fig 4 the rn and rs values of each parameter are respectively listed in table s2 and table s3 and the screened sps are listed in table 5 unlike the morris sampling there are some rn values greater than 1 in jsb and sb sub basins in the study area taking parameter m as an example in fig 4 the normalized sensitivity index values of c1 c8 are all higher than the rule of thumb threshold 0 050 0 06 i e ns is 8 that greater than the nb of jsb and sb shown in eq 12 accordingly the parameters can be regarded as sensitive ones if their rn value is greater than 0 8 in jsb and greater than 2 in sb as we can see in fig 4 all four doe algorithms agree that m is a sensitive parameter and α is an insensitive parameter of the btop model from the slh samples the sensitivity of a1 is greatly overestimated although the matching parameter d 0 is still insensitive due to the small rn value similar to the other three algorithms both sdbar and n 0 are identified as insensitive parameters in the sa results corresponding to lh mc and qmc n 0 is sensitive and there are some divergences in the sensitivity distinguishing of sdbar for example all sa results of the lh samples in three sub basins consider sdbar sensitive as do the qmc samples except using nse as a model performance indicator in the zpp sub basin however the result of the mc samples always regards sdbar as an insensitive parameter from the rs values m is the most sensitive parameter which is indicated by the rs values of the included ci greater than 0 77 and sdbar and n 0 are almost equally sensitive in general the sa results of the samples from the lh algorithm are more stable in identifying sensitive and insensitive parameters which are the same as the morris sampling except for d 0 campolongo et al 2007 pointed out that when the samples come from the morris sampling the moat method may judge unimportant factors as important ones not vice versa therefore it may be possible that the sa results of morris samples could incorrectly regard d 0 as a sensitive parameter it is also possible that lh is unable to be used for the moat method to identify all sps effectively these two questions are further discussed in combination with the quantitative sa section 3 2 3 1 3 efficiency of the qualitative gsa method this section evaluates the efficiency of the qualitative moat method using varying size samples r 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 50 70 and 100 collected by the morris sampling and lh algorithm which performed well in sps screening only si moat 1 is applied as the sensitivity index later due to the similar sa results obtained by referencing both si moat 1 and si moat 2 values discussed in previous sections different from the morris sampling rn becomes the number ratio of the sensitive variables to all in each parameter for the lh algorithm to avoid its value greater than one as in the effectiveness evaluation thus the judgment basis that the parameter with the rn value greater than 0 5 is sensitive applies to both the morris and lh algorithms as shown in fig 5 it is evident that the sensitive parameter m square marker and insensitive parameter α cross marker are always clearly distinguished with all combinations of indicators doe algorithms and sample sizes concerning the other parameters of d 0 sdbar and n 0 the effective screening of sps requires at least 1 080 r 30 samples from the morris sampling and 144 r 4 samples from the lh algorithm in zpp and jsb fig 5 a and b however it needs at least 3 600 r 100 morris samples and 720 r 20 lh samples in sb fig 5 c owing to the slow recognition of n 0 as a sensitive parameter with applying kge 3 2 evaluation of the quantitative gsa methods 3 2 1 effectiveness of the quantitative gsa methods in this section 9 360 samples collected by the lh slh mc and qmc algorithms that have been used for the moat method are also employed for the dgsm and rsmsobol method to perform quantitative sa unlike the moat method there is no empirical threshold to obtain the rn values and only rs values related to sti dgsm and sti rsm eqs 8 and 11 are applied for the sps screening combined with the sa results obtained by the moat method we regard the parameters with rs value greater than 0 02 0 03 as sensitive ones 3 2 1 1 sa results of dgsm fig 6 shows the sensitivity of each parameter by the rs value related to sti dgsm all rs values are listed in table s4 and the screened sps are listed in table 5 according to fig 6 we can find that all parameters are classified as sensitive using the lh algorithm samples the parameter α even has a higher rs value than others especially in the jsb and sb sub basins fig 6 b and c a similar result is obtained with the samples from the qmc algorithm it indicates that all parameters except d 0 are sensitive and n0 and α have strong sensitivity looking at the slh samples the sti dgsm value of a1 is much higher than that of others making the rs value of d 0 close to 1 these sps screening results are almost opposite to that from the moat method as for the mc algorithm the sa result in the zpp sub basin fig 6 a shows that m the largest green bubbles is the most sensitive parameter of the btop model and the corresponding rs values with three model performance indicators are all greater than 0 5 d 0 and α are insensitive parameters as the rs values are less than 0 02 however the rs value of the parameter α increases in jsb and we can no longer consider it as an insensitive parameter similarly all parameters of sb are considered sensitive compared to other sampling algorithms the mc samples may have ideal sa results consistent with the moat method using lh samples but only in zpp it is not enough to convince us that the mc algorithm is the appropriate sampling algorithm for the dgsm method to screen sps of the btop model 3 2 1 2 sa results of rsmsobol fig 7 shows the rs values related to sti rsm of each parameter listed in table s5 and the screened sps are also listed in table 5 compared to the dgsm method the samples taken by the four chosen doe algorithms perform much better in quantitative sa with the rsmsobol method as shown in fig 7 regardless of the model performance indicator the parameter m is always judged as the most sensitive parameter in three sub basins with the highest rs values which are all greater than 0 5 and about 70 are greater than 0 8 the sa results obtained by the rsmsobol method can also identify α as an insensitive parameter effectively however there are some discrepancies in the sensitivity judgment of the parameters d 0 sdbar and n 0 as listed in table 5 when nse is used to indicate the model performance for the slh mc and qmc samples d 0 is considered as a sensitive parameter in jsb and sb and sdbar is identified as an insensitive parameter in zpp using the lh samples and the nse indicator these results are opposite to that when rmse and kge are applied however the lh and qmc samples using rmse as a model performance indicator cannot regard n 0 as a sensitive parameter similarly to nse and kge in contrast the performance of kge is extremely stable except for d 0 the other two parameters are both considered sensitive this is relatively close to the qualitative sa results with utilizing the moat method in general the rsmsobol method is commendable due to its excellent sa performance with kge as a model output indicator thus we evaluate the efficiency of rsmsobol method with the various sample sizes and the model performance is only indicated by kge it should be noted that the efficiency of the dgsm method is not evaluated due to the inconsistent sa results with the other two gsa methods although it is faster than the moat methods in our cases 3 2 2 efficiency of the quantitative gsa method since the sa results with three indicators are similar we present the rs values of model parameters with various sample sizes with kge as the model performance indicator in fig 8 while the results with indicator nse and rmse are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 except for the 108 r 3 slh samples and the 72 r 2 mc samples with null rs value caused by the unsuccessful surrogate modeling the sensitivity of the parameter m and α can always be correctly distinguished with the smallest size design i e 72 r 2 in all sub basins d 0 can also be effectively identified as an insensitive parameter with a small size when the samples are collected by lh mc and qmc algorithms however the slh samples cannot considered d 0 insensitive until the sample size reaches 1 080 r 30 in zpp and sb and even 1 800 r 50 in jsb as for the remaining parameters sdbar is a sensitive parameter apart from the sa results of the mc samples in zpp and jsb and n 0 is also considered sensitive apart from mc samples in zpp as well as slh samples in sb after the comprehensive comparison qmc is the most efficient and stable doe algorithm that applicable to the rsmsobol method and the required minimum sample sizes in zpp jsb and sb are 360 r 10 108 r 3 and 1080 r 30 respectively 3 3 evaluation of the gdiscs system to evaluate the applicability of the gdiscs system we compare the optimization experiments of sps versus aps in four sub basins including zpp jsb sb and hs that has not been reported in the previous sps screening to avoid missing sps many studies believed that the parameter is sensitive as long as it is not considered insensitive by all gsa methods bennett et al 2018 gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 li et al 2021 accordingly we set another optimization combination composed of sps and d 0 denoted as sps d 0 to further discuss whether d 0 should be regarded as a sensitive parameter to be adjusted during the btop model calibration the optimal objective function values and the required model runs number of optimizing sps sps d 0 and aps with varying objective functions are shown in fig 9 and the quantitative values and optimization durations are listed in table 6 in the zpp sub basin fig 9 a aps and sps d 0 were not optimized due to the insufficient nloop and accordingly the optimization duration accuracy as well as runoff simulation performance are not included in the following comparisons in the jsb fig 9 b sb fig 9 c and hs fig 9 d sub basins the sps optimization reaches the convergence with lesser model runs and shorter optimization duration than sps d 0 and aps it means that the optimal values can be identified quickly when only sps are optimized for example the minimum model runs of aps optimization is 8 965 the optimization duration is about 33 h when the kge value is nearly constant and cannot be further improved after 20 shuffling loops in hs see fig 9 d with kge on the vertical axis and table 6 it is more than 10 000 runs the optimization duration is more than 37 h in jsb and sb whether the objective function is nse or kge fig 9 b c and table 6 however the runs number and the required duration by the sps optimization are almost halved or even less for the combination sps d 0 the required model runs to reach convergence is sometimes higher or sometimes lower than aps but consistently significantly higher than sps in the early optimization stage both nse and kge values of the converged sps are higher than those of sps d 0 and aps and then sps gradually reach the optimal values satisfying the convergence condition but sps d 0 and aps continue to be optimized if the set values of nloop and nmaxr are sufficiently large the objective function values of aps eventually exceed sps and sps d 0 like in jsb and sb fig 9 b and c otherwise it means that larger nloop or nmaxr are required like in hs fig 9 d when the accuracy is considered there are some differences in the nse and kge values among the three parameter combinations the maximum nse and kge differences between aps and sps are 0 047 and 0 037 in jsb fig 9 a and the minimum differences are 0 003 and 0 001 in hs fig 9 d it indicates that sps can capture most optimization information of aps although the parameter variables number is reduced by nearly 1 3 sps include three parameters and corresponding 24 variables and aps include seven parameters and 35 variables the nse and kge differences between sps and sps d 0 are in smaller ranges that are 0 002 0 033 and 0 001 0 036 overall the optimization accuracy of sps is close to aps and sps d 0 and is sufficient to meet the practical application of hydrological simulations minimum nse is greater than 0 61 and minimum kge is greater than 0 72 however the optimization speed of sps is considerably faster than the other two combinations which makes it require lesser computational time and costs 3 4 evaluation of the parameters from sps optimization after optimizing the three combinations by the sce ua method with two objective functions nse and kge nse and kge are also applied as model performance indicators to evaluate the runoff simulation during calibration table 7 and validation table 8 moreover the obtained optimal values of the parameter variables are respectively shown in table s6 and table s7 where the unoptimized variables are assigned to the default values from gusyev et al 2017 the simulation with applying default values to all parameters is also performed to evaluate the parameter optimization in improving model performance when using nse as an objective function for parameter optimization the runoff simulation performance of optimal sps is close to that of optimal aps with maximum δnse and δkge of 0 047 and 0 029 in the jsb sub basin minimum δnse and δkge of 0 003 and 0 001 in the hs sub basin maximum δrbias is 2 70 in the sb sub basin and minimum δrbias is 0 50 in the jsb sub basin as well as to that of optimal sps d 0 maximum δnse is 0 033 in jsb and maximum δkge is 0 018 in sb maximum δrbias is 1 30 in jsb and sb minimum δnse δkge and δrbias are all in hs with the values of 0 002 0 001 and 0 036 although when kge was applied for parameter optimization the difference in the simulation performance of the optimal sps and aps is minor in jsb δnse is 0 137 δkge is 0 037 and δrbias is 0 30 the worst performance is also acceptable with nse of 0 591 kge of 0 797 and rbias of 9 70 compared to the simulations with default parameter values the model performance is greatly improved by optimizing only sps the evident improvements are in jsb δnse is 0 356 δkge is 0 139 and δrbias is 2 40 when nse is the objective function δnse is 0 260 δkge is 0 143 and δrbias is 5 00 when kge is the objective function during the validation period table 8 the runoff simulation performance of optimal sps and aps are also in a relatively small range δnse 0 003 0 022 δkge 0 005 0 034 and δrbias 0 7 4 9 when nse is the objective function δnse 0 001 0 145 δkge 0 001 0 038 and δrbias 0 1 11 5 when kge is the objective function however the simulation differences between sps and default parameters are more evident in the jsb sub basin the δnse δkge and δrbias increase to 0 764 0 321 and 15 40 when using nse as an objective function and increase to 0 604 0 246 and 20 8 when kge is used for the optimization due to the closed performance in flow simulations with the optimal parameters from different objective functions fig 10 only shows the simulated runoff processes using nse as the objective function while the hydrograph corresponding to kge is shown in fig s5 since the initial conditions of the btop model are default but not optimal the simulated runoff in 1982 and 1986 are not included in the following description fig 10 shows that the simulations from the final sps roughly coincide with those from aps and sps d 0 during calibration and validation periods especially in hs fig 10 c where the runoff curves from three parameter combinations almost overlap however the simulated flow always overestimates the peak flows due to the closely related fact that hs is located in the tibetan plateau with snow cover and frozen soil gradually to the downstream the peak simulation is closer and closer to the observations as it is less affected by the plateau characteristics in jsb fig 10 a and sb fig 10 b there are some differences between the simulations from optimal parameter combinations as well as default parameters the simulated peak flows with optimal aps and sps d 0 are always higher than sps and their low flows are the lowest and closest to the observations however the simulations with the default parameters are on the contrary these characteristics are more evident in the validation period than the calibration period overall sps can capture most of the hydrological information of aps and sps d 0 and are highly representative of them accordingly d 0 should not be regarded as a sensitive parameter of the btop model in this paper furthermore optimizing with only sps improves the runoff simulations with the default parameters significantly especially in reducing the overestimation of the low flows 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness which doe algorithm could obtain reasonable samples to achieve reliable sa by the gsa method combined with the effectiveness analysis of three gsa methods section 3 1 2 and 3 2 1 we found that whether the gsa method can effectively screen sensitive model parameters is closely related to the doe algorithms but not only to itself for the moat method the samples from the morris sampling tended to perform well in the qualitative sa according to similar reports gan et al 2014 2018 li et al 2013 morris 1991 wang et al 2016 as well as in this study moreover the screened sps with the samples from the lh algorithm were the same as that of the morris sampling except for d 0 combined with the quantitative sa results from the well performed rsmsobol method using kge as the model performance indicator d 0 was regarded as an insensitive parameter of the btop model this implies that the moat method made a mistake in identifying the parameter d 0 as a sensitive one with the morris sampling in this study and similar results were reported by campolongo et al 2007 in addition the sa results of the morris samples corresponded well to the btop model s characteristic that only the parameters in the blocks above the river gauge have an impact in its flow simulation takeuchi et al 2008 but not lh samples it is probably owing to the principle of the various sampling algorithms in detail the morris sampling uses a design that changes one factor at a time individually and randomly which is suitable for the moat method in obtaining multiple elementary effects for every input morris 1991 but lh algorithm changes all factors at once mckay et al 1979 although it has no impact on the sps screening in this paper we still capture the information that there is a visible difference in the parameter sa with applying varying doe algorithms for the same gsa method as for the dgsm method it demonstrated time saving computations that was even faster than moat and the mc samples indeed had better sa results than other sampling algorithms in this paper this is consistent with kucherenko et al 2009 which have proved that the sa performance with using the samples from the mc algorithm was significantly decent nevertheless it is difficult to conclude that the mc algorithm is a suitable doe algorithm for the dgsm method due to the sensitivity misjudgment of the parameter α in summary for a complex model with many parameters multi gsa methods and multi doe algorithms are essential for more robust sa results specifically the qualitative gsa methods with multi doe algorithms can be used for rough parameter screening at the beginning and allow to differentiate the least and the most sensitive parameters at a lower evaluation cost then the quantitative ones and multi doe algorithms can be applied for further sa campolongo and saltelli 1997 campolongo et al 2007 the surrogate modeling techniques that can construct varying applicable models based on the samples and corresponding model outputs song et al 2012 storlie et al 2009 zhan et al 2013 deserve attention in future studies 4 2 efficiency how many samples from the applicable doe algorithm are sufficient for the robust sa results to evaluate the sa efficiency of the gsa methods with great effectiveness we collected varying size samples by the practicable doe algorithms section 3 1 3 and 3 2 2 although the morris sampling is a specific doe algorithm of the moat method gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 and its sa result can excellently display the parameter characteristic of the btop model the lh algorithm demonstrated higher efficiency and stability in sps screening in our cases it indicates that the morris sampling design changing one factor at a time often provides less information for sa when its sample size is the same as lh samples similarly for the river gauge with a small number of upstream blocks the qualitative moat method often requires a large sample to screen the sps effectively due to the less available information in each sample combination thus we suggest that the river gauges with multiple upstream blocks are chosen for similar studies and then the sample size can be designed as needed it can save both time and labor while avoiding the unreliability of determining parameter sensitivity due to limited information for the quantitative rsmsobol method shahsavani and grimvall 2011 qmc is the most efficient algorithm although the samples from all four doe algorithms performed well in the sps screening especially in the zpp sub basin this is inseparable from its ability to converge faster than mc and other random sequence sampling algorithms due to the deterministic low deviation sequence krykova 2004 lécot and tuffin 2004 zhan et al 2013 on the other hand it proves that the performance comparison of multiple doe algorithms is necessary for effective and efficient sa more importantly by comparing the required lh sample size of the two gsa methods we also observed that the quantitative methods usually require more model runs than the qualitative ones gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 li et al 2021 4 3 credibility are the sps screening results of the samples with various model performance indicators consistent as shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 the sa results corresponding to three indicators of rmse nse and kge were always different even though the gsa method and the doe algorithm were unchanged regarding the formula composition and implications of three indicators the total square error is firstly obtained in the calculation of rmse which indicates that each error affects the total in proportion to its square the total square error as a result is mainly affected by the larger errors and concentrates on the largest one chai and draxler 2014 after dividing by n and taking the square root the total squared error is scaled willmott and matsuura 2005 the numerator of the nse is the same as that of the square of rmse nash and sutcliffe 1970 it makes nse is sensitive to high values such as peak flows in the hydrograph similar to rmse li et al 2021 however the distinct denominators scale the total squared error in varying degrees murphy 1988 as for the gaining popularity kge is composed of three items correlation bias ratio and variability ratio making it distinguishable from the above two gupta et al 2009 it is equipped to measure the temporal dynamics and the distribution of flows kling et al 2012 in short the sa results on the basis of varying model performance indicators are hardly consistent and it is essential to apply multi indicators for the reliable screening of sps as for the sa performance in the effectiveness evaluation kge was stabilized and commendable for the well behaved combinations of the doe algorithm and the gsa method such as the morris algorithm and the moat method the mc algorithm and the dgsm method as well as all doe algorithms and the rsmsobol method it is closely related to the superior character of kge which covers many model performance evaluation indexes and is able to capture the model performance characteristics more comprehensively thus kge can be widely used as the model performance indicator in the sa of the model parameters choubin et al 2018 kling et al 2012 mathevet et al 2020 rojas et al 2020 tsai et al 2021 however after the efficiency evaluation the river gauge with fewer upstream sub basins often required more samples when kge is used therefore if kge is applied as the model performance indicator it is recommended to have more sub basins above the studied river gauges to avoid large samples requirements 4 4 significance can parameter sa with gdiscs system reduce the model runs to shorten the parameter optimization duration from the evaluation of the required model runs number and optimization duration as well as the simulation performance based on the gdiscs system in section 3 3 the optimal parameter values could be identified quickly with lower computational costs only 1 2 or even less runs number and optimization duration when sps were optimized and sps could capture most optimization information of aps moreover the optimization accuracy of sps was close to aps and it was also sufficient for practical application in hydrological simulations this is consistent with the conclusion obtained by li et al 2021 thus the sps obtained by gdiscs system contribute to shortening the parameter optimization process well with satisfactory model performance although the sps optimization is on the basis of sa that needs to take time in collecting parameter samples the obtained sa results can also provide reference information for other related studies such as dhm parameter regionalization and model uncertainty analysis in this or other basins with similar characteristics in addition the choice of the doe algorithm the gsa method and the model performance indicators all affect the required sample size and thus the efficiency of sa as we have discovered this is helpful to improve the parameter sa efficiency of all dynamic models such as environmental models and dhms besides the impact of the gdiscs system on improving model calibration efficiency and reducing model computational burden it also has some potentials in reducing the uncertainty of model parameter optimization called equifinality for different parameters it has been proven that this uncertainty comes from the interaction between many parameters calibrated together clark et al 2011 renard et al 2010 screening the sps that are utilized with a significant effect on the model output variability is also a process of reducing the parameter dimensionality to be optimized and thus reducing the interactions between the parameters gan et al 2014 li et al 2013 moreover the insensitive parameters that have little effect on model outputs are likely to cause excessive noise fitting and over parameterization problems sheikholeslami et al 2021 it is necessary to further analyze the effectiveness of the gdiscs system in reducing the parameter uncertainty and the over parameterization risk quantitatively and comprehensively 5 conclusions we proposed the gdiscs system to obtain the robust sps and evaluate the effect of sps optimization on flow simulation in this system three gsa methods moat dgsm and rsmsobol four doe algorithms lh slh mc and qmc which are used to obtain samples with varying sizes and three indicators rmse nse and kge were integrated for a comprehensive evaluation of parameter importance and model calibration the gdiscs system was verified with the btop model at the eight blocks of the umrb china to apply gdiscs system in future studies it is important to understand our findings of four raised issues as summarized below the effectiveness of the gsa method in screening sps is closely related to itself as well as the doe algorithms in terms of the qualitative sa by the moat method which has the morris sampling as its special doe algorithm the screened sps m sdbar and n0 with the samples from lh algorithm were consistent well with the quantitative results from the rsmsobol method which had a great sa performance using all doe algorithms however the dgsm method mistakenly considered d 0 and α sensitive even though the most appropriate mc algorithm was used thus the gdiscs system with multi gsa methods and multi doe algorithms is essential for obtaining robust sa results especially for a complex model with many parameters as for the efficiency evaluation the quantitative gsa methods usually require more model runs than the qualitative methods for reliable sa results in our study using the samples from lh algorithm the robust screened sps required 144 r 4 samples in the zpp and jsb sub basins and 720 r 20 in the sb sub basin by the qualitative moat method however for the quantitative rsmsobol method the identical results needed 1 800 r 50 samples in jsb and at least 3 600 r 100 samples in zpp and sb moreover the stable sa results by the moat method always required more samples due to the insufficient sensitivity information in the sub basins with few blocks and the morris samples that change only one factor at a time in question 3 it is easy to notice that the sa results corresponding to three indicators were always different when the gsa method and the doe algorithm were unchanged during the effectiveness evaluation the sa performances using kge as a model output indicator were stabilized and commendable for the well behaved doe algorithm and gsa method combinations such as the morris algorithm and moat method the mc algorithm and dgsm method as well as the qmc algorithm and rsmsobol method therefore kge is recommended for the parameter sa considering practical applications using numerical models in other basins the sps obtained from the gdiscs system can considerably shorten the parameter optimization process with satisfactory runoff simulation performance as demonstrated in this study the optimal parameter values can be identified quickly with almost halved or even lesser number of the model runs when only sps are optimized and sps can capture most optimization information of aps although the parameter variables number is reduced by nearly one third the optimization accuracy of sps is close to aps with slight differences i e the maximum nse kge and rbias differences are 0 137 0 037 and 2 70 and it is sufficient to meet the practical application of hydrological simulations in summary the gdiscs system that includes multiple gsa methods doe algorithms model performance indicators and sample size designs is applicable and practical for obtaining robust sa results moreover optimizing only sps can significantly improve model calibration efficiency and reduce model computational burden while ensuring satisfactory simulation performance furthermore as long as the btop model is concerned it is promising that assign the sps to each grid and keep insensitive parameters in blocks for a more reasonable efficient and accurate simulation which would be our following study shortly credit authorship contribution statement lingxue liu
