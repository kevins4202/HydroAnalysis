22645,traffic flow theory has been applied to the study of marine traffic flow and underpins the phenomena being studied this paper is intended to demonstrate the uses of classical fundamental diagrams which are developed previously on the basis of highway traffic by conducting empirical tests on marine traffic data marine traffic data are extracted from the automatic identification system ais from shanghai port in 2010 and 2018 interpolation methods are used to estimate the three primary variables of fundamental diagrams namely flow rate traffic density and local speed the relationships among these three variables are discussed and marine traffic data are further compared and contrasted with classical traffic flow models the importance of the finding is to create consistency predictability and uniformity of uses of fundamental diagrams on marine traffic flow keywords ship traffic fundamental diagram ais data empirical tests shanghai port 1 introduction the traffic flow theory has been recently used to underpin the phenomena of marine traffic flow wen et al 2015 extended the concept of traffic flow complexity to marine traffic flow in terms of traffic density factor and traffic conflict factor they argued the spatial distributions of traffic flow complexity and collision risk are highly correlated kang meng and liu 2018 predicted the capacity of a waterway system by adopting the classical fundamental diagram of traffic flow they used weighted and non weighted least squared approaches to estimate the speed density relationship of marine traffic along the singapore strait they showed that the foundation of marine traffic flow theory is still highly deficient different from kang et al 2018 we are motivated to examine any difference s between marine traffic flow and classical traffic flow models the traffic flow model is the fundamental tool in traffic flow theory for describing understanding and predicting traffic flow in maritime research the microscopic models individual ships are popular but the macroscopic flow model a group of ships has only recently emerged in the maritime literature jensen et al 2013 yip 2013 discussed a mathematical maritime flow model based on classical flow models he proposed an extension of the one dimensional payne model to a two dimensional marine traffic flow model thereby introducing a new way of characterising maritime traffic flow in the marine domain the automatic identification system ais collects a vast amount of near real time traffic data these data record ships behaviour at different moments according to the imo s international maritime organization s regulation in solas the international convention for the safety of life at sea 2000 ais equipment is mandatory for vessels with gross cargo tonnages of 300 tons or more for international voyages for vessels with gross cargo tonnages of 500 tons or more for non international waterways and for all passenger vessels whether in international or non international waters the requirement became effective for ships on 31 december 2004 many researchers apply ais to their research and studies however although many kinds of traffic flow model have been used to describe maritime traffic flow few of them have focused on the fundamental diagrams the characteristics of the real world traffic fundamental relationship in maritime traffic and whether the maritime traffic fundamental diagram is similar to that of highway traffic flow remain unclear these issues are investigated in the remainder of this paper section 2 briefly summarises the traffic flow theory with respect to marine traffic section 3 presents an account of the methodology and explains the procedures of sampling used section 4 examines real world traffic data sources and data pre processing section 5 contains the results of empirical testing section 6 discusses the results section 7 concludes the study 2 literature review 2 1 brief review of traffic flow theory the initial research into the traffic flow model was conducted during the early twentieth century by greenshields 1934 who studied the relationship between distance and velocity known as the fundamental relationship or fundamental diagram after that many types of traffic flow model have been developed to describe traffic flow phenomena generally these investigations are categorised into microscopic models mesoscopic models and macroscopic models van wageningen kessels et al 2014 the characteristics of which are described as follows 2 1 1 microscopic models microscopic models distinguish and trace the individual behaviour of each car including actions such as car following and lane changing microscopic models include a leading vehicle and following vehicles and each following vehicle will adjust its behaviour according to that of the leading vehicle currently car following models can be divided into four subtypes safe distance models gipps 1981 stimulus response models bando et al 1995 action point models wiedemann 1974 and cellular automata models nagel and schreckenberg 1992 as a microscopic model can characterise the simple cooperation between vehicles it is an accepted model type in the marine traffic field in particular maritime car following models have been widely used in china to calculate the capacity of waterways and to simulate traffic zhu and zhang 2009 used a ship following model to calculate the transit capacity of an inland waterway subsequently he et al 2012 improved the ship following model and made it more suitable for marine traffic simulation feng 2013 used a different method a cellar automata marine traffic flow model which can also simulate traffic flow and calculate the transit capacity of waterways 2 1 2 mesoscopic models mesoscopic models describe the aggregate features of vehicle behaviour such as the probability distribution of speed and density compared with micro and macroscopic traffic models the mesoscopic traffic model is the most recently developed type of model and contains three main subtypes headway distribution models buckley 1968 cluster models mahnke and kuhne 2007 and gas kinetic models prigogine 1961 the gas kinetic model is the most commonly used subtype in road traffic studies in the maritime traffic field few models of the gas kinetic subtype have been developed however some characteristics such as arrival distribution headway distribution speed distribution and density distribution have become the main parameters to describe predict and simulate maritime traffic flow hou et al 2014 used vessel speed arrival time and density amongst other parameters to describe traffic flow in the middle reach of the yangtze river including around the cities of hefei wuhan nanchang and changsha other researchers have also used these parameters to predict traffic flow jagerman and altiok 2003 analysed the arrival distribution of ships in sea ports to approximate both the asymptotic probabilities of the number of vessels and the waiting time probabilities these parameters i e vessel speed and arrival time are the essential inputs to all types of traffic simulation models köse et al 2003 2 1 3 macroscopic models in macroscopic traffic models traffic is regarded as a continuum flow such models ignore individual behaviour and focus on aggregated variables such as average density and velocity the most basic macroscopic models were developed by lighthill and whitham 1955a b and richards 1956 referred to as the lwr lighthill whitham richards model subsequently higher order models including cell transmission ctm daganzo 1994 and multi class mc lwr models have been developed as improvements on the lwr model payne 1971 van wageningen kessels et al 2014 micro meso and macro scopic models all have the same basis which is the fundamental relationship between density velocity and flow rate these models are dedicated to reproducing the key phenomena in real world road traffic such as capacity drop hysteresis and scattered fundamental diagrams van wageningen kessels et al 2014 in other words the fundamental diagram is the basis of traffic flow theory 2 2 traffic flow studies in maritime studies recently with the spread of ais equipment more and more ship data become available for ship traffic flow analysis and have attracted numerous researchers working on ship traffic analysis as yip 2013 showed the traffic flow model might benefit better safety management of ship traffic in various studies one popular type of traffic flow analysis dominates and aims at describing the statistical features of the ship traffic in some other studies researchers set a number of observation lines and calculating the number of the ships crossing these observation lines in different locations kasyk and kijewska 2013 xiao et al 2015 then the distributions of ship positions and ship speeds are obtained hou et al 2014 kasyk and kijewska 2013 instead of analysing the traffic flow on the observation lines other studies directly analyse the ship trajectories in a certain water area and identify the patterns of trajectory in the area on the basis of ais data for instance zhou et al 2019 developed a naive bayesian classifier for identifying ship s patterns in the port of rotterdam chen et al 2018 used the ais data to classify vessel motion patterns in the yangtze river these statistical analyses are helpful for simulating traffic flow in the observed areas merrick et al 2005 xu et al 2013 and conducting risk analysis in the observed waterways li et al 2012 although the statistical analysis of ship traffic flow is useful to show the time invariant feature of the traffic flow the dynamics of traffic flow is neglected in fact the ship traffic flow also has time varying features e g density average speed flow all of which are crucial for real time traffic management for instance the vessel traffic control monitors the traffic flow so as to avoid a traffic congestion more real time traffic management in road traffic might refer to qian 2009 in the maritime domain there is a lack of tools to describe the dynamics of ship traffic flow for real time traffic management the development of traffic flow analysis in road traffic has inspired a group of researchers in the maritime domain hongxiang et al 2015 and qi zheng and gang 2017a simulated the ship traffic flow in a waterway by a famous cellular automaton model which is a widely used traffic flow model in road traffic later on qi zheng and gang 2017b incorporated the influence of weather on ships speed in a simulator these studies showed the potential of using the traffic flow theory in ship traffic management these studies in fact contain an assumption that the traffic law developed from the road traffic is readily applicable to ship traffic flow however this assumption has not been carefully tested in the maritime domain that motivates this study to test the fitness of classical traffic flow models in the ship traffic flow kang meng and liu 2018 conducted empirical tests of ship traffic flow in singapore and showed that the relationship between density and speed of ship traffic is similar to the highway traffic models to some extent the coefficient of overall fitness r squired statistics ranges roughly from 0 4 to 0 9 however they did not report other fundamental relationships 3 methodology 3 1 definition of variables to study the fundamental relation the variables of traffic flow need to be first defined greenshields 1934 employed distance between vehicles and velocity as the fundamental parameters since greenshields work the main parameters for traffic flow have become density k the average number of vehicles per unit length of road v e h m velocity u the average vehicle speed per unit length of road m s and intensity q the average number of vehicles per unit time v e h s in the maritime research field a different measurement system exists with the three variables above being defined as follows density k the average number of vessels per unit length of channel v e h n m where nm stands for nautical miles velocity u the average vessel speed per unit length of channel knots or nautical miles per hour where kn denotes knots or nautical miles per hour and intensity q the average number of vessels per unit time v e h h according to these definitions k q and u can be calculated as follows 1 k m x 2 q n t 3 u 1 m i 1 m v i where m is the number of vessels at the observed moment x is the length of observed channel v i is the speed of vessel i in the channel at the observed moment n is the number of vessels passing the line of observation and t is the duration over which the observations were made these three variables have the following relationship 4 q k u 3 2 empirical analysis to calculate the three variables k q and u a time space diagram is used see fig 1 a the time space diagram is an informative representation that illustrates vehicles trajectories in the time space dimension the curves passing through the coordinates illustrate the trajectories of vessels whereby the ordinate value of each point in the curve represents the distance to the channels origin line x and the abscissa value of each point in the curve represents the observed time t the blue arrows in fig 1a tangents of the curves indicate the speed of each vessel when t t 0 the red arrows in fig 1a indicate the speeds of the vessels when they pass the line of observation x x 0 according to equations 1 and 2 x and t are required to calculate density intensity and velocity in practice we need a window of observation as shown in fig 1b to calculate the variables because vessels are dynamic the number of vessels in the channel is changing continuously for a given unit length of channel x in other words m is varying with time set as m t similarly when the line of observation is placed in a different location the number of vessels observed will be different during a given time duration t therefore n varies with distance and is thus set as n x in conclusion the following equations are used to calculate k q and u 5 k m x 1 t t 0 t 0 t m t d t x t 0 t 0 t m t d t x t 6 q n t 1 x x 0 x 0 x n x d x t x 0 x 0 x n x d x x t 7 u q k where m t is the number of vessels in the channel x at time t n x is the number of vessels passing the line of observation x during time t and m t and n x are segmented and discontinuous functions respectively providing that dt and dx are small enough fig 1b m t and n x can be counted the velocity of a ship is lower than that of a car and therefore we select dt 1 s and dx 0 0005 nm in this way the observation window can be split into small slices and m and n can be counted for each slice the detail of calculating algorithm can be found in algorithm 2 algorithm 1 gererate ship flow w r t in given rectangle area area 1 or 2 image 1 algorithm 2 calculation of traffic variables in each observing window image 2 3 3 analysis procedures before the computing of traffic data the study area and total observation duration should be chosen the study area is chosen within the channel in which vessels sail as we will repeat the computing for different groups of k q and u the total observation duration should be long enough for sufficient observations to be made the specific procedures are as follows step 1 extract ais data into trajectory information see fig 2 step 2 choose the study area in the channel of interest where vessels are sailing and the total duration over which observations are made step 3 set the start line in the observed channel the entrance of the studied section step 4 filter the trajectories that are recorded in the observed channel calculate the distance to the start line in the trajectory and record the distance time data see algorithm 1 step 5 utilize the records in step 4 to draw a time space diagram fig 3 step 6 choose the observation window x and t as one sample step 7 calculate one group of values for the variables k q and u based on the procedure outlined in section 3 1 definition of variables see algorithm 2 step 8 repeat step 6 moving the observation window until the pre set total observation duration is reached and step 9 draw the maritime traffic fundamental diagram using the sampled observations 4 data processing 4 1 features of automatic identification system data greenshields 1934 used a camera to record road traffic however ships are much larger than cars which makes it impossible to record ships behaviour using a camera the ais information contains static data such as imo number call sign ship name and maritime mobile service identity mmsi as well as dynamic data such as speed over ground sog course over ground cog position and coordinated universal time utc the refresh rates of this information differ the equipment transmits the static information every 6 min whereas the rate for dynamic information is more complicated for anchoring ships the broadcast rate is 3 min and it increases to 2 s when the ship is sailing at high speed itu 2010 as a result ais data are obtained in near real time at discrete points but the refresh rate is asynchronous to analyse the traffic fundamental relation we need a continuous trajectory therefore the raw ais data first need to be processed noises exist in the ais data and can adversely affect the results of analysis to reduce the noises we have removed some ais data if 1 the same mmsi number appears at different positions in the same timeslot or 2 the change of ship position in two successive timeslots exceeds the practical limit of ship speed e g 50 knots or 3 the speed in the record is too high e g 50 knots the raw ais was collected over the period of 1 january to 31 march 3 months in 2010 and 2018 as the results of 2010 and 2018 are very similar our discussion is based on 2010 mainly 4 2 ships trajectories because an analysis of the traffic fundamental relationship needs only dynamic data ships static information can be ignored the process for creating ais history trajectories is illustrated in fig 2 first to read the ais information the raw data needed to be decoded to decode the ais data we referred to the technical document recommendation itu r m 1371 4 itu 2010 second to simplify the algorithm we removed the pure static record the information that included the dynamic data was transferred to the next step of the process third the mmsi was extracted to search whether each mmsi had appeared previously if yes then a new form was created to record the ship s new position and utc and if no then the new data were added to the relevant mmsi form and the new form was sorted by utc fourth the extracted ais database was updated if the current record was the final record then the process was ended otherwise the process moved to the next record and was continued after this process the ais data were stored in different forms with the mmsi identifying each form and in each form the position data being sorted in order of increasing utc after this the trajectories of ship movements were drawn however as the refresh rates are different these trajectories are still discrete therefore this paper uses a linear interpolation algorithm to increase the resolution of the trajectories 4 3 approach channels to shanghai port to discover the maritime traffic fundamental relation we chose shanghai port one of the busiest ports in the world shanghai port is located at the estuary of the yangtze river therefore the east west directed traffic into and out of the yangtze river and north south directed traffic will cross at the estuary see fig 4 which makes the shanghai port traffic flow complicated there are only two channels through which shanghai port can be approached fig 5 we chose these two channels to observe traffic data 5 empirical analysis to ensure that the maritime fundamental diagram is portrayed correctly we design several tests we evaluate the influence of the different parameters including x and t total observation times observed channels and observation dates on the final results first we define a basic sample group the characteristics of which are given in table 1 fig 6 shows two selected observed areas namely area 1 and area 2 fig 7 shows a time space diagram of the traffic flow in area 1 for the period 5 7 march 2010 5 7 march 2018 fig 8 displays the fundamental relationship as a series of scatterplots with points being calculated based on the parameters set in table 1 fig 8 1 shows the fundamental diagram in 2010 and fig 8 1 shows that in 2018 as these two figure shown with this parameter setting maritime traffic flow has a similar fundamental relationship to that of highway traffic see fig 14 the density velocity relationship is near linear and negatively related however it is not ready to conclude whether these characteristics are a function only of the particular parameters therefore in the following sections we test the effect of different parameter settings on the fundamental relationship 5 1 test 1 the influence of different observation window size in the road traffic flow situation because the speed of traffic evaluation is high the size of the observation window is small e g 1 km and 1 min the size of a ship is much larger than that of a car and the speed is much lower than that of a car therefore we set the standard observation window as 2 nm and 2 h to verify the size of the observation window we test different observation window sizes the size of the observation window for control group 1 1 cg 1 1 is 3 nm and 2 h and that for control group 1 2 cg 1 2 is 2 nm and 4 h the other parameters used for cg 1 1 and cg 1 2 are given in table a1 in the appendix the results are shown in fig 9 fig 9 1 2 show the fundamental diagrams in 2010 and fig 9 3 4 shows the fundamental diagrams in 2018 5 2 test 2 the influence of different total observed time because the observation window for the maritime situation is larger than that for highway traffic we illustrate the effect of different total observed time on the fundamental relationship for control group 2 1 cg 2 1 the total observed time is 5 days and for cg 2 2 is 7 days details are shown in table a2 in the appendix the results are shown in fig 10 in which it can be seen that although the greater number of days of observations provides more samples the patterns of the fundamental diagrams for the two observation durations in the same year are very similar 5 3 test 3 the influence of different observation date maritime traffic should differ between different months therefore we set four control groups with different observation dates cg 3 1 on 1 3 january fig 11 1 fig 11 3 and cg 3 2 on 1 3 february fig 11 2 fig 11 4 details are presented in table a3 5 4 test 4 the influence of different channel traffic flow is likely to differ in different channels for example in shanghai port fig 6 the beicao channel the northern channel is the main channel for deep draught vessels and the depth of the channel is maintained at 10 m after 2010 the maintained depth is 12 5 m whereas the nancao channel the southern channel is for smaller ships liu et al 2014 we chose two areas in these channels for making observations in fig 6 area 1 and area 2 are located in the nancao channel and the beicao channel respectively the settings of these experiments are shown in table a4 and the fundamental diagrams for area 2 are shown in fig 12 5 5 sensitivity test the influence of observation time window to test the influence from the size of observation window different observation period have been chosen in this test therefore we set 5 control groups with different time windows such as 30min 1 h 4 h 6 h and 12 h similarly the distance sensitivity analysis is also investigated the alternative distances are 1 nm 1 5 nm 2 5 nm 3 nm and 3 5 nm since three primary parameters q k u are dependent such that the q is equal to k time u all the results of sensitivity tests are shown in the same plane namely the density flow plane the settings can be found in table a5 and the fundamental diagrams are shown in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 summary of empirical analysis in test 1 the different sizes of observation window have been set to determine their influences on the outcomes as shown in fig 9 1 cg 1 1 2010 the different lengths of the distance window do not change the numbers of points but the values of those however if we extend the observation time the number of the observation points decreases as shown in fig 9 2 cg 1 2 2010 in different observation windows the value and the number of points change but the shape of the points on each q k u plane is similar a similar conclusion can be obtained when we see the data from 2018 i e fig 9 3 and 4 in test 2 the different periods of time have been chosen cg 2 1 2010 and cg 2 1 2018 show the result from 5 days observation cg 2 2 2010 and cg 2 2 2018 show the outcomes from 7 days by comparing with figs 8 and 10 it can be observed that although the values of the points in each fundamental diagram are different the tendencies of these points are the same on the k u plane the increasing traffic density will reduce the average speed moreover on the k q plane the traffic density has a positive relationship with traffic flow in test 3 the different observation months have been chose as the result shown the values of points in each figure are totally different but the relationships between k u and k q are still the same in test 4 the ais data from another channel beicao channel have been analysed fig 12 1 shows that the fundamental relation between q u k in beicao channel in 2010 and fig 12 2 shows that in 2018 by comparing figs 8 and 12 it can be found that the majority of traffic density in the beicao channel is below 0 5 veh nm which is lower than that in our standard group nancao channel in addition the maximum speed in the beicao channel is higher than that in the nancao channel this is because the beicao channel is only for deep draught ships which are longer and need a longer safety distance between ships besides the higher speed of these ships also requires a bigger gap between them which will make traffic density decrease test 5 shows the observation in various observation windows panel 1 of fig 13 shows the outcomes of different time windows the red points represent the control groups with various time windows and the blue one is the standard group 2 nm 2 h when the time window is shortened more observation points are shown in some windows few or no ships are observed in the window thus there are some points located in the origin k 0 q 0 in panel 1 of fig 13 also in some windows several ship at high speed is found hence some points are located in high position k 2 veh nm q 20 veh h with the time window gets enlarged some points are merged however the linear positive relationships remained the same until the time window increase to 12h only 6 points are showed in the figure that means in this case the size of time windows will influence the number of the observation points in each fundamental diagram but not the shape of the diagram panel 2 of fig 13 shows the outcomes of different observed distance when the distance window becomes longer the value of the observation points changes however the linear relations between density and traffic flow are the same that means the length of the distance window will impact on the value of the points in the fundamental diagram but the relations among fundamental parameters will not be affected from test 1 to test 5 we can see that although the positions of points have been modified in different observation windows and different conditions the envelopes of each figure in each year are similar in density speed k u plane with the increase of the density k the average velocity has a decreased tendency while in the density flow k q plane it shows that the traffic flow has a positive relationship with traffic density 6 2 marine traffic flow greenshields 1934 proposed that the relationship between density and intensity is parabolic fig 14 a and that between density and velocity is linear fig 14 e since the work of greenshields several types of fundamental relationship have been proposed daganzo 1994 proposed a bilinear triangular relationship in the density intensity plane fig 14 b f whereas smulders 1990 constructed a parabolic linear relationship fig 14 c g drake et al 1967 presented a totally non linear fundamental relationship fig 14 d h all these classical traffic flow models are developed for highway traffic flow comparing these models we can find that in density speed plane k u plane the traffic density has a negative relation with traffic average speed in density flow plane k q plane with traffic density increases the traffic flow will reach peak and after that the increase of traffic density will lead to the decrease of traffic flow according to the relationship of k q the states of traffic can be divided into two phases namely free flow and congested flow comparing the density intensity and density velocity planes between highway traffic and maritime traffic we find that the fundamental relationship is similar but still different from our observations we also find the negative relations between traffic density and speed on the k u plane nevertheless the traffic density only has a positive relationship with traffic flow although several points on the k q plane as shown in figs 8 11 infer to the decreasing tendency more observation points will be needed to confirm this tendency 6 2 1 density flow plane the density flow plane k q plane of fig 8 shows that the observed marine traffic flow is in free flow phase in this phase the maritime traffic density intensity relationship is somewhat like the relationship proposed by daganzo 1994 for low values of traffic density the linear relationship between density and intensity is obvious from these low values traffic intensity increases to reach its peak at a density of around 1 0 veh nm fig 8 however the declined tendency is missed fig 15 shows data and regression lines for the density intensity relationship for the nancao channel by utilizing the maritime fundamental relationship data in fig 8 the data on the density intensity plane of fig 15 can be proposed as classical models namely greenshields greenberg underwood and pipes underwood 1961 kang et al 2018 the models and results of regressions are shown in table 2 the density flow relationship of marine traffic is very much similar to the relationship defined by classical models the empirical findings confirm that a vessel moves like free flow traffic however vessel may slow down if she becomes too close to each other and vessels interact with other vessels when ship domains overlap the ship domain theory has been adopted to determine the probability of ship collision with bridge structures iabse 1993 our study provides empirical evidence for a rigorous link between classical models in the highway traffic literature and the ship domain theory in the marine traffic literature 6 2 2 density velocity plane density and velocity have a negative correlation in maritime traffic which is similar to that observed for highway traffic flow various models have been developed to describe the fundamental relationship for highway traffic flow table 3 and fig 16 report the traffic flow according to classical models namely greenshields greenberg underwood and pipes the r squared shows that the classical models cannot fit the data satisfactorily 6 3 handling the errors in ais data since ais data is the data source of this analysis thus the quality of ais data is very critical during the analysis two main sources of errors might occur and they are discussed in the following source 1 the errors in raw ais data ais messages are inevitable containing various errors especially 50 of human inputted information might have errors harati mokhtari et al 2007 the position information is usually relying on gps onboard and this type of data contains three error sources 1 errors in onboard equipment 2 errors due to transmission and 3 errors in storage in receivers since we do not know the real position of the ship at each moment thus this type of errors is difficult to validate however we can filter some obvious errors to clean the data i e a same mmsi name might not appear at different position at the same time the speed of the merchant ship usually is less than 50 knots source 2 during the statistical process some errors might be added firstly the ais signal is missing in a long period of time in which the ship might finish its previous voyage or other unknown activities thus we have split one trajectory into to two provided that the relative distance between two records is exceeding 12 nm much bigger than observing window and the time difference between two neighbouring records exceeding 1200 sec secondly we project the 2 dimensional ship trajectory longitude and latitude of the ship into 1 dimension distance to observe line which contains errors in the highway traffic flow cars are moving within a regular lane and the width of lane contains one car only thus the trajectory of cars is almost the centre line of the lane however in the maritime traffic channel is often wide enough to contain more than one ships and the ship s trajectory might not completely follow the central line of waterways thus when we project the 2d data into 1d some errors are inevitably contained since ais is our only and the best data source it is difficult to calculate the errors rate containing in ais data however we might imply the error rate when we observe some abnormal behaviours such as the shake of ship positions in time space diagram an example is shown in the left panel of fig 17 in which a z shaped path is observed however according to the neighbouring data the ship should sail smoothly this abnormal behaviour might occur owing to the two main reasons discussed previously we use the percentage of position shake to represent the error rate of the collected data in this manuscript if one path in time space diagram contains a z shaped shake we count the while path is abnormal in return the error rate in each month is presented in january and march the error rate is relatively low and the average is approximately 0 2 and 0 3 in february the error is relatively high which is approximately 0 4 to reduce errors and obtain more reliable results we expect some developments on the reliability of ais equipment source i and a better statistical tool that does not need to reduce 2d data into 1 d source ii e g pedestrian traffic flow techniques vanumu et al 2017 7 conclusions the fundamental relationship is the foundation of traffic flow theory and of the macroscopic traffic model therefore the maritime fundamental relationship needs to be considered before developing a maritime traffic flow model here we have quantified the fundamental relationship of maritime traffic flow by using shanghai port ais data we have used the maritime time space diagram with various parameter settings to represent vessel traffic we have performed regressions on the traffic model data to quantify the observed patterns on the density flow plan and on the density velocity plan the results show that marine traffic flow is very similar to highway traffic flow but does not fully fit any existing known fundamental relationships the density intensity relationship of marine traffic is very much similar to the relationship defined by classical models while the density speed relationship seemly not similar to the classical models the difference observed might be due to the difference between highway traffic flow and ship traffic flow for instance the ship traffic does not have physical boundary of lanes and the overtaking is common these differences might result in the discrepancy between the classical models and the ship traffic data such understanding is important to develop a passage planning system in ports to regulate marine traffic in ports yip 2015 modifications in analyses might be needed for the further studies in which we might refer to some achievements in for example pedestrian traffic flow vanumu et al 2017 moreover although we have made substantial effort to eliminate possible bias we expect the further empirical studies on this theme for ship traffic flow will advance to further eliminate bias this study however has several limitations and also suggests opportunities for future investigations first the analysis ignores the variation of the ship sizes as the ship size varies greatly compared with the vehicle in the surface transportation the fundamental diagrams that determined the character of relative motions of ships should be related to a primary quantity second our study does not consider any theoretical fundamental diagram incorporating theoretical analysis may result in deeper understanding of marine traffic flow thirdly a way to reduce the errors in ais data and statistical analysis needs further investigation finally further applications of the fundamental diagram should be explored such as finding the capacity drop point in real traffic flow estimating the maximum capacity of a specific

22645,traffic flow theory has been applied to the study of marine traffic flow and underpins the phenomena being studied this paper is intended to demonstrate the uses of classical fundamental diagrams which are developed previously on the basis of highway traffic by conducting empirical tests on marine traffic data marine traffic data are extracted from the automatic identification system ais from shanghai port in 2010 and 2018 interpolation methods are used to estimate the three primary variables of fundamental diagrams namely flow rate traffic density and local speed the relationships among these three variables are discussed and marine traffic data are further compared and contrasted with classical traffic flow models the importance of the finding is to create consistency predictability and uniformity of uses of fundamental diagrams on marine traffic flow keywords ship traffic fundamental diagram ais data empirical tests shanghai port 1 introduction the traffic flow theory has been recently used to underpin the phenomena of marine traffic flow wen et al 2015 extended the concept of traffic flow complexity to marine traffic flow in terms of traffic density factor and traffic conflict factor they argued the spatial distributions of traffic flow complexity and collision risk are highly correlated kang meng and liu 2018 predicted the capacity of a waterway system by adopting the classical fundamental diagram of traffic flow they used weighted and non weighted least squared approaches to estimate the speed density relationship of marine traffic along the singapore strait they showed that the foundation of marine traffic flow theory is still highly deficient different from kang et al 2018 we are motivated to examine any difference s between marine traffic flow and classical traffic flow models the traffic flow model is the fundamental tool in traffic flow theory for describing understanding and predicting traffic flow in maritime research the microscopic models individual ships are popular but the macroscopic flow model a group of ships has only recently emerged in the maritime literature jensen et al 2013 yip 2013 discussed a mathematical maritime flow model based on classical flow models he proposed an extension of the one dimensional payne model to a two dimensional marine traffic flow model thereby introducing a new way of characterising maritime traffic flow in the marine domain the automatic identification system ais collects a vast amount of near real time traffic data these data record ships behaviour at different moments according to the imo s international maritime organization s regulation in solas the international convention for the safety of life at sea 2000 ais equipment is mandatory for vessels with gross cargo tonnages of 300 tons or more for international voyages for vessels with gross cargo tonnages of 500 tons or more for non international waterways and for all passenger vessels whether in international or non international waters the requirement became effective for ships on 31 december 2004 many researchers apply ais to their research and studies however although many kinds of traffic flow model have been used to describe maritime traffic flow few of them have focused on the fundamental diagrams the characteristics of the real world traffic fundamental relationship in maritime traffic and whether the maritime traffic fundamental diagram is similar to that of highway traffic flow remain unclear these issues are investigated in the remainder of this paper section 2 briefly summarises the traffic flow theory with respect to marine traffic section 3 presents an account of the methodology and explains the procedures of sampling used section 4 examines real world traffic data sources and data pre processing section 5 contains the results of empirical testing section 6 discusses the results section 7 concludes the study 2 literature review 2 1 brief review of traffic flow theory the initial research into the traffic flow model was conducted during the early twentieth century by greenshields 1934 who studied the relationship between distance and velocity known as the fundamental relationship or fundamental diagram after that many types of traffic flow model have been developed to describe traffic flow phenomena generally these investigations are categorised into microscopic models mesoscopic models and macroscopic models van wageningen kessels et al 2014 the characteristics of which are described as follows 2 1 1 microscopic models microscopic models distinguish and trace the individual behaviour of each car including actions such as car following and lane changing microscopic models include a leading vehicle and following vehicles and each following vehicle will adjust its behaviour according to that of the leading vehicle currently car following models can be divided into four subtypes safe distance models gipps 1981 stimulus response models bando et al 1995 action point models wiedemann 1974 and cellular automata models nagel and schreckenberg 1992 as a microscopic model can characterise the simple cooperation between vehicles it is an accepted model type in the marine traffic field in particular maritime car following models have been widely used in china to calculate the capacity of waterways and to simulate traffic zhu and zhang 2009 used a ship following model to calculate the transit capacity of an inland waterway subsequently he et al 2012 improved the ship following model and made it more suitable for marine traffic simulation feng 2013 used a different method a cellar automata marine traffic flow model which can also simulate traffic flow and calculate the transit capacity of waterways 2 1 2 mesoscopic models mesoscopic models describe the aggregate features of vehicle behaviour such as the probability distribution of speed and density compared with micro and macroscopic traffic models the mesoscopic traffic model is the most recently developed type of model and contains three main subtypes headway distribution models buckley 1968 cluster models mahnke and kuhne 2007 and gas kinetic models prigogine 1961 the gas kinetic model is the most commonly used subtype in road traffic studies in the maritime traffic field few models of the gas kinetic subtype have been developed however some characteristics such as arrival distribution headway distribution speed distribution and density distribution have become the main parameters to describe predict and simulate maritime traffic flow hou et al 2014 used vessel speed arrival time and density amongst other parameters to describe traffic flow in the middle reach of the yangtze river including around the cities of hefei wuhan nanchang and changsha other researchers have also used these parameters to predict traffic flow jagerman and altiok 2003 analysed the arrival distribution of ships in sea ports to approximate both the asymptotic probabilities of the number of vessels and the waiting time probabilities these parameters i e vessel speed and arrival time are the essential inputs to all types of traffic simulation models köse et al 2003 2 1 3 macroscopic models in macroscopic traffic models traffic is regarded as a continuum flow such models ignore individual behaviour and focus on aggregated variables such as average density and velocity the most basic macroscopic models were developed by lighthill and whitham 1955a b and richards 1956 referred to as the lwr lighthill whitham richards model subsequently higher order models including cell transmission ctm daganzo 1994 and multi class mc lwr models have been developed as improvements on the lwr model payne 1971 van wageningen kessels et al 2014 micro meso and macro scopic models all have the same basis which is the fundamental relationship between density velocity and flow rate these models are dedicated to reproducing the key phenomena in real world road traffic such as capacity drop hysteresis and scattered fundamental diagrams van wageningen kessels et al 2014 in other words the fundamental diagram is the basis of traffic flow theory 2 2 traffic flow studies in maritime studies recently with the spread of ais equipment more and more ship data become available for ship traffic flow analysis and have attracted numerous researchers working on ship traffic analysis as yip 2013 showed the traffic flow model might benefit better safety management of ship traffic in various studies one popular type of traffic flow analysis dominates and aims at describing the statistical features of the ship traffic in some other studies researchers set a number of observation lines and calculating the number of the ships crossing these observation lines in different locations kasyk and kijewska 2013 xiao et al 2015 then the distributions of ship positions and ship speeds are obtained hou et al 2014 kasyk and kijewska 2013 instead of analysing the traffic flow on the observation lines other studies directly analyse the ship trajectories in a certain water area and identify the patterns of trajectory in the area on the basis of ais data for instance zhou et al 2019 developed a naive bayesian classifier for identifying ship s patterns in the port of rotterdam chen et al 2018 used the ais data to classify vessel motion patterns in the yangtze river these statistical analyses are helpful for simulating traffic flow in the observed areas merrick et al 2005 xu et al 2013 and conducting risk analysis in the observed waterways li et al 2012 although the statistical analysis of ship traffic flow is useful to show the time invariant feature of the traffic flow the dynamics of traffic flow is neglected in fact the ship traffic flow also has time varying features e g density average speed flow all of which are crucial for real time traffic management for instance the vessel traffic control monitors the traffic flow so as to avoid a traffic congestion more real time traffic management in road traffic might refer to qian 2009 in the maritime domain there is a lack of tools to describe the dynamics of ship traffic flow for real time traffic management the development of traffic flow analysis in road traffic has inspired a group of researchers in the maritime domain hongxiang et al 2015 and qi zheng and gang 2017a simulated the ship traffic flow in a waterway by a famous cellular automaton model which is a widely used traffic flow model in road traffic later on qi zheng and gang 2017b incorporated the influence of weather on ships speed in a simulator these studies showed the potential of using the traffic flow theory in ship traffic management these studies in fact contain an assumption that the traffic law developed from the road traffic is readily applicable to ship traffic flow however this assumption has not been carefully tested in the maritime domain that motivates this study to test the fitness of classical traffic flow models in the ship traffic flow kang meng and liu 2018 conducted empirical tests of ship traffic flow in singapore and showed that the relationship between density and speed of ship traffic is similar to the highway traffic models to some extent the coefficient of overall fitness r squired statistics ranges roughly from 0 4 to 0 9 however they did not report other fundamental relationships 3 methodology 3 1 definition of variables to study the fundamental relation the variables of traffic flow need to be first defined greenshields 1934 employed distance between vehicles and velocity as the fundamental parameters since greenshields work the main parameters for traffic flow have become density k the average number of vehicles per unit length of road v e h m velocity u the average vehicle speed per unit length of road m s and intensity q the average number of vehicles per unit time v e h s in the maritime research field a different measurement system exists with the three variables above being defined as follows density k the average number of vessels per unit length of channel v e h n m where nm stands for nautical miles velocity u the average vessel speed per unit length of channel knots or nautical miles per hour where kn denotes knots or nautical miles per hour and intensity q the average number of vessels per unit time v e h h according to these definitions k q and u can be calculated as follows 1 k m x 2 q n t 3 u 1 m i 1 m v i where m is the number of vessels at the observed moment x is the length of observed channel v i is the speed of vessel i in the channel at the observed moment n is the number of vessels passing the line of observation and t is the duration over which the observations were made these three variables have the following relationship 4 q k u 3 2 empirical analysis to calculate the three variables k q and u a time space diagram is used see fig 1 a the time space diagram is an informative representation that illustrates vehicles trajectories in the time space dimension the curves passing through the coordinates illustrate the trajectories of vessels whereby the ordinate value of each point in the curve represents the distance to the channels origin line x and the abscissa value of each point in the curve represents the observed time t the blue arrows in fig 1a tangents of the curves indicate the speed of each vessel when t t 0 the red arrows in fig 1a indicate the speeds of the vessels when they pass the line of observation x x 0 according to equations 1 and 2 x and t are required to calculate density intensity and velocity in practice we need a window of observation as shown in fig 1b to calculate the variables because vessels are dynamic the number of vessels in the channel is changing continuously for a given unit length of channel x in other words m is varying with time set as m t similarly when the line of observation is placed in a different location the number of vessels observed will be different during a given time duration t therefore n varies with distance and is thus set as n x in conclusion the following equations are used to calculate k q and u 5 k m x 1 t t 0 t 0 t m t d t x t 0 t 0 t m t d t x t 6 q n t 1 x x 0 x 0 x n x d x t x 0 x 0 x n x d x x t 7 u q k where m t is the number of vessels in the channel x at time t n x is the number of vessels passing the line of observation x during time t and m t and n x are segmented and discontinuous functions respectively providing that dt and dx are small enough fig 1b m t and n x can be counted the velocity of a ship is lower than that of a car and therefore we select dt 1 s and dx 0 0005 nm in this way the observation window can be split into small slices and m and n can be counted for each slice the detail of calculating algorithm can be found in algorithm 2 algorithm 1 gererate ship flow w r t in given rectangle area area 1 or 2 image 1 algorithm 2 calculation of traffic variables in each observing window image 2 3 3 analysis procedures before the computing of traffic data the study area and total observation duration should be chosen the study area is chosen within the channel in which vessels sail as we will repeat the computing for different groups of k q and u the total observation duration should be long enough for sufficient observations to be made the specific procedures are as follows step 1 extract ais data into trajectory information see fig 2 step 2 choose the study area in the channel of interest where vessels are sailing and the total duration over which observations are made step 3 set the start line in the observed channel the entrance of the studied section step 4 filter the trajectories that are recorded in the observed channel calculate the distance to the start line in the trajectory and record the distance time data see algorithm 1 step 5 utilize the records in step 4 to draw a time space diagram fig 3 step 6 choose the observation window x and t as one sample step 7 calculate one group of values for the variables k q and u based on the procedure outlined in section 3 1 definition of variables see algorithm 2 step 8 repeat step 6 moving the observation window until the pre set total observation duration is reached and step 9 draw the maritime traffic fundamental diagram using the sampled observations 4 data processing 4 1 features of automatic identification system data greenshields 1934 used a camera to record road traffic however ships are much larger than cars which makes it impossible to record ships behaviour using a camera the ais information contains static data such as imo number call sign ship name and maritime mobile service identity mmsi as well as dynamic data such as speed over ground sog course over ground cog position and coordinated universal time utc the refresh rates of this information differ the equipment transmits the static information every 6 min whereas the rate for dynamic information is more complicated for anchoring ships the broadcast rate is 3 min and it increases to 2 s when the ship is sailing at high speed itu 2010 as a result ais data are obtained in near real time at discrete points but the refresh rate is asynchronous to analyse the traffic fundamental relation we need a continuous trajectory therefore the raw ais data first need to be processed noises exist in the ais data and can adversely affect the results of analysis to reduce the noises we have removed some ais data if 1 the same mmsi number appears at different positions in the same timeslot or 2 the change of ship position in two successive timeslots exceeds the practical limit of ship speed e g 50 knots or 3 the speed in the record is too high e g 50 knots the raw ais was collected over the period of 1 january to 31 march 3 months in 2010 and 2018 as the results of 2010 and 2018 are very similar our discussion is based on 2010 mainly 4 2 ships trajectories because an analysis of the traffic fundamental relationship needs only dynamic data ships static information can be ignored the process for creating ais history trajectories is illustrated in fig 2 first to read the ais information the raw data needed to be decoded to decode the ais data we referred to the technical document recommendation itu r m 1371 4 itu 2010 second to simplify the algorithm we removed the pure static record the information that included the dynamic data was transferred to the next step of the process third the mmsi was extracted to search whether each mmsi had appeared previously if yes then a new form was created to record the ship s new position and utc and if no then the new data were added to the relevant mmsi form and the new form was sorted by utc fourth the extracted ais database was updated if the current record was the final record then the process was ended otherwise the process moved to the next record and was continued after this process the ais data were stored in different forms with the mmsi identifying each form and in each form the position data being sorted in order of increasing utc after this the trajectories of ship movements were drawn however as the refresh rates are different these trajectories are still discrete therefore this paper uses a linear interpolation algorithm to increase the resolution of the trajectories 4 3 approach channels to shanghai port to discover the maritime traffic fundamental relation we chose shanghai port one of the busiest ports in the world shanghai port is located at the estuary of the yangtze river therefore the east west directed traffic into and out of the yangtze river and north south directed traffic will cross at the estuary see fig 4 which makes the shanghai port traffic flow complicated there are only two channels through which shanghai port can be approached fig 5 we chose these two channels to observe traffic data 5 empirical analysis to ensure that the maritime fundamental diagram is portrayed correctly we design several tests we evaluate the influence of the different parameters including x and t total observation times observed channels and observation dates on the final results first we define a basic sample group the characteristics of which are given in table 1 fig 6 shows two selected observed areas namely area 1 and area 2 fig 7 shows a time space diagram of the traffic flow in area 1 for the period 5 7 march 2010 5 7 march 2018 fig 8 displays the fundamental relationship as a series of scatterplots with points being calculated based on the parameters set in table 1 fig 8 1 shows the fundamental diagram in 2010 and fig 8 1 shows that in 2018 as these two figure shown with this parameter setting maritime traffic flow has a similar fundamental relationship to that of highway traffic see fig 14 the density velocity relationship is near linear and negatively related however it is not ready to conclude whether these characteristics are a function only of the particular parameters therefore in the following sections we test the effect of different parameter settings on the fundamental relationship 5 1 test 1 the influence of different observation window size in the road traffic flow situation because the speed of traffic evaluation is high the size of the observation window is small e g 1 km and 1 min the size of a ship is much larger than that of a car and the speed is much lower than that of a car therefore we set the standard observation window as 2 nm and 2 h to verify the size of the observation window we test different observation window sizes the size of the observation window for control group 1 1 cg 1 1 is 3 nm and 2 h and that for control group 1 2 cg 1 2 is 2 nm and 4 h the other parameters used for cg 1 1 and cg 1 2 are given in table a1 in the appendix the results are shown in fig 9 fig 9 1 2 show the fundamental diagrams in 2010 and fig 9 3 4 shows the fundamental diagrams in 2018 5 2 test 2 the influence of different total observed time because the observation window for the maritime situation is larger than that for highway traffic we illustrate the effect of different total observed time on the fundamental relationship for control group 2 1 cg 2 1 the total observed time is 5 days and for cg 2 2 is 7 days details are shown in table a2 in the appendix the results are shown in fig 10 in which it can be seen that although the greater number of days of observations provides more samples the patterns of the fundamental diagrams for the two observation durations in the same year are very similar 5 3 test 3 the influence of different observation date maritime traffic should differ between different months therefore we set four control groups with different observation dates cg 3 1 on 1 3 january fig 11 1 fig 11 3 and cg 3 2 on 1 3 february fig 11 2 fig 11 4 details are presented in table a3 5 4 test 4 the influence of different channel traffic flow is likely to differ in different channels for example in shanghai port fig 6 the beicao channel the northern channel is the main channel for deep draught vessels and the depth of the channel is maintained at 10 m after 2010 the maintained depth is 12 5 m whereas the nancao channel the southern channel is for smaller ships liu et al 2014 we chose two areas in these channels for making observations in fig 6 area 1 and area 2 are located in the nancao channel and the beicao channel respectively the settings of these experiments are shown in table a4 and the fundamental diagrams for area 2 are shown in fig 12 5 5 sensitivity test the influence of observation time window to test the influence from the size of observation window different observation period have been chosen in this test therefore we set 5 control groups with different time windows such as 30min 1 h 4 h 6 h and 12 h similarly the distance sensitivity analysis is also investigated the alternative distances are 1 nm 1 5 nm 2 5 nm 3 nm and 3 5 nm since three primary parameters q k u are dependent such that the q is equal to k time u all the results of sensitivity tests are shown in the same plane namely the density flow plane the settings can be found in table a5 and the fundamental diagrams are shown in fig 13 6 discussion 6 1 summary of empirical analysis in test 1 the different sizes of observation window have been set to determine their influences on the outcomes as shown in fig 9 1 cg 1 1 2010 the different lengths of the distance window do not change the numbers of points but the values of those however if we extend the observation time the number of the observation points decreases as shown in fig 9 2 cg 1 2 2010 in different observation windows the value and the number of points change but the shape of the points on each q k u plane is similar a similar conclusion can be obtained when we see the data from 2018 i e fig 9 3 and 4 in test 2 the different periods of time have been chosen cg 2 1 2010 and cg 2 1 2018 show the result from 5 days observation cg 2 2 2010 and cg 2 2 2018 show the outcomes from 7 days by comparing with figs 8 and 10 it can be observed that although the values of the points in each fundamental diagram are different the tendencies of these points are the same on the k u plane the increasing traffic density will reduce the average speed moreover on the k q plane the traffic density has a positive relationship with traffic flow in test 3 the different observation months have been chose as the result shown the values of points in each figure are totally different but the relationships between k u and k q are still the same in test 4 the ais data from another channel beicao channel have been analysed fig 12 1 shows that the fundamental relation between q u k in beicao channel in 2010 and fig 12 2 shows that in 2018 by comparing figs 8 and 12 it can be found that the majority of traffic density in the beicao channel is below 0 5 veh nm which is lower than that in our standard group nancao channel in addition the maximum speed in the beicao channel is higher than that in the nancao channel this is because the beicao channel is only for deep draught ships which are longer and need a longer safety distance between ships besides the higher speed of these ships also requires a bigger gap between them which will make traffic density decrease test 5 shows the observation in various observation windows panel 1 of fig 13 shows the outcomes of different time windows the red points represent the control groups with various time windows and the blue one is the standard group 2 nm 2 h when the time window is shortened more observation points are shown in some windows few or no ships are observed in the window thus there are some points located in the origin k 0 q 0 in panel 1 of fig 13 also in some windows several ship at high speed is found hence some points are located in high position k 2 veh nm q 20 veh h with the time window gets enlarged some points are merged however the linear positive relationships remained the same until the time window increase to 12h only 6 points are showed in the figure that means in this case the size of time windows will influence the number of the observation points in each fundamental diagram but not the shape of the diagram panel 2 of fig 13 shows the outcomes of different observed distance when the distance window becomes longer the value of the observation points changes however the linear relations between density and traffic flow are the same that means the length of the distance window will impact on the value of the points in the fundamental diagram but the relations among fundamental parameters will not be affected from test 1 to test 5 we can see that although the positions of points have been modified in different observation windows and different conditions the envelopes of each figure in each year are similar in density speed k u plane with the increase of the density k the average velocity has a decreased tendency while in the density flow k q plane it shows that the traffic flow has a positive relationship with traffic density 6 2 marine traffic flow greenshields 1934 proposed that the relationship between density and intensity is parabolic fig 14 a and that between density and velocity is linear fig 14 e since the work of greenshields several types of fundamental relationship have been proposed daganzo 1994 proposed a bilinear triangular relationship in the density intensity plane fig 14 b f whereas smulders 1990 constructed a parabolic linear relationship fig 14 c g drake et al 1967 presented a totally non linear fundamental relationship fig 14 d h all these classical traffic flow models are developed for highway traffic flow comparing these models we can find that in density speed plane k u plane the traffic density has a negative relation with traffic average speed in density flow plane k q plane with traffic density increases the traffic flow will reach peak and after that the increase of traffic density will lead to the decrease of traffic flow according to the relationship of k q the states of traffic can be divided into two phases namely free flow and congested flow comparing the density intensity and density velocity planes between highway traffic and maritime traffic we find that the fundamental relationship is similar but still different from our observations we also find the negative relations between traffic density and speed on the k u plane nevertheless the traffic density only has a positive relationship with traffic flow although several points on the k q plane as shown in figs 8 11 infer to the decreasing tendency more observation points will be needed to confirm this tendency 6 2 1 density flow plane the density flow plane k q plane of fig 8 shows that the observed marine traffic flow is in free flow phase in this phase the maritime traffic density intensity relationship is somewhat like the relationship proposed by daganzo 1994 for low values of traffic density the linear relationship between density and intensity is obvious from these low values traffic intensity increases to reach its peak at a density of around 1 0 veh nm fig 8 however the declined tendency is missed fig 15 shows data and regression lines for the density intensity relationship for the nancao channel by utilizing the maritime fundamental relationship data in fig 8 the data on the density intensity plane of fig 15 can be proposed as classical models namely greenshields greenberg underwood and pipes underwood 1961 kang et al 2018 the models and results of regressions are shown in table 2 the density flow relationship of marine traffic is very much similar to the relationship defined by classical models the empirical findings confirm that a vessel moves like free flow traffic however vessel may slow down if she becomes too close to each other and vessels interact with other vessels when ship domains overlap the ship domain theory has been adopted to determine the probability of ship collision with bridge structures iabse 1993 our study provides empirical evidence for a rigorous link between classical models in the highway traffic literature and the ship domain theory in the marine traffic literature 6 2 2 density velocity plane density and velocity have a negative correlation in maritime traffic which is similar to that observed for highway traffic flow various models have been developed to describe the fundamental relationship for highway traffic flow table 3 and fig 16 report the traffic flow according to classical models namely greenshields greenberg underwood and pipes the r squared shows that the classical models cannot fit the data satisfactorily 6 3 handling the errors in ais data since ais data is the data source of this analysis thus the quality of ais data is very critical during the analysis two main sources of errors might occur and they are discussed in the following source 1 the errors in raw ais data ais messages are inevitable containing various errors especially 50 of human inputted information might have errors harati mokhtari et al 2007 the position information is usually relying on gps onboard and this type of data contains three error sources 1 errors in onboard equipment 2 errors due to transmission and 3 errors in storage in receivers since we do not know the real position of the ship at each moment thus this type of errors is difficult to validate however we can filter some obvious errors to clean the data i e a same mmsi name might not appear at different position at the same time the speed of the merchant ship usually is less than 50 knots source 2 during the statistical process some errors might be added firstly the ais signal is missing in a long period of time in which the ship might finish its previous voyage or other unknown activities thus we have split one trajectory into to two provided that the relative distance between two records is exceeding 12 nm much bigger than observing window and the time difference between two neighbouring records exceeding 1200 sec secondly we project the 2 dimensional ship trajectory longitude and latitude of the ship into 1 dimension distance to observe line which contains errors in the highway traffic flow cars are moving within a regular lane and the width of lane contains one car only thus the trajectory of cars is almost the centre line of the lane however in the maritime traffic channel is often wide enough to contain more than one ships and the ship s trajectory might not completely follow the central line of waterways thus when we project the 2d data into 1d some errors are inevitably contained since ais is our only and the best data source it is difficult to calculate the errors rate containing in ais data however we might imply the error rate when we observe some abnormal behaviours such as the shake of ship positions in time space diagram an example is shown in the left panel of fig 17 in which a z shaped path is observed however according to the neighbouring data the ship should sail smoothly this abnormal behaviour might occur owing to the two main reasons discussed previously we use the percentage of position shake to represent the error rate of the collected data in this manuscript if one path in time space diagram contains a z shaped shake we count the while path is abnormal in return the error rate in each month is presented in january and march the error rate is relatively low and the average is approximately 0 2 and 0 3 in february the error is relatively high which is approximately 0 4 to reduce errors and obtain more reliable results we expect some developments on the reliability of ais equipment source i and a better statistical tool that does not need to reduce 2d data into 1 d source ii e g pedestrian traffic flow techniques vanumu et al 2017 7 conclusions the fundamental relationship is the foundation of traffic flow theory and of the macroscopic traffic model therefore the maritime fundamental relationship needs to be considered before developing a maritime traffic flow model here we have quantified the fundamental relationship of maritime traffic flow by using shanghai port ais data we have used the maritime time space diagram with various parameter settings to represent vessel traffic we have performed regressions on the traffic model data to quantify the observed patterns on the density flow plan and on the density velocity plan the results show that marine traffic flow is very similar to highway traffic flow but does not fully fit any existing known fundamental relationships the density intensity relationship of marine traffic is very much similar to the relationship defined by classical models while the density speed relationship seemly not similar to the classical models the difference observed might be due to the difference between highway traffic flow and ship traffic flow for instance the ship traffic does not have physical boundary of lanes and the overtaking is common these differences might result in the discrepancy between the classical models and the ship traffic data such understanding is important to develop a passage planning system in ports to regulate marine traffic in ports yip 2015 modifications in analyses might be needed for the further studies in which we might refer to some achievements in for example pedestrian traffic flow vanumu et al 2017 moreover although we have made substantial effort to eliminate possible bias we expect the further empirical studies on this theme for ship traffic flow will advance to further eliminate bias this study however has several limitations and also suggests opportunities for future investigations first the analysis ignores the variation of the ship sizes as the ship size varies greatly compared with the vehicle in the surface transportation the fundamental diagrams that determined the character of relative motions of ships should be related to a primary quantity second our study does not consider any theoretical fundamental diagram incorporating theoretical analysis may result in deeper understanding of marine traffic flow thirdly a way to reduce the errors in ais data and statistical analysis needs further investigation finally further applications of the fundamental diagram should be explored such as finding the capacity drop point in real traffic flow estimating the maximum capacity of a specific

22646,generally there exists a case wherein a laden service ship approaches a partially loaded very large crude carrier vlcc for cargo transfer this process is called reverse lightering operation the manoeuvrability of these nearly fully loaded ships under interaction loads should be understood for the operation safety in this study we presented at first a practical method to simulate the approach manoeuvre taking the interaction loads estimated by a 3d panel method and other hydrodynamic loads based on experiments into consideration a standard approach manoeuvre of an aframax tanker to a vlcc was simulated and the difference in the behaviour of conventional lightering operation and reverse lightering operation was discussed one result indicated that the service ship might experience difficulty in keeping the heading angle in parallel with the vlcc at the final phase of the approach manoeuvre in the reverse lightering operation this would be caused by the increase of interaction

port due to insufficient water depth a lightering operation is commonly performed in this operation cargoes such as crude oil and petroleum products are transferred from a large ship typically a very large crude carrier vlcc to a small service ship like an aframax tanker conduction of this operation is anticipated to grow as the size of ships continues to increase to take advantage of the huge economies of scale the ship to ship sts transfer guidebook ics and ocimf 2005 describes a common procedure of the operation and contains recommendations on safety it has been widely used and will be important for the years to come on the other hand there exists a case where a laden service ship approaches a larger and partially loaded ship and the cargoes are transferred from the service ship to the larger ship this is called as reverse lightering operation because the nearly fully loaded ships have to move in close proximity a high potential collision risk is of concern therefore the manoeuvrability of these ships along with the interaction loads between them should be understood well for the operation safety although the information paper ocimf 2009 provides the guidelines and considerations applicable to a reverse lightering operation it would be more preferable to discuss the behaviours of these ships during the approach manoeuvre in association with the interaction loads because the sts transfer and the interaction between two ships in close proximity have always been some interesting topics many experimental studies e g vantorre et al 2002 lataire et al 2012 theoretical studies e g yasukawa 2003 xiang et al 2011 and computational fluid dynamics cfd works e g mousaviraad et al 2011 zou and larsson 2013 have been performed in this study we present at first an original practical method to simulate the approach manoeuvre in both lightering and reverse lightering operations it is based on the method suggested by one of the authors yasukawa 2003 and it has the following features the added masses and the non lifting hydrodynamic interaction loads acting on the two ships in close proximity are calculated by a three dimensional boundary element method when solving the motion equations they are updated in each time step according to the relative positional relationship other terms i e resistance manoeuvring loads damping terms due to viscosity propeller thrust and rudder force are assumed not to interact with each other and estimated by a towing tank experiment for each ship the mathematical modelling of these terms follows the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 because of the quick calculation this kind of approach would facilitate simulations and could be regarded as one of practical methods applicable to a simulator after that a standard approach manoeuvre of an aframax tanker to a vlcc is simulated the water depth is deep assuming open sea where adequate sea room is available for operations the manoeuvre is a 3 dof movement i e surge sway and yaw and the steering pattern the resultant heading angle sway velocity and trajectory of each ship during approaching are presented especially the difference in the behaviour of these ships in conventional lightering operation and reverse lightering operation is discussed in association with the difference of the interaction loads the outcome of such a discussion would be useful to understand points to notice for the safe manoeuvring technique 2 manoeuvring motion equations of two ships in close proximity the coordinate systems are shown in fig 1 the right hand and space fixed coordinate system with the xy plane referring to the water surface is defined as o xyz the heading angle of each ship is defined from this x axis g k x s k y s k z s k is the right hand and ship k fixed coordinate system in which the origin is defined at the centre of gravity of the ship k x s k and y s k are each ship s forward and lateral directions since the approach manoeuvre is conducted very slowly without any large movements the significant flow separation would be less likely to happen it signifies potential flow could foam the base flow around the hulls and potential flow based interaction loads would be primarily important from this viewpoint in this study the interaction loads are estimated within the potential flow theory and considered into manoeuvring motion equations as external loads acting on each hull the complete formulations should be referred to yasukawa 2003 and we also explained them in this appendix only essence is described here eq 1 shows the three dimensional motion equations for surge sway and yaw respectively the interaction loads acting on these hulls appear in the right hand side of each equation i e f a i k and f d i k 1 m k u k v k r k f a 1 k f d 1 k f v e 1 k m k v k u k r k f a 2 k f d 2 k f v e 2 k i z k r k f a 3 k f d 3 k f v e 3 k where differential function of time is distinguished by putting a dot above the character f a i k denotes the load term of ship k in the ith 1 surge 2 sway 3 yaw direction related to the total time derivative of the velocity potential and f d i k indicates the load term due to the quasi steady pressure with respect to the square of the velocity potential these interaction loads are originally related to the partial time derivative of the velocity potential in the bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow they result from the phenomenon that the interval of streamlines between these hulls changes as two ships move close time by time causing the asymmetric flow velocity and pressure around each hull as an example f a 2 1 is eventually expressed as follows 2 f a 2 1 l 1 6 u l m 2 l u l m 2 l u l u 3 m 1 l where u l is used as a unified notation representing velocities of two ships l 1 2 6 it has the following relation with each velocity component 3 u l 1 2 3 4 5 6 u 1 v 1 r 1 u 2 v 2 r 2 m jl in eq 2 indicates the added mass and added moment of inertia with respect to the jth force induced by motion of the lth mode for example m 25 indicates the added mass in sway of ship1 due to the sway motion of ship 2 meanwhile m 53 indicates the equivalent term of ship 2 due to the yaw motion of ship 1 we see the interaction loads are integrated into the motion equations through these terms they are calculated by a 3d panel method as a function of the ship position in every time step for the validation of this method we have applied essentially the same method to the case of a ship bank interaction and ship ship interaction and compared to experimental results yasukawa et al 2009 based on the conclusion of this paper the quantitative accuracy was not necessarily sufficient but the qualitative tendency of the interaction loads could be captured by this method f vei k represents the resistance manoeuvring damping loads on the hull due to viscous fluid propeller thrust and rudder force of ship k since every movement during the approach manoeuvre should be minimal for the safety the flow would not separate from the hulls on a large scale and the region of the turbulent flow or wake field would be limited near each body it could suggest us to simply assume that these terms do not severely interact each other during the approach manoeuvre and formulate them based on the standard mmg model e g yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 a series of coefficients required to express each hydrodynamic load needs to be identified by towing tank experiments for each ship they are described in the following chapter 3 towing tank experiment 3 1 subject ships since the combined use of a vlcc and an aframax tanker is standard for ships engaged in sts transfers kvlcc2 force technology and iihr 2008 was selected as the vlcc and an aframax tanker which was designed with reference to lataire et al 2009 was used as the service ship ss the principal dimensions of each ship including the two loading conditions are listed in table 1 the fully loaded vlcc and the ss in ballast condition combination was considered for lightering operation whereas the partially loaded vlcc and the fully laden ss combination was assumed for reverse lightering operation hereinafter the vlcc is labeled as k 1 and the ss as k 2 fig 2 shows the illustration of each operation captive model tests with 1 110 scale ship models were conducted to identify the term f v e i k for the conditions of the full load ss ballast load ss and partially loaded vlcc in the case of full load vlcc most experimental coefficients were available for this study from sano and yasukawa 2008 the experimental ship s speed was set at f r 0 055 fig 3 shows photos of the vlcc and ss models 3 2 measured hydrodynamic loads fig 4 shows the sway force and yaw moment around the midship for the bare hull of the ss in manoeuvring nondimensionalized by using the length and draft of each loading condition of the ss i e y h 2 and n h 2 the superscript means it is the nondimensional value they were measured in the circular motion test cmt with multiple combinations of yaw velocity and drift angle because the component of the rudder force was subtracted from the measured value they show symmetry about the origin meanwhile they still include the inertia term so that the symbol is added to be distinguished from the excluded one it can be seen that the hydrodynamic load in manoeuvring is influenced by the loading condition of the ss especially the nondimensional yaw moment on the bare hull under the full load condition seems significantly different from the ballast condition 4 manoeuvring simulation of the ss since the loading condition of the ss is different between the lightering and reverse lightering operations the basic manoeuvrability of the ss should be investigated first the turning and zigzag simulations were executed simply based on the model scale assuming the interaction terms of f a i k and f d i k to be zero fig 5 shows the 5 turning trajectories and fig 6 shows the time series of heading and rudder angles in 5 5 zigzag manoeuvres such a small steering angle was used for the simulations because a sufficiently small and slow manoeuvre by the small steering of the ss was anticipated during the operation here the values of x y and t were nondimensionalized by using the length of the ss and its initial velocity the turning circle diameter of the full load ss is smaller than that of the ballast condition although it indicates a better turning ability the deterioration of the course keeping performance should be considered further the longer advance for turning signifies the late response to the steering indeed we see the steering response of the full load ss significantly worsens than the ballast condition during zigzag manoeuvres this would concern us about the difficulty in approach manoeuvres of the ss during the reverse lightering operation 5 hydrodynamic interaction loads between two hulls the magnitude of interaction loads which changes according to the positional relationship of the two ships and each loading condition is evaluated by the three dimensional panel method based on potential theory fig 7 shows the panel arrangement of the bare hull of the full load vlcc and the full load ss where each hull surface was divided by 720 panels this number of panels were adopted because the added masses in surge and sway and added moment of inertia in yaw of the same vlcc calculated by the same panel method agreed with the result based on 1320 panels and it also agreed with the result based on motora s empirical charts sano and yasukawa 2019 we define the relative position of the midship of the ss from the midship of the vlcc as x a y a assuming the vlcc and the ss head in the same direction the contours of nondimensional sway force and yaw moment acting on the ss due to the interaction i e f a 2 2 f d 2 2 and f a 3 2 f d 3 2 are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively they were nondimensionalized by the length and the full load draft of the vlcc the relative positions nondimensionalized by the length of the vlcc are taken as the vertical and horizontal axes in these figures the range of the vertical axis is from x a x a l p p 1 0 5 to 0 5 and the left end of the horizontal axis is taken as y a 0 167 corresponding to the diameter of the fender which was assumed as 3 3 m the interpretation of the contour maps is as follows the contour colour represents the magnitude of interaction sway force fig 8 and yaw moment fig 9 experienced by the ss when the ss is located at the relative position from the vlcc indicated by the circle in the left side illustration it is supposed to take the interaction load corresponding to the contour colour at the same position in the contour maps from fig 8 the comparison of the contour maps of these operations show that a significant interaction sway force acts on the ss during the reverse lightering operation the negative sign denotes that the ss takes the attraction force to the vlcc because the counter colour is the darkest near the relative position x a y a 0 0 167 which is the final stage of the approach manoeuvre the ss takes the largest attraction force when the two ships are parallel and run close furthermore in the case of interaction yaw moment in fig 9 the bow out moment which turns the bow outside acts on the ss when its midship is located ahead of the midship of the vlcc meanwhile the bow in moment acts on the ss when it is behind the vlcc it can be clearly seen that the direction of the interaction yaw moment depends on the relative positional relationship in the reverse lightering operation it becomes more significant and the ss would be influenced in the wider area around the vlcc this result indicates that it would be preferable for two ships to run while arranging each midship side by side and come close because the ss could easily maintain the heading angle during the approach manoeuvre due to the small interaction yaw moment 6 approach manoeuvre simulation 6 1 mathematical model manoeuvring motion equations described in chapter 2 were solved to simulate the lightering and reverse lightering operations the terms of f v e i k including the damping force due to the manoeuvre propeller thrust and rudder force were identified by the towing tank experiments chapter 3 meanwhile the terms of f a i k and f d i k as the interaction loads were estimated by the 3d panel method chapter 5 the simulations were simply conducted in model scale and the following discussions were based on nondimensional values hereinafter the length the full load draft and the initial velocity of the vlcc were consistently used for the nondimensionalization 6 2 result and discussion 6 2 1 scenario the sts transfer guide 2005 provides the guidelines for manoeuvring alongside two ships under power it recommends that the port side of the ss approaches and berths to the starboard side of the vlcc and the two ships should preferably travel parallel and at the same speed in this study the following scenario was considered while the vlcc tries to keep the straight course of y y l p p 1 0 at 5 knots the ss tries to come alongside the vlcc with a fender at its hull side and run along the course of y 0 167 the initial position was set at y 140 m or y 0 438 far from the vlcc in the lateral direction the pd control was adopted for steering during the approach manoeuvre based on which the deviation of the heading angle and yaw velocity from the target value i e zero was adjusted in addition the deviation of the lateral distance from the target course was feedback controlled to make the vlcc keep the course i e y 0 1 0 and make the ss run alongside the vlcc i e y 0 2 0 167 the rudder angle of these ships during the approach manoeuvre is given by the following equation 4 δ k g p k ψ k g d k r k g y k y k y 0 k where the nondimensional proportional and differential gains g p k and g d k were fixed at 6 according to eda 1971 who discussed the directional stability and control of ships in restricted channels these gains are called control with high sensitivity derived from the pattern of rudder activity the gain of the deviation of the lateral distance g y k was set at 6 for the steering of the vlcc to enable maintaining the straight course meanwhile it was set as 1 for the ss to enable reducing the excessive change of the ss s heading direction during the approach manoeuvre the propeller revolution of these ships was also adjusted by feedback control to compensate the deviation of the speed from the target speed due to manoeuvres and the deviation of the longitudinal position from the target contact point 6 2 2 trajectory the simulated ship trajectories are shown in fig 10 because the fender was not modelled the approach manoeuvre was suspended if the ss contacted the vlcc when the ships engaged in the reverse lightering operation are controlled by the same steering sense or the same steering controller as the lightering operation we see a longer distance would be required to complete the approach manoeuvre until the contact this is because a larger displacement the inertia force added mass and damping sway force act on the full load ss and the sway motion does not occur earlier therefore it is found that a large sea area would be recommended for the reverse lightering operation the paths of the center of gravity cog of the vlcc are drawn in fig 11 the vlcc which is supposed to maintain a constant course during the operation deviates from the path slightly towards the ss in the reverse lightering operation this is caused by the strong interaction sway force which acts on the vlcc as the attraction force attracting its hull towards the ss and the small sway damping force due to the small draft of the partially loaded vlcc 6 2 3 heading angle and rudder angle the time series graphs of the heading angle and rudder angle during the approach manoeuvre are shown in fig 12 lightering and fig 13 reverse lightering the non dimensional time is taken as the horizontal axis the heading direction of the ss shifts towards the vlcc i e ψ 2 0 at the initial stage to start moving closer to the vlcc although these ships come nearly parallel i e ψ 2 ψ 1 they eventually turn the bow outside each other at the end of the approach i e ψ 1 0 and ψ 2 0 this is caused by the interaction bow out moment the resultant deviation of the heading angle i e the difference in the heading angle between the ss blue line and the vlcc red line seems more significant in the reverse lightering operation this indicates that the parallel contact which is commonly recommended would be more difficult under this operation further the time series of the rudder angle signifies the difficulty in the reverse lightering operation because a large amount of steering would be required during the operation such a large steering in close proximity might impose heavy stresses on the ship operators who are responsible for the safe operation 6 2 4 sway velocity and added mass in order to select proper fenders the kinetic energy at the contact is important because the sway velocity and the amount of added mass as well as the mass are key factors the time series of the sway velocity and nondimensional added mass in sway during each operation are shown in the same figures from the slope of the line of the sway velocity the sway acceleration of the ss in the reverse lightering operation is smaller than that in the lightering operation and it eventually contacts the vlcc at a slower sway speed meanwhile because the vlcc in the reverse lightering operation is attracted due to the large interaction sway force and moves towards the ss the resultant relative sway velocity of the ss at contact does not seem significantly different between these operations from the same figure it is seen that the added mass in sway of the ss and the vlcc i e m 22 and m 55 respectively increases as the ss closely approaches the vlcc in both operations this is the same phenomenon as a bank effect on the added mass for a ship sailing near a bank sano et al 2014 the added mass in sway of the ss at the contact in the reverse lightering operation reaches about three times larger than that in the lightering operation due to the increase of the mass and added mass in sway of the ss the kinetic energy significantly increases in the reverse lightering operation this kind of simulation would be helpful for proper fender selection according to the operation type by evaluating the approach manoeuvre 6 2 5 influence of contact location a scenario when the ss contacts the vlcc with a small deviation from the midship is simulated the contact location of the ss is assumed at the front and back of the midship of the vlcc as δ x 0 1 l p p 1 the time series graphs of the heading and rudder angles are shown in fig 14 lightering and fig 15 reverse lightering it can be seen that the heading direction steering pattern and required time until the contact are influenced by the contact location especially in the case of the vlcc in the reverse lightering operation i e blue lines in fig 15 for example the rudder angle for course keeping of the vlcc increases near δ 1 10 deg steering to the starboard side when they are contacted at δx 0 1 it seems larger than other cases although the steering pattern and resultant manoeuvring movement would change according to the steering controller it signifies that a steering of the vlcc might need to be sensitively adjusted for course keeping corresponding to a slight deviation of the contact location a similar difference in steering between different contact locations is seen in the lightering operation too but the steering angle is not large on the whole fig 14 the ss i e red lines also has a difference in heading angle and steering pattern between different contact locations it seems noticeable in the reverse lightering operation 7 conclusion one of mathematical models to simulate the approach manoeuvre in the lightering and reverse lightering operations was presented as two ships move in close proximity the pattern of streamlines between their hulls changes it causes the plural change such as flow velocity pressure distribution and the resultant interaction loads acting on two ships in the presented method this phenomenon is represented through the change of added mass due to the time dependent velocity potential it is regarded as one of main components of the interaction loads to evaluate the damping loads on the bare hull due to the manoeuvres propeller thrust and rudder force we conducted towing tank experiments for each ship individually and identified experimental coefficients used for the mathematical model this kind of method might be simple but its quick calculation would be preferable for simulation studies and we could expect the applicability to a simulator the magnitude of interaction sway force and yaw moment acting on the ss in both lightering and reverse lightering operations was investigated because it was presented by the contour map depending on the relative position of the ss from the vlcc it might be helpful to understand the area where the manoeuvre of the ss is influenced by the interaction these maps are also available to grasp the area where the vlcc takes the strong interaction as the reaction the differences in the approach manoeuvres of the ss and the vlcc according to the operation type were discussed based on the simulation in which manoeuvring loads based on the experiments were simply scaled up to the actual scale in particular in the case of the reverse lightering operation the following findings were found to be of concern for safe operation a the vlcc was attracted towards the ss due to a strong interaction sway force and resulted in a difficulty in maintaining the constant course b the bows of the ss and the vlcc turned the heading directions outside of each other this might result in the sterns of the ss and the vlcc to be attracted to each other first making a parallel approach difficult c the heading direction and steering pattern of the vlcc and the ss are sensitively influenced by the contact location as one of future works the viscose effect on the interaction loads during the approach maneuver would be interested just for example the thickness of the boundary layer on the hull surface at the side of the gap between hulls might be affected because the flow speed becomes faster and the velocity gradient become higher there it might cause asymmetric friction drag between the port and starboard hull surfaces and the resultant yaw moment might be induced the cfd works would be useful to evaluate them as another work in future the discussion about the water depth effect on the interaction loads or approach manoeuvre would be also interesting acknowledgements the authors

interaction loads between them into consideration yasukawa 2003 since the details can be referred to this reference only the outline is explained in this appendix a 1 boundary value problem to solve interaction loads the coordinate system is referred to fig 1 the perturbation velocity potential due to ship motion φ t x y z needs to fulfill the following boundary conditions a 1 φ n k u k n 1 k v k n 2 k r k n 3 k o n s h k a 2 φ z 0 on z 0 where eq a 1 is the hull surface condition of each ship in which n k represents the outward normal direction and n 1 k n 2 k n 3 k are its vector components with respect to longitudinal lateral and yaw directions of ship k respectively eq a 2 is the rigid wall surface condition which is acceptable because the speed of both vessels is sufficiently small during the approach manoeuvre i e preferably about 5 knots the sts transfer guide 2005 and wave generation could be negligible the boundary condition of sea bottom was omitted here because of deep water according to the form of eq a 1 φ is expressed as follows a 3 φ t x y z l 1 6 u l t φ l t x y z where u l is a unified notation representing velocities of two ships it is defined as eq 3 in which l takes the value from 1 to 6 corresponding to motions of two ships φ l is expressed by intermediation of source strength σ l k as follows a 4 φ l t p k 1 2 s h k σ l k t q g p q d s where s h k means the ship s hull surface and p x y z is a field point and q ξ η ζ is a singular point g p q is green function to fulfill the conditions of eq a 2 and expressed as follows a 5 g p q x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 1 2 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 1 2 eventually the integral equation representing ship hull surface boundary condition of eq a 1 is formulated as follows a 6 k 1 2 s h k σ l k t q g p q n k d s φ l n k solving eq a 6 to identify the source strength every time step φ t x y z or potential flow field is estimated by eq a 3 via eq a 4 thus the interaction load terms f a i k and f d i k can be calculated by integrating the hull pressure given from bernoulli s equation based on ship fixed coordinate system a 2 manoeuvring motion equations the complete motion equations of 2 ships manoeuvring in close

22646,generally there exists a case wherein a laden service ship approaches a partially loaded very large crude carrier vlcc for cargo transfer this process is called reverse lightering operation the manoeuvrability of these nearly fully loaded ships under interaction loads should be understood for the operation safety in this study we presented at first a practical method to simulate the approach manoeuvre taking the interaction loads estimated by a 3d panel method and other hydrodynamic loads based on experiments into consideration a standard approach manoeuvre of an aframax tanker to a vlcc was simulated and the difference in the behaviour of conventional lightering operation and reverse lightering operation was discussed one result indicated that the service ship might experience difficulty in keeping the heading angle in parallel with the vlcc at the final phase of the approach manoeuvre in the reverse lightering operation this would be caused by the increase of interaction

port due to insufficient water depth a lightering operation is commonly performed in this operation cargoes such as crude oil and petroleum products are transferred from a large ship typically a very large crude carrier vlcc to a small service ship like an aframax tanker conduction of this operation is anticipated to grow as the size of ships continues to increase to take advantage of the huge economies of scale the ship to ship sts transfer guidebook ics and ocimf 2005 describes a common procedure of the operation and contains recommendations on safety it has been widely used and will be important for the years to come on the other hand there exists a case where a laden service ship approaches a larger and partially loaded ship and the cargoes are transferred from the service ship to the larger ship this is called as reverse lightering operation because the nearly fully loaded ships have to move in close proximity a high potential collision risk is of concern therefore the manoeuvrability of these ships along with the interaction loads between them should be understood well for the operation safety although the information paper ocimf 2009 provides the guidelines and considerations applicable to a reverse lightering operation it would be more preferable to discuss the behaviours of these ships during the approach manoeuvre in association with the interaction loads because the sts transfer and the interaction between two ships in close proximity have always been some interesting topics many experimental studies e g vantorre et al 2002 lataire et al 2012 theoretical studies e g yasukawa 2003 xiang et al 2011 and computational fluid dynamics cfd works e g mousaviraad et al 2011 zou and larsson 2013 have been performed in this study we present at first an original practical method to simulate the approach manoeuvre in both lightering and reverse lightering operations it is based on the method suggested by one of the authors yasukawa 2003 and it has the following features the added masses and the non lifting hydrodynamic interaction loads acting on the two ships in close proximity are calculated by a three dimensional boundary element method when solving the motion equations they are updated in each time step according to the relative positional relationship other terms i e resistance manoeuvring loads damping terms due to viscosity propeller thrust and rudder force are assumed not to interact with each other and estimated by a towing tank experiment for each ship the mathematical modelling of these terms follows the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 because of the quick calculation this kind of approach would facilitate simulations and could be regarded as one of practical methods applicable to a simulator after that a standard approach manoeuvre of an aframax tanker to a vlcc is simulated the water depth is deep assuming open sea where adequate sea room is available for operations the manoeuvre is a 3 dof movement i e surge sway and yaw and the steering pattern the resultant heading angle sway velocity and trajectory of each ship during approaching are presented especially the difference in the behaviour of these ships in conventional lightering operation and reverse lightering operation is discussed in association with the difference of the interaction loads the outcome of such a discussion would be useful to understand points to notice for the safe manoeuvring technique 2 manoeuvring motion equations of two ships in close proximity the coordinate systems are shown in fig 1 the right hand and space fixed coordinate system with the xy plane referring to the water surface is defined as o xyz the heading angle of each ship is defined from this x axis g k x s k y s k z s k is the right hand and ship k fixed coordinate system in which the origin is defined at the centre of gravity of the ship k x s k and y s k are each ship s forward and lateral directions since the approach manoeuvre is conducted very slowly without any large movements the significant flow separation would be less likely to happen it signifies potential flow could foam the base flow around the hulls and potential flow based interaction loads would be primarily important from this viewpoint in this study the interaction loads are estimated within the potential flow theory and considered into manoeuvring motion equations as external loads acting on each hull the complete formulations should be referred to yasukawa 2003 and we also explained them in this appendix only essence is described here eq 1 shows the three dimensional motion equations for surge sway and yaw respectively the interaction loads acting on these hulls appear in the right hand side of each equation i e f a i k and f d i k 1 m k u k v k r k f a 1 k f d 1 k f v e 1 k m k v k u k r k f a 2 k f d 2 k f v e 2 k i z k r k f a 3 k f d 3 k f v e 3 k where differential function of time is distinguished by putting a dot above the character f a i k denotes the load term of ship k in the ith 1 surge 2 sway 3 yaw direction related to the total time derivative of the velocity potential and f d i k indicates the load term due to the quasi steady pressure with respect to the square of the velocity potential these interaction loads are originally related to the partial time derivative of the velocity potential in the bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow they result from the phenomenon that the interval of streamlines between these hulls changes as two ships move close time by time causing the asymmetric flow velocity and pressure around each hull as an example f a 2 1 is eventually expressed as follows 2 f a 2 1 l 1 6 u l m 2 l u l m 2 l u l u 3 m 1 l where u l is used as a unified notation representing velocities of two ships l 1 2 6 it has the following relation with each velocity component 3 u l 1 2 3 4 5 6 u 1 v 1 r 1 u 2 v 2 r 2 m jl in eq 2 indicates the added mass and added moment of inertia with respect to the jth force induced by motion of the lth mode for example m 25 indicates the added mass in sway of ship1 due to the sway motion of ship 2 meanwhile m 53 indicates the equivalent term of ship 2 due to the yaw motion of ship 1 we see the interaction loads are integrated into the motion equations through these terms they are calculated by a 3d panel method as a function of the ship position in every time step for the validation of this method we have applied essentially the same method to the case of a ship bank interaction and ship ship interaction and compared to experimental results yasukawa et al 2009 based on the conclusion of this paper the quantitative accuracy was not necessarily sufficient but the qualitative tendency of the interaction loads could be captured by this method f vei k represents the resistance manoeuvring damping loads on the hull due to viscous fluid propeller thrust and rudder force of ship k since every movement during the approach manoeuvre should be minimal for the safety the flow would not separate from the hulls on a large scale and the region of the turbulent flow or wake field would be limited near each body it could suggest us to simply assume that these terms do not severely interact each other during the approach manoeuvre and formulate them based on the standard mmg model e g yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 a series of coefficients required to express each hydrodynamic load needs to be identified by towing tank experiments for each ship they are described in the following chapter 3 towing tank experiment 3 1 subject ships since the combined use of a vlcc and an aframax tanker is standard for ships engaged in sts transfers kvlcc2 force technology and iihr 2008 was selected as the vlcc and an aframax tanker which was designed with reference to lataire et al 2009 was used as the service ship ss the principal dimensions of each ship including the two loading conditions are listed in table 1 the fully loaded vlcc and the ss in ballast condition combination was considered for lightering operation whereas the partially loaded vlcc and the fully laden ss combination was assumed for reverse lightering operation hereinafter the vlcc is labeled as k 1 and the ss as k 2 fig 2 shows the illustration of each operation captive model tests with 1 110 scale ship models were conducted to identify the term f v e i k for the conditions of the full load ss ballast load ss and partially loaded vlcc in the case of full load vlcc most experimental coefficients were available for this study from sano and yasukawa 2008 the experimental ship s speed was set at f r 0 055 fig 3 shows photos of the vlcc and ss models 3 2 measured hydrodynamic loads fig 4 shows the sway force and yaw moment around the midship for the bare hull of the ss in manoeuvring nondimensionalized by using the length and draft of each loading condition of the ss i e y h 2 and n h 2 the superscript means it is the nondimensional value they were measured in the circular motion test cmt with multiple combinations of yaw velocity and drift angle because the component of the rudder force was subtracted from the measured value they show symmetry about the origin meanwhile they still include the inertia term so that the symbol is added to be distinguished from the excluded one it can be seen that the hydrodynamic load in manoeuvring is influenced by the loading condition of the ss especially the nondimensional yaw moment on the bare hull under the full load condition seems significantly different from the ballast condition 4 manoeuvring simulation of the ss since the loading condition of the ss is different between the lightering and reverse lightering operations the basic manoeuvrability of the ss should be investigated first the turning and zigzag simulations were executed simply based on the model scale assuming the interaction terms of f a i k and f d i k to be zero fig 5 shows the 5 turning trajectories and fig 6 shows the time series of heading and rudder angles in 5 5 zigzag manoeuvres such a small steering angle was used for the simulations because a sufficiently small and slow manoeuvre by the small steering of the ss was anticipated during the operation here the values of x y and t were nondimensionalized by using the length of the ss and its initial velocity the turning circle diameter of the full load ss is smaller than that of the ballast condition although it indicates a better turning ability the deterioration of the course keeping performance should be considered further the longer advance for turning signifies the late response to the steering indeed we see the steering response of the full load ss significantly worsens than the ballast condition during zigzag manoeuvres this would concern us about the difficulty in approach manoeuvres of the ss during the reverse lightering operation 5 hydrodynamic interaction loads between two hulls the magnitude of interaction loads which changes according to the positional relationship of the two ships and each loading condition is evaluated by the three dimensional panel method based on potential theory fig 7 shows the panel arrangement of the bare hull of the full load vlcc and the full load ss where each hull surface was divided by 720 panels this number of panels were adopted because the added masses in surge and sway and added moment of inertia in yaw of the same vlcc calculated by the same panel method agreed with the result based on 1320 panels and it also agreed with the result based on motora s empirical charts sano and yasukawa 2019 we define the relative position of the midship of the ss from the midship of the vlcc as x a y a assuming the vlcc and the ss head in the same direction the contours of nondimensional sway force and yaw moment acting on the ss due to the interaction i e f a 2 2 f d 2 2 and f a 3 2 f d 3 2 are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively they were nondimensionalized by the length and the full load draft of the vlcc the relative positions nondimensionalized by the length of the vlcc are taken as the vertical and horizontal axes in these figures the range of the vertical axis is from x a x a l p p 1 0 5 to 0 5 and the left end of the horizontal axis is taken as y a 0 167 corresponding to the diameter of the fender which was assumed as 3 3 m the interpretation of the contour maps is as follows the contour colour represents the magnitude of interaction sway force fig 8 and yaw moment fig 9 experienced by the ss when the ss is located at the relative position from the vlcc indicated by the circle in the left side illustration it is supposed to take the interaction load corresponding to the contour colour at the same position in the contour maps from fig 8 the comparison of the contour maps of these operations show that a significant interaction sway force acts on the ss during the reverse lightering operation the negative sign denotes that the ss takes the attraction force to the vlcc because the counter colour is the darkest near the relative position x a y a 0 0 167 which is the final stage of the approach manoeuvre the ss takes the largest attraction force when the two ships are parallel and run close furthermore in the case of interaction yaw moment in fig 9 the bow out moment which turns the bow outside acts on the ss when its midship is located ahead of the midship of the vlcc meanwhile the bow in moment acts on the ss when it is behind the vlcc it can be clearly seen that the direction of the interaction yaw moment depends on the relative positional relationship in the reverse lightering operation it becomes more significant and the ss would be influenced in the wider area around the vlcc this result indicates that it would be preferable for two ships to run while arranging each midship side by side and come close because the ss could easily maintain the heading angle during the approach manoeuvre due to the small interaction yaw moment 6 approach manoeuvre simulation 6 1 mathematical model manoeuvring motion equations described in chapter 2 were solved to simulate the lightering and reverse lightering operations the terms of f v e i k including the damping force due to the manoeuvre propeller thrust and rudder force were identified by the towing tank experiments chapter 3 meanwhile the terms of f a i k and f d i k as the interaction loads were estimated by the 3d panel method chapter 5 the simulations were simply conducted in model scale and the following discussions were based on nondimensional values hereinafter the length the full load draft and the initial velocity of the vlcc were consistently used for the nondimensionalization 6 2 result and discussion 6 2 1 scenario the sts transfer guide 2005 provides the guidelines for manoeuvring alongside two ships under power it recommends that the port side of the ss approaches and berths to the starboard side of the vlcc and the two ships should preferably travel parallel and at the same speed in this study the following scenario was considered while the vlcc tries to keep the straight course of y y l p p 1 0 at 5 knots the ss tries to come alongside the vlcc with a fender at its hull side and run along the course of y 0 167 the initial position was set at y 140 m or y 0 438 far from the vlcc in the lateral direction the pd control was adopted for steering during the approach manoeuvre based on which the deviation of the heading angle and yaw velocity from the target value i e zero was adjusted in addition the deviation of the lateral distance from the target course was feedback controlled to make the vlcc keep the course i e y 0 1 0 and make the ss run alongside the vlcc i e y 0 2 0 167 the rudder angle of these ships during the approach manoeuvre is given by the following equation 4 δ k g p k ψ k g d k r k g y k y k y 0 k where the nondimensional proportional and differential gains g p k and g d k were fixed at 6 according to eda 1971 who discussed the directional stability and control of ships in restricted channels these gains are called control with high sensitivity derived from the pattern of rudder activity the gain of the deviation of the lateral distance g y k was set at 6 for the steering of the vlcc to enable maintaining the straight course meanwhile it was set as 1 for the ss to enable reducing the excessive change of the ss s heading direction during the approach manoeuvre the propeller revolution of these ships was also adjusted by feedback control to compensate the deviation of the speed from the target speed due to manoeuvres and the deviation of the longitudinal position from the target contact point 6 2 2 trajectory the simulated ship trajectories are shown in fig 10 because the fender was not modelled the approach manoeuvre was suspended if the ss contacted the vlcc when the ships engaged in the reverse lightering operation are controlled by the same steering sense or the same steering controller as the lightering operation we see a longer distance would be required to complete the approach manoeuvre until the contact this is because a larger displacement the inertia force added mass and damping sway force act on the full load ss and the sway motion does not occur earlier therefore it is found that a large sea area would be recommended for the reverse lightering operation the paths of the center of gravity cog of the vlcc are drawn in fig 11 the vlcc which is supposed to maintain a constant course during the operation deviates from the path slightly towards the ss in the reverse lightering operation this is caused by the strong interaction sway force which acts on the vlcc as the attraction force attracting its hull towards the ss and the small sway damping force due to the small draft of the partially loaded vlcc 6 2 3 heading angle and rudder angle the time series graphs of the heading angle and rudder angle during the approach manoeuvre are shown in fig 12 lightering and fig 13 reverse lightering the non dimensional time is taken as the horizontal axis the heading direction of the ss shifts towards the vlcc i e ψ 2 0 at the initial stage to start moving closer to the vlcc although these ships come nearly parallel i e ψ 2 ψ 1 they eventually turn the bow outside each other at the end of the approach i e ψ 1 0 and ψ 2 0 this is caused by the interaction bow out moment the resultant deviation of the heading angle i e the difference in the heading angle between the ss blue line and the vlcc red line seems more significant in the reverse lightering operation this indicates that the parallel contact which is commonly recommended would be more difficult under this operation further the time series of the rudder angle signifies the difficulty in the reverse lightering operation because a large amount of steering would be required during the operation such a large steering in close proximity might impose heavy stresses on the ship operators who are responsible for the safe operation 6 2 4 sway velocity and added mass in order to select proper fenders the kinetic energy at the contact is important because the sway velocity and the amount of added mass as well as the mass are key factors the time series of the sway velocity and nondimensional added mass in sway during each operation are shown in the same figures from the slope of the line of the sway velocity the sway acceleration of the ss in the reverse lightering operation is smaller than that in the lightering operation and it eventually contacts the vlcc at a slower sway speed meanwhile because the vlcc in the reverse lightering operation is attracted due to the large interaction sway force and moves towards the ss the resultant relative sway velocity of the ss at contact does not seem significantly different between these operations from the same figure it is seen that the added mass in sway of the ss and the vlcc i e m 22 and m 55 respectively increases as the ss closely approaches the vlcc in both operations this is the same phenomenon as a bank effect on the added mass for a ship sailing near a bank sano et al 2014 the added mass in sway of the ss at the contact in the reverse lightering operation reaches about three times larger than that in the lightering operation due to the increase of the mass and added mass in sway of the ss the kinetic energy significantly increases in the reverse lightering operation this kind of simulation would be helpful for proper fender selection according to the operation type by evaluating the approach manoeuvre 6 2 5 influence of contact location a scenario when the ss contacts the vlcc with a small deviation from the midship is simulated the contact location of the ss is assumed at the front and back of the midship of the vlcc as δ x 0 1 l p p 1 the time series graphs of the heading and rudder angles are shown in fig 14 lightering and fig 15 reverse lightering it can be seen that the heading direction steering pattern and required time until the contact are influenced by the contact location especially in the case of the vlcc in the reverse lightering operation i e blue lines in fig 15 for example the rudder angle for course keeping of the vlcc increases near δ 1 10 deg steering to the starboard side when they are contacted at δx 0 1 it seems larger than other cases although the steering pattern and resultant manoeuvring movement would change according to the steering controller it signifies that a steering of the vlcc might need to be sensitively adjusted for course keeping corresponding to a slight deviation of the contact location a similar difference in steering between different contact locations is seen in the lightering operation too but the steering angle is not large on the whole fig 14 the ss i e red lines also has a difference in heading angle and steering pattern between different contact locations it seems noticeable in the reverse lightering operation 7 conclusion one of mathematical models to simulate the approach manoeuvre in the lightering and reverse lightering operations was presented as two ships move in close proximity the pattern of streamlines between their hulls changes it causes the plural change such as flow velocity pressure distribution and the resultant interaction loads acting on two ships in the presented method this phenomenon is represented through the change of added mass due to the time dependent velocity potential it is regarded as one of main components of the interaction loads to evaluate the damping loads on the bare hull due to the manoeuvres propeller thrust and rudder force we conducted towing tank experiments for each ship individually and identified experimental coefficients used for the mathematical model this kind of method might be simple but its quick calculation would be preferable for simulation studies and we could expect the applicability to a simulator the magnitude of interaction sway force and yaw moment acting on the ss in both lightering and reverse lightering operations was investigated because it was presented by the contour map depending on the relative position of the ss from the vlcc it might be helpful to understand the area where the manoeuvre of the ss is influenced by the interaction these maps are also available to grasp the area where the vlcc takes the strong interaction as the reaction the differences in the approach manoeuvres of the ss and the vlcc according to the operation type were discussed based on the simulation in which manoeuvring loads based on the experiments were simply scaled up to the actual scale in particular in the case of the reverse lightering operation the following findings were found to be of concern for safe operation a the vlcc was attracted towards the ss due to a strong interaction sway force and resulted in a difficulty in maintaining the constant course b the bows of the ss and the vlcc turned the heading directions outside of each other this might result in the sterns of the ss and the vlcc to be attracted to each other first making a parallel approach difficult c the heading direction and steering pattern of the vlcc and the ss are sensitively influenced by the contact location as one of future works the viscose effect on the interaction loads during the approach maneuver would be interested just for example the thickness of the boundary layer on the hull surface at the side of the gap between hulls might be affected because the flow speed becomes faster and the velocity gradient become higher there it might cause asymmetric friction drag between the port and starboard hull surfaces and the resultant yaw moment might be induced the cfd works would be useful to evaluate them as another work in future the discussion about the water depth effect on the interaction loads or approach manoeuvre would be also interesting acknowledgements the authors

authors formulated the boundary value problem for the potential flow field around two ships in close proximity he derived the manoeuvring motion equations of two ships taking the potential flow based interaction loads between them into consideration yasukawa 2003 since the details can be referred to this reference only the outline is explained in this appendix a 1 boundary value problem to solve interaction loads the coordinate system is referred to fig 1 the perturbation velocity potential due to ship motion φ t x y z needs to fulfill the following boundary conditions a 1 φ n k u k n 1 k v k n 2 k r k n 3 k o n s h k a 2 φ z 0 on z 0 where eq a 1 is the hull surface condition of each ship in which n k represents the outward normal direction and n 1 k n 2 k n 3 k are its vector components with respect to longitudinal lateral and yaw directions of ship k respectively eq a 2 is the rigid wall surface condition which is acceptable because the speed of both vessels is sufficiently small during the approach manoeuvre i e preferably about 5 knots the sts transfer guide 2005 and wave generation could be negligible the boundary condition of sea bottom was omitted here because of deep water according to the form of eq a 1 φ is expressed as follows a 3 φ t x y z l 1 6 u l t φ l t x y z where u l is a unified notation representing velocities of two ships it is defined as eq 3 in which l takes the value from 1 to 6 corresponding to motions of two ships φ l is expressed by intermediation of source strength σ l k as follows a 4 φ l t p k 1 2 s h k σ l k t q g p q d s where s h k means the ship s hull surface and p x y z is a field point and q ξ η ζ is a singular point g p q is green function to fulfill the conditions of eq a 2 and expressed as follows a 5 g p q x ξ 2 y η 2 z

solving eq a 6 to identify the source strength every time step φ t x y z or potential flow field is estimated by eq a 3 via eq a 4 thus the interaction load terms f a i k and f d i k can be calculated by integrating the hull pressure given from bernoulli s equation based on ship fixed coordinate system a 2 manoeuvring motion equations the complete motion equations of 2 ships manoeuvring in close

22647,the needing to explore the depths of the sea is currently increasing however human exploration can be compromised due to dangers that divers face at great depths the autonomous underwater vehicle auv has allowed underwater research to make a great stride and avoid human accidents in such situation designing an optimized auv s hull is essential to maximize periods of operation auv s hull must be outfitted to withstand harsh environmental conditions and minimize hydrodynamic drag in this paper a variant of torpedo body is proposed with four degrees of freedom dof and capable of exploring the caribbean sea at great depths computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis and empirical methods are used to investigate the hydrodynamic resistance of the designed hull and estimate the drag employing an optimization process and proving the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm with the profile efficiency analysis the results demonstrate that cfd optimization methods have an influence on drag estimation furthermore this paper shows that main factors impact the auv design are the pressure on its body and the hydrodynamic drag with results obtained based on cfd and empirical estimations it was possible to achieve optimal parameters concerning the protection of internal hardware the buoyancy of the vehicle and minimum drag to reach optimal energy consumption finally the variation made to the typical torpedo body does not increase the drag of the vehicle keywords auv design optimization efficiency 1 introduction the caribbean sea is an extensive area that shelters several marine species and natural wealth the need to explore this area is currently growing however human exploration can be compromised due to dangers that divers face at great depths athié et al 2011 nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles auvs represent a novel and versatile tool for sea exploration in these exploration conditions the risk of human life is imminent auvs are mostly used as tools for data acquisition and ocean mapping bayat et al 2017 damus et al 2002 adhami mirhosseini et al 2014 plueddemannal and stokeylee 2012 still novel researches have reported the incorporation of these vehicles toward monitoring of marine species kondo et al 2014 govindarajan et al 2015 pineda et al 2016 currently the auv is considered as a pioneering alternative in oceanographic marine biological and submarine industry research minimizing human intervention and decreasing accidents as have been shown in hollinger et al 2012 lynch and ellery 2014 choi et al 2015 therefore we propose an auv for monitoring areas with rich species resources in the caribbean sea hence by resorting to the auv human losses are avoided and work periods could be increased however deep sea exploration exhibits severe conditions such as ocean currents high pressure low temperature and absence of energy sources which avoid long periods of work tal ezer et al 2003 hence an auv needs to withstand these extreme environmental conditions through extended periods of operation to achieve that optimal design of the vehicle is necessary pan et al 2015 in recent years the optimization of auv has gained importance for the purpose of minimizing the hydrodynamic drag gao et al 2016 vasudev et al 2014 joung et al 2009 the minimized drag can result in less energy consumption and consequently in long operating periods optimal design of an auv s hull includes optimization of vehicle s hull and drag minimization for a typical auv torpedo body the hull of the vehicle is composed of four main parts namely body nose tail and propulsion unit the body of the vehicle safely enclosures the internal hardware throughout high pressure conditions the propulsion unit provides the vehicle with the ability to move during operation the nose and tail can be designed to minimize the drag and accomplish a hydrodynamic profile of the vehicle computational fluid dynamics has been used extensively to analyze the drag around the vehicle and successful computations of resistance can be found in previous research pan et al 2015 de sousa et al 2014 cfd tools allow the designer to compute better drag estimations and other parameters that are important in an optimized design in the proposed optimization model computer aided geometric definition cagd is integrated with the cfd along with the optimization framework for optimizing a given parameter furthermore using cfd with cagd and an optimization method allows the study of different parametric hull forms and their analysis therefore we propose an optimized torpedo body variation for auv s hull based on the range and energy available in the auv in this paper the drag minimization was performed resorting to cfd tools and empirical methods these approaches were implemented to achieve an auv optimal structure design and thus increasing the fidelity of the optimization model unlike vehicles with typical torpedo body the hull proposed in this document allows the coupling of devices through an external structure this mechanical design makes it easy to assembly and dis assembly the vehicle in any environment without the need for specialized tools this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes a torpedo body variation as a propose for the auv s hull section 3 explains the methodology to obtain the optimal auv s hull based on required characteristics of operating requirements section 4 reports results achieved from the optimization method parameters for the auv s hull and an efficiency analysis based on the range to different velocities finally section 5 provides some final conclusions 2 mechanical design this paper presents the design and drag analysis of an auv with a torpedo body variation designed to explore the caribbean sea unlike the typical torpedo body the hull proposed in this paper has four thrusters that provide mobility in 4 dof the body was divided into four main parts during the design of the auv s hull body 1 nose 2 tail 3 and thrusters distribution 4 as shown in fig 1 a the design of the body nose tail and the thrusters are explained in section 2 1 section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively in table 1 the geometric limitations of the vehicle are shown these limitations are based on the logistics and transportation facilities to the deployment area and the capacity to house internal hardware devices 2 1 body design the proposed vehicle will serve as a tool for exploring hence it is necessary to use video cameras for data collection additionally the vehicle s body must safely enclosure the internal hardware due to high pressure underwater conditions to fulfill these requirements the auv body is composed of a poly tube methyl methacrylate the transparent tube allows image recording using cameras inside the auv s body this has been reported for fishes monitoring naddaf sh et al 2018 the body of the vehicle is sealed using two aluminum caps as is shown in fig 2 underwater connectors embedded in the caps connect internal devices to external ones in addition four rods have been used to connect and fix caps outside the vehicle as shown in fig 3 to avoid the water filtration when fixing aluminum caps to the body of the vehicle second it facilitates the assembly and dis assembly of the auv and it allows handling out of the water in any environment additionally rods can be used as an external structure for fixing external devices or payloads such as forward thrusters and sensors in fig 2 d b is the diameter of the body in m t b is the thickness of the body in m l b is the length of the body in m and l c a p is the length of the cap in m the dimensions of the body are established according to the weight and volume of internal components to guarantee the buoyancy of the vehicle and underwater pressure to guarantee immersions at 100 m 2 2 nose and tail design in this paper the nose and tail design has been based on myring hull profile equations myring 1976 myring equations have been previously used in several projects such as gao et al 2016 de sousa et al 2014 alam et al 2015 de barros et al 2004 zi fan et al 2014 using these equations the drag force to which the auv is subject to can be minimized the myring equations that describes the profile of the nose and tail are given by 1 y n 1 2 d n 1 l n x n l n n n 1 n n 2 y t 1 2 d n 1 l t x t l t n t 1 n t where d n stands for the diameter of the nose in m l n is the length of the nose in m x n is the reference length such that x n 0 l n n n is the shape variation coefficient of the nose l t is the length of the tail in m x t is the reference length such that x t 0 l t and n t is the shape variation coefficient of the tail in order to minimize the drag the method of optimization is designed to calculate the drag for different values of n n and n t using matlab then the n n and n t for minimum drag were chosen 2 3 thrusters location design usual underwater vehicles with torpedo body use a propeller unit for displacement and immersion wang et al 2013 in contrast the auv proposed in this paper has four thrusters two immersion thrusters are located along the auv body two displacement thrusters are located on both sides of the auv s body furthermore a strategic thrusters distribution is proposed the distribution design for the thrusters provides four dof to the auv two dof corresponding to linear movement advance and immersion on x ˆ and z ˆ axes respectively two dof corresponding to angular movement pitch and yaw on y ˆ and z ˆ axes respectively here the position of thrusters is defined by the distances between thrusters and the center of the vehicle it is worth to mention that the position of thrusters has a symmetrical distribution in addition as shown in fig 4 the immersion thrusters are on the x ˆ axis vehicle length while the displacement thrusters are on the y ˆ axis for a better perception in fig 1a the top view of the proposed vehicle is presented in fig 4 distances between thrusters and the center of the vehicle in m are represented by d x and d y on the x ˆ and y ˆ axes respectively where d y d x additionally in order to facilitate surface movement the advance thrusters are located as follows d z x and d z y stand for distances on the z ˆ axis for thrusters attached on the x ˆ and y ˆ axes where d z x d z y the design optimization methodology of the proposed design is described in detail in section 3 3 optimization methodology in order to explore the caribbean sea designing an optimized auv s hull is essential to reduce energy consumption and increase the working range the auv s hull must be outfitted to withstand harsh environmental conditions and minimize hydrodynamic drag by minimizing hydrodynamic drag the energy consumption for vehicle movement decreases resulting in longer operating periods fig 5 shows the flowchart of the optimization framework the empirical calculation of the hydrodynamic drag was done with matlab the cad design was done with solidworks also the toolbox of solidworks flow simulation has been used to run the cfd analysis the work station has an intel xeon cpu es 2609 v3 1 90 ghz with 8 gb of ram and 6 processors the aim of this new framework is to develop an optimized vehicle auv that minimizes the energy consumption furthermore this paper provides a cfd analysis for drag estimation in this sense the optimization process consists of the following steps 1 defining the operation requirements based on project goals reported in section 3 1 2 defining the body section s parameters based on geometric limitations shown in table 1 operating requirements presented in table 2 and the criteria reported in section 3 2 3 performing an optimization of drag by empirical analysis to different values of n n and n t by matlab based on minimizing the objective function described in section 3 3 4 performing the cfd analysis to evaluate the obtained drag described in section 3 4 5 evaluating if the proposed design meets the proposed design limitations in case of non compliance a change of curvature for the nose and or tail is proposed 3 1 operation requirements based on the characteristics of the area to be explored by the auv presented in athié et al 2011 lópez et al 2009 cetina et al 2006 and tal ezer et al 2003 it was established the operation requirements summarized in table 2 the yucatan basin in the caribbean sea close to the chinchorros reef has been reported as a non eddies zone this characteristic is ideal for low displacement auv velocities due to current profiles go from 0 4 up to 0 6 m s richardson 2005 the auv must be able to overcome these speeds and move against the current the body must be able to tolerate the pressure at different depths for this project has been thought of maximum depths of 100 m the operating requirements taken into account for the auv design are shown below namely critical pressure subsection 3 2 1 and buoyancy subsection 3 2 2 3 2 body section parameters calculations 3 2 1 critical pressure criteria the pressure acting on the designed vehicle s body is caused uniquely by its environment sea in extreme conditions with very high environmental pressure the system can implode and damage the internal system the pressure at which failure occurs is known as critical pressure p c in order to protect the internal devices the auv s body has been designed with a critical pressure greater than the pressure with which the vehicle will interact underwater design model parameters for nose body and tail geometric characteristics are shown in table 3 to obtain the value of the critical pressure it is considered a safety factor of 10 the critical pressure in k g f c m 2 is then calculated using equation 3 presented by lorentz and southwell in çengel et al 2006 and plana 1982 3 p c 2 6 e t b d b 5 2 l b d b 0 45 t b d b 1 2 where e stands for the modulus of elasticity t b the thickness of the cylinder in m d b the diameter of the body in m and l b the length of the body in m according to sánchez 2013 at the maximum depth operation shown in table 2 the critical pressure is 11 a t m 3 2 2 buoyancy criteria in order to recover the vehicle in low energy situation or any thrusters operation problem the auv has been designed with buoyancy capability to float up to reach the sea surface and send a the position from the global position system gps to ensure the auv s buoyancy the archimedes principle pickover 2008 is used to design the parameters of the auv the buoyancy of the vehicle in k g f is defined in equation 4 4 b g v a u v ρ s w d m a u v where b stands for the buoyancy in n v a u v the volume of the auv in m 3 ρ s w d the density of the salt water dislodged in k g m 3 m a u v the mass of the vehicle in k g and g is the gravity in m s 2 hence the mass of the on board and payload components need to be taken into account in order to minimize the low energy consumption the buoyancy force suggested for to guarantee the recover of the auv is 1 10 n 3 3 empirical drag estimation a design optimization was carried out to find the optimum curve for nose and tail the objective function for optimum design is the drag matlab is used to calculate optimal values however the equations to calculate of hydrodynamic drag are based on a torpedo body type therefore in this document a torpedo body type is first proposed for the empirical calculation of the drag in addition in order to optimize the energy consumption it is necessary to minimize the hydrodynamic drag the drag opposes the advance of the auv due to the friction between its surface and the water following the definition in myring 1976 the drag d is defined in equation 5 in n 5 d 1 2 ρ v 2 c v s a u v where s a u v stands for the area of the auv s surface in contact with the water in m 2 c v the viscous resistance coefficient v the auv speed in m s and ρ the density of the fluid in k g m 3 as is shown in gillmer and johnson 1982 the viscous coefficient is a function of the drag coefficient on the surface hull c f however as is used in joung et al 2009 to estimate the coefficient of friction drag caused by viscosity the international towing tank conference propose a correlation line which is a commonly used method for estimation of the skin friction component of the auv the correlation line is a function of reynolds number and it can be defined in equation 6 6 c f 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 where r n is the reynolds number the drag coefficient is a function of reynolds number r n the reynolds number is defined in equation 7 7 r n ρ v l a u v μ where l a u v is the length of the vehicle in m and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid in k g m s in order to compute the drag it is necessary to calculate the viscous resistance coefficient c v based on alam et al 2015 three methodologies have been implemented to calculate c v 1 gillmer and

nose n n and the tail n t 3 4 computational fluid dynamics analysis since the introduction of supercomputers in 1980s the use of computational fluid dynamics to analyze the behavior of solids to face the effects of several fluids has increased dramatically cfd is used as a numerical tool in different and varied areas of engineering computational fluid dynamics is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze the behavior of fluid flow through or around objects even though equations that describe the behavior of fluids are well understood since 1930 the complexity in solving them requires a computational power that has only been achieved in recent decades in this project the cfd software package from soldiworks flow simulation has been used to simulate the flow around the hull of the proposed underwater vehicle the advantage of using flow simulation is that the analysis is done on the cad design made in solidworks flow simulation considers laminar and turbulent flows on the one hand laminar flows occur for low values of the reynolds number on the other hand turbulent flows are presented for high values of the reynolds number to predict turbulent flows the navier stokes equations with favre s average are used kunz et al 2000 when using these equations it is necessary to know additional terms such as reynolds tensions therefore to close this system of equations flow simulation uses transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate with the model κ ε the modified turbulence model κ ε with damping functions proposed in lam and bremhorst 1981 describes laminar turbulent and transition flows of homogeneous fluids the turbulence model κ ε is commonly used for engineering simulations due to its robustness and application to a wide range of flows the equations for conservative mass momentum and energy are the fluid mass is conservative the rate of mass flow inside the control volume must be the same to the total variation rate of the fluid mass inside that control volume 12 ρ t ρ u 0 the rate of momentum is equal to all the forces including viscous and normal forces 13 ρ d v d t σ f the energy is conservative energy dissipation is meanly due to viscosity that turns the mechanical energy from the fluid into heat dissipation energy 14 ρ d h d t d p d t k t μ in this work tetrahedral and triangular elements of first and second order have been used for meshing regarding the solution domain soldiworks flow simulation recommends in sobachkin et al 2014 to define the control volume based on the geometry of the solid to be analyzed therefore the dimensions of the control volume are defined as follows width 10 times the diameter of the auv fig 6 b height 5 times the diameter of the auv fig 6a length 12 times the length of the auv fig 6a regarding the environmental conditions different flow rates have been tested between 0 3 m s at constant pressure in order to know the behavior of the vehicle and calculate the hydrodynamic drag in addition this analysis was performed with different profiles of nose and tail to verify that the vehicle chosen as optimal meets the design limitations environmental requirements and offers the minimum drag the results obtained and the design parameters for the optimal design of the auv with torpedo body variation are presented below 3 5 experimental tests in order to get experimental data a towing tank was used towing tank parameters are shown in table 4 the towing tank has limited dimensions and flow speed due to the constrained channel therefore this situation modifies the fluid behavior around the auv in contrast with cfd simulations in fig 7 different views of the towing tank are shown also you can see the structure used to capture data in addition in this image you can see the dimensions of the tank in m m as is shown in fig 8 six different profiles were used in experimental test namely mbv nn125 mbv nn150 mbv nn175 mbv nn200 mbv nt150 and mb nn150 where mbvs are the profiles corresponding to the variations of the missile body represented by mb each profile p i was scaled down to 600 m m length with a diameter of 53 34 m m according with ittc 57 these profiles were printed on a 3d printer and polylactic acid pla was used to print them the characteristics of the 3d printer are print volume is 220 m m x 220 m m x 300 m m it has an extruder of 0 5 m m in diameter the layer height is 0 3 m m and the displacement speed of 60 m m s the combination of these six different profiles makes up seven prototype profiles used in experimental tests in order to carry out the experimental tests in each profile different fluid velocities were considered first the desired flow rate was established after the flow velocity reached a stable state with laminar flow in the channel the studied profile was submerged in the channel and the data acquisition was performed with a psoc cypress data logger as can be seen in fig 9 b data was sensed with the load cell fs2030 and then processed in matlab fs2030 sensor is a low compression force sensor with normalized zero and span for interchangeability and is thermally compensated for changes in zero and span with respect to temperature the seven profile combinations were tested as is shown in fig 9a 4 results in table 5 the boundary conditions in the cfd analysis can be observed the dimensions of the control volume are width 1778 m m height 889 m m and length 23280 m m in order to analyze the behavior of the hydrodynamic drag the velocity of the fluid is configured equivalent to the speed of movement but in an opposite direction to the movement of the auv the drag behavior was analyzed for the velocity set of 0 5 3 m s in addition the turbulence model κ ε has been implemented for values of reynolds number between 1 and 2 regarding dimensions of the vehicle the maximum diameter is 0 1778 m and the length of nose to tail is 1 94 m the analysis was implemented for salt water as fluid with a density of 1024 k g m 3 and pressure of 5 a t m based on the quality criteria in sobachkin et al 2014 the result of the mesh in the nose and tail of the auv can be seen in fig 10 obtaining an average of 650 000 elements with 85 000 elements in contact with the fluid for different study profiles the refinement level scale starts for low refinement values 0 blue at high levels 4 red in addition absence of 0 2 levels in the contour plots indicates an adequate meshing level in order to obtain accurate results in areas of higher fluid incidence a 4 level mesh red was designed at the ends of the proposed vehicle as shown in fig 10 a nose and fig 10 b tail the meshing in the rest of the vehicle was designed level 3 yellow due to computational restrictions of calculation as shown in fig 10 c fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic drag behavior of four nose profiles where purple color corresponds to n n 1 25 the yellow color for n n 1 5 n n 1 75 for the orange color and finally n n 2 is represented in blue color iterations are represented in the abscissa axis while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n four graphs show similar behaviors starting with high drag values the values are minimum at the interval of 60 80 finally drag values are stabilized for iterations greater than 80 therefore calculations converge from iteration 220 on average with the nose profile of n n 1 5 the lowest drag value 17 39 n is obtained for the fluid velocity analysis of 3 m s in contrast with the nose profile of n n 2 the highest value of drag is obtained 18 15 n in fig 12 the drag behavior is shown in relation to velocities on the abscissa axis the velocity is represented in m s while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n the figure shows the behavior of 6 profiles with different nose and tail curvatures dotted lines represent the vehicle profile of a typical missile body while sewed lines represent the vehicle profile with curvature and length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length of 0 24 m curves show similar behavior the graph that shows the greatest drag is missile body with n n 1 25 dotted green line while the graph with the smallest drag is the option n n 1 5 and n t 1 5 but with tile length of 0 24 m yellow solid line the velocity and pressure contours around the auv surfaces are shown in fig 13 a for the n n 2 design and fig 13b for n n 1 5 the velocity around the nose is lower and the pressure profile gray contour increase and remain in higher values as it reaches the stern with respect to b option which pressure profile is clearly smoother in the order of 2 k p a this is due to conservation of energy in steady flow in the relationship between velocity v i and pressure p i there is a change in the fluid contact profile a 1 a 2 that implies for the conservation mass v 1 v 2 and by bernoulli implies p 1 p 2 by immerse properties of this study in fig 13b represents the n n 1 5 and fig 13a represents n n 2 the velocity in the tail tends to zero due to the tail profile from fig 12 the design n n 2 experiences higher pressures from the gray scale leading to higher drag values this conclude that for n n 2 more propulsion energy shall be needed in this sense the optimization analysis in contour profiles match with the above drag profile analysis therefore according to the methodology for the optimization of the objective function the optimal option is the version with n n 1 5 l n 0 18 m n t 1 5 and l t 0 24 m see fig 14 since as can be observed in the graphs of figs 11 and 12 the proposed option obtains less drag and complies with the design limitations established in table 1 4 1 experimental data analysis in fig 15 the experimental tests behavior of the hydrodynamic drag are observed with respect to samples obtained on the abscissa axis samples are shown while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in

length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length different to length nose in the one hand the graph that shows the greatest drag in fig 15a is the missile body with n n 1 50 profile cyan dotted line on the other hand the graph that shows the greatest drag in fig 15b is the missile body variation one with n n 1 50 profile red sewed line while in both fig 15a and b the graph with the smallest drag is the option mv2 nn150 with n n 1 5 and n t 1 5 but with tile length different to nose length yellow solid line which verifies the results obtained in simulations all values for 0 35 m s and 0 60 m m s data has a filtering process in order to evaluate and average value for fig 15a and b average value represents 11 2 less drag than the other profiles in fig 16 the experimental drag behavior is shown in relation to velocities on the abscissa axis the velocity is represented in m s while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n the figure shows the behavior of seven profiles with different nose and tail curvatures dotted lines represent the vehicle profile of a typical missile body while sewed lines represent the vehicle profile with curvature and length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length different to the nose length curves show similar behavior the graph that shows the greatest drag is missile body variations n n 1 5 and n n 1 75 red and blue sewed lines while the graph with the smallest drag is the missile body variation two the n n 1 5 yellow solid line reinforcing the result obtained in simulation using the data from the seven profiles tested we can plot the average drags in this case we were constrained to 1 m s the figure shows that a different velocities the m b v 2 n n 1 50 has the lower values with respect to the other profiles and this tendency increase as the velocity does in phillips et al 2007 hull optimization performance is developed to increase the operative range for auv torpedo using tank tests to validate cfd studies of pressure distribution and drag for different profiles under ittc 57 procedures similar approach is implemented in rattanasiri et al 2014 but in this particular case numerical methods are used for validating results from prediction algorithm but still trying to minimize energy consumption in this paper whole test attain the ittc procedures ittc 2011 turbulence around the 3d printed bodies yields to noise and bouncing phenomena in the compression force sensor this disturbance is clearly shown in the experimental approach drag behavior for the different tests changing the nose profile is represented in the drag tendency however the solid yellow line corresponding to m b v 2 with n n 1 50 and its keep below the 0 9 n 4 2 range and energy efficiency energy consumption considerations have an important impact on the auv design due to battery technologies can not supply a huge energy density therefore the hydrodynamic efficiency plays a main issue in order to have the longest range during the survey duty the relationship between the available power in the battery bank the range of the duty route the auv velocity and payload are expressed in equation 15 15 r e k d p u 3 u 2 where r is the range of the duty route in m e is the battery energy available in joules j k d is the drag coefficient w s 3 m 3 u is the auv velocity in m s p is the energy consumed by the payload bradley et al 2001 by using the information of velocity and range profiles we can detect the maximum range with a specific velocity value afterward we can calculate the efficiency that corresponds with this maximum range value and drag coefficient at 2 m s 1 we have 10 n drag this mean range can be any function just in horizontal plane once the desire depth is achieved the efficiency with lithium ion battery can be improved three times with respect to the polymer electrolyte pefc battery according with hyakudome et al 2002 this fact allows to our design a long range in m due to li ion higher power density by means to reduce the payload low density polymer pla racks were built in to support the li ion batteries in addition with the myring equation optimization the power losses are reduced at low velocity rates conditions with the n n 1 5 profile joung et al 2009 the range improvement by increasing efficiency changes from 6 h r s at half duty cycle propulsion with 2 m s and 27 k m range to 9 5 h r s equivalent to 35 k m range in fig 17 m b v 2 n n 1 5 orange continuous line has the higher performance the efficiency with the above described restrictions and the best hydrodynamic profile increase 22 8 the rage this value is even greater than the reported for a torpedo hull optimization alvarez et al 2009 as a result we have more energy autonomy and longer survey range 5 conclusions this paper presents an optimized variation of torpedo body for an autonomous underwater vehicle capable to explore the caribbean sea the auv design was proposed in order to minimize the drag and optimize the energy consumption according to yucatan caribbean basin current conditions an empirical and cfd tools estimation has been used to minimize the drag as a result we get a nozzle profile with the best performance the cfd analysis has been used as a cost effective process to define the parameters auv s hull the torpedo body variation presented in this project is based in literature similar design for our particular application indeed the structure and external design allows to install external devices such as thrusters and sensors the myring profile increase the mechanical protection against unforeseen impacts due to its geometrical properties but also the material pla has low cost and low density experimental tests carried on according to standard procedures probe that indeed the same best profile selected from cfd analysis attained the expected low drag in experimental results even with the towing tank restrictions due to having a narrow channel the efficiency was increased for this kind of auv torpedo designs by means to consider achieve longer distances with the same energy density supplied by the bank of batteries this energy efficiency is directly linked between the energy payload and the desire range even though the literature includes torpedo profiles tested under air conditions is in a short time perspective to carry on matching analysis with data obtained from sea platform conditions

22647,the needing to explore the depths of the sea is currently increasing however human exploration can be compromised due to dangers that divers face at great depths the autonomous underwater vehicle auv has allowed underwater research to make a great stride and avoid human accidents in such situation designing an optimized auv s hull is essential to maximize periods of operation auv s hull must be outfitted to withstand harsh environmental conditions and minimize hydrodynamic drag in this paper a variant of torpedo body is proposed with four degrees of freedom dof and capable of exploring the caribbean sea at great depths computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis and empirical methods are used to investigate the hydrodynamic resistance of the designed hull and estimate the drag employing an optimization process and proving the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm with the profile efficiency analysis the results demonstrate that cfd optimization methods have an influence on drag estimation furthermore this paper shows that main factors impact the auv design are the pressure on its body and the hydrodynamic drag with results obtained based on cfd and empirical estimations it was possible to achieve optimal parameters concerning the protection of internal hardware the buoyancy of the vehicle and minimum drag to reach optimal energy consumption finally the variation made to the typical torpedo body does not increase the drag of the vehicle keywords auv design optimization efficiency 1 introduction the caribbean sea is an extensive area that shelters several marine species and natural wealth the need to explore this area is currently growing however human exploration can be compromised due to dangers that divers face at great depths athié et al 2011 nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles auvs represent a novel and versatile tool for sea exploration in these exploration conditions the risk of human life is imminent auvs are mostly used as tools for data acquisition and ocean mapping bayat et al 2017 damus et al 2002 adhami mirhosseini et al 2014 plueddemannal and stokeylee 2012 still novel researches have reported the incorporation of these vehicles toward monitoring of marine species kondo et al 2014 govindarajan et al 2015 pineda et al 2016 currently the auv is considered as a pioneering alternative in oceanographic marine biological and submarine industry research minimizing human intervention and decreasing accidents as have been shown in hollinger et al 2012 lynch and ellery 2014 choi et al 2015 therefore we propose an auv for monitoring areas with rich species resources in the caribbean sea hence by resorting to the auv human losses are avoided and work periods could be increased however deep sea exploration exhibits severe conditions such as ocean currents high pressure low temperature and absence of energy sources which avoid long periods of work tal ezer et al 2003 hence an auv needs to withstand these extreme environmental conditions through extended periods of operation to achieve that optimal design of the vehicle is necessary pan et al 2015 in recent years the optimization of auv has gained importance for the purpose of minimizing the hydrodynamic drag gao et al 2016 vasudev et al 2014 joung et al 2009 the minimized drag can result in less energy consumption and consequently in long operating periods optimal design of an auv s hull includes optimization of vehicle s hull and drag minimization for a typical auv torpedo body the hull of the vehicle is composed of four main parts namely body nose tail and propulsion unit the body of the vehicle safely enclosures the internal hardware throughout high pressure conditions the propulsion unit provides the vehicle with the ability to move during operation the nose and tail can be designed to minimize the drag and accomplish a hydrodynamic profile of the vehicle computational fluid dynamics has been used extensively to analyze the drag around the vehicle and successful computations of resistance can be found in previous research pan et al 2015 de sousa et al 2014 cfd tools allow the designer to compute better drag estimations and other parameters that are important in an optimized design in the proposed optimization model computer aided geometric definition cagd is integrated with the cfd along with the optimization framework for optimizing a given parameter furthermore using cfd with cagd and an optimization method allows the study of different parametric hull forms and their analysis therefore we propose an optimized torpedo body variation for auv s hull based on the range and energy available in the auv in this paper the drag minimization was performed resorting to cfd tools and empirical methods these approaches were implemented to achieve an auv optimal structure design and thus increasing the fidelity of the optimization model unlike vehicles with typical torpedo body the hull proposed in this document allows the coupling of devices through an external structure this mechanical design makes it easy to assembly and dis assembly the vehicle in any environment without the need for specialized tools this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes a torpedo body variation as a propose for the auv s hull section 3 explains the methodology to obtain the optimal auv s hull based on required characteristics of operating requirements section 4 reports results achieved from the optimization method parameters for the auv s hull and an efficiency analysis based on the range to different velocities finally section 5 provides some final conclusions 2 mechanical design this paper presents the design and drag analysis of an auv with a torpedo body variation designed to explore the caribbean sea unlike the typical torpedo body the hull proposed in this paper has four thrusters that provide mobility in 4 dof the body was divided into four main parts during the design of the auv s hull body 1 nose 2 tail 3 and thrusters distribution 4 as shown in fig 1 a the design of the body nose tail and the thrusters are explained in section 2 1 section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively in table 1 the geometric limitations of the vehicle are shown these limitations are based on the logistics and transportation facilities to the deployment area and the capacity to house internal hardware devices 2 1 body design the proposed vehicle will serve as a tool for exploring hence it is necessary to use video cameras for data collection additionally the vehicle s body must safely enclosure the internal hardware due to high pressure underwater conditions to fulfill these requirements the auv body is composed of a poly tube methyl methacrylate the transparent tube allows image recording using cameras inside the auv s body this has been reported for fishes monitoring naddaf sh et al 2018 the body of the vehicle is sealed using two aluminum caps as is shown in fig 2 underwater connectors embedded in the caps connect internal devices to external ones in addition four rods have been used to connect and fix caps outside the vehicle as shown in fig 3 to avoid the water filtration when fixing aluminum caps to the body of the vehicle second it facilitates the assembly and dis assembly of the auv and it allows handling out of the water in any environment additionally rods can be used as an external structure for fixing external devices or payloads such as forward thrusters and sensors in fig 2 d b is the diameter of the body in m t b is the thickness of the body in m l b is the length of the body in m and l c a p is the length of the cap in m the dimensions of the body are established according to the weight and volume of internal components to guarantee the buoyancy of the vehicle and underwater pressure to guarantee immersions at 100 m 2 2 nose and tail design in this paper the nose and tail design has been based on myring hull profile equations myring 1976 myring equations have been previously used in several projects such as gao et al 2016 de sousa et al 2014 alam et al 2015 de barros et al 2004 zi fan et al 2014 using these equations the drag force to which the auv is subject to can be minimized the myring equations that describes the profile of the nose and tail are given by 1 y n 1 2 d n 1 l n x n l n n n 1 n n 2 y t 1 2 d n 1 l t x t l t n t 1 n t where d n stands for the diameter of the nose in m l n is the length of the nose in m x n is the reference length such that x n 0 l n n n is the shape variation coefficient of the nose l t is the length of the tail in m x t is the reference length such that x t 0 l t and n t is the shape variation coefficient of the tail in order to minimize the drag the method of optimization is designed to calculate the drag for different values of n n and n t using matlab then the n n and n t for minimum drag were chosen 2 3 thrusters location design usual underwater vehicles with torpedo body use a propeller unit for displacement and immersion wang et al 2013 in contrast the auv proposed in this paper has four thrusters two immersion thrusters are located along the auv body two displacement thrusters are located on both sides of the auv s body furthermore a strategic thrusters distribution is proposed the distribution design for the thrusters provides four dof to the auv two dof corresponding to linear movement advance and immersion on x ˆ and z ˆ axes respectively two dof corresponding to angular movement pitch and yaw on y ˆ and z ˆ axes respectively here the position of thrusters is defined by the distances between thrusters and the center of the vehicle it is worth to mention that the position of thrusters has a symmetrical distribution in addition as shown in fig 4 the immersion thrusters are on the x ˆ axis vehicle length while the displacement thrusters are on the y ˆ axis for a better perception in fig 1a the top view of the proposed vehicle is presented in fig 4 distances between thrusters and the center of the vehicle in m are represented by d x and d y on the x ˆ and y ˆ axes respectively where d y d x additionally in order to facilitate surface movement the advance thrusters are located as follows d z x and d z y stand for distances on the z ˆ axis for thrusters attached on the x ˆ and y ˆ axes where d z x d z y the design optimization methodology of the proposed design is described in detail in section 3 3 optimization methodology in order to explore the caribbean sea designing an optimized auv s hull is essential to reduce energy consumption and increase the working range the auv s hull must be outfitted to withstand harsh environmental conditions and minimize hydrodynamic drag by minimizing hydrodynamic drag the energy consumption for vehicle movement decreases resulting in longer operating periods fig 5 shows the flowchart of the optimization framework the empirical calculation of the hydrodynamic drag was done with matlab the cad design was done with solidworks also the toolbox of solidworks flow simulation has been used to run the cfd analysis the work station has an intel xeon cpu es 2609 v3 1 90 ghz with 8 gb of ram and 6 processors the aim of this new framework is to develop an optimized vehicle auv that minimizes the energy consumption furthermore this paper provides a cfd analysis for drag estimation in this sense the optimization process consists of the following steps 1 defining the operation requirements based on project goals reported in section 3 1 2 defining the body section s parameters based on geometric limitations shown in table 1 operating requirements presented in table 2 and the criteria reported in section 3 2 3 performing an optimization of drag by empirical analysis to different values of n n and n t by matlab based on minimizing the objective function described in section 3 3 4 performing the cfd analysis to evaluate the obtained drag described in section 3 4 5 evaluating if the proposed design meets the proposed design limitations in case of non compliance a change of curvature for the nose and or tail is proposed 3 1 operation requirements based on the characteristics of the area to be explored by the auv presented in athié et al 2011 lópez et al 2009 cetina et al 2006 and tal ezer et al 2003 it was established the operation requirements summarized in table 2 the yucatan basin in the caribbean sea close to the chinchorros reef has been reported as a non eddies zone this characteristic is ideal for low displacement auv velocities due to current profiles go from 0 4 up to 0 6 m s richardson 2005 the auv must be able to overcome these speeds and move against the current the body must be able to tolerate the pressure at different depths for this project has been thought of maximum depths of 100 m the operating requirements taken into account for the auv design are shown below namely critical pressure subsection 3 2 1 and buoyancy subsection 3 2 2 3 2 body section parameters calculations 3 2 1 critical pressure criteria the pressure acting on the designed vehicle s body is caused uniquely by its environment sea in extreme conditions with very high environmental pressure the system can implode and damage the internal system the pressure at which failure occurs is known as critical pressure p c in order to protect the internal devices the auv s body has been designed with a critical pressure greater than the pressure with which the vehicle will interact underwater design model parameters for nose body and tail geometric characteristics are shown in table 3 to obtain the value of the critical pressure it is considered a safety factor of 10 the critical pressure in k g f c m 2 is then calculated using equation 3 presented by lorentz and southwell in çengel et al 2006 and plana 1982 3 p c 2 6 e t b d b 5 2 l b d b 0 45 t b d b 1 2 where e stands for the modulus of elasticity t b the thickness of the cylinder in m d b the diameter of the body in m and l b the length of the body in m according to sánchez 2013 at the maximum depth operation shown in table 2 the critical pressure is 11 a t m 3 2 2 buoyancy criteria in order to recover the vehicle in low energy situation or any thrusters operation problem the auv has been designed with buoyancy capability to float up to reach the sea surface and send a the position from the global position system gps to ensure the auv s buoyancy the archimedes principle pickover 2008 is used to design the parameters of the auv the buoyancy of the vehicle in k g f is defined in equation 4 4 b g v a u v ρ s w d m a u v where b stands for the buoyancy in n v a u v the volume of the auv in m 3 ρ s w d the density of the salt water dislodged in k g m 3 m a u v the mass of the vehicle in k g and g is the gravity in m s 2 hence the mass of the on board and payload components need to be taken into account in order to minimize the low energy consumption the buoyancy force suggested for to guarantee the recover of the auv is 1 10 n 3 3 empirical drag estimation a design optimization was carried out to find the optimum curve for nose and tail the objective function for optimum design is the drag matlab is used to calculate optimal values however the equations to calculate of hydrodynamic drag are based on a torpedo body type therefore in this document a torpedo body type is first proposed for the empirical calculation of the drag in addition in order to optimize the energy consumption it is necessary to minimize the hydrodynamic drag the drag opposes the advance of the auv due to the friction between its surface and the water following the definition in myring 1976 the drag d is defined in equation 5 in n 5 d 1 2 ρ v 2 c v s a u v where s a u v stands for the area of the auv s surface in contact with the water in m 2 c v the viscous resistance coefficient v the auv speed in m s and ρ the density of the fluid in k g m 3 as is shown in gillmer and johnson 1982 the viscous coefficient is a function of the drag coefficient on the surface hull c f however as is used in joung et al 2009 to estimate the coefficient of friction drag caused by viscosity the international towing tank conference propose a correlation line which is a commonly used method for estimation of the skin friction component of the auv the correlation line is a function of reynolds number and it can be defined in equation 6 6 c f 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 where r n is the reynolds number the drag coefficient is a function of reynolds number r n the reynolds number is defined in equation 7 7 r n ρ v l a u v μ where l a u v is the length of the vehicle in m and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid in k g m s in order to compute the drag it is necessary to calculate the viscous resistance coefficient c v based on alam et al 2015 three methodologies have been implemented to calculate c v 1 gillmer and johnson g j method gillmer and johnson 1982 8 c v c f 1 0 5 d m l d m l 3 2 massachusetts institute of technology mit method jackson 1992 9 c v c f 1 1 5 d m l 3 2 7 d m l 3 0 002 c p 0 6 in this method a prismatic coefficient c p is used and defined as shown in equation 10 10 c p v a u v π d m 2 2 l where v a u v is the volume of the vehicle in m 3 and d m is the maximum diameter of the vehicle in m 3 virginia polytechnic institute method martz 2008 11 c v c f 1 0 5 d m l d m l 7 n n n t 2 unlike the g j method this method takes into account the effects caused by the curvature of the nose n n and the tail n t 3 4 computational fluid dynamics analysis since the introduction of supercomputers in 1980s the use of computational fluid dynamics to analyze the behavior of solids to face the effects of several fluids has increased dramatically cfd is used as a numerical tool in different and varied areas of engineering computational fluid dynamics is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze the behavior of fluid flow through or around objects even though equations that describe the behavior of fluids are well understood since 1930 the complexity in solving them requires a computational power that has only been achieved in recent decades in this project the cfd software package from soldiworks flow simulation has been used to simulate the flow around the hull of the proposed underwater vehicle the advantage of using flow simulation is that the analysis is done on the cad design made in solidworks flow simulation considers laminar and turbulent flows on the one hand laminar flows occur for low values of the reynolds number on the other hand turbulent flows are presented for high values of the reynolds number to predict turbulent flows the navier stokes equations with favre s average are used kunz et al 2000 when using these equations it is necessary to know additional terms such as reynolds tensions therefore to close this system of equations flow simulation uses transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate with the model κ ε the modified turbulence model κ ε with damping functions proposed in lam and bremhorst 1981 describes laminar turbulent and transition flows of homogeneous fluids the turbulence model κ ε is commonly used for engineering simulations due to its robustness and application to a wide range of flows the equations for conservative mass momentum and energy are the fluid mass is conservative the rate of mass flow inside the control volume must be the same to the total variation rate of the fluid mass inside that control volume 12 ρ t ρ u 0 the rate of momentum is equal to all the forces including viscous and normal forces 13 ρ d v d t σ f the energy is conservative energy dissipation is meanly due to viscosity that turns the mechanical energy from the fluid into heat dissipation energy 14 ρ d h d t d p d t k t μ in this work tetrahedral and triangular elements of first and second order have been used for meshing regarding the solution domain soldiworks flow simulation recommends in sobachkin et al 2014 to define the control volume based on the geometry of the solid to be analyzed therefore the dimensions of the control volume are defined as follows width 10 times the diameter of the auv fig 6 b height 5 times the diameter of the auv fig 6a length 12 times the length of the auv fig 6a regarding the environmental conditions different flow rates have been tested between 0 3 m s at constant pressure in order to know the behavior of the vehicle and calculate the hydrodynamic drag in addition this analysis was performed with different profiles of nose and tail to verify that the vehicle chosen as optimal meets the design limitations environmental requirements and offers the minimum drag the results obtained and the design parameters for the optimal design of the auv with torpedo body variation are presented below 3 5 experimental tests in order to get experimental data a towing tank was used towing tank parameters are shown in table 4 the towing tank has limited dimensions and flow speed due to the constrained channel therefore this situation modifies the fluid behavior around the auv in contrast with cfd simulations in fig 7 different views of the towing tank are shown also you can see the structure used to capture data in addition in this image you can see the dimensions of the tank in m m as is shown in fig 8 six different profiles were used in experimental test namely mbv nn125 mbv nn150 mbv nn175 mbv nn200 mbv nt150 and mb nn150 where mbvs are the profiles corresponding to the variations of the missile body represented by mb each profile p i was scaled down to 600 m m length with a diameter of 53 34 m m according with ittc 57 these profiles were printed on a 3d printer and polylactic acid pla was used to print them the characteristics of the 3d printer are print volume is 220 m m x 220 m m x 300 m m it has an extruder of 0 5 m m in diameter the layer height is 0 3 m m and the displacement speed of 60 m m s the combination of these six different profiles makes up seven prototype profiles used in experimental tests in order to carry out the experimental tests in each profile different fluid velocities were considered first the desired flow rate was established after the flow velocity reached a stable state with laminar flow in the channel the studied profile was submerged in the channel and the data acquisition was performed with a psoc cypress data logger as can be seen in fig 9 b data was sensed with the load cell fs2030 and then processed in matlab fs2030 sensor is a low compression force sensor with normalized zero and span for interchangeability and is thermally compensated for changes in zero and span with respect to temperature the seven profile combinations were tested as is shown in fig 9a 4 results in table 5 the boundary conditions in the cfd analysis can be observed the dimensions of the control volume are width 1778 m m height 889 m m and length 23280 m m in order to analyze the behavior of the hydrodynamic drag the velocity of the fluid is configured equivalent to the speed of movement but in an opposite direction to the movement of the auv the drag behavior was analyzed for the velocity set of 0 5 3 m s in addition the turbulence model κ ε has been implemented for values of reynolds number between 1 and 2 regarding dimensions of the vehicle the maximum diameter is 0 1778 m and the length of nose to tail is 1 94 m the analysis was implemented for salt water as fluid with a density of 1024 k g m 3 and pressure of 5 a t m based on the quality criteria in sobachkin et al 2014 the result of the mesh in the nose and tail of the auv can be seen in fig 10 obtaining an average of 650 000 elements with 85 000 elements in contact with the fluid for different study profiles the refinement level scale starts for low refinement values 0 blue at high levels 4 red in addition absence of 0 2 levels in the contour plots indicates an adequate meshing level in order to obtain accurate results in areas of higher fluid incidence a 4 level mesh red was designed at the ends of the proposed vehicle as shown in fig 10 a nose and fig 10 b tail the meshing in the rest of the vehicle was designed level 3 yellow due to computational restrictions of calculation as shown in fig 10 c fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic drag behavior of four nose profiles where purple color corresponds to n n 1 25 the yellow color for n n 1 5 n n 1 75 for the orange color and finally n n 2 is represented in blue color iterations are represented in the abscissa axis while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n four graphs show similar behaviors starting with high drag values the values are minimum at the interval of 60 80 finally drag values are stabilized for iterations greater than 80 therefore calculations converge from iteration 220 on average with the nose profile of n n 1 5 the lowest drag value 17 39 n is obtained for the fluid velocity analysis of 3 m s in contrast with the nose profile of n n 2 the highest value of drag is obtained 18 15 n in fig 12 the drag behavior is shown in relation to velocities on the abscissa axis the velocity is represented in m s while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n the figure shows the behavior of 6 profiles with different nose and tail curvatures dotted lines represent the vehicle profile of a typical missile body while sewed lines represent the vehicle profile with curvature and length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length of 0 24 m curves show similar behavior the graph that shows the greatest drag is missile body with n n 1 25 dotted green line while the graph with the smallest drag is the option n n 1 5 and n t 1 5 but with tile length of 0 24 m yellow solid line the velocity and pressure contours around the auv surfaces are shown in fig 13 a for the n n 2 design and fig 13b for n n 1 5 the velocity around the nose is lower and the pressure profile gray contour increase and remain in higher values as it reaches the stern with respect to b option which pressure profile is clearly smoother in the order of 2 k p a this is due to conservation of energy in steady flow in the relationship between velocity v i and pressure p i there is a change in the fluid contact profile a 1 a 2 that implies for the conservation mass v 1 v 2 and by bernoulli implies p 1 p 2 by immerse properties of this study in fig 13b represents the n n 1 5 and fig 13a represents n n 2 the velocity in the tail tends to zero due to the tail profile from fig 12 the design n n 2 experiences higher pressures from the gray scale leading to higher drag values this conclude that for n n 2 more propulsion energy shall be needed in this sense the optimization analysis in contour profiles match with the above drag profile analysis therefore according to the methodology for the optimization of the objective function the optimal option is the version with n n 1 5 l n 0 18 m n t 1 5 and l t 0 24 m see fig 14 since as can be observed in the graphs of figs 11 and 12 the proposed option obtains less drag and complies with the design limitations established in table 1 4 1 experimental data analysis in fig 15 the experimental tests behavior of the hydrodynamic drag are observed with respect to samples obtained on the abscissa axis samples are shown while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in

length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length different to length nose in the one hand the graph that shows the greatest drag in fig 15a is the missile body with n n 1 50 profile cyan dotted line on the other hand the graph that shows the greatest drag in fig 15b is the missile body variation one with n n 1 50 profile red sewed line while in both fig 15a and b the graph with the smallest drag is the option mv2 nn150 with n n 1 5 and n t 1 5 but with tile length different to nose length yellow solid line which verifies the results obtained in simulations all values for 0 35 m s and 0 60 m m s data has a filtering process in order to evaluate and average value for fig 15a and b average value represents 11 2 less drag than the other profiles in fig 16 the experimental drag behavior is shown in relation to velocities on the abscissa axis the velocity is represented in m s while in the ordinate axis the drag is shown in n the figure shows the behavior of seven profiles with different nose and tail curvatures dotted lines represent the vehicle profile of a typical missile body while sewed lines represent the vehicle profile with curvature and length tail equal to nose n n n t and l n l t and solid lines have a fixed tail curvature of n t 1 5 and the fixed tail length different to the nose length curves show similar behavior the graph that shows the greatest drag is missile body variations n n 1 5 and n n 1 75 red and blue sewed lines while the graph with the smallest drag is the missile body variation two the n n 1 5 yellow solid line reinforcing the result obtained in simulation using the data from the seven profiles tested we can plot the average drags in this case we were constrained to 1 m s the figure shows that a different velocities the m b v 2 n n 1 50 has the lower values with respect to the other profiles and this tendency increase as the velocity does in phillips et al 2007 hull optimization performance is developed to increase the operative range for auv torpedo using tank tests to validate cfd studies of pressure distribution and drag for different profiles under ittc 57 procedures similar approach is implemented in rattanasiri et al 2014 but in this particular case numerical methods are used for validating results from prediction algorithm but still trying to minimize energy consumption in this paper whole test attain the ittc procedures ittc 2011 turbulence around the 3d printed bodies yields to noise and bouncing phenomena in the compression force sensor this disturbance is clearly shown in the experimental approach drag behavior for the different tests changing the nose profile is represented in the drag tendency however the solid yellow line corresponding to m b v 2 with n n 1 50 and its keep below the 0 9 n 4 2 range and energy efficiency energy consumption considerations have an important impact on the auv design due to battery technologies can not supply a huge energy density therefore the hydrodynamic efficiency plays a main issue in order to have the longest range during the survey duty the relationship between the available power in the battery bank the range of the duty route the auv velocity and payload are expressed in equation 15 15 r e k d p u 3 u 2 where r is the range of the duty route in m e is the battery energy available in joules j k d is the drag coefficient w s 3 m 3 u is the auv velocity in m s p is the energy consumed by the payload bradley et al 2001 by using the information of velocity and range profiles we can detect the maximum range with a specific velocity value afterward we can calculate the efficiency that corresponds with this maximum range value and drag coefficient at 2 m s 1 we have 10 n drag this mean range can be any function just in horizontal plane once the desire depth is achieved the efficiency with lithium ion battery can be improved three times with respect to the polymer electrolyte pefc battery according with hyakudome et al 2002 this fact allows to our design a long range in m due to li ion higher power density by means to reduce the payload low density polymer pla racks were built in to support the li ion batteries in addition with the myring equation optimization the power losses are reduced at low velocity rates conditions with the n n 1 5 profile joung et al 2009 the range improvement by increasing efficiency changes from 6 h r s at half duty cycle propulsion with 2 m s and 27 k m range to 9 5 h r s equivalent to 35 k m range in fig 17 m b v 2 n n 1 5 orange continuous line has the higher performance the efficiency with the above described restrictions and the best hydrodynamic profile increase 22 8 the rage this value is even greater than the reported for a torpedo hull optimization alvarez et al 2009 as a result we have more energy autonomy and longer survey range 5 conclusions this paper presents an optimized variation of torpedo body for an autonomous underwater vehicle capable to explore the caribbean sea the auv design was proposed in order to minimize the drag and optimize the energy consumption according to yucatan caribbean basin current conditions an empirical and cfd tools estimation has been used to minimize the drag as a result we get a nozzle profile with the best performance the cfd analysis has been used as a cost effective process to define the parameters auv s hull the torpedo body variation presented in this project is based in literature similar design for our particular application indeed the structure and external design allows to install external devices such as thrusters and sensors the myring profile increase the mechanical protection against unforeseen impacts due to its geometrical properties but also the material pla has low cost and low density experimental tests carried on according to standard procedures probe that indeed the same best profile selected from cfd analysis attained the expected low drag in experimental results even with the towing tank restrictions due to having a narrow channel the efficiency was increased for this kind of auv torpedo designs by means to consider achieve longer distances with the same energy density supplied by the bank of batteries this energy efficiency is directly linked between the energy payload and the desire range even though the literature includes torpedo profiles tested under air conditions is in a short time perspective to carry on matching analysis with data obtained from sea platform conditions

22648,the blade tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation is a concern for hydraulic machineries the underlying mechanism of the tlv cavitation is complex due to the interactions between the vortical flow and cavities leading to the necessity of improving the numerical methods in consideration of the influence of the angular momentum on the vortex cavitation the zwart s cavitation model is improved by adjusting the condensation coefficient based on the vortex intensity the modified cavitation model is used to investigate the tlv cavitation from a waterjet pump the energy characteristics of this pump and the cavitation phenomena near the blade tip are validated by the referenced experiment the blade tip leakage flow and the tlv cavitation features are revealed by present simulation under different cavitation conditions it can be found that both the tlv and its cavitation reduce the leakage flow rate through the rotor tip according to the analysis of the pressure fluctuation characteristics it shows that the tlv cavitation especially its terminal region enhances the pressure pulsation with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficients the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation is increasing and the corresponding positions with the maximum pulsation migrate to the downstream keywords tip leakage vortex cavitation pressure pulsation waterjet pump numerical

utilization of the ocean božić and benišek 2016 luo et al 2015 cao et al 2017 bhattacharyya et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the existence of the blade tip clearance is necessary to avoid rubbing between the rotating and resting parts while the tip leakage flow through the clearance is inevitable accompanied by the energy loss and efficiency penalty booth et al 1982 moreover the multiple secondary flows and vortex structures may raise lots of problems in these rotors langston 2001 a serious problem is the vortex cavitation which can reduce the power output for turbines lead to a drop in head for pumps and cause the performance breakdown noise and vibration arndt 2002 the tip leakage vortex tlv formed by the interaction of the clearance flow with the through flow is prone to induce the vortex cavitation near the tip clearance farrell and billet 1994 experiment researches on single hydrofoil can be used as a simplified case to investigate the tlv cavitation murayama et al 2006 dreyer et al 2014 but the relative motion between the outer casing and blade in a real rotor is hard to be covered by a stationary hydrofoil although the twisted blade and various vortices make the experiment in a rotor passage difficult many researchers do a lot of effort to measure the tlv flow and its cavitation aeschlimann et al 2013 lemay et al 2015 tan et al 2012 moreover the numerical simulation

and the dynamic pressure fluctuation are studied bai et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 kim et al 2019 liu et al 2017 base on the computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis many computer based commercial softwares like the ansys fluent and cfx ansys fluentansys cfx pumplinx pumplinx and star ccm star ccm are adopted for practical engineering calculations to ensure the effectiveness in solving cavitation problems in engineering the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a turbulence model and a cavitation model are general solved among the various widely used statistical turbulence models the k ω based shear stress transport sst model shows advantages on capturing the global features of the tlv in single phase flow calculations decaix et al 2015 guo et al 2016 for the cavitating flow calculations the original sst model with a rotation curvature correction cc could increase the prediction accuracy of the tlv cavitation guo et al 2018 this sst cc model has also been performed in the simulation of rotating machinery and it could get more accurate simulation results in most examples smirnov and menter 2009 tao et al 2014 the common cavitation models are mainly based on the homogeneous fluid approach and the mass transfer between the liquid and vapor is usually controlled by a transport equation in which some coefficients relying on experience will affect the simulated cavitating flow considering the effects of the rotary vortex motion on the cavity guo et al 2018 have calibrated the empirical coefficients in zwart s cavitation model and the modified vortex cavitation model could significantly improve the prediction of the tlv cavitation in order to analysis the tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor the above mentioned sst cc turbulence model and the modified vortex cavitation model will be used in present simulation the description for the numerical setup is shown in the following section 2 the objective of this paper is to investigate the cavitating tlv characteristics by the numerical method a referenced experiment for an axial waterjet pump is used to validate the simulation results the comparisons with the experiment are described in section 3 followed by the detailed analysis of the tlv features on different cavitating conditions in addition the effects of the cavitation on the vorticity and the pressure fluctuation characteristics are discussed finally section 4 shows the conclusions in present work 2 numerical simulation 2 1 computational case an axial waterjet pump axwj 2 was measured in chesnakas et al s experiment chesnakas et al 2009 and its powering and cavitation performance was obtained according to the experimental apparatus the computational domain is established as shown in fig 1 both the inlet and rotor casing diameter d is 304 8 mm and the rotor tip gap is about 0 5 mm the exit section has a diameter of 0 7d there are 6 and 8 blades in the rotor and stator configuration respectively during the performance testing the inflow and outflow information was measured between station a and station b set the coordinate system s origin in front of the rotor the two stations are about 0 3d and 1 4d away from the zero in z axis direction some extensions for the inlet and outlet are made to reduce the interference of the boundaries and the total length of the computational domain is about 3d along z axis some non dimensional parameters are used to describe the operating conditions the flow coefficient q the head coefficient h and the power coefficient p are defined as 1 q q v n d 3 2 h p t b p t a ρ n d 2 3 p 2 π n t r ρ n 3 d 5 where n is the revolutions per second calculated from the rotating speed of 2000 r min d is the inlet diameter ρ is the

by 4 η q h p in the powering performance experiment the peak efficiency of 89 occurred at q 0 76 the cavitating conditions are determined by the cavitation coefficient n 5 n p t a p v ρ n d 2 where the p v is the vapor pressure of water the drop in torque is measured directly in the experiment and the headrise represented as h is a calculated quantity 2 2 turbulence model the present work is carried out in ansys cfx software to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the averaging procedure introduces additional unknown terms called turbulent stresses according to introducing an eddy viscosity to mimic the effect of turbulence many eddy viscosity models have been built and widely used for simulating the industrial flows however one weakness of the eddy viscosity models is that they are insensitive to the streamline curvature and system rotation which are just important features in the swirling and rotating flows smirnov and menter 2009 used a modified function f r1 to control the production p k terms of the original k ω sst model and provided the sst cc model the modified transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent frequency ω are shown as follows 6 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k f r 1 β ρ k ω x j μ e f k x j 7 ρ ω t ρ u j ω x j α ρ p k μ t f r 1 d ω c d ω x j μ e f ω x j except for some empirical constants ρ is the density t is the time u j u v w is the velocity x j x y z is the position μ ef is about viscosity the terms d ω and d ω are related to the turbulent frequency ω and its derivative the f r1 is from a function f rotation suggested by spalart and shur 1997 with slight modification to maintain a numerical stability 8 f rotation 1 c r 1 2 r 1 r 1 c r 3 tan 1 c r 2 r c r 1 9 f r 1 max min f rotation 1 25 0 0 where the r and r are related to the strain rate tensor s and rotation rate tensor ω and the empirical constants are c r1 1 0 c r2 2 0 c r3 1 0 this curvature correction cc is available in cfx pre and the sst cc model is implemented in present simulation 2 3 cavitation model the homogeneous fluid approach which is assumed that each phase shares the turbulence flow field is widely used in the multiphase flow simulation using the simplified rayleigh plesset equation to describe the growth of vapor bubble in liquid zwart et al 2004 derived the total interphase mass transfer rate s l v due to cavitation per unit volume with the following form 10 s l v f v a p 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r n u c 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v f c o n d 3 α v ρ v r n u c 2 3 p p v ρ l if p p v where the subscripts v l and nuc represent the vapor liquid and nucleation site respectively α is the volume fraction r nuc is the radius of nucleation site f vap and f cond are empirical calibration coefficients to control the phase change rate vaporization and condensation in zwart s cavitation model these parameters have been found to work well for a variety of fluids and devices with r nuc 1 10 6 m α nuc 5 10 4 f vap 50 and f cond 0 01 but they are also need to be calibrated according to some specific cavitation problems zwart et al 2004 morgut and nobile 2012 liu et al 2014 in view of the underlying mechanism of the vortex cavitation guo et al 2018 has modified the zwart s cavitation model by building a relationship between the condensation coefficient f cond and the vortex features the high level of vorticity delays the collapse of cavity in vortex region and this influence can be reflected by controlling the condensation process with a lower f cond an appropriate reduction for f cond could extend the cavitating vortex region and it has promoted the solution of the problem that the predicting vortex cavitation is shorter or smaller with the default cavitation model used a variable f came from equation 8 is used to reflect the vortex intensity with the expression of 11 f 2 r 1 r where r is the ratio of the strain rate tensor and the rotation rate tensor with r s ω a reduction factor c fc was used as a multiplier of the traditional f cond to modify the zwart s cavitation model the variation curve for c fc f cond with the vortex identification criterion f is shown in fig 2 within the tlv region the rotation dominates the local flow and the larger ω than s is corresponding to the range of 0 1 for both r and f the smaller f represents a stronger vortex and a much lower f cond is needed based on much calibration experience and a specific case of cavitating tlv in a referenced hydrofoil experiment dreyer et al 2014 the variation curve in fig 2 is semi empirical built and the corresponding expression for c fc is 12 c f c 0 01 if f 0 6 34 58 f 3 71 63 f 2 49 29 f 11 25 if 0 6 f 1 1 if f 1 the lower limit for f cond is set as one percent of the default value in the range of f 1 the original value for f cond is enough after a serious of comparison a 3rd order polynomial is used to describe the transition of c fc from 0 01 to 1 this modification reflect the relationship between vorticity and cavity life on the one hand the low static pressure in vortex is conducive to the existence of cavitation on the other hand the high level of vorticity can be sustained only by lower static pressure in vortex core and the stronger vortex is more stable due to the conservation of angular momentum it has improved the prediction accuracy for tlv cavitation and the detailed derivation and demonstrate procedures are shown in reference guo et al 2018 this modified cavitation model could be embedded into the cfx software by cfx expression language cel and used in present simulation 2 4 mesh generation and validation the solutions are computed by ansys cfx software using an element based finite volume method which first involves discretizing the spatial domain using a mesh the whole computational domain is divided into four parts to generate the mesh the cylindrical inflow and outflow parts adopt the unstructured tetrahedral grid with a mesh refinement on the sidewalls a structured hexahedral mesh is used for the rotor and stator passages and the fine grid is employed near the rotor tip the local mesh for some parts is displayed in fig 3 the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 is recommended for discretization error estimation which has been evaluated over several hundred cfd cases including the simulation of cavitating tlv flow around a hydrofoil cheng et al 2018 using gci method only three significantly different sets of grids are needed to determine some key variables φ in a simulation in present case the pump performance parameters h p and η are treated as key variables and the mesh count of 1 41 3 29 and 8 33 million are generated the coarse medium and fine meshes are corresponding to three sets of grids with the subscript of 1 2 and 3 and the simulation results can be got as φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 based on richardson extrapolation richardson and gaunt 1927 an extrapolated value of φ ext can be solved by iteration on the non cavitating condition of q 0 76 the calculation of discretization error is shown in table 1 both the extrapolated relative error e ext and the fine grid convergence index gcifine are lower than 3 in addition the mesh near the blade tip is validated by comparing the minimum pressure at several locations along tlv the corresponding gcifine for the pressure values are also less than 3 based on this numerical uncertainty analysis the fine grid solution is determined as 8 33 million for the total number of grid cells the rotor tip clearance contains 50 nodes in the span wise direction the wall function is used to solve the near wall flow and the averaged value for y is about 30 on the blade surface and casing wall the gci method is employed to evaluate the mesh resolution near the best efficiency point bep with q 0 76 on the non cavitating condition the pump performance curve is got by the simulation and compared with the referenced experiment result in fig 4 overall the numerical simulation reflects the energy performance of this pump especially at the bep and design condition q 0 85 2 5 boundary conditions and numerical solution method referring to the values of n and q determined by the experiment a total pressure on the inlet and a mass flow rate on the outlet are set as the boundary conditions by equations 5 and 1 the default level of 5 is used as the inlet turbulence intensity the rotor domain has a revolving speed of 2000r min and it connects with the other stationary parts through the interface models these interfaces are set as the frozen rotor type in the steady state calculation which is performed for the mesh validation and to provide the initial flow field for the cavitating simulation then the unsteady solutions with different cavitation coefficients are carried out and the transient rotor stator type is set for these interfaces wherein the sliding mesh technique is enabled the no slip wall is set on all physical surfaces of the pump the sensitivities of the transient simulation results to the time steps has been evaluated by three cases among t 180 t 360 and t 720 where t is the rotational period of rotor in consideration of the computational accuracy and efficiency the t 360 about 8 33 10 5s is selected to track the flow revolution and the root mean square rms residual level of 1 10 4 for pressure and velocity is the convergence criterion the pressure pulsation analysis results have been compared within different sampling time between 4t to 7t it is found that the pressure pulsation information tends to be stable when the sample time is larger than 6t so the averaged flow field and the pressure fluctuation are analysed by the simulated results within 6t the second order backward euler scheme is used for the transient runs the high resolution scheme is chosen for both the advection scheme and turbulence numeric 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons with the experimental results near the design flow rate of q 0 85 the cavitation performance of the pump was measured at q 0 83 with different cavitation coefficients and the corresponding cavitation images adapted from the experiment are shown on four conditions in fig 5 with the decreasing of n the cavitation phenomenon firstly appears at the blade tip on condition a and then the cavitating tlv becomes visible from condition b the enlargement of the cavitation region leads to the drop off for the efficiency curve especially when the n is lower than 1 2 meanwhile a wedge shaped cavitation region is formed on condition d in the simulated results the pump efficiency η can be calculated by equation 4 and fig 5 shows that the simulation results reveal the effect of cavitation number on the efficiency curve as the cavity is made up of vapor and water fig 6 shows the distribution of the vapor fraction α v near the blade tip on condition d these contours are displayed on two spanwise sections which are some cylindrical surfaces in this case respectively where r is the local radius and r is the radius of the rotor casing in fig 6 a the section is located inside the rotor tip gap and the contour shows a wedge shaped cavitation region forming a 74 degree angle with the axial direction in fact the referenced experiment has revealed that this angle would be constant with the further decline of n the volume fraction of vapor is around 0 1 0 6 within the cavity and the value of α v is a little higher in the end of the cavitation region in fig 6 b the location of the section is slightly inward from the tip so the blank areas represent the part of blades it can be seen that the tlv cavitation is separated from the cavitation region on the blade surface and it seems that these two kinds of cavitation region determine the wedge shape outline for the sheet cavitation along the casing in fig 6 a a higher vapor fraction appears near the blade suction side ss and it decreases rapidly near the edge of the cavitation zone the spatial pattern of cavity can be presented by the iso surface a surface of constant value for vapor fraction in the simulation results fig 6 reveals that the size of the visible cavitation region is dependent on the adoptive value of α v as the average value of α v in tlv is about 0 3 fig 7 uses the iso surface of α v 0 3 to display the cavitation region in flow passage of rotor compared to the referenced experimental phenomena in fig 5 the developed tlv cavitation region is replicated by the simulation on conditions c and d basically with the deviation for efficiency lower than 1 meanwhile the attached cavitation covers the blade suction surface started from the inlet side at the cavitation inception stage of condition a and even condition b the simulated tip cavities are smaller than the referenced test results the cavitation inception is sensitive to much factor such as the water quality which is hard to be fully involved in the simulation accordingly the differences in efficiency between simulation and the adapted experimental data are about 3 4 overall the numerical simulation has reasonably revealed the variation laws of the cavitating tlv with different cavitation coefficients the calculation results are used for further analysis of the flow characteristics near the rotor tip 3 2 effects of tlv cavitation on tip leakage flow and vortex features under different cavitation conditions the change of the leakage flow rate q le through the rotor tip with n is shown in fig 8 compared to the total flow rate into the pump inlet q in the proportion of the leakage flow is about 1 1 1 4 from condition a to condition d the q le reduces with the decreasing of n and the rate of decline increases gradually as the cavitation area near the blade tip expands rapidly with lower cavitation coefficients like on conditions c and d the larger cavity leads to the flow blockage in the tip clearance and reduces the leakage flow rate meanwhile the blockage to the rotor flow diminishes the axial velocity component with increased load on the rotor blade tip which augments the leakage flow and affects the tlv strength the tlv is formed due to the interactions between the leakage flow and the flow around blade so the vortical flow features will be affected by the change of the leakage flow in order to reveal the vortex structures lots of methods can be used to identify the vortex region zhang et al 2017 some galilean invariants referring to the independence of the identified vortices on the choice of the frames are based on the characteristic equation of the velocity gradient tensor the velocity gradient tensor u can be written as a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric components with u s ω a λ 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 using a median of three eigenvalues of s 2 ω 2 is suitable to reflect a region of a pressure minimum in most situations and it is equivalent to the requirement that λ 2 0 within the vortex core this λ 2 criterion has been applied to identify the tlv from a hydrofoil tip clearance and it could accurately identify the tlv core region with an intuitively clear vortex geometry guo et al 2016 fig 9 shows the contours of λ 2 on a spanwise section near the tip at different cavitation conditions the local area with a large negative value of λ 2 in the blade suction side ss indicates the tlv region with the decreasing of n the location for the starting point of tlv is moving away from the leading edge le along the ss as the tlv cavitation develops the rotor is partially blocked and the tlv trajectory becomes more circumferential considering the damage of the tlv cavitation on the blade surface the end of the cavitating tlv may affect the pressure side ps of the adjacent blade and the contact position will change with the variation of tlv when the n is lower the cavitation phenomena intensify the complexity of the vortical flow features take condition d for example the additional vortex region near the blade trailing edge te is formed and even results in the vortex cavitation shown in fig 7 this kind of cavitation is usually due to the interactions between the tlv cavitation and the attached cavitation under the influence of the cavitation the vortex features can be further revealed by the vorticity transport equation ji et al 2014 huang et al 2014 taking curl of the navier stokes equations the vorticity equation for the cavitating flow is shown as following 13 d ω d t ω u ω u ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω where ω is the vorticity u is the velocity ν is the kinematic viscosity the subscripts of m and t represent the mixture phase and turbulent respectively is the hamiltonian operator on the right side of equation 13 each term represents the vortex stretching vortex dilatation baroclinic torque and viscous diffusion in turn the last viscous diffusion term can be ignored with a higher renolds number re whose order of magnitude is about 106 near the blade tip so the other three terms are mainly discussed in the following take condition d for example fig 10 shows the contours for the z axis component of the vorticity equation on a spanwise section inside the tip gap at r r 99 9 under the interference between the stationary rotor casing and the rotating blades the higher velocity gradient results in a large area of the distribution for the vortex stretching term with bigger absolute values as shown in fig 10 a in addition the peak value of ω u z appears in the vicinity of the blade leading edge and trailing edge due to the impact of inflow and the downstream interference fig 10 b shows that the vortex dilatation term is concentrated in the wedge shaped cavitation region this dilatation term can reflect the effects of the fluid compressibility on the vorticity so the term is equal to zero for the non cavitating region usually the higher vapor content corresponds to a stronger compressibility it can be found that the attached cavitation on blade surface makes a greater contribution than the tlv cavitation to the vortex dilatation referring to the vapor fraction distribution in fig 6 the baroclinic torque term works when the pressure and the density gradients are misaligned and the related concentration area is mainly on the junction region between the vapor and liquid shown in fig 10 c compared to the analytical results for the tlv cavitation around a hydrofoil by the vorticity equation decaix et al 2018 the characteristics of vortical flow on the blade tip is more complex in the rotating rotor on the one hand the relative movement between the blade tip and casing end wall significantly influences the vortex stretching term on the other hand the attached cavitation on blade surface is typical with lower n and it affects the vorticity production near the blade tip at the same time these rotor flow features make the tlv cavitation different from that around a single foil 3 3 effects of tlv cavitation on pressure fluctuation characteristics based on the above analysis of the time averaged tip leakage flow features it can be seen that the tlv becomes more distinct and the whole vortex flow field is more complicated with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the concentrated vorticity easily leads to the pressure loss and the change of pressure distribution will affect the pressure pulsation characteristics which determines the hydraulic stability of the rotor and even the pump in this section the pressure pulsation near the blade tip is analysed by the simulation results and six pressure pulse recording points p1 p6 are set on the stationary rotor casing as shown in fig 11 the pressure pulsation coefficient c p is defined as 14 c p p p 1 2 ρ v tip 2 where p is the instantaneous pressure p is the time averaged value within the sampling time 6 rotational periods of rotor and v tip is the circumferential velocity at blade tip which can be got by the product of the tip radius and the angular speed based on the time history of the pressure pulsation like in fig 12 a at point p1 on condition d the fast fourier transform fft is used to divide it into its frequency components the variation of the amplitude for pressure pulsation with the dominant relative frequency f f n where the f n is the runner rotational frequency equal to 33 33 hz can be got in fig 12 b where the log scale is used for the y axis to highlight low amplitude contents fig 12 reveals that the time domain plot of the c p has a relatively uniform variation with the values within 0 04 0 06 after the fft analysis the dominant frequency is 6 times the f n which is equal to the rotor blade passing frequency f rb the harmonic frequencies are the multiples of the f rb as the present calculations are near the design flow rate condition the formed cavitating tlv has a relatively stable feature and the pressure pulsation characteristics on the rotor casing are mainly determined by the rotational motion of the rotor blades additionally the pulsation amplitudes for each frequency component are almost damping exponentially and the similar variation trend appears in the whole fft analysis results on conditions b d at each pressure recording point fig 13 compares the pressure pulsation amplitude at the dominant frequency f rb on different conditions at each recording point it shows that the amplitudes increase firstly and then decrease along the pump shaft direction and the maximal value has a certain growth tendency with the decreasing of n the reason why does the pulsation amplitude appear in different position can be illustrated by the pressure distribution in fig 14 the pressure pulsation characteristics on these recording points p1 p6 reflect the variation of pressure along the circumferential direction fig 14 shows the contours of pressure on the spanwise section at r r 99 9 as the tlv region migrates to downstream with the decreasing of n and the low pressure region related to the tlv cavitation also moves to the downstream on conditions b and c the maximal amplitudes appear near the middle part of blade tip at point p3 and the corresponding streamwise position is close to the end of tlv as shown in fig 9 on condition d the serious cavitation covers the most of the blade tip region and the low pressure feature are more obvious near blade trailing edge under the influence of the trailing vortices the pressure change is more significant near point p5 and the strongest pressure pulse is at the end of the wedge shaped low pressure region overall the cavitation phenomenon will exacerbate the instability of flow field in the rotor tip under the influence of the tlv cavitation fig 13 highlights the necessity of fully setting monitoring points to cover the blade tip region 4 conclusions the tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor have been investigated by the numerical simulation the rotor from a waterjet pump is used with some experimental results for reference close to the design flow rate condition the cavitating tlv flow features on different cavitation conditions are analysed and some observations are made as results 1 based on the vortex cavitation characteristics a modified zwart s cavitation model is applied to calculating the tlv cavitation in the rotor under the common influences of the attached cavitation and tlv cavitation the rotor efficiency starts to fall and a wedge shaped cavitation region is formed when the cavitation coefficient n is lower than 1 2 the simulated efficiency curve of rotor and the predicted wedge shaped cavitation region near the blade tip are agree well with the experimental results 2 through the identification of the vortical flow near the rotor tip it can be seen that the tlv is inevitable no matter whether the cavitation occurs with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the vortex characteristics of tlv is more obvious and the vortex region is growing which leads to a reduced leakage flow rate through the rotor tip the effects of the cavity on the vortical flow are analysed by the vorticity transport equation it reveals that the relative motion between the rotor tip and casing makes major contribution to the vortex stretching term 3 the pressure pulsation characteristics are reflected by the pressure recording points on the rotor casing it shows that the dominant frequency is equal to the rotor blade passing frequency and the strongest pressure pulse appears at the end of the wedge shaped cavitation region with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the tlv shifts to downstream with the offset of the high pulse positions meanwhile the amplitude of the pressure pulsation is increasing with the cavitation increased

22648,the blade tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation is a concern for hydraulic machineries the underlying mechanism of the tlv cavitation is complex due to the interactions between the vortical flow and cavities leading to the necessity of improving the numerical methods in consideration of the influence of the angular momentum on the vortex cavitation the zwart s cavitation model is improved by

pump and the cavitation phenomena near the blade tip are validated by the referenced experiment the blade tip leakage flow and the tlv cavitation features are revealed by present simulation under different cavitation conditions it can be found that both the tlv and its cavitation reduce the leakage flow rate through the rotor tip according to the analysis of the pressure fluctuation characteristics it shows that the tlv cavitation especially its terminal region enhances the pressure pulsation with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficients the amplitude of the pressure

cavitation near the tip clearance farrell and billet 1994 experiment researches on single hydrofoil can be used as a simplified case to investigate the tlv cavitation murayama et al 2006 dreyer et al 2014 but the relative motion between the outer casing and blade in a real rotor is hard to be covered by a stationary hydrofoil although the twisted blade and various vortices make the experiment in a

solving cavitation problems in engineering the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a turbulence model and a cavitation model are general solved among the various widely used statistical turbulence models the k ω based shear stress transport sst model shows advantages on capturing the global features of the tlv in single phase flow calculations decaix et al 2015 guo et al 2016 for the cavitating flow calculations the original sst model with a rotation curvature correction cc could increase the prediction accuracy of the tlv cavitation guo et al 2018 this sst cc model

are mainly based on the homogeneous fluid approach and the mass transfer between the liquid and vapor is usually controlled by a transport equation in which some coefficients relying on experience will affect the simulated cavitating flow considering the effects of the rotary vortex motion on the cavity guo et al 2018 have calibrated the empirical coefficients in zwart s cavitation model and the modified vortex cavitation model could significantly improve the prediction of the tlv cavitation in order to analysis the tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor the above mentioned sst cc turbulence model and the modified vortex cavitation model will be used in present simulation the description for the numerical setup is shown in the following section 2 the objective of this paper is

pressure fluctuation characteristics are discussed finally section 4 shows the conclusions in present work 2 numerical simulation 2 1 computational case an axial waterjet pump axwj 2 was measured in chesnakas et al s experiment chesnakas et al 2009 and its powering and cavitation performance was obtained according to the experimental apparatus the computational domain is established as shown in fig 1 both the inlet and rotor casing diameter d is 304 8 mm and the rotor tip gap is about 0 5 mm the exit section has a diameter of 0 7d there are 6 and 8 blades in the rotor and stator configuration respectively during the performance testing the inflow and outflow information was measured between station a and station b set the coordinate system s origin in front of the rotor the two stations are about 0 3d and 1 4d away from the zero in z axis direction some extensions for the inlet and outlet are made to reduce the interference of the boundaries and the total length of the computational domain is about 3d along z axis some non dimensional parameters are used to describe the operating conditions the flow coefficient q the head coefficient h and the power coefficient p

the p v is the vapor pressure of water the drop in torque is measured directly in the experiment and the headrise represented as h is a calculated quantity 2 2 turbulence model the present work is carried out in ansys cfx software to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the averaging procedure introduces additional unknown terms called turbulent stresses according to introducing an eddy viscosity to mimic the effect of turbulence many eddy viscosity models have been built and widely used for simulating the industrial flows however one weakness of the eddy viscosity models is that they are insensitive to the streamline curvature and system rotation which are just important features in the swirling and rotating flows smirnov and menter 2009 used a modified function f r1 to control the production p k terms of the original k ω sst model and provided the sst cc model the modified transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent frequency ω are shown as follows 6 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k f r 1 β ρ k ω x j μ e f k x j 7 ρ ω t ρ u j ω x j α ρ p k μ t f r 1 d ω c d ω x j μ e f ω x j except for some empirical constants ρ is the density t is the time u j u v w is the velocity x j x y z is the position μ ef is about viscosity the terms d ω and d ω are related to the turbulent frequency ω and its derivative the f r1 is from a function f rotation suggested by spalart and shur 1997 with slight modification to maintain a numerical stability 8 f rotation 1 c r 1 2 r 1 r 1 c r 3 tan 1 c r 2 r c r 1 9 f r 1 max min f rotation 1 25 0 0 where the r and r are related to the strain rate tensor s and rotation rate tensor ω and the empirical constants are c r1 1 0 c r2 2 0 c r3 1 0 this curvature correction cc is available in cfx pre and the sst cc model is implemented in present simulation 2 3 cavitation model the homogeneous fluid approach which is assumed that each phase shares the turbulence flow field is widely used in the multiphase flow simulation using the simplified rayleigh plesset equation to describe the growth of vapor bubble in liquid zwart et al 2004 derived the total interphase mass transfer rate s l v due to cavitation per unit volume with the following form 10 s l v f v a p 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r n u c 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v f c o n d 3 α v ρ v r n u c 2 3 p p v ρ l if p p v where the subscripts v l and nuc represent the vapor liquid and nucleation site respectively α is the volume fraction r nuc is the radius of nucleation site f vap and f cond are empirical calibration coefficients to control the phase change rate vaporization and condensation in zwart s cavitation model these parameters have been found to work well for a variety of fluids and devices with r nuc 1 10 6 m α nuc 5 10 4 f vap 50 and f cond 0 01 but they are also need to be calibrated according to some specific cavitation problems zwart et al 2004 morgut and nobile 2012 liu et al 2014 in view of the underlying mechanism of the vortex cavitation guo et al 2018 has modified the zwart s cavitation model by building a relationship between the condensation coefficient f cond and the vortex features the high level of vorticity delays the collapse of cavity in vortex region and this influence can be reflected by controlling the condensation process with a lower f cond an appropriate reduction for f cond could extend the cavitating vortex region and it has promoted the solution of the problem that the predicting vortex cavitation is shorter or smaller with the default cavitation model used a variable f came from equation 8 is used to reflect the vortex intensity with the expression of 11 f 2 r 1 r where r is the ratio of the strain rate tensor and the rotation rate tensor with r s ω a reduction factor c fc was used as a multiplier of the traditional f cond to modify the zwart s cavitation model the variation curve for c fc f cond with the vortex identification criterion f is shown in fig 2 within the tlv region the rotation dominates the local flow and the larger ω than s is corresponding to the range of 0 1 for both r and f the smaller f represents a stronger vortex and a much lower f cond is needed based on much calibration experience and a specific case of cavitating tlv in a referenced hydrofoil experiment dreyer et al 2014 the variation curve in fig 2 is semi empirical built and the corresponding expression for c fc is 12 c f c 0 01 if f 0 6 34 58 f 3 71 63 f 2 49 29 f 11 25 if 0 6 f 1 1 if f 1 the lower limit for f cond is set as one percent of the default value in the range of f 1 the original value for f cond is enough after a serious of comparison a 3rd order polynomial is used to describe the transition of c fc from 0 01 to 1 this modification reflect the relationship between vorticity and cavity life on the one hand the low static pressure in vortex is conducive to the existence of cavitation on the other hand the high level of vorticity can be sustained only by lower static pressure in vortex core and the stronger vortex is more stable due to the conservation of angular momentum it has improved the prediction accuracy for tlv cavitation and the detailed derivation and demonstrate procedures are shown in reference guo et al 2018 this modified cavitation model could be embedded into the cfx software by cfx expression language cel and used in present simulation 2 4 mesh generation and validation the solutions are computed by ansys cfx software using an element based finite volume method which first involves discretizing the spatial domain using a mesh the whole computational domain is divided into four parts to generate the mesh the cylindrical inflow and outflow parts adopt the unstructured tetrahedral grid with a mesh refinement on the sidewalls a structured hexahedral mesh is used for the rotor and stator passages and the fine grid is employed near the rotor tip the local mesh for some parts is displayed in fig 3 the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 is recommended for discretization error estimation which has been evaluated over several hundred cfd cases including the simulation of cavitating tlv flow around a hydrofoil cheng et al 2018 using gci method only three significantly different sets of grids are needed to determine some key variables φ in a simulation in present case the pump performance parameters h p and η are treated as key variables and the mesh count of 1 41 3 29 and 8 33 million are generated the coarse medium and fine meshes are corresponding to three sets of grids with the subscript of 1 2 and 3 and the simulation results can be got as φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 based on richardson extrapolation richardson and gaunt 1927 an extrapolated value of φ ext can be solved by iteration on the non cavitating condition of q 0 76 the calculation of discretization error is shown in table 1 both the extrapolated relative error e ext and the fine grid convergence index gcifine are lower than 3 in addition the mesh near the blade tip is validated by comparing the minimum pressure at several locations along tlv the corresponding gcifine for the pressure values are also less than 3 based on this numerical uncertainty analysis the fine grid solution is determined as 8 33 million for the total number of grid cells the rotor tip clearance contains 50 nodes in the span wise direction the wall function is used to solve the near wall flow and the averaged value for y is about 30 on the blade surface and casing wall the gci method is employed to evaluate the mesh resolution near the best efficiency point bep with q 0 76 on the non cavitating condition the pump performance curve is got by the simulation and compared with the referenced experiment result in fig 4 overall the numerical simulation reflects the energy performance of this pump especially at the bep and design condition q 0 85 2 5 boundary conditions and numerical solution method referring to the values of n and q determined by the experiment a total pressure on the inlet and a mass flow rate on the outlet are set as the boundary conditions by equations 5 and 1 the default level of 5 is used as the inlet turbulence intensity the rotor domain has a revolving speed of 2000r min and it connects with the other stationary parts through the interface models these interfaces are set as the frozen rotor type in the steady state calculation which is performed for the mesh validation and to provide the initial flow field for the cavitating simulation then the unsteady solutions with different cavitation coefficients are carried out and the transient rotor stator type is set for these interfaces wherein the sliding mesh technique is enabled the no slip wall is set on all physical surfaces of the pump the sensitivities of the transient simulation results to the time steps has been evaluated by three cases among t 180 t 360 and t 720 where t is the rotational period of rotor in consideration of the computational accuracy and efficiency the t 360 about 8 33 10 5s is selected to track the flow revolution and the root mean square rms residual level of 1 10 4 for pressure and velocity is the convergence criterion the pressure pulsation analysis results have been compared within different sampling time between 4t to 7t it is found that the pressure pulsation information tends to be stable when the sample time is larger than 6t so the averaged flow field and the pressure fluctuation are analysed by the simulated results within 6t the second order backward euler scheme is used for the transient runs the high resolution scheme is chosen for both the advection scheme and turbulence numeric 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons with the experimental results near the design flow rate of q 0 85 the cavitation performance of the pump was measured at q 0 83 with different cavitation coefficients and the corresponding cavitation images adapted from the experiment are shown on four conditions in fig 5 with the decreasing of n the cavitation phenomenon firstly appears at the blade tip on condition a and then the cavitating tlv becomes visible from condition b the enlargement of the cavitation region leads to the drop off for the efficiency curve especially when the n is lower than 1 2 meanwhile a wedge shaped cavitation region is formed on condition d in the simulated results the pump efficiency η can be calculated by equation 4 and fig 5 shows that the simulation results reveal the effect of cavitation number on the efficiency curve as the cavity is made up of vapor and water fig 6 shows the distribution of the vapor fraction α v near the blade tip on condition d these contours are displayed on two spanwise sections which are some cylindrical surfaces in this case respectively where r is the local radius and r is the radius of the rotor casing in fig 6 a the section is located inside the rotor tip gap and the contour shows a wedge shaped cavitation region forming a 74 degree angle with the axial direction in fact the referenced experiment has revealed that this angle would be constant with the further decline of n the volume fraction of vapor is around 0 1 0 6 within the cavity and the value of α v is a little higher in the end of the cavitation region in fig 6 b the location of the section is slightly inward from the tip so the blank areas represent the part of blades it can be seen that the tlv cavitation is separated from the cavitation region on the blade surface and it seems that these two kinds of cavitation region determine the wedge shape outline for the sheet cavitation along the casing in fig 6 a a higher vapor fraction appears near the blade suction side ss and it decreases rapidly near the edge of the cavitation zone the spatial pattern of cavity can be presented by the iso surface a surface of constant value for vapor fraction in the simulation results fig 6 reveals that the size of the visible cavitation region is dependent on the adoptive value of α v as the average value of α v in tlv is about 0 3 fig 7 uses the iso surface of α v 0 3 to display the cavitation region in flow passage of rotor compared to the referenced experimental phenomena in fig 5 the developed tlv cavitation region is replicated by the simulation on conditions c and d basically with the deviation for efficiency lower than 1 meanwhile the attached cavitation covers the blade suction surface started from the inlet side at the cavitation inception stage of condition a and even condition b the simulated tip cavities are smaller than the referenced test results the cavitation inception is sensitive to much factor such as the water quality which is hard to be fully involved in the simulation accordingly the differences in efficiency between simulation and the adapted experimental data are about 3 4 overall the numerical simulation has reasonably revealed the variation laws of the cavitating tlv with different cavitation coefficients the calculation results are used for further analysis of the flow characteristics near the rotor tip 3 2 effects of tlv cavitation on tip leakage flow and vortex features under different cavitation conditions the change of the leakage flow rate q le through the rotor tip with n is shown in fig 8 compared to the total flow rate into the pump inlet q in the proportion of the leakage flow is about 1 1 1 4 from condition a to condition d the q le reduces with the decreasing of n and the rate of decline increases gradually as the cavitation area near the blade tip expands rapidly with lower cavitation coefficients like on conditions c and d the larger cavity leads to the flow blockage in the tip clearance and reduces the leakage flow rate meanwhile the blockage to the rotor flow diminishes the axial velocity component with increased load on the rotor blade tip which augments the leakage flow and affects the tlv strength the tlv is formed due to the interactions between the leakage flow and the flow around blade so the vortical flow features will be affected by the change of the leakage flow in order to reveal the vortex structures lots of methods can be used to identify the vortex region zhang et al 2017 some galilean invariants referring to the independence of the identified vortices on the choice of the frames are based on the characteristic equation of the velocity gradient tensor the velocity gradient tensor u can be written as a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric components with u s ω a λ 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 using a median of three eigenvalues of s 2 ω 2 is suitable to reflect a region of a pressure minimum in most situations and it is equivalent to the requirement that λ 2 0 within the vortex core this λ 2 criterion has been applied to identify the tlv from a hydrofoil tip clearance and it could accurately identify the tlv core region with an intuitively clear vortex geometry guo et al 2016 fig 9 shows the contours of λ 2 on a spanwise section near the tip at different cavitation conditions the local area with a large negative value of λ 2 in the blade suction side ss indicates the tlv region with the decreasing of n the location for the starting point of tlv is moving away from the leading edge le along the ss as the tlv cavitation develops the rotor is partially blocked and the tlv trajectory becomes more circumferential considering the damage of the tlv cavitation on the blade surface the end of the cavitating tlv may affect the pressure side ps of the adjacent blade and the contact position will change with the variation of tlv when the n is lower the cavitation phenomena intensify the complexity of the vortical flow features take condition d for example the additional vortex region near the blade trailing edge te is formed and even results in the vortex cavitation shown in fig 7 this kind of cavitation is usually due to the interactions between the tlv cavitation and the attached cavitation under the influence of the cavitation the vortex features can be further revealed by the vorticity transport equation ji et al 2014 huang et al 2014 taking curl of the navier stokes equations the vorticity equation for the cavitating flow is shown as following 13 d ω d t ω u ω u ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω where ω is the vorticity u is the velocity ν is the kinematic viscosity the subscripts of m and t represent the mixture phase and turbulent respectively is the hamiltonian operator on the right side of equation 13 each term represents the vortex stretching vortex dilatation baroclinic torque and viscous diffusion in turn the last viscous diffusion term can be ignored with a higher renolds number re whose order of magnitude is about 106 near the blade tip so the other three terms are mainly discussed in the following take condition d for example fig 10 shows the contours for the z axis component of the vorticity equation on a spanwise section inside the tip gap at r r 99 9 under the interference between the stationary rotor casing and the rotating blades the higher velocity gradient results in a large area of the distribution for the vortex stretching term with bigger absolute values as shown in fig 10 a in addition the peak value of ω u z appears in the vicinity of the blade leading edge and trailing edge due to the impact of inflow and the downstream interference fig 10 b shows that the vortex dilatation term is concentrated in the wedge shaped cavitation region this dilatation term can reflect the effects of the fluid compressibility on the vorticity so the term is equal to zero for the non cavitating region usually the higher vapor content corresponds to a stronger compressibility it can be found that the attached cavitation on blade surface makes a greater contribution than the tlv cavitation to the vortex dilatation referring to the vapor fraction distribution in fig 6 the baroclinic torque term works when the pressure and the density gradients are misaligned and the related concentration area is mainly on the junction region between the vapor and liquid shown in fig 10 c compared to the analytical results for the tlv cavitation around a hydrofoil by the vorticity equation decaix et al 2018 the characteristics of vortical flow on the blade tip is more complex in the rotating rotor on the one hand the relative movement between the blade tip and casing end wall significantly influences the vortex stretching term on the other hand the attached cavitation on blade surface is typical with lower n and it affects the vorticity production near the blade tip at the same time these rotor flow features make the tlv cavitation different from that around a single foil 3 3 effects of tlv cavitation on pressure fluctuation characteristics based on the above analysis of the time averaged tip leakage flow features it can be seen that the tlv becomes more distinct and the whole vortex flow field is more complicated with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the concentrated vorticity easily leads to the pressure loss and the change of pressure distribution will affect the pressure pulsation characteristics which determines the hydraulic stability of the rotor and even the pump in this section the pressure pulsation near the blade tip is analysed by the simulation results and six pressure pulse recording points p1 p6 are set on the stationary rotor casing as shown in fig 11 the pressure pulsation coefficient c p is defined as 14 c p p p 1 2 ρ v tip 2 where p is the instantaneous pressure p is the time averaged value within the sampling time 6 rotational periods of rotor and v tip is the circumferential velocity at blade tip which can be got by the product of the tip radius and the angular speed based on the time history of the pressure pulsation like in fig 12 a at point p1 on condition d the fast fourier transform fft is used to divide it into its frequency components the variation of the amplitude for pressure pulsation with the dominant relative frequency f f n where the f n is the runner rotational frequency equal to 33 33 hz can be got in fig 12 b where the log scale is used for the y axis to highlight low amplitude contents fig 12 reveals that the time domain plot of the c p has a relatively uniform variation with the values within 0 04 0 06 after the fft analysis the dominant frequency is 6 times the f n which is equal to the rotor blade passing frequency f rb the harmonic frequencies are the multiples of the f rb as the present calculations are near the design flow rate condition the formed cavitating tlv has a relatively stable feature and the pressure pulsation characteristics on the rotor casing are mainly determined by the rotational motion of the rotor blades additionally the pulsation amplitudes for each frequency component are almost damping exponentially and the similar variation trend appears in the whole fft analysis results on conditions b d at each pressure recording point fig 13 compares the pressure pulsation amplitude at the dominant frequency f rb on different conditions at each recording point it shows that the amplitudes increase firstly and then decrease along the pump shaft direction and the maximal value has a certain growth tendency with the decreasing of n the reason why does the pulsation amplitude appear in different position can be illustrated by the pressure distribution in fig 14 the pressure pulsation characteristics on these recording points p1 p6 reflect the variation of pressure along the circumferential direction fig 14 shows the contours of pressure on the spanwise section at r r 99 9 as the tlv region migrates to downstream with the decreasing of n and the low pressure region related to the tlv cavitation also moves to the downstream on conditions b and c the maximal amplitudes appear near the middle part of blade tip at point p3 and the corresponding streamwise position is close to the end of tlv as shown in fig 9 on condition d the serious cavitation covers the most of the blade tip region and the low pressure feature are more obvious near blade trailing edge under the influence of the trailing vortices the pressure change is more significant near point p5 and the strongest pressure pulse is at the end of the wedge shaped low pressure region overall the cavitation phenomenon will exacerbate the instability of flow field in the rotor tip under the influence of the tlv cavitation fig 13 highlights the necessity of fully setting monitoring points to cover the blade tip region 4 conclusions the tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor have been investigated by the numerical simulation the rotor from a waterjet pump is used with some experimental results for reference close to the design flow rate condition the cavitating tlv flow features on different cavitation conditions are analysed and some observations are made as results 1 based on the vortex cavitation characteristics a modified zwart s cavitation model is applied to calculating the tlv cavitation in the rotor under the common influences of the attached cavitation and tlv cavitation the rotor efficiency starts to fall and a wedge shaped cavitation region is formed when the cavitation coefficient n is lower than 1 2 the simulated efficiency curve of rotor and the predicted wedge shaped cavitation region near the blade tip are agree well with the experimental results 2 through the identification of the vortical flow near the rotor tip it can be seen that the tlv is inevitable no matter whether the cavitation occurs with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the vortex characteristics of tlv is more obvious and the vortex region is growing which leads to a reduced leakage flow rate through the rotor tip the effects of the cavity on the vortical flow are analysed by the vorticity transport equation it reveals that the relative motion between the rotor tip and casing makes major contribution to the vortex stretching term 3 the pressure pulsation characteristics are reflected by the pressure recording points on the rotor casing it shows that the dominant frequency is equal to the rotor blade passing frequency and the strongest pressure pulse appears at the end of the wedge shaped cavitation region with the decreasing of the cavitation coefficient the tlv shifts to downstream with the offset of the high pulse positions meanwhile the amplitude of the pressure pulsation is increasing with the cavitation increased

respectively and is driven by 25 rigid fins which can sway in the transverse plane vertical to the axis fig 4 the experiment is carried out at a small towing tank of 25 m 3 m 1 5m in length width and depth and the side and bottom of tank is made of transparent toughened glass in the experiment the water depth is 900 mm and the test model of undulating fins is immersed in a depth of 450 mm so the effect of water surface on the propulsion of undulating fins can be negligible in the experiment the kinematic parameters of undulating fins are set as follows λ l 0 5 φmax 85 f 2 0hz h l 0 065 where h is fin height 3 2 experiment setup piv system is composite of a quantel twins brilliant b laser of wave length 325 nm and ccd camera powerviewplus4m with resolution of 2048pix 2048pix and nikon

frequency of rigid fins is designed as 1 3 and the rotary encoder e80h30 1024 with resolution of 0 350 is installed on the motor shaft to get the wave phase of undulating fins and transmit to the synchronous controller to trigger the laser to illuminate the flow field and the ccd camera to capture particle images the flow field on middle cross section x l 0 5 of undulating fins is measured in

the diagnostic window for piv image is set as 32pix 32pix 100 pairs of particle images are sampled at each phase in this experiment the flow field of undulating fins is measured in stationary water fig 5 a shows the instantaneous velocity vector on the cross section at a certain time on part of cross section the light sheet is sheltered by the fin surface so the flow velocity cannot be obtained in these areas shown as the blank area in fig 5a and b fig 5b shows contour of phase averaged in plane velocity of 100 instantaneous velocity field at the same phase and its streamlines on the cross section the grey solid line represents the intersection line of fin surface and cross section 4 comparison between numerical simulation and experiments for comparison with the hydrodynamics experiments in the numerical simulation of hydrodynamics the main geometry and kinematics parameters of undulating fins are set as the same as hydrodynamics experiments i e l 800 mm l λ 2 f 2 0hz h l 0 065 φ m 850 a global unstructured grid of 1 0 106 is used to model the computational domain with time space δt 0 001s yaqiang et al 2016 the numerical simulation results of hydrodynamics is compared with the experiment in stationary water shown as fig 6 the comparison indicates both the thrust of numerical simulation and experiments are linear to square of frequency the numerical results agree well with the experiments and the maximum relative bias is about 9 44 considering there is still some differences between numerical simulation and experiment test such as the undulating fins is installed in the cylinder base in experiment while it is simplified as a baseline in the numerical simulation the above mentioned bias is acceptable fig 7 presents the comparison of contour of in plane velocity and streamlines map on cross section x l 0 5 subgraph a1 a8 and b1 b8 corresponds to piv and cfd results at equally distributed wave phases at wave amplitude 850 and 300 respectively in the numerical simulation the geometry and kinematics parameters of undulating fins are set as follows l 800 mm l λ 2 f 2 0hz h l 0 0625 φ m 300 a global structured grid of 3 3 106 is used to model the computational domain with time space δt 0 001s limited by numerical simulation method here only the numerical results at wave amplitude of 300 is shown and it cannot be compared quantitatively with the experimental results at wave amplitude 850 generally speaking shown as fig 7 it is obvious that the characteristics of flow field of numerical results agrees well with the experiments results qualitatively there is a strong jet flow near the mid sagittal plane both in measurement results and numerical simulation the series of anti karman vortexes streamwise vortexes locate alternatively with different sign of vorticity on both side of the jet flow compared with experiments at wave amplitude of 850 because of the wave amplitude is smaller 300 in the numerical simulation the numerical simulated anti karman vortexes are more concentrated near the mid sagittal plane it is obvious in fig 7 that two or more streamwise vortexes exist on middle cross section at any moment as the fin swings to nearby the maximum angle a new streamwise vortex generates and sheds from the tip of fin surface so there are two streamwise vortexes generated during each period at two side maximum angle on the other hand as the fin swings to near the mid sagittal plane the fully developed streamwise vortexes begins to decay 5 vortex structure of flow field the spatial vortex structure is extracted from the flow field of undulating fins at wave amplitude 30 fig 8 shows iso surface of vorticity magnitude q 1s 2 and contour of the streamwise velocity the results indicate that there are mainly three kinds of vortexes i e streamwise vortex crescent vortex and toroidal vortex supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video1 video1 5 1 streamwise vortexes fig 9 shows the streamwise vortex structure of iso surface of q 200s 2 the grey part represents fin surface the travelling wave on fin surface is spreading toward positive x direction the color represents rotation direction of streamwise vortexes comparing fig 8 with fig 9 it is obvious that vorticity intensity of streamwise vortex is the strongest among all kinds of vortexes fig 9 also shows streamwise vortexes alternately distribute on each side of fin surface the angle between streamwise vortexes and baseline of fin surface becomes more and more larger as wave spreads downstream observation and analysis of numerical results indicate as the bow fin swings to near maximum angle the streamwise vortex generates and then moves downstream with wave spreading during the process the tail end of streamwise vortex always sticks to fin tip that is to say the streamwise vortex moves at the same speed as wave spreading due to symmetry of fin movement on mid sagittal plane and wave length ratio λ l 0 5 there are two pairs of streamwise vortexes with contrary rotation alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane which move downstream and shed at the fin end and diffuse in the wake fig 10 shows instantaneous streamlines and contour of in plane velocity on a cross section x l 0 125 the grey line represents intersect line of fin surface with cross section and the black arrows represents swing direction of fin surface at the moment at this moment there are three streamwise vortexes on the cross section where vortex a is newly generated still adheres to the tip of fin surface vortex b has gone through a fully development process and is detached from fin surface vortex c has moved at a distance and tends to be disappeared from the point of view of flow on the cross section fig 10 shows that the fluid outside the white circle which is marked with dotted lines is convergent to the fin surface due to suction produced by undulating fins and must be pushed towards downstream while inside the circle there is a jet ejects outward from the fin tip fig 11 shows serial changes of velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 125 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively it is obvious in fig 11 that two or more streamwise vortexes exist on forepart cross section at any moment as the fin swings to nearby maximum angle new streamwise vortex generates and sheds from the tip of fin surface so there are two streamwise vortexes generated during each period at two side maximum angle on the other hand as fin swings to near mid sagittal plane the fully developed streamwise vortexes begins to decay fig 12 shows serial changes of contour of in plane velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 5 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively comparing flow structure of forepart cross section fig 11 with that of middle cross section fig 12 we can find on the above two sections vortex structure and its evolution with wave phase are similar the difference is flow structure on middle cross section is more complicated the jet ejected outward from fin tip becomes more strong and its affected range seems enlarged supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video2 video2 fig 13 shows serial changes of velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 875 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively comparing flow structure of middle cross section with that of afterbody cross section we can find on the above two sections vortex structure and its evolution with wave phase are similar the difference is that on cross section x l 0 875 diffusion area of the vertical jet enlarges after the jet ejects from fin tip and moves at a distance 5 2 crescent vortexes fig 14 shows local view of spatial vortex structure near the fin front the grey part represents fin surface the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on two sides of mid sagittal plane the color map represents the axial velocity supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video3 video3 it can be seen the crescent vortexes mainly package in the periphery of the streamwise vortexes the intersection of crescent vortexes and mid sagittal plane almost forms a line tilting at an acute angle with baseline of fin surface inside the crescent vortexes there is a high speed flow of axial velocity while outside is low speed flow the crescent vortexes locate at the interface of shear layer fig 15 shows flow field in a tilting plane which is vertical to mid sagittal plane fig 15a shows spatial position of the titling plane in fig 15b the color map represents axial velocity it is obvious that the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane and the vortex cores locate in two sides of axial jet numerical results indicates the crescent vortex is connected to the streamwise vortex near the front of fin surface due to the symmetry of fins movement about mid sagittal plane crescent vortexes also alternately distribute on two sides of fin surface after separated from streamwise vortex the crescent vortex moves downstream meanwhile migrates outward fig 15 also indicates that the crescent vortexes induce high speed jet which produces the main thrust this is hydrodynamic mechanism of undulating fins propulsion 5 3 toroidal vortex fig 16 shows contour of in plane velocity and streamlines in the mid sagittal plane as cross section of a large vortex ring a vortex pair locates away from the fin end and near the end of an inclined rear jet which generates thrust meanwhile positive heave force flow visualization at different moment indicates the toroidal vortex is quite stable 5 4 hydrodynamic mechanism of undulating fins the non dimensional coefficients of hydrodynamic k x and k y on the fin is defined as k x t x f 2 h 2 l 2 ρ k y t y f 2 h 2 l 2 ρ where tx ty are force components at x and y direction respectively fig 17 shows mean force coefficients vary with wave amplitude in the series simulation the parameters are set as l 800 mm h 45 mm f 2 0hz l λ 2 it can be seen the k y is always positive at different wave amplitude except at zero wave amplitude fig 18 a shows velocity vector map colored by in plane velocity on cross section x l 0 5 fig 18b shows streamlines colored by vertical velocity it is obvious that the main stream is vertical up over the fin tip especially at y l 0 125 it is obvious the vertical jet is highly correlative with streamwise vortexes that is to say the streamwise vortexes mainly induce the vertical jet and generate the main heave force this is the hydrodynamic mechanism of heave force generation fig 19 shows contour of vertical velocity in horizontal plane y l 0 125 it is obvious that the vertical up flow is predominant in the whole flow field so the distinct vertical up force will be generated by fin surface movement just as fig 17 shows at wave amplitude 300 6 conclusion the flow field of undulating fins is numerical simulated by les and dynamic grid technique with diffusion based smoothing model and hydrodynamics measurements and piv experiments the thrust of undulating fins by numerical simulation at wave amplitude 850 generally agrees well with the hydrodynamics experiments and is linear to square of wave frequency the phase locked piv experiments is carried out to measure in plane velocity field on middle cross section at wave amplitude 850 one hundred instantaneous velocity fields are phase averaged analyzed to extract vortex structure at each phase generally speaking the numerical results such as the streamwise vortexes structure and its evolution with phase angle at wave amplitude of 300 qualitatively agree well with the experiments results at wave amplitude 850 compared with experiments at wave amplitude of 850 because of the wave amplitude is smaller 300 in the numerical simulation the streamwise vortexes are more concentrated near the mid sagittal plane the numerical results at wave amplitude 300 indicates that there are mainly three kinds of vortexes i e streamwise vortex crescent vortex and toroidal vortex the intensity of streamwise vortex is the strongest among all kinds of vortexes streamwise vortexes alternately distribute on each side of fin surface the angle between streamwise vortexes and baseline of fin surface becomes more and more larger as wave spreads downstream at every moment there are two pairs of streamwise vortexes with contrary rotation alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane which move downstream at the same speed as wave spreading while the tail end of streamwise vortex always sticks to the fin tip and shed at the end of fin surface and diffuse in the wake the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane and the vortex cores locate in two sides of axial jet inside the crescent vortexes is a high speed flow while outside low speed flow the intersection of crescent vortexes and mid sagittal plane almost forms a line tilting at an acute angle with baseline of fin surface the crescent vortex is connected to the streamwise vortex near the front of fin surface after separated from streamwise vortex the crescent vortex moves downstream meanwhile migrates outward the crescent vortexes mainly induce high speed axial jet which produces the main thrust the streamwise vortexes mainly induce the vertical jet which generates the main heave force the downward and outward jet is formed under the action of crescent vortexes and streamwise vortexes the toroidal vortex just locates periphery of the jet end acknowledgements this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51379193

swings to nearby the maximum angle a new streamwise vortex generates and sheds from the tip of fin surface so there are two streamwise vortexes generated during each period at two side maximum angle on the other hand as the fin swings to near the mid sagittal plane the fully developed streamwise vortexes begins to decay 5 vortex structure of flow field the spatial vortex structure is extracted from the flow field of undulating fins at wave amplitude 30 fig 8 shows iso surface of vorticity magnitude q 1s 2 and contour of the streamwise velocity the results indicate that there are mainly three kinds of vortexes i e streamwise vortex crescent vortex and toroidal vortex supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video1 video1 5 1 streamwise vortexes fig 9 shows the streamwise vortex structure of iso surface of q 200s 2 the grey part represents fin surface the travelling wave on fin surface is spreading toward positive x direction the color represents rotation direction of streamwise vortexes comparing fig 8 with fig 9 it is obvious that vorticity intensity of streamwise vortex is the strongest among all kinds of vortexes fig 9 also shows streamwise vortexes alternately distribute on each side of fin surface the angle between streamwise vortexes and baseline of fin surface becomes more and more larger as wave spreads downstream observation and analysis of numerical results indicate as the bow fin swings to near maximum angle the streamwise vortex generates and then moves downstream with wave spreading during the process the tail end of streamwise vortex always sticks to fin tip that is to say the streamwise vortex moves at the same speed as wave spreading due to symmetry of fin movement on mid sagittal plane and wave length ratio λ l 0 5 there are two pairs of streamwise vortexes with contrary rotation alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane which move downstream and shed at the fin end and diffuse in the wake fig 10 shows instantaneous streamlines and contour of in plane velocity on a cross section x l 0 125 the grey line represents intersect line of fin surface with cross section and the black arrows represents swing direction of fin surface at the moment at this moment there are three streamwise vortexes on the cross section where vortex a is newly generated still adheres to the tip of fin surface vortex b has gone through a fully development process and is detached from fin surface vortex c has moved at a distance and tends to be disappeared from the point of view of flow on the cross section fig 10 shows that the fluid outside the white circle which is marked with dotted lines is convergent to the fin surface due to suction produced by undulating fins and must be pushed towards downstream while inside the circle there is a jet ejects outward from the fin tip fig 11 shows serial changes of velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 125 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively it is obvious in fig 11 that two or more streamwise vortexes exist on forepart cross section at any moment as the fin swings to nearby maximum angle new streamwise vortex generates and sheds from the tip of fin surface so there are two streamwise vortexes generated during each period at two side maximum angle on the other hand as fin swings to near mid sagittal plane the fully developed streamwise vortexes begins to decay fig 12 shows serial changes of contour of in plane velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 5 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively comparing flow structure of forepart cross section fig 11 with that of middle cross section fig 12 we can find on the above two sections vortex structure and its evolution with wave phase are similar the difference is flow structure on middle cross section is more complicated the jet ejected outward from fin tip becomes more strong and its affected range seems enlarged supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video2 video2 fig 13 shows serial changes of velocity and streamlines on cross section x l 0 875 the sub figures a f correspond to wave phase 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 and 360 respectively comparing flow structure of middle cross section with that of afterbody cross section we can find on the above two sections vortex structure and its evolution with wave phase are similar the difference is that on cross section x l 0 875 diffusion area of the vertical jet enlarges after the jet ejects from fin tip and moves at a distance 5 2 crescent vortexes fig 14 shows local view of spatial vortex structure near the fin front the grey part represents fin surface the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on two sides of mid sagittal plane the color map represents the axial velocity supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106166 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video3 video3 it can be seen the crescent vortexes mainly package in the periphery of the streamwise vortexes the intersection of crescent vortexes and mid sagittal plane almost forms a line tilting at an acute angle with baseline of fin surface inside the crescent vortexes there is a high speed flow of axial velocity while outside is low speed flow the crescent vortexes locate at the interface of shear layer fig 15 shows flow field in a tilting plane which is vertical to mid sagittal plane fig 15a shows spatial position of the titling plane in fig 15b the color map represents axial velocity it is obvious that the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane and the vortex cores locate in two sides of axial jet numerical results indicates the crescent vortex is connected to the streamwise vortex near the front of fin surface due to the symmetry of fins movement about mid sagittal plane crescent vortexes also alternately distribute on two sides of fin surface after separated from streamwise vortex the crescent vortex moves downstream meanwhile migrates outward fig 15 also indicates that the crescent vortexes induce high speed jet which produces the main thrust this is hydrodynamic mechanism of undulating fins propulsion 5 3 toroidal vortex fig 16 shows contour of in plane velocity and streamlines in the mid sagittal plane as cross section of a large vortex ring a vortex pair locates away from the fin end and near the end of an inclined rear jet which generates thrust meanwhile positive heave force flow visualization at different moment indicates the toroidal vortex is quite stable 5 4 hydrodynamic mechanism of undulating fins the non dimensional coefficients of hydrodynamic k x and k y on the fin is defined as k x t x f 2 h 2 l 2 ρ k y t y f 2 h 2 l 2 ρ where tx ty are force components at x and y direction respectively fig 17 shows mean force coefficients vary with wave amplitude in the series simulation the parameters are set as l 800 mm h 45 mm f 2 0hz l λ 2 it can be seen the k y is always positive at different wave amplitude except at zero wave amplitude fig 18 a shows velocity vector map colored by in plane velocity on cross section x l 0 5 fig 18b shows streamlines colored by vertical velocity it is obvious that the main stream is vertical up over the fin tip especially at y l 0 125 it is obvious the vertical jet is highly correlative with streamwise vortexes that is to say the streamwise vortexes mainly induce the vertical jet and generate the main heave force this is the hydrodynamic mechanism of heave force generation fig 19 shows contour of vertical velocity in horizontal plane y l 0 125 it is obvious that the vertical up flow is predominant in the whole flow field so the distinct vertical up force will be generated by fin surface movement just as fig 17 shows at wave amplitude 300 6 conclusion the flow field of undulating fins is numerical simulated by les and dynamic grid technique with diffusion based smoothing model and hydrodynamics measurements and piv experiments the thrust of undulating fins by numerical simulation at wave amplitude 850 generally agrees well with the hydrodynamics experiments and is linear to square of wave frequency the phase locked piv experiments is carried out to measure in plane velocity field on middle cross section at wave amplitude 850 one hundred instantaneous velocity fields are phase averaged analyzed to extract vortex structure at each phase generally speaking the numerical results such as the streamwise vortexes structure and its evolution with phase angle at wave amplitude of 300 qualitatively agree well with the experiments results at wave amplitude 850 compared with experiments at wave amplitude of 850 because of the wave amplitude is smaller 300 in the numerical simulation the streamwise vortexes are more concentrated near the mid sagittal plane the numerical results at wave amplitude 300 indicates that there are mainly three kinds of vortexes i e streamwise vortex crescent vortex and toroidal vortex the intensity of streamwise vortex is the strongest among all kinds of vortexes streamwise vortexes alternately distribute on each side of fin surface the angle between streamwise vortexes and baseline of fin surface becomes more and more larger as wave spreads downstream at every moment there are two pairs of streamwise vortexes with contrary rotation alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane which move downstream at the same speed as wave spreading while the tail end of streamwise vortex always sticks to the fin tip and shed at the end of fin surface and diffuse in the wake the crescent vortexes alternately distribute on the two sides of mid sagittal plane and the vortex cores locate in two sides of axial jet inside the crescent vortexes is a high speed flow while outside low speed flow the intersection of crescent vortexes and mid sagittal plane almost forms a line tilting at an acute angle with baseline of fin surface the crescent vortex is connected to the streamwise vortex near the front of fin surface after separated from streamwise vortex the crescent vortex moves downstream meanwhile migrates outward the crescent vortexes mainly induce high speed axial jet which produces the main thrust the streamwise vortexes mainly induce the vertical jet which generates the main heave force the downward and outward jet is formed under the action of crescent vortexes and streamwise vortexes the toroidal vortex just locates periphery of the jet end acknowledgements this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51379193
