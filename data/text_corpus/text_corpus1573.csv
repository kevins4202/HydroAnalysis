7865,study region the xiangjiang river xjr basin china study focus on multiple time scales annual quarterly and monthly there are few comprehensive and comprehensive quantitative evaluation frameworks for the factors that drive changes in watershed runoff the focus of this study is to use the range of variability approach rva to quantitatively analyze the changes in the overall hydrological regime of the basin the budyko model and the deterministic hydrological process model abcd model were then used to quantitatively separate the factors affecting runoff in the monthly window and to clarify the differences in the runoff driving force at different time scales new hydrological insights for the region after the mutation the runoff of the xjr basin increased by 11 and the changes in the five groups of hydrological and ecological indicators indicated that the ecological response process of the basin was undergoing negative changes the contributions of the driving forces on different time scales show significant differences the climatic factor is the dominant factor of the runoff change on the interannual scale however on the seasonal scale human activities have a greater weight in spring accounting for 82 of the total on a monthly scale it presents a more complicated situation human activities contribute significantly in february may and october 60 52 and 54 while climate factors are the main driving factor in the remaining months 51 170 graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecohydrology the budyko model the abcd model driving factor xiangjiang river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the hydrological cycle which includes precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff is key to the sustainable use of water resources in nature dimitriadis et al 2021 yang et al 2021 runoff is a major link in the hydrological cycle and its changes are mainly driven by climate change and human activities farsi et al 2019 kundzewicz 2008 climate change has recently been driven primarily by temperature changes with average global surface temperatures rising by about 1 c since the first industrial revolution resulting in changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which in turn alter runoff processes han et al 2022 schneider et al 2017 the impact of human activities on runoff is mainly reflected in two aspects on the one hand the construction and operation of reservoirs and water intake for life and production will directly affect runoff changes on the other hand the development of industry greenhouse gas emissions land use changes etc will indirectly drive runoff changes sajikumar et al 2015 yang et al 2022 therefore quantifying the impacts of human activities and climate change is important to clarify the mechanism of runoff change in watersheds as an important part of the basin ecosystem and an important condition for the economic development of the basin the change in runoff has a profound impact on the management and sustainable use of water resources in the region howard et al 2016 many scholars have quantitatively studied the reasons that drive runoff changes ryberg et al 2014 wagener et al 2010 wang et al 2018 research methods are mainly divided into two categories one is quantitative attribution of runoff changes based on different analytical formulas based on the budyko hypothesis for example wang et al 2018 analyzed the lower connecticut river through the choudhury yang formula based on the budyko hypothesis and found that climate change is the dominant factor driving the increase in runoff in the region huang et al 2020 used 6 different functions based on the budyko hypothesis to analyze the dongting lake dtl watershed in china their research discovered that the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff dominate during the p1 and p2 periods respectively the other is to simulate the runoff process when not disturbed by human activities through hydrological models including the soil and water assessment tool swat model variable infiltration capacity vic model etc and quantify the contribution of climate and humans to runoff changes by comparing measured runoff and reconstructed runoff yan et al 2020 used the vic model to reconstruct the natural runoff after the luanhe river basin mutation and determined that climate change and the impact of local human activities on local runoff are roughly the same pirnia et al 2019 used swat models to study the haraz river basin in northern iran and found that human activities are the dominant driving force of annual runoff changes in the basin however most of these studies focus on analyzing the driving forces of runoff changes on an interannual scale and lack quantitative attribution of factors affecting runoff changes on more detailed time scales seasonal and monthly scales the seasonal distribution of precipitation and the scheduling and operation of reservoirs during the year can change the annual runoff process in the basin gaudard et al 2018 peng et al 2019 therefore quantitative attribution analysis of runoff on seasonal and monthly scales is essential the abcd model proposed by thomas based on the principle of water balance is widely used in runoff simulation research because of its few parameters strong applicability and clear model concept shahid et al 2020 vandewiele et al 1992 compared the abcd model with other monthly water balance models and found that the abcd model was suitable for multiple watersheds in china myanmar and belgium and proved its reliability in the weihe river basin li et al 2016 compared the abcd model with the dynamic water balance model dwbm thornthwaite mather s water balance tmwb model and vandewiele s water balance model vwbm and found that the four monthly water balance models performed well but the abcd model outperformed the other three models in summary this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for basin hydrology which is mainly divided into the following three steps 1 use the range of variability approach rva to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the degree of change in the watershed hydrology 2 the choudhury yang formula is used to illustrate the contribution of the driving factors precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface behind the runoff change on an interannual scale 3 construct a separation framework with the monthly scale window of the abcd model and quantitatively analyze the impact of human activities and climate change on it at different time scales interannual seasonal and monthly scales under the ecological and hydrological changes of the basin the xiangjiang river xjr is the mother river of hunan province and its drainage area accounts for about 40 of the total area of hunan province it is the most developed area in hunan province and one of the granaries of china its unique water environment provides excellent conditions for the reproduction and wintering of various organisms and also provides support for the ecological protection and restoration of the dtl wetland yuan et al 2019 however in recent decades intensified climate change and high frequency human activities have led to changes in the natural runoff of the xjr which have adversely affected the local ecosystem and the dtl wetland the predecessors have only carried out research on the xjr on a unilateral or single scale and have not conducted a systematic and comprehensive analysis which is inappropriate for such an important watershed therefore this study selects the xjr basin as the research object and the research results can provide new ideas for a comprehensive analysis of the ecological hydrology of the basin and its influencing factors as well as provide a scientific basis for water resources management and ecosystem restoration in the xjr basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xjr is located at 110 50 114 25 e 24 5 28 25 n primarily in hunan province with the eastern part of the basin adjacent to the poyang lake water system and the overall terrain being high in the south and low in the north fig 1 it originates from baishi township xing an county guangxi zhuang autonomous region and flows north into dtl which is the largest river in the dtl water system and one of the eight major tributaries of the yangtze river gao et al 2018 the mainstream of the xjr has a total length of 856 kilometers and a basin area of 94 660 square kilometers and its land use types are mainly arable land and forest land the area belongs to the subtropical humid climate with four distinct seasons and the summer temperature is high and rainy the annual rainfall is relatively abundant so its watershed has many tributaries the water system is developed and the average annual flow into dtl is 7 13 1011 m3 accounting for about 22 4 of the total annual average flow into dtl the xjr basin is a concentrated area of population and industry in hunan province and is also an important grain production base in china to ensure the effective management of local water resources since the 1950s many reservoirs have been built in the upper and middle reaches of the xjr including 20 large scale reservoirs including zhushuqiao dongjiang yongjia and huamuqiao and more than 100 medium sized reservoirs with the development of the local economy society and population the contradiction between the intensification of water demand in the basin and the uneven distribution of precipitation during the year has become more and more acute and the intra year regulation and storage effect of reservoir groups has become more and more obvious 2 2 data the hydrological data used in this study is the daily flow of the xiangtan hydrological station the control station of the xjr outlet from 1961 to 2019 which is derived from the hydrological yearbook of the yangtze river basin meteorological data using the daily meteorological data of 11 meteorological stations such as yongzhou and hengyang from 1961 to 2019 including precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature average relative humidity average wind speed sunshine hours and other indicators which are used to construct meteorological runoff models for research meteorological data is provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the elevation data of the xjr basin comes from the geospatial data cloud https gscloud cn the geographic locations and elevations of all the above stations are shown in table 1 3 methodology previous studies on watershed eco hydrology are often unidirectional and single scale analyses however with the increasingly complex watershed environment previous studies have been unable to meet the needs of local watershed managers we constructed a comprehensive analytical framework for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the watershed s eco hydrological response and drivers of runoff change at multiple time scales fig 2 3 1 precipitation calculation when calculating the precipitation in the basin the commonly used methods are the arithmetic average method the isohyetal method and the thiessen polygon method the arithmetic average method is easily affected by extreme values and does not consider the basin area represented by the meteorological station when using the isohyetal method to calculate it contains a certain degree of subjectivity the idea of the thiessen polygon method is to use the vertical bisector to segment the area taking into account the uneven distribution of precipitation in the area and the result is more reliable faisal et al 2012 therefore this study uses the thiessen polygon method to calculate the precipitation according to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the meteorological station arc gis is used to construct a thiessen polygon and the entire xjr basin is divided into 11 thiessen polygon areas and the area of each meteorological station area is calculated finally the precipitation in the xjr basin was calculated by the area weight the specific formula is as follows 1 p 1 a i 1 n p i a i where p is the precipitation in the basin a i is the area of the ith thiessen polygon p i is the precipitation of the ith thiessen polygon i 1 2 n n is the number of tyson polygons in the area a is the area of the area 3 2 sequence homogeneity mutational and periodic tests the recorded results of hydrological and meteorological stations will be affected by many factors other than the observation object including changes in the location of the stations changes in instruments etc therefore a homogeneity test for the data is necessary in the early stages of the study we adopted the standard normal homogeneity test snht the pettitt test and the von neumann test methods to test the data homogeneity for the specific principles please refer to bickici arikan and kahya 2019 for the determination of the mutation year in the xjr basin this study used the trend free pre whitening mann kendall method tfpw mk to analyze the changes in the hydrological sequence of the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 compared with the classical mann kendall m k method the tfpw mk method can eliminate the influence of sequence autocorrelation on the test results torabi poodeh et al 2021 the specific steps are as follows 1 calculate the linear trend β of the original sequence xt by removing the trend term tt of the sequence xt the sequence yt without the trend term is formed 2 β median x j x i j i i j 3 y t x t t t x t β t among them xi and xj are the original sequences of the ith item and the jth item t is the sequence rank t 1 2 n n is the sequence length 2 calculate the first order autocorrelation coefficient r1 of the sequence yt and remove the autocorrelation items in the sequence 4 r 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i x i 1 x i 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i 2 i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i 2 1 2 5 y t y t r 1 y t 1 where y t is a sequence after removing autocorrelation terms 3 add the trend term tt to get a new series without autocorrelation effects 6 y t y t t t where y t means a new sequence without autocorrelation 4 perform the m k test on the new sequence refer to zhang et al 2021 in addition for the determination of the mutation year we combined the pettitt test method and the cumulative anomaly method to identify the mutation point of the annual runoff series for specific principles please refer to liaqat et al 2021 and the complex morlet wavelet function is used to study the periodicity of runoff in the xjr basin the formula is as follows 7 φ t e t 2 2 e w where t is the time w is the constant and the specific principle can be referred to coulibaly et al 2005 3 3 hydrological situation analysis based on the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva the change in river hydrological situation was evaluated by using 32 hydrological change indicators in 5 groups table 2 and then the degree of change di was used to assess and quantify the degree of impact of each indicator duan et al 2016 the formula is as follows 8 d i n 0 i n e n e 100 wherein d i is the hydrological change of the ith index n 0 i is the number of years that the ith iha value falls within the rva threshold range 25 75 n e is the number of years that the iha value is expected to fall within the rva range after mutation n e n t l n t is the total year of the flow series after mutation the number l is 50 in order to objectively judge the degree of hydrological change based on the impact of hydrological changes on ecosystems richter et al divided the degree of hydrological change d i into three grades that is 0 33 is low degree change l 33 67 is moderate degree change m and 67 100 is high degree change h at the same time the mean of the index is adopted to describe the degree of change in the overall hydrological situation of the river guo et al 2022 the formula is as follows 9 d 0 1 32 i 1 32 d i 2 0 5 where d 0 is the overall change of the river 32 represents the number of hydrological indicators 3 4 runoff variation attribution analysis 3 4 1 elasticity coefficient method based on budyko hypothesis calculate the influencing factors of runoff change on an annual scale by the choudhury yang formula formula 10 the idea is to calculate the elasticity coefficients of the corresponding influencing factors and then use them to calculate the amount of runoff change caused by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the lower pad surface roderick and farquhar 2011 10 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where e is the multi year average actual evapotranspiration mm p is the multi year average annual rainfall mm and n is the lower cushion surface parameter which reflects the basin s overall situation of vegetation soil terrain and land use e t 0 is the multi year average annual potential evapotranspiration mm usually calculated by the fao penman monteith formula and the specific calculation formula and parameters can be referred to isikwue et al 2014 let φ e t 0 p watershed dryness index based on the definition of the elastic coefficient the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the corresponding elastic coefficient of the underlying surface can be calculated by using the full differential form of the hydrothermal coupling balance equation 11 ε p 1 φ n 1 n 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n φ 12 ε e t 0 1 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 n 13 ε n ln 1 φ n φ n ln 1 φ n n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n 1 with ε p ε e t 0 and ε n the amount of runoff change due to the corresponding factors can be calculated δ r p δ p r p ε p δ r e t 0 δ e t 0 r e t 0 ε e t 0 δ r n δ n r n ε n 14 among them the amount of runoff change caused by climate change is the sum of the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration driven runoff and the amount of change driven by human activities is the amount of runoff change caused by changes in the lower cushion surface 3 4 2 abcd model the abcd model considers the water balance relationship within the basin and is a deterministic process model its model structure is shown in fig 3 the model contains four key physical parameters a b c and d and simulates changes in direct runoff base flow soil water actual evapotranspiration and groundwater reserves by inputting potential evapotranspiration and precipitation shahid et al 2018 in order to explore the relationship between the actual evapotranspiration intensity e precipitation p and soil water storage s in the abcd model thomas 1981 assumed that the effective water volume w i and the possible evapotranspiration amount y i followed a nonlinear functional relationship 15 y i w i w i b 2 a w i b 2 a 2 w i b a 0 5 16 y i e i s i w i p i s i 1 soil aquifer redistribution to direct runoff d and groundwater recharge q is 17 d i 1 c w i y i q i c w i y i and assume the aquifer as a linear reservoir 18 f i d g i eventually we can get the total runoff r i 19 r i d i f i among the above the range and physical significance of each parameter are shown in the following table zhang et al 2020 table 3 the above abcd model needs to set the initial values of groundwater initial storage g0 and soil initial storage capacity s0 and the values of a b c and d parameters need to be set our determination of these parameters is based on the genetic algorithm ga method in matlab by repeatedly modifying the overall solution they eventually reach a global optimal situation its specific principles can be referred to galletly 1992 in this research the initial storage capacity of groundwater g0 is 260 mm and the initial storage capacity of soil s0 is 150 mm table 4 summarizes other researchers values for the remaining four parameters alley 1984 ji et al 2021 xin et al 2019 3 4 3 climate change and human contribution rate calculations based on the reconstructed natural runoff sequence of the abcd model a framework for quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff is constructed shahid et al 2020 and the calculation is as follows 20 δ r h δ r δ r c 21 δ r r o b s 2 r o b s 1 22 δ r c r s i m 2 r s i m 1 where δ r is the amount of actual total runoff change mm δ r o b s 1 and δ r o b s 2 is the actual runoff during the natural period and the change period mm δ r c is the amount of runoff change caused by climate change mm r s i m 1 and r s i m 2 are the simulated runoff of the natural period and the change period mm δ r h is the amount of runoff change from human activities mm quantify the extent to which climate change and human activities contribute 23 η c δ r c δ r c δ r h 100 η h δ r h δ r c δ r h 100 in the formula η c and η h are expressed as the contribution rate of climate change and human activities to runoff changes respectively 3 5 reliability verification of the model the performance evaluation of the abcd model uses the objective function o which is composed of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and fitting determination coefficients r 2 between 0 and the closer the o value is to 0 the better the model performance and the higher the degree of coefficients between the simulated value and the measured value moriasi et al 2007 24 n s e 1 i 1 n r o b s i r s i m i 2 i 1 n r o b s i r o b s 2 r 2 r o b s i r o b s i 1 n r s i m i r s i m 2 i 1

the measured data in the period r s i m is the mean of all the simulated data in the period and n is the number of data λ is the weighted specific gravity takes 0 5 in order to better detect the model parameters and simulate the watershed runoff more reasonably the model will be tested and verified in the early stages of the simulation and evaluating the performance and applicability of the model a large number of studies have taken the early runoff sequence which is less affected by human activities as the base period for model validation cao et al 2022 shahid et al 2020 take it as a runoff change in natural situations in this research the runoff from 1961 to 1975 is used as the base period for the model simulation according to the proportion of the natural period 1961 1990 and change period 1991 2019 for the whole period 1961 2019 the base period 1961 1975 is divided into the testing period 1961 1968 and the verification period 1969 1975 the fitting results of the measured values and simulated values in the test period and the verification period are shown in fig 4 a and b and the fitting coefficients are 0 88 and 0 94 respectively simultaneously we evaluate the model effect in the wet season april september and the dry season january march and october december in these two periods in the wet season the fitting coefficients of the testing and verification periods were 0 84 and 0 93 respectively fig 4c and d and in the dry season they were 0 87 and 0 81 respectively fig 4e and f during the testing period and verification period we found that the fitting coefficients of the model in the overall and wet and dry seasons were all above 0 8 which met the standard of excellent fitting fig 5 shows the fitting effect of different periods from 1961 to 2019 and the comparison of the measured and simulated runoff sequences on the monthly scale including the whole period fig 5a and b the wet season of the whole period fig 5c and d and the dry season of the whole period fig 5e and f the fitting coefficients are 0 90 0 87 and 0 87 respectively we can see that the effect of the runoff simulation is very good table 5 shows the calculation results of the evaluation indicators the nse coefficient results in the test period and the verification period are 0 84 and 0 88 respectively and the objective functions in the test period and the verification period are 0 14 and 0 09 respectively in the wet season the nse coefficient results of the test period and the validation period were 0 81 and 0 88 respectively and the objective function was 0 18 and 0 10 respectively in the dry season the nse coefficient results of the test period and the validation period were 0 89 and 0 87 respectively and the objective function was 0 12 and 0 16 we can find that the nse coefficients are all close to 1 and the objective functions are all close to 0 this indicates that the simulation performance of the abcd model is good and it is reliable enough to quantify the relative impacts of human activities and climate change on xiangjiang runoff on a monthly scale 3 6 model uncertainty study hydrological models have certain uncertainties when simulating watershed runoff this study uses the generalized likelihood uncertainty glue method to evaluate the uncertainty of the model the main steps are as follows 1 define the likelihood function 2 determine the parameter s value range and prior distribution function the value range of the parameters in this study is shown in table 4 and the prior distribution function usually chooses the uniform distribution form 3 determine the threshold value and calculate the parameter group likelihood function value 4 when new data is added to the calculation the bayesian function is used to update the weighted likelihood value recursively for the specific principles and formulas of this method please refer to the literature jin et al 2010 it is worth noting that the likelihood function and threshold are determined subjectively in this research the commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency is selected as the likelihood function and the threshold is set to 0 7 the graph below reflects the uncertainty range for the model simulation with 95 confidence during the base period 1961 1975 we can clearly see that the confidence interval covers the measured values very well and only a few parts are outside the confidence interval with a coverage of more than 95 this indicates that the model uncertainty in this study has very little impact on the results of the xjr basin fig 6 4 results 4 1 analysis of sequence homogeneity mutation and periodicity to ensure data homogeneity we used snht pettitt test and von neumann test methods and found that in the test of the significance level a 0 01 the hydrological and meteorological data used in this research have passed the homogeneity test this indicates that the data are reliable and meet the requirements for research use the mutation test results of the runoff sequence of the xjr are shown in table 6 it can be seen that 1990 is the common mutation year detected by the three testing methods so 1990 is designated as the mutation year of xjr runoff therefore the long term sequence of runoff in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 is divided into the natural period 1961 1990 and the change period 1991 2019 by calculating the complex morlet wavelet function of the annual runoff of the xiangtan hydrological station in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 the periodic analysis results were obtained fig 7 in fig 7a it is shown that the sequence has four main periods of 4 8 13 and 25 years based on the analysis of the real part of the wavelet coefficients and the contours of the wavelet coefficients fig 7b we can obtain the four scale change periods corresponding to the four main periods of the xiangjiang annual runoff series which are 3 6 6 10 13 16 and 21 30 years the above results reflect the obvious periodicity of the annual runoff of the xjr therefore it is highly feasible to use the abcd model to simulate the runoff of the xjr 4 2 runoff and climate change characteristics the potential evapotranspiration precipitation and runoff depth changes in the xjr basin before and after the mutation are shown in fig 8 in the whole period 1961 2019 precipitation and runoff depth showed an upward trend and potential evapotranspiration showed a downward trend but due to the influence of the lower cushion surface and climate change the changing trend of potential evapotranspiration changed from decreasing before mutation to increasing after mutation and precipitation and runoff were decreasing in both natural and changing periods the average runoff depth for many years before and after the mutation was 770 mm and 854 mm respectively this indicates that the runoff depth has increased by 84 mm under the combined influence of human activities and climate change and that a significant change has occurred for most rivers precipitation is the main source of supply for their runoff while the xjr is affected by the local climate and the distribution of precipitation in the year is quite different mainly manifested in the spring and summer where precipitation is more abundant and the autumn and winter precipitation is rarer it can be seen from the average monthly distribution of precipitation and runoff in the xjr basin before and after the mutation fig 9 that after the mutation the precipitation in the xjr basin tends to be flattened therefore the distribution of xjr runoff during the year is mainly concentrated from march to august and after mutation flattening occurs at the same time compared with before the mutation the high peak of runoff changed from may to june and the runoff in autumn and winter also increased to varying degrees 4 3 hydrological situation in the xjr basin the degree of hydrological change before and after the sudden change of the xjr basin was analyzed by the iha rva method among the 32 flow hydrological indicators in the xjr basin 1 was changed to a high degree 7 were changed to a moderate degree and the rest were changed to a low degree and the specific results are shown in fig 10 the greatest impact of human activities on the hydrological indicators of each group of xjr flows in the xjr basin is the occurrence time of the minimum annual runoff the degree of change is 100 which is a high degree of change and the hydrological indicators that reach the medium degree of change include the annual average 1d minimum flow 53 45 the annual average 3d minimum flow 52 98 the annual average 7d minimum flow 48 28 the annual average 30d minimum flow 43 10 the base flow index 60 59 the low pulse number 45 55 and the high pulse number 58 62 note 1 32 in fig 10 represents the 32 hydrological indicators in the iha which are no longer described and can be referred to guo et al 2022 the degree of change of hydrological indexes and the degree of overall hydrological change of the 5 groups of xjr basin flow are shown in table 7 the results show that after the mutation the hydrological situation in the xjr basin was most affected by the extreme flow time the degree of change was 71 reaching a high degree of change followed by the frequency of high and low pulses and the changes in the duration and annual extreme flow both of which reached moderate change the degree of change was 43 and 36 and the other two sets of indicators changed to a lower degree than the above three groups of indicators only a low degree of change the overall hydrological situation of the xjr has undergone significant changes with a degree of change of 33 reaching a moderate degree of change 4 4 attribution results of the budyko model for runoff variations the calculations show that the lower cushion surface parameter n of the xjr basin was reduced from 1 124 before the mutation to 1 106 after the mutation indicating that the actual evapotranspiration would be reduced under the condition that the potential evaporation and rainfall were unchanged the coefficients of p et 0 n and their elasticity to runoff in the xjr basin are shown in table 8 which are compared with ε p ε et0 and ε n before the disturbance and after the disturbance ε p is reduced by 0 1 ε et0 is increased by 0 1 and ε n is increased by 0 03 the ε p ε et0 and ε n of the change period were 1 44 0 44 and 0 53 respectively indicating that whenever p et 0 n increased by 1 the runoff depth would increase by 1 44 decrease by 0 44 and decrease by 0 53 respectively runoff variations in the xjr basin are the most sensitive to precipitation and the least sensitive to potential evapotranspiration table 9 shows the contribution of each parameter to the runoff using the elastic coefficient of each influencing factor to the runoff the changes caused by p et 0 and n to the runoff are calculated and the contribution rate of each influencing factor to the runoff is obtained from table 9 compared with the natural period the multi year average runoff depth of the mutation period increased by 84 66 mm the multi year average precipitation p increased by 80 93 mm and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 65 26 mm providing a contribution rate of 77 08 the potential evapotranspiration et 0 decreased by 34 29 mm and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 12 04 mm providing a contribution rate of 14 22 the lower cushion surface parameter n was reduced by 0 018 and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 7 36 mm providing a contribution rate of 8 70 therefore the amount of runoff change caused by climate change precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is 77 30 mm providing a contribution rate of 91 3 4 5 attribution of runoff variations by abcd models on multiple time scales the abcd model was used to simulate the runoff in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 and quantitatively attribute the impact of climate and humans on runoff at different time scales the results are shown in fig 11 the runoff changes are driven by climate change and human activities on a multi year scale were 77 66 mm and 7 00 mm respectively compared with those before the disturbance on the seasonal scale compared with the natural period the occurrence of runoff in spring decreased by 18 17 mm in the change period among which climate change led to a decrease of 3 35 mm and human activities led to a decrease of 14 82 mm indicating that the change of spring runoff was dominated by human activities in the three seasons of summer autumn and winter the runoff has increased to different degrees the runoff change in summer and autumn is dominated by climate change which contributes 88 84 and 99 20 respectively for winter due to the increase of human activities human activities and the impact of climate change on runoff are almost the same and the contribution of human activities to runoff is 47 67 year a represents the results of the abcd model on an annual scale and year b represents the results of the budyko model on an annual scale compared with before mutation on the monthly scale the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff is shown in fig 12 the runoff of the xjr increased in all other months except for april and may which decreased by 19 31 mm and 14 60 mm respectively climate change drove runoff to decrease by 11 70 mm and 7 07 mm in april and may respectively contributing 60 61 and 48 39 and the rest of the months supplemented the runoff among them the contribution of climate change to runoff from july to september exceeded 100 and the highest contribution rate of climate change in september was 169 70 human activities drive runoff to reduce to varying degrees from april to september except june among which may leads to a reduction of 7 53 mm in the runoff contributing 51 6 which is dominant while from october to march of the following year human activities are supplementing the runoff plays an important role and is the dominant factor in the runoff change in october and february contributing 53 85 and 60 12 respectively 5 discussion the runoff process in the natural environment is the key to maintaining the stability of the basin ecosystem this study was found in the study of the ecological and hydrological variables in the xjr basin after the mutation the runoff in the basin increased by 11 and the 32 ecological and hydrological indicators of 5 groups in the xjr basin changed significantly among them the changes in high and low flow pulse indicators will change the structure of the aquatic food chain in the watershed ecosystem hoeinghaus et al 2007 roach et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to discuss the ecological response process and the driving force behind the changes in the hydrological regime of the xjr basin from the perspective of the whole basin system since the change in the hydrological regime of the xjr the fish and vegetation in the basin have produced different responses among them the fish habitat shrinks the spawning time of the four major fish changes accordingly and the sharp decrease in spawning eventually leads to a decrease in the fish diversity index of the xjr yuan et al 2019 the construction of cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the xjr has created an artificial constant environment lacking natural extreme phenomena which may be the main reason for the large change in hydrological indicators at the same time the occurrence of flow homogenization will also reduce the incoming water and nutrients obtained by plain plants in the floodplain in the lower reaches of the xjr resulting in a reduction in vegetation coverage xu et al 2019 our quantitative method based on the deterministic process model further evaluates the impact of the driving factors behind the runoff change on the runoff on various time scales and compares the results with the annual scale quantitative results obtained by the elastic coefficient method of budyko assumption and finds that both are roughly the same proving the reliability of the abcd model on this basis using the model quantitative attribution of runoff changes at the seasonal and monthly scales was achieved based on the budyko model zou et al 2018 found that compared with 1961 1991 the meteorological elements in the lower reaches of the xjr from 1992 to 2013 had a partial increase in precipitation and a decrease in potential evapotranspiration resulting in an increase in runoff production and the contribution to climate change was 87 zhou et al 2019 quantitatively analyzed the causes of runoff changes in the four inflow sub basins of dtl through the double mass curve method and multiple linear regression method and found that the contribution rate of climate change to the xjr runoff was about 85 92 our study not only supports their results on the interannual scale but also extends the analysis to a more detailed time scale and finds that the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff is significantly different on the seasonal and monthly scales on the seasonal scale spring runoff is dominated by human activities contributing 82 while summer and autumn are dominated by climate change contributing 89 and 99 respectively and the impact of the two on runoff in winter is basically the same however on the monthly scale climate change plays a complementary role in runoff throughout the year except april and may the precipitation in april and may decreased compared with that before the sudden change and the potential evapotranspiration increased under the combined drive of the two the runoff was reduced in april and may the climate change in september contributed the most to the supplementary runoff but the average precipitation in september decreased compared with that before the disturbance and the reason was that the average potential evapotranspiration in september decreased this leads to a decrease in actual evapotranspiration which in turn leads to an increase in runoff production das et al 2018 leipprand et al 2006 human activities play a reducing role in runoff from april to september except june the main reason is that the flood season in the xjr basin is from april to september and the reservoir groups in the upper and middle reaches of the xjr basin will play their roles in storing water during the flood season to prevent flooding disasters and at the end of the flood season the reservoir will store water to cope with the shortage of water for living and production during the dry season during the non flood season human activities play a role in supplementing runoff to ensure the production and domestic water of downstream residents hodgkins et al 2017 watts et al 2011 in june human activities drove an increase of 8 27 mm of runoff for two reasons first the reservoir groups in the middle and upper reaches of the xjr will release some of the reservoir capacity in response to the arrival of floods connaughton et al 2014 second in hunan province as the main grain producing province in the country the xjr basin is the main production area and june is the rice panicle period when the irrigation demand is intensified xiao et al 2022 xu et al 2020 wassmann et al 2009 in general the operation of the reservoir group in the middle and upper reaches of the xjr plays a role in peak shaving and replenishment for the runoff during the year and the replenishment mainly plays a role in spring and winter and the operation and scheduling of the reservoir can solve the problem of the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the xjr basin to a certain extent peng et al 2020 van oel et al 2018 in terms of runoff prediction reconstruction the traditional physical model has strict requirements for input data and the lack of some data will lead to inaccurate operation the core of the data driven model such as a neural network is a black box model which simulates the unclear mechanism of runoff and which cannot reflect the hydrological process of runoff changes due to factors such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which is not conducive to the quantitative analysis of the drivers of runoff changes jakeman et al 1993 oyebode et al 2019 sajikumar et al 2015 deterministic process models have been proven to be reliable in hydrological prediction can be simulated for monthly runoff and have the advantages of simple model structure clear mechanism fewer parameters and easy collection of input data gunasekara 2018 the abcd model used in this study is a deterministic process model we introduced the objective function o to evaluate the model in different periods including the test period the verification period the wet and dry seasons of the test period and the wet and dry seasons of the verification period and found that the value of the objective function o is very close to 0 in each period which indicates that the model simulation effect is very good however this model also has certain limitations mainly because it does not fully consider the impact of groundwater evaporation on runoff which may lead to certain fluctuations in the reconstruction of runoff these fluctuations may cause the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the model to be underestimated during the simulation however during the hydrological cycle the change of runoff is mainly dominated by precipitation and human activities and the effect of evapotranspiration on it is very limited dang et al 2021 at the same time some studies have shown that evapotranspiration includes surface evapotranspiration and groundwater evapotranspiration of which groundwater evapotranspiration accounts for a small proportion of the total evapotranspiration yeh et al 2009 moreover the conclusions drawn by budyko in this study and the analysis results of other researchers using different methods for the xjr basin reflect the limited impact of groundwater evapotranspiration on the abcd model zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2018 therefore groundwater evapotranspiration is not fully considered and has very little impact on the abcd model lyu et al 2019 finally we adopted the glue method to evaluate the uncertainty of the model and found that at 95 confidence the model simulation interval covered more than 95 of the observed values jin et al 2010 this shows that the uncertainty generated during the modeling in this study has very little impact on the output of the model and it also reflects that our results of quantifying the driving factors of runoff change in the xjr basin on a fine time scale are reliable this is not only conducive to understanding the hydrological cycle process of the local watershed but also provides a basis for local hydrological forecasting agricultural irrigation ecological scheduling etc 6 conclusion due to the uneven distribution of climatic factors such as precipitation etc within the year and the increase of human activities such as water abstraction and water transfer the changes in the water resources system in the basin are more complex the traditional research on hydrology on an annual scale has not satisfied the planning of sustainable utilization of local water resources we conduct research on the xjr basin on a comprehensive time scale by constructing a systematic and scientific approach we found that the overall hydrological situation of the xjr has reached a moderate change which not only has a negative impact on the local biological reproduction and survival but also is not conducive to the ecological restoration of the dtl wetland at the downstream outlet we used budyko to quantitatively distinguish the contributions of climatic components precipitation and evapotranspiration to xjr runoff change and found that xjr runoff is most sensitive to precipitation and climate change is the main driving factor of its runoff change contributing 91 in addition we further analyzed using the abcd model and found that the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff on the monthly and seasonal scales showed great differences the analytical methods constructed in this study can easily be used to study the ecological responses of watersheds under changing environments as well as to quantify the drivers of watershed runoff changes on integrated time scales annual seasonal and monthly scales so as to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the watershed the study found that climate change has a greater impact on the xjr runoff on the interannual scale but on the seasonal and monthly scales the interference of human activities on the runoff has become very prominent this has brought great challenges to the management and sustainable utilization of water resources in the xjr basin the abcd model uncertainty results show that the modeling uncertainty has a very limited impact on the model output results proving that our quantitative results on different time scales are reliable our research results can provide a scientific basis for basin decision makers on the allocation management and sustainable use of water resources and provide an effective reference for the ecological protection and restoration of the xjr basin and the outflow area dtl although we discuss and analyze the uncertainty in the modeling process in this study more detailed effects such as the correlation between climate change and human activities can also amplify the effects of uncertainty but their research is more complex and difficult in future research we should pay more attention to the uncertainties in the assessment of watersheds in addition this study comprehensively evaluates and analyzes the watershed from two directions and multiple time scales in the future how to analyze the water resources system of the basin from a more comprehensive perspective is also the

7865,study region the xiangjiang river xjr basin china study focus on multiple time scales annual quarterly and monthly there are few comprehensive and comprehensive quantitative evaluation frameworks for the factors that drive changes in watershed runoff the focus of this study is to use the range of variability approach rva to quantitatively analyze the changes in the overall hydrological regime of the basin the budyko model and the deterministic hydrological process model abcd model were then used to quantitatively separate the factors affecting runoff in the monthly window and to clarify the differences in the runoff driving force at different time scales new hydrological insights for the region after the mutation the runoff of the xjr basin increased by 11 and the changes in the five groups of hydrological and ecological indicators indicated that the ecological response process of the basin was undergoing negative changes the contributions of the driving forces on different time scales show significant differences the climatic factor is the dominant factor of the runoff change on the interannual scale however on the seasonal scale human activities have a greater weight in spring accounting for 82 of the total on a monthly scale it presents a more complicated situation human activities contribute significantly in february may and october 60 52 and 54 while climate factors are the main driving factor in the remaining months 51 170 graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecohydrology the budyko model the abcd model driving factor xiangjiang river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the hydrological cycle which includes precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff is key to the sustainable use of water resources in nature dimitriadis et al 2021 yang et al 2021 runoff is a major link in the hydrological cycle and its changes are mainly driven by climate change and human activities farsi et al 2019 kundzewicz 2008 climate change has recently been driven primarily by temperature changes with average global surface temperatures rising by about 1 c since the first industrial revolution resulting in changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which in turn alter runoff processes han et al 2022 schneider et al 2017 the impact of human activities on runoff is mainly reflected in two aspects on the one hand the construction and operation of reservoirs and water intake for life and production will directly affect runoff changes on the other hand the development of industry greenhouse gas emissions land use changes etc will indirectly drive runoff changes sajikumar et al 2015 yang et al 2022 therefore quantifying the impacts of human activities and climate change is important to clarify the mechanism of runoff change in watersheds as an important part of the basin ecosystem and an important condition for the economic development of the basin the change in runoff has a profound impact on the management and sustainable use of water resources in the region howard et al 2016 many scholars have quantitatively studied the reasons that drive runoff changes ryberg et al 2014 wagener et al 2010 wang et al 2018 research methods are mainly divided into two categories one is quantitative attribution of runoff changes based on different analytical formulas based on the budyko hypothesis for example wang et al 2018 analyzed the lower connecticut river through the choudhury yang formula based on the budyko hypothesis and found that climate change is the dominant factor driving the increase in runoff in the region huang et al 2020 used 6 different functions based on the budyko hypothesis to analyze the dongting lake dtl watershed in china their research discovered that the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff dominate during the p1 and p2 periods respectively the other is to simulate the runoff process when not disturbed by human activities through hydrological models including the soil and water assessment tool swat model variable infiltration capacity vic model etc and quantify the contribution of climate and humans to runoff changes by comparing measured runoff and reconstructed runoff yan et al 2020 used the vic model to reconstruct the natural runoff after the luanhe river basin mutation and determined that climate change and the impact of local human activities on local runoff are roughly the same pirnia et al 2019 used swat models to study the haraz river basin in northern iran and found that human activities are the dominant driving force of annual runoff changes in the basin however most of these studies focus on analyzing the driving forces of runoff changes on an interannual scale and lack quantitative attribution of factors affecting runoff changes on more detailed time scales seasonal and monthly scales the seasonal distribution of precipitation and the scheduling and operation of reservoirs during the year can change the annual runoff process in the basin gaudard et al 2018 peng et al 2019 therefore quantitative attribution analysis of runoff on seasonal and monthly scales is essential the abcd model proposed by thomas based on the principle of water balance is widely used in runoff simulation research because of its few parameters strong applicability and clear model concept shahid et al 2020 vandewiele et al 1992 compared the abcd model with other monthly water balance models and found that the abcd model was suitable for multiple watersheds in china myanmar and belgium and proved its reliability in the weihe river basin li et al 2016 compared the abcd model with the dynamic water balance model dwbm thornthwaite mather s water balance tmwb model and vandewiele s water balance model vwbm and found that the four monthly water balance models performed well but the abcd model outperformed the other three models in summary this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for basin hydrology which is mainly divided into the following three steps 1 use the range of variability approach rva to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the degree of change in the watershed hydrology 2 the choudhury yang formula is used to illustrate the contribution of the driving factors precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface behind the runoff change on an interannual scale 3 construct a separation framework with the monthly scale window of the abcd model and quantitatively analyze the impact of human activities and climate change on it at different time scales interannual seasonal and monthly scales under the ecological and hydrological changes of the basin the xiangjiang river xjr is the mother river of hunan province and its drainage area accounts for about 40 of the total area of hunan province it is the most developed area in hunan province and one of the granaries of china its unique water environment provides excellent conditions for the reproduction and wintering of various organisms and also provides support for the ecological protection and restoration of the dtl wetland yuan et al 2019 however in recent decades intensified climate change and high frequency human activities have led to changes in the natural runoff of the xjr which have adversely affected the local ecosystem and the dtl wetland the predecessors have only carried out research on the xjr on a unilateral or single scale and have not conducted a systematic and comprehensive analysis which is inappropriate for such an important watershed therefore this study selects the xjr basin as the research object and the research results can provide new ideas for a comprehensive analysis of the ecological hydrology of the basin and its influencing factors as well as provide a scientific basis for water resources management and ecosystem restoration in the xjr basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xjr is located at 110 50 114 25 e 24 5 28 25 n primarily in hunan province with the eastern part of the basin adjacent to the poyang lake water system and the overall terrain being high in the south and low in the north fig 1 it originates from baishi township xing an county guangxi zhuang autonomous region and flows north into dtl which is the largest river in the dtl water system and one of the eight major tributaries of the yangtze river gao et al 2018 the mainstream of the xjr has a total length of 856 kilometers and a basin area of 94 660 square kilometers and its land use types are mainly arable land and forest land the area belongs to the subtropical humid climate with four distinct seasons and the summer temperature is high and rainy the annual rainfall is relatively abundant so its watershed has many tributaries the water system is developed and the average annual flow into dtl is 7 13 1011 m3 accounting for about 22 4 of the total annual average flow into dtl the xjr basin is a concentrated area of population and industry in hunan province and is also an important grain production base in china to ensure the effective management of local water resources since the 1950s many reservoirs have been built in the upper and middle reaches of the xjr including 20 large scale reservoirs including zhushuqiao dongjiang yongjia and huamuqiao and more than 100 medium sized reservoirs with the development of the local economy society and population the contradiction between the intensification of water demand in the basin and the uneven distribution of precipitation during the year has become more and more acute and the intra year regulation and storage effect of reservoir groups has become more and more obvious 2 2 data the hydrological data used in this study is the daily flow of the xiangtan hydrological station the control station of the xjr outlet from 1961 to 2019 which is derived from the hydrological yearbook of the yangtze river basin meteorological data using the daily meteorological data of 11 meteorological stations such as yongzhou and hengyang from 1961 to 2019 including precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature average relative humidity average wind speed sunshine hours and other indicators which are used to construct meteorological runoff models for research meteorological data is provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the elevation data of the xjr basin comes from the geospatial data cloud https gscloud cn the geographic locations and elevations of all the above stations are shown in table 1 3 methodology previous studies on watershed eco hydrology are often unidirectional and single scale analyses however with the increasingly complex watershed environment previous studies have been unable to meet the needs of local watershed managers we constructed a comprehensive analytical framework for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the watershed s eco hydrological response and drivers of runoff change at multiple time scales fig 2 3 1 precipitation calculation when calculating the precipitation in the basin the commonly used methods are the arithmetic average method the isohyetal method and the thiessen polygon method the arithmetic average method is easily affected by extreme values and does not consider the basin area represented by the meteorological station when using the isohyetal method to calculate it contains a certain degree of subjectivity the idea of the thiessen polygon method is to use the vertical bisector to segment the area taking into account the uneven distribution of precipitation in the area and the result is more reliable faisal et al 2012 therefore this study uses the thiessen polygon method to calculate the precipitation according to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the meteorological station arc gis is used to construct a thiessen polygon and the entire xjr basin is divided into 11 thiessen polygon areas and the area of each meteorological station area is calculated finally the precipitation in the xjr basin was calculated by the area weight the specific formula is as follows 1 p 1 a i 1 n p i a i where p is the precipitation in the basin a i is the area of the ith thiessen polygon p i is the precipitation of the ith thiessen polygon i 1 2 n n is the number of tyson polygons in the area a is the area of the area 3 2 sequence homogeneity mutational and periodic tests the recorded results of hydrological and meteorological stations will be affected by many factors other than the observation object including changes in the location of the stations changes in instruments etc therefore a homogeneity test for the data is necessary in the early stages of the study we adopted the standard normal homogeneity test snht the pettitt test and the von neumann test methods to test the data homogeneity for the specific principles please refer to bickici arikan and kahya 2019 for the determination of the mutation year in the xjr basin this study used the trend free pre whitening mann kendall method tfpw mk to analyze the changes in the hydrological sequence of the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 compared with the classical mann kendall m k method the tfpw mk method can eliminate the influence of sequence autocorrelation on the test results torabi poodeh et al 2021 the specific steps are as follows 1 calculate the linear trend β of the original sequence xt by removing the trend term tt of the sequence xt the sequence yt without the trend term is formed 2 β median x j x i j i i j 3 y t x t t t x t β t among them xi and xj are the original sequences of the ith item and the jth item t is the sequence rank t 1 2 n n is the sequence length 2 calculate the first order autocorrelation coefficient r1 of the sequence yt and remove the autocorrelation items in the sequence 4 r 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i x i 1 x i 1 i 1 n 1 x i x i 2 i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i 2 1 2 5 y t y t r 1 y t 1 where y t is a sequence after removing autocorrelation terms 3 add the trend term tt to get a new series without autocorrelation effects 6 y t y t t t where y t means a new sequence without autocorrelation 4 perform the m k test on the new sequence refer to zhang et al 2021 in addition for the determination of the mutation year we combined the pettitt test method and the cumulative anomaly method to identify the mutation point of the annual runoff series for specific principles please refer to liaqat et al 2021 and the complex morlet wavelet function is used to study the periodicity of runoff in the xjr basin the formula is as follows 7 φ t e t 2 2 e w where t is the time w is the constant and the specific principle can be referred to coulibaly et al 2005 3 3 hydrological situation analysis based on the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva the change in river hydrological situation was evaluated by using 32 hydrological change indicators in 5 groups table 2 and then the degree of change di was used to assess and quantify the degree of impact of each indicator duan et al 2016 the formula is as follows 8 d i n 0 i n e n e 100 wherein d i is the hydrological change of the ith index n 0 i is the number of years that the ith iha value falls within the rva threshold range 25 75 n e is the number of years that the iha value is expected to fall within the rva range after mutation n e n t l n t is the total year of the flow series after mutation the number l is 50 in order to objectively judge the degree of hydrological change based on the impact of hydrological changes on ecosystems richter et al divided the degree of hydrological change d i into three grades that is 0 33 is low degree change l 33 67 is moderate degree change m and 67 100 is high degree change h at the same time the mean of the index is adopted to describe the degree of change in the overall hydrological situation of the river guo et al 2022 the formula is as follows 9 d 0 1 32 i 1 32 d i 2 0 5 where d 0 is the overall change of the river 32 represents the number of hydrological indicators 3 4 runoff variation attribution analysis 3 4 1 elasticity coefficient method based on budyko hypothesis calculate the influencing factors of runoff change on an annual scale by the choudhury yang formula formula 10 the idea is to calculate the elasticity coefficients of the corresponding influencing factors and then use them to calculate the amount of runoff change caused by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the lower pad surface roderick and farquhar 2011 10 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where e is the multi year average actual evapotranspiration mm p is the multi year average annual rainfall mm and n is the lower cushion surface parameter which reflects the basin s overall situation of vegetation soil terrain and land use e t 0 is the multi year average annual potential evapotranspiration mm usually calculated by the fao penman monteith formula and the specific calculation formula and parameters can be referred to isikwue et al 2014 let φ e t 0 p watershed dryness index based on the definition of the elastic coefficient the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the corresponding elastic coefficient of the underlying surface can be calculated by using the full differential form of the hydrothermal coupling balance equation 11 ε p 1 φ n 1 n 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n φ 12 ε e t 0 1 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 n 13 ε n ln 1 φ n φ n ln 1 φ n n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n 1 with ε p ε e t 0 and ε n the amount of runoff change due to the corresponding factors can be calculated δ r p δ p r p ε p δ r e t 0 δ e t 0 r e t 0 ε e t 0 δ r n δ n r n ε n 14 among them the amount of runoff change caused by climate change is the sum of the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration driven runoff and the amount of change driven by human activities is the amount of runoff change caused by changes in the lower cushion surface 3 4 2 abcd model the abcd model considers the water balance relationship within the basin and is a deterministic process model its model structure is shown in fig 3 the model contains four key physical parameters a b c and d and simulates changes in direct runoff base flow soil water actual evapotranspiration and groundwater reserves by inputting potential evapotranspiration and precipitation shahid et al 2018 in order to explore the relationship between the actual evapotranspiration intensity e precipitation p and soil water storage s in the abcd model thomas 1981 assumed that the effective water volume w i and the possible evapotranspiration amount y i followed a nonlinear functional relationship 15 y i w i w i b 2 a w i b 2 a 2 w i b a 0 5 16 y i e i s i w i p i s i

total runoff r i 19 r i d i f i among the above the range and physical significance of each parameter are shown in the following table zhang et al 2020 table 3 the above abcd model needs to set the initial values of groundwater initial storage g0 and soil initial storage capacity s0 and the values of a b c and d parameters need to be set our determination of these parameters is based on the genetic algorithm ga method in matlab by repeatedly modifying the overall solution they eventually reach a global optimal situation its specific principles can be referred to galletly 1992 in this research the initial storage capacity of groundwater g0 is 260 mm and the initial storage capacity of soil s0 is 150 mm table 4 summarizes other researchers values for the remaining four parameters alley 1984 ji et al 2021 xin et al 2019 3 4 3 climate change and human contribution rate calculations based on the reconstructed natural runoff sequence of the abcd model a framework for quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff is constructed shahid et al 2020 and the calculation is as follows 20 δ r h δ r δ r c 21 δ r r o b s 2 r o b s 1 22 δ r c r s i m 2 r s i m 1 where δ r is the amount of actual total runoff change mm δ r o b s 1 and δ r o b s 2 is the actual runoff during the natural period and the change period mm δ r c is the amount of runoff change caused by climate change mm r s i m 1 and r s i m 2 are the simulated runoff of the natural period and the change period mm δ r h is the amount of runoff change from human activities mm quantify the extent to which climate change and human activities contribute 23 η c δ r c δ r c δ r h 100 η h δ r h δ r c δ r h 100 in the formula η c and η h are expressed as the contribution rate of climate change and human activities to runoff changes respectively 3 5 reliability verification of the model the performance evaluation of the abcd model uses the objective function o which is composed of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and fitting determination coefficients r 2 between 0 and the closer the o value is to 0 the better the model performance and the higher the degree of coefficients between the simulated value and the measured value moriasi et al 2007 24 n s e 1 i 1 n r o b s i r s i m i 2 i 1 n r o b s i r o b s 2 r 2 r o b s i r o b s i 1 n r s i m i r s i m 2 i 1

the measured data in the period r s i m is the mean of all the simulated data in the period and n is the number of data λ is the weighted specific gravity takes 0 5 in order to better detect the model parameters and simulate the watershed runoff more reasonably the model will be tested and verified in the early stages of the simulation and evaluating the performance and applicability of the model a large number of studies have taken the early runoff sequence which is less affected by human activities as the base period for model validation cao et al 2022 shahid et al 2020 take it as a runoff change in natural situations in this research the runoff from 1961 to 1975 is used as the base period for the model simulation according to the proportion of the natural period 1961 1990 and change period 1991 2019 for the whole period 1961 2019 the base period 1961 1975 is divided into the testing period 1961 1968 and the verification period 1969 1975 the fitting results of the measured values and simulated values in the test period and the verification period are shown in fig 4 a and b and the fitting coefficients are 0 88 and 0 94 respectively simultaneously we evaluate the model effect in the wet season april september and the dry season january march and october december in these two periods in the wet season the fitting coefficients of the testing and verification periods were 0 84 and 0 93 respectively fig 4c and d and in the dry season they were 0 87 and 0 81 respectively fig 4e and f during the testing period and verification period we found that the fitting coefficients of the model in the overall and wet and dry seasons were all above 0 8 which met the standard of excellent fitting fig 5 shows the fitting effect of different periods from 1961 to 2019 and the comparison of the measured and simulated runoff sequences on the monthly scale including the whole period fig 5a and b the wet season of the whole period fig 5c and d and the dry season of the whole period fig 5e and f the fitting coefficients are 0 90 0 87 and 0 87 respectively we can see that the effect of the runoff simulation is very good table 5 shows the calculation results of the evaluation indicators the nse coefficient results in the test period and the verification period are 0 84 and 0 88 respectively and the objective functions in the test period and the verification period are 0 14 and 0 09 respectively in the wet season the nse coefficient results of the test period and the validation period were 0 81 and 0 88 respectively and the objective function was 0 18 and 0 10 respectively in the dry season the nse coefficient results of the test period and the validation period were 0 89 and 0 87 respectively and the objective function was 0 12 and 0 16 we can find that the nse coefficients are all close to 1 and the objective functions are all close to 0 this indicates that the simulation performance of the abcd model is good and it is reliable enough to quantify the relative impacts of human activities and climate change on xiangjiang runoff on a monthly scale 3 6 model uncertainty study hydrological models have certain uncertainties when simulating watershed runoff this study uses the generalized likelihood uncertainty glue method to evaluate the uncertainty of the model the main steps are as follows 1 define the likelihood function 2 determine the parameter s value range and prior distribution function the value range of the parameters in this study is shown in table 4 and the prior distribution function usually chooses the uniform distribution form 3 determine the threshold value and calculate the parameter group likelihood function value 4 when new data is added to the calculation the bayesian function is used to update the weighted likelihood value recursively for the specific principles and formulas of this method please refer to the literature jin et al 2010 it is worth noting that the likelihood function and threshold are determined subjectively in this research the commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency is selected as the likelihood function and the threshold is set to 0 7 the graph below reflects the uncertainty range for the model simulation with 95 confidence during the base period 1961 1975 we can clearly see that the confidence interval covers the measured values very well and only a few parts are outside the confidence interval with a coverage of more than 95 this indicates that the model uncertainty in this study has very little impact on the results of the xjr basin fig 6 4 results 4 1 analysis of sequence homogeneity mutation and periodicity to ensure data homogeneity we used snht pettitt test and von neumann test methods and found that in the test of the significance level a 0 01 the hydrological and meteorological data used in this research have passed the homogeneity test this indicates that the data are reliable and meet the requirements for research use the mutation test results of the runoff sequence of the xjr are shown in table 6 it can be seen that 1990 is the common mutation year detected by the three testing methods so 1990 is designated as the mutation year of xjr runoff therefore the long term sequence of runoff in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 is divided into the natural period 1961 1990 and the change period 1991 2019 by calculating the complex morlet wavelet function of the annual runoff of the xiangtan hydrological station in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 the periodic analysis results were obtained fig 7 in fig 7a it is shown that the sequence has four main periods of 4 8 13 and 25 years based on the analysis of the real part of the wavelet coefficients and the contours of the wavelet coefficients fig 7b we can obtain the four scale change periods corresponding to the four main periods of the xiangjiang annual runoff series which are 3 6 6 10 13 16 and 21 30 years the above results reflect the obvious periodicity of the annual runoff of the xjr therefore it is highly feasible to use the abcd model to simulate the runoff of the xjr 4 2 runoff and climate change characteristics the potential evapotranspiration precipitation and runoff depth changes in the xjr basin before and after the mutation are shown in fig 8 in the whole period 1961 2019 precipitation and runoff depth showed an upward trend and potential evapotranspiration showed a downward trend but due to the influence of the lower cushion surface and climate change the changing trend of potential evapotranspiration changed from decreasing before mutation to increasing after mutation and precipitation and runoff were decreasing in both natural and changing periods the average runoff depth for many years before and after the mutation was 770 mm and 854 mm respectively this indicates that the runoff depth has increased by 84 mm under the combined influence of human activities and climate change and that a significant change has occurred for most rivers precipitation is the main source of supply for their runoff while the xjr is affected by the local climate and the distribution of precipitation in the year is quite different mainly manifested in the spring and summer where precipitation is more abundant and the autumn and winter precipitation is rarer it can be seen from the average monthly distribution of precipitation and runoff in the xjr basin before and after the mutation fig 9 that after the mutation the precipitation in the xjr basin tends to be flattened therefore the distribution of xjr runoff during the year is mainly concentrated from march to august and after mutation flattening occurs at the same time compared with before the mutation the high peak of runoff changed from may to june and the runoff in autumn and winter also increased to varying degrees 4 3 hydrological situation in the xjr basin the degree of hydrological change before and after the sudden change of the xjr basin was analyzed by the iha rva method among the 32 flow hydrological indicators in the xjr basin 1 was changed to a high degree 7 were changed to a moderate degree and the rest were changed to a low degree and the specific results are shown in fig 10 the greatest impact of human activities on the hydrological indicators of each group of xjr flows in the xjr basin is the occurrence time of the minimum annual runoff the degree of change is 100 which is a high degree of change and the hydrological indicators that reach the medium degree of change include the annual average 1d minimum flow 53 45 the annual average 3d minimum flow 52 98 the annual average 7d minimum flow 48 28 the annual average 30d minimum flow 43 10 the base flow index 60 59 the low pulse number 45 55 and the high pulse number 58 62 note 1 32 in fig 10 represents the 32 hydrological indicators in the iha which are no longer described and can be referred to guo et al 2022 the degree of change of hydrological indexes and the degree of overall hydrological change of the 5 groups of xjr basin flow are shown in table 7 the results show that after the mutation the hydrological situation in the xjr basin was most affected by the extreme flow time the degree of change was 71 reaching a high degree of change followed by the frequency of high and low pulses and the changes in the duration and annual extreme flow both of which reached moderate change the degree of change was 43 and 36 and the other two sets of indicators changed to a lower degree than the above three groups of indicators only a low degree of change the overall hydrological situation of the xjr has undergone significant changes with a degree of change of 33 reaching a moderate degree of change 4 4 attribution results of the budyko model for runoff variations the calculations show that the lower cushion surface parameter n of the xjr basin was reduced from 1 124 before the mutation to 1 106 after the mutation indicating that the actual evapotranspiration would be reduced under the condition that the potential evaporation and rainfall were unchanged the coefficients of p et 0 n and their elasticity to runoff in the xjr basin are shown in table 8 which are compared with ε p ε et0 and ε n before the disturbance and after the disturbance ε p is reduced by 0 1 ε et0 is increased by 0 1 and ε n is increased by 0 03 the ε p ε et0 and ε n of the change period were 1 44 0 44 and 0 53 respectively indicating that whenever p et 0 n increased by 1 the runoff depth would increase by 1 44 decrease by 0 44 and decrease by 0 53 respectively runoff variations in the xjr basin are the most sensitive to precipitation and the least sensitive to potential evapotranspiration table 9 shows the contribution of each parameter to the runoff using the elastic coefficient of each influencing factor to the runoff the changes caused by p et 0 and n to the runoff are calculated and the contribution rate of each influencing factor to the runoff is obtained from table 9 compared with the natural period the multi year average runoff depth of the mutation period increased by 84 66 mm the multi year average precipitation p increased by 80 93 mm and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 65 26 mm providing a contribution rate of 77 08 the potential evapotranspiration et 0 decreased by 34 29 mm and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 12 04 mm providing a contribution rate of 14 22 the lower cushion surface parameter n was reduced by 0 018 and the amount of runoff change caused by it increased by 7 36 mm providing a contribution rate of 8 70 therefore the amount of runoff change caused by climate change precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is 77 30 mm providing a contribution rate of 91 3 4 5 attribution of runoff variations by abcd models on multiple time scales the abcd model was used to simulate the runoff in the xjr basin from 1961 to 2019 and quantitatively attribute the impact of climate and humans on runoff at different time scales the results are shown in fig 11 the runoff changes are driven by climate change and human activities on a multi year scale were 77 66 mm and 7 00 mm respectively compared with those before the disturbance on the seasonal scale compared with the natural period the occurrence of runoff in spring decreased by 18 17 mm in the change period among which climate change led to a decrease of 3 35 mm and human activities led to a decrease of 14 82 mm indicating that the change of spring runoff was dominated by human activities in the three seasons of summer autumn and winter the runoff has increased to different degrees the runoff change in summer and autumn is dominated by climate change which contributes 88 84 and 99 20 respectively for winter due to the increase of human activities human activities and the impact of climate change on runoff are almost the same and the contribution of human activities to runoff is 47 67 year a represents the results of the abcd model on an annual scale and year b represents the results of the budyko model on an annual scale compared with before mutation on the monthly scale the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff is shown in fig 12 the runoff of the xjr increased in all other months except for april and may which decreased by 19 31 mm and 14 60 mm respectively climate change drove runoff to decrease by 11 70 mm and 7 07 mm in april and may respectively contributing 60 61 and 48 39 and the rest of the months supplemented the runoff among them the contribution of climate change to runoff from july to september exceeded 100 and the highest contribution rate of climate change in september was 169 70 human activities drive runoff to reduce to varying degrees from april to september except june among which may leads to a reduction of 7 53 mm in the runoff contributing 51 6 which is dominant while from october to march of the following year human activities are supplementing the runoff plays an important role and is the dominant factor in the runoff change in october and february contributing 53 85 and 60 12 respectively 5 discussion the runoff process in the natural environment is the key to maintaining the stability of the basin ecosystem this study was found in the study of the ecological and hydrological variables in the xjr basin after the mutation the runoff in the basin increased by 11 and the 32 ecological and hydrological indicators of 5 groups in the xjr basin changed significantly among them the changes in high and low flow pulse indicators will change the structure of the aquatic food chain in the watershed ecosystem hoeinghaus et al 2007 roach et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to discuss the ecological response process and the driving force behind the changes in the hydrological regime of the xjr basin from the perspective of the whole basin system since the change in the hydrological regime of the xjr the fish and vegetation in the basin have produced different responses among them the fish habitat shrinks the spawning time of the four major fish changes accordingly and the sharp decrease in spawning eventually leads to a decrease in the fish diversity index of the xjr yuan et al 2019 the construction of cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the xjr has created an artificial constant environment lacking natural extreme phenomena which may be the main reason for the large change in hydrological indicators at the same time the occurrence of flow homogenization will also reduce the incoming water and nutrients obtained by plain plants in the floodplain in the lower reaches of the xjr resulting in a reduction in vegetation coverage xu et al 2019 our quantitative method based on the deterministic process model further evaluates the impact of the driving factors behind the runoff change on the runoff on various time scales and compares the results with the annual scale quantitative results obtained by the elastic coefficient method of budyko assumption and finds that both are roughly the same proving the reliability of the abcd model on this basis using the model quantitative attribution of runoff changes at the seasonal and monthly scales was achieved based on the budyko model zou et al 2018 found that compared with 1961 1991 the meteorological elements in the lower reaches of the xjr from 1992 to 2013 had a partial increase in precipitation and a decrease in potential evapotranspiration resulting in an increase in runoff production and the contribution to climate change was 87 zhou et al 2019 quantitatively analyzed the causes of runoff changes in the four inflow sub basins of dtl through the double mass curve method and multiple linear regression method and found that the contribution rate of climate change to the xjr runoff was about 85 92 our study not only supports their results on the interannual scale but also extends the analysis to a more detailed time scale and finds that the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff is significantly different on the seasonal and monthly scales on the seasonal scale spring runoff is dominated by human activities contributing 82 while summer and autumn are dominated by climate change contributing 89 and 99 respectively and the impact of the two on runoff in winter is basically the same however on the monthly scale climate change plays a complementary role in runoff throughout the year except april and may the precipitation in april and may decreased compared with that before the sudden change and the potential evapotranspiration increased under the combined drive of the two the runoff was reduced in april and may the climate change in september contributed the most to the supplementary runoff but the average precipitation in september decreased compared with that before the disturbance and the reason was that the average potential evapotranspiration in september decreased this leads to a decrease in actual evapotranspiration which in turn leads to an increase in runoff production das et al 2018 leipprand et al 2006 human activities play a reducing role in runoff from april to september except june the main reason is that the flood season in the xjr basin is from april to september and the reservoir groups in the upper and middle reaches of the xjr basin will play their roles in storing water during the flood season to prevent flooding disasters and at the end of the flood season the reservoir will store water to cope with the shortage of water for living and production during the dry season during the non flood season human activities play a role in supplementing runoff to ensure the production and domestic water of downstream residents hodgkins et al 2017 watts et al 2011 in june human activities drove an increase of 8 27 mm of runoff for two reasons first the reservoir groups in the middle and upper reaches of the xjr will release some of the reservoir capacity in response to the arrival of floods connaughton et al 2014 second in hunan province as the main grain producing province in the country the xjr basin is the main production area and june is the rice panicle period when the irrigation demand is intensified xiao et al 2022 xu et al 2020 wassmann et al 2009 in general the operation of the reservoir group in the middle and upper reaches of the xjr plays a role in peak shaving and replenishment for the runoff during the year and the replenishment mainly plays a role in spring and winter and the operation and scheduling of the reservoir can solve the problem of the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the xjr basin to a certain extent peng et al 2020 van oel et al 2018 in terms of runoff prediction reconstruction the traditional physical model has strict requirements for input data and the lack of some data will lead to inaccurate operation the core of the data driven model such as a neural network is a black box model which simulates the unclear mechanism of runoff and which cannot reflect the hydrological process of runoff changes due to factors such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which is not conducive to the quantitative analysis of the drivers of runoff changes jakeman et al 1993 oyebode et al 2019 sajikumar et al 2015 deterministic process models have been proven to be reliable in hydrological prediction can be simulated for monthly runoff and have the advantages of simple model structure clear mechanism fewer parameters and easy collection of input data gunasekara 2018 the abcd model used in this study is a deterministic process model we introduced the objective function o to evaluate the model in different periods including the test period the verification period the wet and dry seasons of the test period and the wet and dry seasons of the verification period and found that the value of the objective function o is very close to 0 in each period which indicates that the model simulation effect is very good however this model also has certain limitations mainly because it does not fully consider the impact of groundwater evaporation on runoff which may lead to certain fluctuations in the reconstruction of runoff these fluctuations may cause the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the model to be underestimated during the simulation however during the hydrological cycle the change of runoff is mainly dominated by precipitation and human activities and the effect of evapotranspiration on it is very limited dang et al 2021 at the same time some studies have shown that evapotranspiration includes surface evapotranspiration and groundwater evapotranspiration of which groundwater evapotranspiration accounts for a small proportion of the total evapotranspiration yeh et al 2009 moreover the conclusions drawn by budyko in this study and the analysis results of other researchers using different methods for the xjr basin reflect the limited impact of groundwater evapotranspiration on the abcd model zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2018 therefore groundwater evapotranspiration is not fully considered and has very little impact on the abcd model lyu et al 2019 finally we adopted the glue method to evaluate the uncertainty of the model and found that at 95 confidence the model simulation interval covered more than 95 of the observed values jin et al 2010 this shows that the uncertainty generated during the modeling in this study has very little impact on the output of the model and it also reflects that our results of quantifying the driving factors of runoff change in the xjr basin on a fine time scale are reliable this is not only conducive to understanding the hydrological cycle process of the local watershed but also provides a basis for local hydrological forecasting agricultural irrigation ecological scheduling etc 6 conclusion due to the uneven distribution of climatic factors such as precipitation etc within the year and the increase of human activities such as water abstraction and water transfer the changes in the water resources system in the basin are more complex the traditional research on hydrology on an annual scale has not satisfied the planning of sustainable utilization of local water resources we conduct research on the xjr basin on a comprehensive time scale by constructing a systematic and scientific approach we found that the overall hydrological situation of the xjr has reached a moderate change which not only has a negative impact on the local biological reproduction and survival but also is not conducive to the ecological restoration of the dtl wetland at the downstream outlet we used budyko to quantitatively distinguish the contributions of climatic components precipitation and evapotranspiration to xjr runoff change and found that xjr runoff is most sensitive to precipitation and climate change is the main driving factor of its runoff change contributing 91 in addition we further analyzed using the abcd model and found that the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff on the monthly and seasonal scales showed great differences the analytical methods constructed in this study can easily be used to study the ecological responses of watersheds under changing environments as well as to quantify the drivers of watershed runoff changes on integrated time scales annual seasonal and monthly scales so as to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the watershed the study found that climate change has a greater impact on the xjr runoff on the interannual scale but on the seasonal and monthly scales the interference of human activities on the runoff has become very prominent this has brought great challenges to the management and sustainable utilization of water resources in the xjr basin the abcd model uncertainty results show that the modeling uncertainty has a very limited impact on the model output results proving that our quantitative results on different time scales are reliable our research results can provide a scientific basis for basin decision makers on the allocation management and sustainable use of water resources and provide an effective reference for the ecological protection and restoration of the xjr basin and the outflow area dtl although we discuss and analyze the uncertainty in the modeling process in this study more detailed effects such as the correlation between climate change and human activities can also amplify the effects of uncertainty but their research is more complex and difficult in future research we should pay more attention to the uncertainties in the assessment of watersheds in addition this study comprehensively evaluates and analyzes the watershed from two directions and multiple time scales in the future how to analyze the water resources system of the basin from a more comprehensive perspective is also the

request 1 introduction precipitation is a critical parameter in coupled land surface atmosphere interactions and reliable precipitation data is essential for understanding climate change and water cycle processes at regional and global scales beck et al 2017 lu et al 2020 sui et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 however in some mountainous areas obtaining accurate precipitation data is still a challenge due to sparse gauge networks and large spatial variability in precipitation bai and liu 2018 fan et al 2021 the tibetan plateau tp is an example of a region with complex topography and limited precipitation observation sites zhang et al 2018 the thermodynamic properties of the tp have a far reaching impact on the east asian monsoon and climate gao and liu 2013 zhang and gao 2021 additionally the tp is the source area of many major rivers in the world such as yellow river yangtze river and lancang river zhang and gao 2021 the sparse networks of ground observations affect the accurate understanding of the hydrothermal process in the tp with the development of remote sensing and data assimilation technology many precipitation datasets covering the world have been developed

driven by hydrological models have achieved good simulation results in many basins on the tp alazzy et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however these precipitation datasets are obtained based on indirect means and their accuracy needs to be verified based on ground observations currently many studies on the applicability of these precipitation datasets based on ground observations have been performed on the tp bai and liu 2018 ma et al 2016 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the results indicated tmpa and cmorph showed overall better performance than persiann gao and liu 2013 the detection ability of imerg was superior to that of tmpa and the imerg products performed better than the tmpa products on multiple timescales ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 aphrodite outperformed chirps and persiann cdr against observations at the annual scale tan et al 2020 chirps and mswep overestimated the daily precipitation and mswep performed better than chirps at the daily scale over the tp liu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 evaluated the performances of era5 era5 land and imerg over mainland china and found all of these products showed the poorest performance over subregions of plateau mountain climate previously the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used to evaluate the ability of precipitation events recorded by gridded precipitation data and only the data with daily precipitation greater than 1 mm were selected in the calculation of these indicators gao and liu 2013 tan et al 2020 liu et al 2019 this threshold may not be appropriate because precipitation events with daily precipitation less than 1 mm are the main events in the cold season in many regions of the tp zhang et al 2015 in addition many studies did not adjust for precipitation observation errors when ground based observations were used as a reference however the precipitation recorded by the rain gauge is generally lower than the true value due to the influence of wetting loss evaporation loss and wind induced undercatch according to the precipitation measurement intercomparison experiments carried out by the world meteorological organization wmo buisán et al 2020 pollock et al 2018 yang et al 2005 especially when it is solid precipitation the catch efficiency of the rain gauge is generally below 70 pierre et al 2019 studies also had shown that the chinese standard precipitation gauge cspg captures 82 9 of solid precipitation in the qilian mountains of eastern tp chen et al 2015 and 46 43 of solid precipitation in central tp zhang et al 2022 these errors may lead to uncertainty in the previous evaluation results and the evaluation of cold season precipitation needs to be further strengthened in this context the applicability of gridded precipitation data in the cold season of the tp was re evaluated based on the daily precipitation data recorded by 133 stations of the china meterological administration cma and the half hour precipitation data recorded by 10 stations of the chinese academy of sciences cas in this study considering that data with higher spatial resolution is more

can be found in the literatures by zhao et al 2021 ma 2020b and ma et al 2020c 2 3 gridded precipitation datasets in this study six high resolution precipitation datasets were employed including the aimerg ma et al 2020a chirps version 2 0 funk et al 2015 cmfd he et al 2020 era5 land hersbach et al 2020 imerg huffman et al 2015 and persiann ccs cdr sadeghi et al 2021 aimerg is obtained by correcting imerg with aphrodite and aphrodite is the gridded precipitation data obtained by interpolation of observational data cmfd is obtained based on the fusion of cma observation data glass reanalysis data and trmm 3b42 v7 remote sensing data it should be noted that most of the gauge observed precipitation data from cma stations was involved in aimerg and cmfd however we did not exclude these cma stations when evaluating cmfd and aimerg on the one hand it is because the specific sites involved in cmfd and aimerg cannot be determined on the other hand we used the corrected cma precipitation data as a reference while cmfd and aimerg involved uncorrected precipitation data and it is also necessary to know the accuracy of cmfd and aimerg in the cold season of the tp chirps is

and persiann cdr and the precipitation estimates are adjusted based on the global precipitation climatology project gpcp data sadeghi et al 2021 the production of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr did not or rarely use observation data at cma stations overview of the six high resolution precipitation datasets can be seen in table 2 and a more detailed description of these data can be found in the references listed in this section 2 4 methods 2 4 1 observation data processing method due to the bad natural environment and unstable power supply system the phenomenon of discontinuous observation data recording often exists so the obtained observation data need to be processed because the temperature and wind speed data mainly serve for the correction of precipitation observation error the data processing is mainly based on precipitation for geonor if the accumulated precipitation of the geonor rain gauge does not change before and after a period when there is a lack of data it means that no precipitation has occurred and all the precipitation during this period is 0 mm if precipitation occurs during the period of missing data the precipitation during this period is only used to calculate and obtain monthly precipitation data not for the evaluation of high resolution precipitation datasets at daily time scale for cspg whether precipitation occurs during a period when the data is missing can be determined by the surrounding nearby stations if there is no precipitation at the surrounding stations all the missing precipitation data are set to 0 mm if there is

season the manual observation results of he et al 2009 at the tgl station showed that snowfall mainly occurred from mid september to mid june of the following year our observations at blh station during 2018 and 2020 showed that snowfall mainly occurs from mid september to early june of the following year fig 2 since the snowfall at the blh station in september mainly occurs at night it will also occur when the average daily temperature is above 4 c combining the observation results of tgl and blh stations we define the cold season as october of each year to may of the next year based on the longitude and latitude of the meteorological stations find the nearest grid point in the high resolution precipitation data extract the same precipitation time series of the grid point as the observed data and process the daily and monthly precipitation data the accuracy of high resolution precipitation data is evaluated by the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical

and csi are to 1 the closer far is to 0 the better the probability of product to detect precipitation events the range of cc is from 1 1 the ranges of rb and rmse are from to and from 0 to the closer the cc is to 1 the closer the rb is to 0 and the closer the rmse is to 0 the more accurate will be the precipitation obtained by this dataset as compared to that by the adjusted gauge based precipitation 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of cold season precipitation based on the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 and kochendorfer et al 2017 the daily precipitation recorded by the cspg and half hourly precipitation recorded by the geonor at the 143 meteorological stations during the study period were adjusted and unadjusted and adjusted gauge recorded annual average cold season precipitation in the tp were calculated figs 3a and 3b as the data for ldh is less than one year the site is not shown in the fig 3 before the adjustment the areal mean annual cold season precipitation in the tp based on the station observations was 147 1 mm after the adjustment the areal mean annual cold season precipitation increased by 0 945 spatially the adjustment of errors has little effect on the spatial distribution pattern of annual precipitation in the cold season on the tp before and after the adjustment the stations with high precipitation 300 mm in the cold season are mainly concentrated in sichuan and southeastern tibet and the stations with low precipitation 20 mm are concentrated in the qaidam basin and western tibet based on the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr products the spatial distributions of annual average precipitation in the cold season over the tp from 2003 to 2015 were obtained fig 3c h as can be seen from fig 3 these six precipitation products all reveal that high precipitation occurs in sichuan and southeastern tibet on the tp and low precipitation occurs in the qaidam basin which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the observational data but in other regions the spatial patterns of precipitation revealed by these six products are quite different especially in the western region where precipitation observation data is lacking for example aimerg and imerg revealed that the precipitation in the northwestern tp is below 100 mm but chirps era5 land and persiann ccs cdr revealed that the precipitation in this area can reach more than 300 mm from the perspective of temporal patterns fig 4 all of the six products showed that the precipitation in the cold season of the tp was the largest in may and the smallest in december however the cold season precipitation of aimerg imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the tp from 2003 to 2015 showed an upward trend and the change rates were 0 3019 0 0639 and 0 115 mm a respectively the cold season precipitation of chirps cmfd and era5 land showed a downward trend and the change rates were 0 5604 1 145 and 2 0994 mm a respectively the correlation coefficient obtained based on the cold season precipitation time series fig 5 shows that the correlation coefficient between imerg and the other five precipitation products is the highest with an average value above 0 76 the correlation coefficient between the era5 land data and other precipitation products is the lowest and the average value is below 0 5 3 2 evaluation of the six precipitation products at annual scale to further investigate the accuracy of the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr the annual cold season precipitation recorded by the six products were also compared with the adjusted gauge observations fig 6 the persiann ccs cdr has the worst consistency with the observed data with cc being 0 46 era5 land substantially overestimates the precipitation with rb and rmse being 85 29 and 188 80 mm year respectively while aimerg chirps imerg underestimate the precipitation with rb being 36 22 9 29 16 97 and rmse being 96 89 mm year 92 26 mm year 70 52 mm year respectively the cmfd is closest to the precipitation recorded by the gauge observations with cc rb and rmse being 0 94 1 10 and 54 79 mm year respectively among the four products made with no or only a small number of cma stations imerg has the highest precision 3 3 evaluation of the six precipitation products at monthly scale taking the adjusted monthly precipitation as a reference the cc rb and rmse for the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp were calculated fig 7 and fig 8 spatially aimerg chirps era5 land and imerg data all show higher cc values in the eastern and southeastern tp revealing that the products are more likely to be in better agreement with gauge observations in areas with high precipitation rb in fig 7 shows that era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate cold season precipitation while aimerg chirps and imerg underestimate precipitation at most stations the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr products show that the rmse values are larger for sites located in the eastern and southeastern tp indicating that the error of the products is larger in areas with high precipitation box plots of cc rb and rmse fig 8 are used to compare the overall accuracy of cold season precipitation recorded by the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr the results show that cmfd has the largest cc value the best rb value and the smallest rmse value and is considered to be the most accurate product for recording the monthly precipitation in the tp among the four products made with no or only a small number of cma stations imerg also has the highest precision at monthly scale overall the conclusions based on monthly data are consistent with those based on annual data and the accuracy of cmfd and imerg in recording cold season precipitation is better than the other four products at annual and monthly scales 3 4 evaluation of the six precipitation products at daily scale random errors of the geonor relating to signal noise make it difficult to record light precipitation events zhang et al 2015 2022 therefore only data from cma stations were used to assess the accuracy of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr for recording cold season precipitation events using the daily precipitation data recorded by 133 cma meteorological stations on the tp from 2003 to 2015 as a reference pod far and csi were calculated and the accuracy of the six products for recording cold season precipitation events was assessed fig 9 and fig 10 in terms of the pod the era5 land exhibit the best performance with pod values at all stations being larger than 0 7 and the median is larger than 0 9 the cmfd also exhibit good performance with pod values at most stations being larger than 0 6 and the median is larger than 0 8 the chirps exhibit the worst performance with pod values at most stations being smaller than 0 5 and the median is smaller than 0 4 as for the far the era5 land performed the worst with far values at most stations being larger than 0 5 and the median is larger than 0 6 the main reason is that era5 land prefers nonzero estimates hersbach et al 2020 ma et al 2022 but there are few precipitation events in the cold season in the tp which leads to the era5 land erroneously record many precipitation events that did not occur while recording the real events the aimerg and cmfd performed better than the other four products the far values of the aimerg and cmfd at most stations were generally smaller than 0 5 and both medians were slightly above 0 4 csi is a comprehensive index of pod and far and can be used to provide an overall description of products for accurately capturing precipitation events ma et al 2022 the csi values of the six precipitation products in fig 9 are high in the eastern and southeastern parts of the tp and low in the northern and southern parts revealing that the precipitation products recorded more accurate precipitation events in areas with high precipitation than in areas with low precipitation box plots of csi in fig 10 also revealed that the accuracy of cmfd recorded cold season precipitation events over the tp was higher than that of the other five products while the cold season precipitation events recorded by chirps had the worst accuracy the daily cc rb and rmse for the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp were also calculated fig 11 and fig 12 the results show that the cc of the six precipitation products on the daily scale is lower than that on the monthly scale which means that the consistency between the products and the observed data on the daily scale is much lower than that on the monthly scale rb and rmse in fig 11 show that era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate while aimerg chirps cmfd and imerg underestimate daily precipitation at most stations and the error of the six products is larger in areas with high precipitation which are consistent with the results on the monthly scale box plots of cc rb and rmse fig 12 show that cmfd and aimerg have higher consistency and accuracy with the observed data than the other four products on the daily scale which is inconsistent with the results on the monthly scale 3 5 evaluation of the products for recording extreme snow events to evaluate the ability of the products for recording extreme snow events a typical case in yushu in southern qinghai province were selected in february 2019 yushu suffered the worst snow disaster in 60 years more than 40 000 yaks and tibetan sheep died and 58 289 people were affected according to the information released by cma the main reason for this snow disaster is that 12 precipitation events occurred in yushu from november 2018 to february 2019 and the precipitation was significantly higher than that in the same period of previous years fig 13 shows the precipitation anomaly of from november to february in yushu from 2003 to 2020 since aimerg and cmfd have no data after 2015 and 2018 only chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr are selected as can be seen from fig 13 chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr all reveal that the precipitation from november 2018 to february 2019 is much higher than that in the same period before indicating that these products can reflect the snow disaster the information released by cma also indicates that the reason for this snow disaster is that there were 12 relatively large snowfalls during the period from november 1 2018 to february 20 2019 by analyzing the daily precipitation in yushu recorded by chirps era5 land imerg and persiann css cdr in the same period fig 14 it is found that although chirps era5 land and persiann css cdr all recorded these 12 snowfall events these products also recorded many large snowfall events in addition to these 12 events imerg recorded fewer total snow events than chirps era5 land and persiann css cdr but at least 2 of the 12 events were not recorded and some events outside of these 12 precipitation events were also recorded from this result it is difficult to accurately judge the occurrence of snow disasters at daily scale based on these precipitation products 4 discussion in this study we evaluated the accuracies of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in recording precipitation in the cold season over the tp based on the observational data obtained from 133 cma sites and 10 cas sites among these six gridded precipitation products cmfd is obtained based on the fusion of cma observation data glass reanalysis data and trmm 3b42 v7 remote sensing data as a result the evaluation results on annual monthly and daily scales show that the accuracy of cmfd is better than the other five products previous snow cover simulation tests in the irtysh river basin in xinjiang also show that the results of using cmfd as forcing data are better than era interim gao et al 2021 therefore cmfd precipitation product is recommended in the eastern tp where there are many observation stations aimerg is obtained by correcting imerg with aphrodite ma et al 2020a so the spatial distribution of cold season precipitation between aimerg and imerg has good consistency aphrodite is the gridded precipitation data obtained by interpolation of observational data and many cma stations are also used yatagai et al 2012 therefore the accuracy of aimerg is higher than that of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the daily scale however because aphrodite did not correct the observation errors the precipitation recorded by aimerg is seriously underestimated and the accuracy on the annual scale is even lower than that of imerg the production of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr did not or rarely use observation data at cma stations from the evaluation results imerg has the highest accuracy considering that aimerg and cmfd stopped data updates in 2015 and 2018 respectively imerg is recommended when the latest cold season precipitation data on the tp is required however it should be noted that imerg has poor accuracy on the daily scale in high latitude and high altitude areas the observational errors of precipitation in the cold season cannot be ignored however even for the same kind of precipitation gauge it is still a challenge to provide a universal correction scheme for snowfall observation errors kochendorfer et al 2022 in this study the cold season precipitation recorded by cspg and geonor on the tp is adjusted by using the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 and kochendorfer et al 2017 the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 is proposed based on daily observations and has widely used for adjusting the precipitation recorded by cspg in china ma et al 2009 2015 2019 sun et al 2018 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2004 this scheme assumes that as long as the daily average wind speed is the same the catch efficiency is the same however the fact is that precipitation occurring when the wind speed is below the daily mean will have a higher catch efficiency than that when the wind speed is above the daily mean even if the daily average wind speed is the same zhang et al 2022 this may lead to that the scheme proposed by yang et al 1991 is not suitable for the whole tp which is also the limitation of this study a previous precipitation comparison observation experiment on the tp also confirmed this scheme underestimated snowfall and overestimated rainfall at the blh site zhang et al 2022 the schemes proposed by kochendorfer et al 2017 is proposed based on half hourly observations from multiple stations around the world which has obvious advantages over the scheme obtained from daily data the precipitation comparative observation experiment at the blh site also show the relative total catch values of snow and mixed precipitation after adjustment increased to 98 25 and 98 23 respectively zhang et al 2022 therefore we further used the adjusted monthly precipitation recorded by geonor as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr for recording cold season precipitation on the tp it can be seen from fig 15 that when the adjusted geonor precipitation is used as a reference the cold season precipitation recorded by imerg has the highest accuracy in the tp with cc rb and rmse being 0 93 27 63 and 4 72 mm month respectively although the cmfd data also has good accuracy it is even worse than the aimerg data which is inconsistent with the results obtained using the adjusted cspg precipitation as a reference the era5 land data is in good agreement with observations cc 0 89 but severely overestimate precipitation rb 129 85 both chirps and persiann ccs cdr are in poor agreement with the observed data with cc values less than 0 7 unfortunately there are very few stations in the tp to record precipitation based on the geonor and the observation period is short although the results of our evaluation using the adjusted monthly precipitation in geonor as a reference show that the imerg recorded the most accurate cold season precipitation on the tp this conclusion needs more data to support later 5 conclusions accurate cold season gridded precipitation products is integral for understanding the dynamic changes of the cryosphere on the tp but the accuracy of these products needs to be evaluated using ground observations this paper takes the adjusted precipitation recorded by cspg and geonor as a reference and evaluated the accuracy of six gridded precipitation products with a spatial resolution no more than 0 1 aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp at annual month and day scales the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 spatially aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr revealed that the annual precipitation in the cold season of the tp was high 300 mm in sichuan and southeastern tibet and low 20 mm in the qaidam basin and western tibet but in the western regions where precipitation observation data is lacking the spatial patterns of precipitation revealed by these six products are quite different 2 temporally all of the six products showed that the monthly precipitation of the tp was the largest in may and the smallest in december however the cold season precipitation of aimerg imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the tp from 2003 to 2015 showed an upward trend while chirps cmfd and era5 land showed a downward trend 3 the cold season precipitation recorded by cmfd imerg and aimerg is more accurate than chirps era5 land and persiann ccs cdr at annual and monthly scales era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate while aimerg chirps cmfd and imerg underestimate cold season precipitation 4 at daily scale the cold season precipitation occurrences detected by cmfd had the highest accuracy followed by aimerg and imerg while chirps had the worst accuracy cmfd and aimerg have higher consistency and accuracy with the observed data than the other four products 5 chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr can reflect the snow disaster in yushu during november 2018 and february 2019 at annual scale but it is difficult to accurately judge the occurrence of snow disasters at daily scale based on these precipitation products 6 the adjustment scheme for cspg underestimates snowfall while the scheme for geonor is suitable for the tp based on a previous precipitation comparison observation experiment at blh site when only the adjusted geonor precipitation is used as a reference the cold season precipitation recorded by imerg has the highest accuracy at monthly scale which is inconsistent with the conclusion that all of the adjusted observations are used as reference however there are few geonor precipitation data currently available and more data are needed

cycle processes at regional and global scales beck et al 2017 lu et al 2020 sui et al 2020 xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 however in some mountainous areas obtaining accurate precipitation data is still a challenge due to sparse gauge networks and large spatial variability in precipitation bai and liu 2018 fan et al 2021 the tibetan plateau tp is an example of a region with complex topography and limited precipitation observation sites zhang et al 2018 the thermodynamic properties of the tp have a far reaching impact on the east asian monsoon and climate gao and liu 2013 zhang and gao 2021 additionally the tp is the source area of many major rivers in the world such as yellow river yangtze river and lancang river zhang and gao 2021 the sparse networks of ground observations affect the accurate understanding of the hydrothermal process in the tp with the development of remote sensing and data assimilation technology many precipitation datasets covering the world have been developed

driven by hydrological models have achieved good simulation results in many basins on the tp alazzy et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however these precipitation datasets are obtained based on indirect means and their accuracy needs to be verified based on ground observations currently many studies on the applicability of these precipitation datasets based on ground observations have been performed on the tp bai and liu 2018 ma et al 2016 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the results indicated tmpa and cmorph showed overall better performance than persiann gao and liu 2013 the detection ability of imerg was superior to that of tmpa and the imerg products performed better than the tmpa products on multiple timescales ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 aphrodite outperformed chirps and persiann cdr against observations at the annual scale tan et al 2020 chirps and mswep overestimated the daily precipitation and mswep performed better than chirps at the daily scale over the tp liu et al 2019 xu et al 2022 evaluated the performances of era5 era5 land and imerg over mainland china and found all of these products showed the poorest performance over subregions of plateau mountain climate previously the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used to evaluate the ability of precipitation events recorded by gridded precipitation data and only the data with daily precipitation greater than 1 mm were selected in the calculation of these indicators gao and liu 2013 tan et al 2020 liu et al 2019 this threshold may not be appropriate because precipitation events with daily precipitation less than 1 mm are the main events in the cold season in many regions of the tp zhang et al 2015 in addition many studies did not adjust for precipitation observation errors when ground based observations were used as a reference however the precipitation recorded by the rain gauge is generally lower than the true value due to the influence of wetting loss evaporation loss and wind induced undercatch according to the precipitation measurement intercomparison experiments carried out by the world meteorological organization wmo buisán et al 2020 pollock et al 2018 yang et al 2005 especially when it is solid precipitation the catch efficiency of the rain gauge is generally below 70 pierre et al 2019 studies also had shown that the chinese standard precipitation gauge cspg captures 82 9 of solid precipitation in the qilian mountains of eastern tp chen et al 2015 and 46 43 of solid precipitation in central tp zhang et al 2022 these errors may lead to uncertainty in the previous evaluation results and the evaluation of cold season precipitation needs to be further strengthened in this context the applicability of gridded precipitation data in the cold season of the tp was re evaluated based on the daily precipitation data recorded by 133 stations of the china meterological administration cma and the half hour precipitation data recorded by 10 stations of the chinese academy of sciences cas in this study considering that data with higher spatial resolution is more

aimerg ma et al 2020a chirps version 2 0 funk et al 2015 cmfd he et al 2020 era5 land hersbach et al 2020 imerg huffman et al 2015 and persiann ccs cdr sadeghi et al 2021 aimerg is obtained by correcting imerg with aphrodite and aphrodite is the gridded precipitation data obtained by interpolation of observational data cmfd is obtained based on the fusion of cma observation data glass reanalysis data and trmm 3b42 v7 remote sensing data it should be noted that most of the gauge observed precipitation data from cma stations was involved in aimerg and cmfd however we did not exclude these cma stations when evaluating cmfd and aimerg on the one hand it is because the specific sites involved in cmfd and aimerg cannot be determined on the other hand we used the corrected cma precipitation data as a reference while cmfd and aimerg involved uncorrected precipitation data and it is also necessary to know the accuracy of cmfd and aimerg in the cold season of the tp chirps is a quasi global precipitation product which merged global climatology satellite estimates and more than 20 000 in situ observation stations imerg is a level 3 gridded precipitation product which intercalibrates merges and interpolates microwave precipitation estimates from gpm constellation microwave calibrated infrared ir satellite estimates global precipitation climatology center gpcc monthly gauge analyses and data from other sensors for the trmm and gpm eras xie et al 2022 imerg provides three different products early run quasi real time late run 12 h lag and final run revised final product the final run version of imerg datasets was used in the study era5 land is a reanalysis dataset provided by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf generated by repeating the land portion of the era5 climate reanalysis data persiann ccs cdr is the newest version of the persiann family products it combines the algorithms that were used to develop persiann ccs and persiann cdr and the precipitation estimates are adjusted based on the global precipitation climatology project gpcp data sadeghi et al 2021 the production of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr did not or rarely use observation data at cma stations overview of the six high resolution precipitation datasets can be seen in table 2 and a more detailed description of these data can be found in the references listed in this section 2 4 methods 2 4 1 observation data processing method due to the bad natural environment and unstable power supply system the phenomenon of discontinuous observation data recording often exists so the obtained observation data need to be processed because the temperature and wind speed data mainly serve for the correction of precipitation observation error the data processing is mainly based on precipitation for geonor if the accumulated precipitation of the geonor rain gauge does not change before and after a period when there is a lack of data it means that no precipitation has occurred and all the precipitation during this period is 0 mm if precipitation occurs during the period of missing data the precipitation during this period is only used to calculate and obtain monthly precipitation data not for the evaluation of high resolution precipitation datasets at daily time scale for cspg whether precipitation occurs during a period when the data is missing can be determined by the surrounding nearby stations if there is no precipitation at the surrounding stations all the missing precipitation data are set to 0 mm if there is precipitation missing data is handled in the same way as the geonor 2 4 2 adjustment schemes for precipitation observation errors for cspg yang et al 1991 constructed the functions between catch efficiency ce and wind speed on daily scale based on the precipitation intercomparison experiment in the urumqi river basin in china 1 c e s n o w exp 0 056 u 10 2 c e r a i n exp 0 041 u 10 3 c e m i

in summer h g m is the gauge height 2 4 3 evaluation indices the main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of high resolution products for recording solid precipitation in the cold season the manual observation results of he et al 2009 at the tgl station showed that snowfall mainly occurred from mid september to mid june of the following year our observations at blh station during 2018 and 2020 showed that snowfall mainly occurs from mid september to early june of the following year fig 2 since the snowfall at the blh station in september mainly occurs at night it will also occur when the average daily temperature is above 4 c combining the observation results of tgl and blh stations we define the cold season as october of each year to may of the next year based on the longitude and latitude of the meteorological stations find the nearest grid point in the high resolution precipitation data extract the same precipitation time series of the grid point as the observed data and process the daily and monthly precipitation data the accuracy of high resolution precipitation data is evaluated by the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi correlation coefficient cc relative bias rb and root mean squared error rmse calculated based on the observed precipitation data and corresponding grid data their respective formulas are as follows 10 p o d h h m 11 f a r f h f 12 c s i h h m f 13 c c i 1 n s i s g i g i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n g i g 2 14 r b i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 15 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 h is the

and csi are to 1 the closer far is to 0 the better the probability of product to detect precipitation events the range of cc is from 1 1 the ranges of rb and rmse are from to and from 0 to the closer the cc is to 1 the closer the rb is to 0 and the closer the rmse is to 0 the more accurate will be the precipitation obtained by this dataset as compared to that by the adjusted gauge based precipitation 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of cold season precipitation based on the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 and kochendorfer et al 2017 the daily precipitation recorded by the cspg and half hourly precipitation recorded by the geonor at the 143 meteorological stations during the study period were adjusted and unadjusted and adjusted gauge recorded annual average cold season precipitation in the tp were calculated figs 3a and 3b as the data for ldh is less than one year the site is not shown in the fig 3 before the adjustment the areal mean annual cold season precipitation in the tp based on the station observations was 147 1 mm after the adjustment the areal mean annual cold season precipitation increased by 0 945 spatially the adjustment of errors has little effect on the spatial distribution pattern of annual precipitation in the cold season on the tp before and after the adjustment the stations with high precipitation 300 mm in the cold season are mainly concentrated in sichuan and southeastern tibet and the stations with low precipitation 20 mm are concentrated in the qaidam basin and western tibet based on the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr products the spatial distributions of annual average precipitation in the cold season over the tp from 2003 to 2015 were obtained fig 3c h as can be seen from fig 3 these six precipitation products all reveal that high precipitation occurs in sichuan and southeastern tibet on the tp and low precipitation occurs in the qaidam basin which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the observational data but in other regions the spatial patterns of precipitation revealed by these six products are quite different especially in the western region where precipitation observation data is lacking for example aimerg and imerg revealed that the precipitation in the northwestern tp is below 100 mm but chirps era5 land and persiann ccs cdr revealed that the precipitation in this area can reach more than 300 mm from the perspective of temporal patterns fig 4 all of the six products showed that the precipitation in the cold season of the tp was the largest in may and the smallest in december however the cold season precipitation of aimerg imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the tp from 2003 to 2015 showed an upward trend and the change rates were 0 3019 0 0639 and 0 115 mm a respectively the cold season precipitation of chirps cmfd and era5 land showed a downward trend and the change rates were 0 5604 1 145 and 2 0994 mm a respectively the correlation coefficient obtained based on the cold season precipitation time series fig 5 shows that the correlation coefficient between imerg and the other five precipitation products is the highest with an average value above 0 76 the correlation coefficient between the era5 land data and other precipitation products is the lowest and the average value is below 0 5 3 2 evaluation of the six precipitation products at annual scale to further investigate the accuracy of the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr the annual cold season precipitation recorded by the six products were also compared with the adjusted gauge observations fig 6 the persiann ccs cdr has the worst consistency with the observed data with cc being 0 46 era5 land substantially overestimates the precipitation with rb and rmse being 85 29 and 188 80 mm year respectively while aimerg chirps imerg underestimate the precipitation with rb being 36 22 9 29 16 97 and rmse being 96 89 mm year 92 26 mm year 70 52 mm year respectively the cmfd is closest to the precipitation recorded by the gauge observations with cc rb and rmse being 0 94 1 10 and 54 79 mm year respectively among the four products made with no or only a small number of cma stations imerg has the highest precision 3 3 evaluation of the six precipitation products at monthly scale taking the adjusted monthly precipitation as a reference the cc rb and rmse for the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp were calculated fig 7 and fig 8 spatially aimerg chirps era5 land and imerg data all show higher cc values in the eastern and southeastern tp revealing that the products are more likely to be in better agreement with gauge observations in areas with high precipitation rb in fig 7 shows that era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate cold season precipitation while aimerg chirps and imerg underestimate precipitation at most stations the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr products show that the rmse values are larger for sites located in the eastern and southeastern tp indicating that the error of the products is larger in areas with high precipitation box plots of cc rb and rmse fig 8 are used to compare the overall accuracy of cold season precipitation recorded by the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr the results show that cmfd has the largest cc value the best rb value and the smallest rmse value and is considered to be the most accurate product for recording the monthly precipitation in the tp among the four products made with no or only a small number of cma stations imerg also has the highest precision at monthly scale overall the conclusions based on monthly data are consistent with those based on annual data and the accuracy of cmfd and imerg in recording cold season precipitation is better than the other four products at annual and monthly scales 3 4 evaluation of the six precipitation products at daily scale random errors of the geonor relating to signal noise make it difficult to record light precipitation events zhang et al 2015 2022 therefore only data from cma stations were used to assess the accuracy of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr for recording cold season precipitation events using the daily precipitation data recorded by 133 cma meteorological stations on the tp from 2003 to 2015 as a reference pod far and csi were calculated and the accuracy of the six products for recording cold season precipitation events was assessed fig 9 and fig 10 in terms of the pod the era5 land exhibit the best performance with pod values at all stations being larger than 0 7 and the median is larger than 0 9 the cmfd also exhibit good performance with pod values at most stations being larger than 0 6 and the median is larger than 0 8 the chirps exhibit the worst performance with pod values at most stations being smaller than 0 5 and the median is smaller than 0 4 as for the far the era5 land performed the worst with far values at most stations being larger than 0 5 and the median is larger than 0 6 the main reason is that era5 land prefers nonzero estimates hersbach et al 2020 ma et al 2022 but there are few precipitation events in the cold season in the tp which leads to the era5 land erroneously record many precipitation events that did not occur while recording the real events the aimerg and cmfd performed better than the other four products the far values of the aimerg and cmfd at most stations were generally smaller than 0 5 and both medians were slightly above 0 4 csi is a comprehensive index of pod and far and can be used to provide an overall description of products for accurately capturing precipitation events ma et al 2022 the csi values of the six precipitation products in fig 9 are high in the eastern and southeastern parts of the tp and low in the northern and southern parts revealing that the precipitation products recorded more accurate precipitation events in areas with high precipitation than in areas with low precipitation box plots of csi in fig 10 also revealed that the accuracy of cmfd recorded cold season precipitation events over the tp was higher than that of the other five products while the cold season precipitation events recorded by chirps had the worst accuracy the daily cc rb and rmse for the aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp were also calculated fig 11 and fig 12 the results show that the cc of the six precipitation products on the daily scale is lower than that on the monthly scale which means that the consistency between the products and the observed data on the daily scale is much lower than that on the monthly scale rb and rmse in fig 11 show that era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate while aimerg chirps cmfd and imerg underestimate daily precipitation at most stations and the error of the six products is larger in areas with high precipitation which are consistent with the results on the monthly scale box plots of cc rb and rmse fig 12 show that cmfd and aimerg have higher consistency and accuracy with the observed data than the other four products on the daily scale which is inconsistent with the results on the monthly scale 3 5 evaluation of the products for recording extreme snow events to evaluate the ability of the products for recording extreme snow events a typical case in yushu in southern qinghai province were selected in february 2019 yushu suffered the worst snow disaster in 60 years more than 40 000 yaks and tibetan sheep died and 58 289 people were affected according to the information released by cma the main reason for this snow disaster is that 12 precipitation events occurred in yushu from november 2018 to february 2019 and the precipitation was significantly higher than that in the same period of previous years fig 13 shows the precipitation anomaly of from november to february in yushu from 2003 to 2020 since aimerg and cmfd have no data after 2015 and 2018 only chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr are selected as can be seen from fig 13 chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr all reveal that the precipitation from november 2018 to february 2019 is much higher than that in the same period before indicating that these products can reflect the snow disaster the information released by cma also indicates that the reason for this snow disaster is that there were 12 relatively large snowfalls during the period from november 1 2018 to february 20 2019 by analyzing the daily precipitation in yushu recorded by chirps era5 land imerg and persiann css cdr in the same period fig 14 it is found that although chirps era5 land and persiann css cdr all recorded these 12 snowfall events these products also recorded many large snowfall events in addition to these 12 events imerg recorded fewer total snow events than chirps era5 land and persiann css cdr but at least 2 of the 12 events were not recorded and some events outside of these 12 precipitation events were also recorded from this result it is difficult to accurately judge the occurrence of snow disasters at daily scale based on these precipitation products 4 discussion in this study we evaluated the accuracies of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in recording precipitation in the cold season over the tp based on the observational data obtained from 133 cma sites and 10 cas sites among these six gridded precipitation products cmfd is obtained based on the fusion of cma observation data glass reanalysis data and trmm 3b42 v7 remote sensing data as a result the evaluation results on annual monthly and daily scales show that the accuracy of cmfd is better than the other five products previous snow cover simulation tests in the irtysh river basin in xinjiang also show that the results of using cmfd as forcing data are better than era interim gao et al 2021 therefore cmfd precipitation product is recommended in the eastern tp where there are many observation stations aimerg is obtained by correcting imerg with aphrodite ma et al 2020a so the spatial distribution of cold season precipitation between aimerg and imerg has good consistency aphrodite is the gridded precipitation data obtained by interpolation of observational data and many cma stations are also used yatagai et al 2012 therefore the accuracy of aimerg is higher than that of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the daily scale however because aphrodite did not correct the observation errors the precipitation recorded by aimerg is seriously underestimated and the accuracy on the annual scale is even lower than that of imerg the production of chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr did not or rarely use observation data at cma stations from the evaluation results imerg has the highest accuracy considering that aimerg and cmfd stopped data updates in 2015 and 2018 respectively imerg is recommended when the latest cold season precipitation data on the tp is required however it should be noted that imerg has poor accuracy on the daily scale in high latitude and high altitude areas the observational errors of precipitation in the cold season cannot be ignored however even for the same kind of precipitation gauge it is still a challenge to provide a universal correction scheme for snowfall observation errors kochendorfer et al 2022 in this study the cold season precipitation recorded by cspg and geonor on the tp is adjusted by using the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 and kochendorfer et al 2017 the schemes proposed by yang et al 1991 is proposed based on daily observations and has widely used for adjusting the precipitation recorded by cspg in china ma et al 2009 2015 2019 sun et al 2018 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2004 this scheme assumes that as long as the daily average wind speed is the same the catch efficiency is the same however the fact is that precipitation occurring when the wind speed is below the daily mean will have a higher catch efficiency than that when the wind speed is above the daily mean even if the daily average wind speed is the same zhang et al 2022 this may lead to that the scheme proposed by yang et al 1991 is not suitable for the whole tp which is also the limitation of this study a previous precipitation comparison observation experiment on the tp also confirmed this scheme underestimated snowfall and overestimated rainfall at the blh site zhang et al 2022 the schemes proposed by kochendorfer et al 2017 is proposed based on half hourly observations from multiple stations around the world which has obvious advantages over the scheme obtained from daily data the precipitation comparative observation experiment at the blh site also show the relative total catch values of snow and mixed precipitation after adjustment increased to 98 25 and 98 23 respectively zhang et al 2022 therefore we further used the adjusted monthly precipitation recorded by geonor as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr for recording cold season precipitation on the tp it can be seen from fig 15 that when the adjusted geonor precipitation is used as a reference the cold season precipitation recorded by imerg has the highest accuracy in the tp with cc rb and rmse being 0 93 27 63 and 4 72 mm month respectively although the cmfd data also has good accuracy it is even worse than the aimerg data which is inconsistent with the results obtained using the adjusted cspg precipitation as a reference the era5 land data is in good agreement with observations cc 0 89 but severely overestimate precipitation rb 129 85 both chirps and persiann ccs cdr are in poor agreement with the observed data with cc values less than 0 7 unfortunately there are very few stations in the tp to record precipitation based on the geonor and the observation period is short although the results of our evaluation using the adjusted monthly precipitation in geonor as a reference show that the imerg recorded the most accurate cold season precipitation on the tp this conclusion needs more data to support later 5 conclusions accurate cold season gridded precipitation products is integral for understanding the dynamic changes of the cryosphere on the tp but the accuracy of these products needs to be evaluated using ground observations this paper takes the adjusted precipitation recorded by cspg and geonor as a reference and evaluated the accuracy of six gridded precipitation products with a spatial resolution no more than 0 1 aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr in the cold season of the tp at annual month and day scales the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 spatially aimerg chirps cmfd era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr revealed that the annual precipitation in the cold season of the tp was high 300 mm in sichuan and southeastern tibet and low 20 mm in the qaidam basin and western tibet but in the western regions where precipitation observation data is lacking the spatial patterns of precipitation revealed by these six products are quite different 2 temporally all of the six products showed that the monthly precipitation of the tp was the largest in may and the smallest in december however the cold season precipitation of aimerg imerg and persiann ccs cdr on the tp from 2003 to 2015 showed an upward trend while chirps cmfd and era5 land showed a downward trend 3 the cold season precipitation recorded by cmfd imerg and aimerg is more accurate than chirps era5 land and persiann ccs cdr at annual and monthly scales era5 land and persiann ccs cdr overestimate while aimerg chirps cmfd and imerg underestimate cold season precipitation 4 at daily scale the cold season precipitation occurrences detected by cmfd had the highest accuracy followed by aimerg and imerg while chirps had the worst accuracy cmfd and aimerg have higher consistency and accuracy with the observed data than the other four products 5 chirps era5 land imerg and persiann ccs cdr can reflect the snow disaster in yushu during november 2018 and february 2019 at annual scale but it is difficult to accurately judge the occurrence of snow disasters at daily scale based on these precipitation products 6 the adjustment scheme for cspg underestimates snowfall while the scheme for geonor is suitable for the tp based on a previous precipitation comparison observation experiment at blh site when only the adjusted geonor precipitation is used as a reference the cold season precipitation recorded by imerg has the highest accuracy at monthly scale which is inconsistent with the conclusion that all of the adjusted observations are used as reference however there are few geonor precipitation data currently available and more data are needed

small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries was estimated by a hydrological model with different scenarios at the end of the study the variation in the relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc and the impact on riverbeds were analysed new hydrological insights for the region the sediment load showed a dramatically decreasing trend and an abrupt change point in 1988 was detected by a mann kendall test compared to the baseline period 1961 1988 the sediment load in the altered period 1989 2015 decreased by 41 7 by employing the swat model with different scenarios sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries was estimated in the basin with a mean value of 457 1 103 tons yr during the altered period the construction of water conservancy facilities has been the key driver of the significant reduction in sediment load observed in the nanliu river the rating curves of monthly ssc discharge showed clockwise patterns which were different from the yangtze river s counter clockwise pattern ssc reductions and excessive sand mining in the main channel have strongly affected riverbeds leading to a

are responsible for the majority of these reductions miao et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 in china s largest river the yangtze river the annual water discharge and sediment load exhibited decreasing trends of 1 41 108 m3 yr and 46 5 106 t yr from 1953 to 2010 respectively climate change contributed 72 of the reduction in the water discharge while the sediment load reduction was mainly 86 controlled by human activities especially dam construction zhao et al 2015 the three gorges dam tgd which was completed in 2003 caused the drop in sediment load from 418 106 t yr to be less than 200 106 t yr dai et al 2011 dai and liu 2013 using sediment budgets and regression relationships yang et al 2007 indicated that the tgd retained 1 51 108 t yr of sediment during

northern coast of the beibu gulf in southern china fig 1 the changes in water discharge and sediment load from the nanliu river are very important to the ecological environment of the beibu gulf different from the three gorges reservoir on the yangtze river there are no reservoir in the main stream of the nanliu river but lots of small ponds and dams in the tributaries zhao et al 2020 the construction of these water conservancy facilities for flood control irrigation and water supply also traps sediment throughout the basin however how much sediment load is retained in these high density small water conservancy facilities is not yet clear in this study the nanliu river basin nlrb is chosen to investigate the comprehensive impacts on the water discharge and sediment load during 1961 2015 first trends and change points were detected then we separated the whole study period into a baseline period and an altered period a hydrological modelling framework was established over the nlrb to simulate the water discharge and sediment load this work aims to quantify how much sediment load is retained by high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries and analyse the variation in the relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc and the impact on riverbeds 2 study region the nanliu river along which 11 tributaries with an area

meteorological bureau for use as model inputs fig 1 table 1 the annual precipitation had a mean value of 1739 5 mm over the entire study period and showed a slightly increasing trend of 1 2 mm yr not shown the observed monthly streamflow and sediment load data measured at the changle hydrological station were collected from guangxi coastal hydrology centre 3 2 methods 3 2 1 mann kendall m k test in this study the mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to detect abrupt changes in streamflow and sediment load in the nlrb the m k method is a nonparametric test and has been widely used in hydrological trend analyses and abrupt change detections this method does not require the sample to obey a certain distribution and is not disturbed by other outliers the test is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their chronological order 3 2 2 hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 developed by the u s department of agriculture usda was used to simulate the streamflow and sediment load in this study in the model runoff was estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number method and the modified usle universal soil loss equation arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 was used to estimate the sediment yield the inputs of the model included the topographic lucc soil and meteorological data in this study the whole basin was divided into 32 subbasins and further 129 hydrological response units hrus which were defined based on the lucc and soil type data the model can directly output the streamflow and sediment load for each subbasin at daily monthly and annual scales the relative bias rb correlation coefficient cc and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to describe the consistency between the simulations and observations the optimal value of rb is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation in contrast to rb a cc with high magnitude values indicates accurate model simulation and the optimal value is 1 the nse is a normalised statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured data variance information nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges from to 1 where a high value nse 0 75 reflects very good agreement between the predicted and observed values moriasi et al 2007

water discharge and sediment load fig 3 shows the time series of the annual water discharge and sediment load of the changle hydrological station in the nlrb for 1961 2015 the water discharge fluctuated violently with a slightly decreasing trend that was statistically insignificant p 0 05 the annual water discharge displayed maximum and minimum values of 8 85 109 m3 and 1 69 109 m3 in 2002 and 1963 respectively with a mean value of 5 16 109 m3 over the entire study period of 1961 2015 the annual sediment load had a mean value of 937 2 103 tons over the entire study period with annual maximum and minimum values of 2137 1 103 tons and 95 9 103 tons in 1981 and 2007 respectively in contrast to the trend observed for the discharge the sediment load showed a dramatically decreasing trend of 14 1 103 ton year fig 4 shows the results of the m k test for detecting abrupt changes in the annual water discharge and sediment load there were several intersections of the uf and ub curves for the water discharge during the period from 1961 to the 1980 s fig 4a for the sediment load a rapid decline was observed and an intersection of the red and green lines occurred in 1988 the year 1988 was the change point for the sediment load thus we separated the overall study period of 1961 2015 into two periods a baseline period of 1961 1988 and the altered period of 1989 2015 4 2 model simulation and evaluation the model was calibrated using the observed data collected from january 1961 to december 1980 correspondingly the validation period was from january 1981 to december 1988 the swat user manual was used in the model calibration process two sets of catalogue parameters needed to be determined runoff parameters and sediment parameters in this study the most specific and sensitive parameters for the streamflow simulation included the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf soil evaporation compensation factor esco groundwater delay time gw delay effective hydraulic conductivity in tributary channel alluvium ch k2 scs runoff curve coefficient cn2 and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc for the sediment load simulation the linear parameter used for the channel sediment routing spcon the exponential parameters used for the channel sediment routing spexp and the usle equation support practice factor usle p were the calibrated parameters then each sensitive parameter was manually adjusted based on the difference between the simulation and observation the final model parameters for the swat model in the nlrb are summarised in table 3 fig 5 shows the observed and simulated streamflow and sediment load of the nlrb upstream of the changle station in the calibration period and validation period the swat model was calibrated generally well to the observed streamflow with an rb of 3 6 a nse of 0 839 and a cc of 0 936 fig 5a during the validation period the model performed slightly worse with a rb of 6 5 and a nse of 0 746 for the sediment load simulation the model obtained a performance as good as that of the streamflow simulation fig 5b during the calibration validation period the rb nse and cc were 0 3 2 0 0 781 0 793 and 0 888 0 895 respectively fig 6 shows the simulation results for the streamflow and sediment load at both monthly and annual scales the model simulations generally followed the monthly and annual streamflow well although slight overestimates existed in some cases e g in 2006 the performance of the swat model is mainly dependent on meteorological input data we collected meteorological data from only seven stations located in and around the basin the model uncertainties are unavoidable due to limited observations the rb between the simulations and observations was 4 1 and the nse values were 0 850 and 0 904 at the monthly and annual scales respectively fig 6a b unfortunately the goodness of the model fit observed for the streamflow simulation was not observed for the sediment load simulation as shown in fig 6c d the simulated sediment load obviously overestimated the observations at both monthly and annual scales obtaining a total rb of 66 6 the nse was 0 310 at the monthly scale and was less than 0 1 064 at the annual scale these values were much lower than the values obtained for the streamflow simulation 4 3 quantifying sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities in this section the method of quantifying sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities is addressed it is assumed that sediment in the baseline period was less influenced by water conservancy facilities the annual sediment change δs is the difference between the observed annual value in the baseline period s o baseline and that in the altered period s o altered 4 δ s s o altered s o baseline 5 δ s δ s clim δ s lucc δ s wcf where δs clim δs lucc and δs wcf represent the impacts of climate change lucc and water conservancy facilities respectively three scenarios 0 1 and 2 were developed with the calibrated swat model in our study scenarios 0 1970s lucc data and meteorological data in the baseline period with its outputs in the baseline period labelled s 0 scenarios 1 1970s lucc data and meteorological data in the altered period with its outputs in the altered period labelled s 1 and scenarios 2 2000 lucc data and meteorological data in the altered period with its outputs in the altered period labelled s 2 the equation used to compute δs clim δs lucc and annual δs wcf are as follows 6 δ s clim s 1 s 0 7 δ s lucc s 2 s 1 8 δ s wcf i s 2 i s o altered i where i represents the individual year in the altered period fig 7a shows the annual time series of the observed and simulated sediment loads under different scenarios in the nanliu river compared to the baseline period the observed sediment load decreased by 41 7 from 1178 7 103 tons yr for the baseline period to 686 8 103 tons yr for the altered period for scenarios 1 and 2 using 1970 s and 2000 lucc data as model input the simulated sediment load in the altered period was 1143 9 103 tons yr and 1137 6 103 tons yr respectively based on the eq 8 the annual sediment retention by water conservancy facilities in the altered period was estimated by subtracting the two terms and showed in fig 7b the estimated annual sediment retention fluctuated violently with a mean value of 457 1 103 tons yr during 1994 2015 the transition period of 1989 1993 is not included the construction of water conservancy facilities was the key driver of the significant reduction in sediment load observed in the nanliu river 5 discussion human activities decrease the sediment flux to the ocean through sediment retention in dams and reservoirs syvitski et al 2005 naik and jay 2011 das et al 2021 to meet the demands of growing populations most large rivers in the world are heavily dammed grill et al 2019 human activities may play an important role in the transport of water and sediment but reduce the flux of sediment reaching the world s coasts by 1 4 gt year due to sediment retention within reservoirs syvitski et al 2005 furthermore reservoirs and dams change the speed of flowing water and the water level potentially affecting the water discharge in rivers and have the most significant ability of intercepting sediment miao et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 in the yangtze river basin the reduction in sediment load is primarily induced by reservoirs liu et al 2021 and it have strongly affected riverbeds and may have accelerated or altered natural processes and river adjustment trends zheng et al 2022 the nlrb has a population of 4 38 million people accounting for 8 5 of guangxi s total population and the population density 432 persons km2 is far higher than guangxi s average level 239 persons km2 hu et al 2017 the structure of the nanliu river has been impacted by human activities zhao et al 2020 and the high density small water conservancy facilities on the tributaries have prevented sediment from entering the main channel fig 8 shows monthly averages of water discharge and ssc for the baseline period 1961 1988 and altered period 1989 2015 for the two periods streamflow had a similar regime mostly occurring in the flood season fig 8a the ssc for the baseline period presented a seasonal fluctuation from 0 015 to 0 299 kg m3 for the altered period ssc was much lower ranging from 0 023 to 0 164 kg m3 and during the flood season it was only 52 of that in the baseline period fig 8b the high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries are the primary driver for the ssc reduction in the main channel fig 9 shows the rating curves of monthly water discharge versus ssc during 1961 1988 in a rising stage of the flow january to august ssc could be divided into two stages rising from january to april and then falling from april to august from august to december ssc gradually changed to a minimum along with falling flow different from the period 1961 1988 the ssc during 1989 2015 experienced a rapid rise in march april followed by a stable period from april june reaching a peak in july during the two periods compared to the flow falling stage the ssc was higher for a given streamflow in the rising stage the rating curves of monthly ssc discharge showed clockwise patterns which were different from the yangtze river s counter clockwise pattern shi et al 1986 dai et al 2016 there is little rain before the flood season starts in april and soil cohesion in the basin has greatly decreased second the farmland on both sides of the river is busy with spring ploughing in april which makes the soil looser so the first flood in april take a lot of sediment into the river xu and ou 2007 from may to august the sediment is not enough to increase with the water flow figs 8 and 9 over the past 40 years since the reform and opening up china s urbanisation has made remarkable achievements and the level of urbanisation has increased by 1 5 times exceeding 3 7 of the global average fang 2018 urbanisation leads to an increase in hardened pavement which decreases sediment yield furthermore river sand is a necessary building material for urbanisation due to the increasing demand for building materials in recent years sand mining has been practiced in rivers and lakes jiang et al 2015 in the middle and lower reaches of the studied river the illegal mining of river sand is a serious phenomenon the sand mining area is approximately 429 95 104 m2 and the volume of sand mined is 3139 60 104 m3 zhao et al 2020 based on the density of river sand 1 4 ton m3 approximately 4395 10 104 t of river sand was excavated from the nanliu river during 2000 2016 zhao et al 2020 and the amount of sand excavated per unit area in this river was much higher than that from the yangtze river li 2017 such a large amount of sand extraction in the river seriously affects the stability and self regulation of riverbanks and channels and further affects the evolution of estuarine deltas li 2017 in the nanliu river ssc reductions and excessive sand mining in the main channel have strongly affected riverbeds leading to a year by year drop from the 1980s to the present the riverbed of the bobai and changle hydrological stations on the middle and down streams of the river dropped by approximately 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 3 0 m respectively fig 10 from the upstream to downstream riverbed scouring is more serious the local government has issued strict measures and illegal sand quarrying sites have been closed down the local government and the water conservancy department formulated a plan for sand extraction strictly delimiting the non mining areas 6 conclusions this study investigated the variations in water discharges and sediment loads in the nanliu river beibu gulf during 1961 2015 the water discharge showed a slightly decreasing trend and the sediment load showed a dramatically decreasing trend of 14 1 103 ton year compared to the baseline period 1961 1988 the sediment load in the altered period 1989 2015 decreased by 41 7 by employing the swat model with different scenarios sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries was estimated in the basin with a mean value of 457 1 103 tons yr during altered period the construction of water conservancy facilities was the key driver of the significant reduction in sediment load observed in the nanliu river the rating curves of monthly ssc discharge showed clockwise patterns which were different from the yangtze river s counter clockwise pattern ssc reductions and excessive sand mining in the main channel have strongly affected riverbeds leading to a year by year drop this finding has great implications for the strategic design and

500 km3 of water and 15 5 gt of sediment are discharged into the ocean through rivers oki et al 2006 syvitski et al 2005 in recent decades hydrological regimes have been changing worldwide milly et al

the world s largest carrier of fluvial sediment while it has a relatively low water discharge wang et al 2016 the water discharge and sediment load have declined in recent decades and human activities are responsible for the majority of these reductions miao et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 in china s largest river the yangtze river the annual water discharge and sediment load exhibited decreasing trends of 1 41 108 m3 yr and 46 5 106 t yr from 1953 to 2010 respectively climate change contributed 72 of the reduction in the water discharge while the sediment load reduction was mainly 86 controlled by human activities especially dam construction zhao et al 2015 the three gorges dam tgd which was completed in 2003 caused the drop in sediment load from 418 106 t yr to be less than 200 106 t yr dai et al 2011 dai and liu 2013 using sediment budgets and regression relationships yang et al 2007 indicated that the tgd retained 1 51 108 t yr of sediment during 2003 2005 the beibu gulf is known as china s last clean sea and it is an important mangrove area in china zhang et al 2007 the nanliu river is a large river with a length of 285 km located on the northern coast of the beibu gulf in southern china fig 1 the changes in water discharge and sediment load from the nanliu river are very important to the ecological environment of the beibu gulf different from the three gorges reservoir on the yangtze river there are no reservoir in the main stream of the nanliu river but lots of small ponds and dams in the tributaries zhao et al 2020 the construction of these water conservancy facilities for flood control irrigation and water supply also traps sediment throughout the basin however how much sediment load is retained in these high density small water conservancy facilities is not yet clear in this study the nanliu river basin nlrb is chosen to investigate the comprehensive impacts on the water discharge and sediment load during 1961 2015 first trends and change points were detected then we separated the whole study period into a baseline period and an altered period a hydrological modelling framework was established over the nlrb to simulate the water discharge and sediment load this work aims to quantify how much sediment load is retained by high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries and analyse the variation in the relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment concentration ssc and the impact on riverbeds 2 study region the nanliu river along which 11 tributaries with an area

this section the method of quantifying sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities is addressed it is assumed that sediment in the baseline period was less influenced by water conservancy facilities the annual sediment change δs is the difference between the observed annual value in the baseline period s o baseline and that in the altered period s o altered 4 δ s s o altered s o baseline 5 δ s δ s clim δ s lucc δ s wcf where δs clim δs lucc and δs wcf represent the impacts of climate change lucc and water conservancy facilities respectively three scenarios 0 1 and 2 were developed with the calibrated swat model in our study scenarios 0 1970s lucc data and meteorological data in the baseline period with its outputs in the baseline period labelled s 0 scenarios 1 1970s lucc data and meteorological data in the altered period with its outputs in the altered period labelled s 1 and scenarios 2 2000 lucc data and meteorological data in the altered period with its outputs in the altered period labelled s 2 the equation used to compute δs clim δs lucc and annual δs wcf are as follows 6 δ s clim s 1 s 0 7 δ s lucc s 2 s 1 8 δ s wcf i s 2 i s o altered i where i represents the individual year in the altered period fig 7a shows the annual time series of the observed and simulated sediment loads under different scenarios in the nanliu river compared to the baseline period the observed sediment load decreased by 41 7 from 1178 7 103 tons yr for the baseline period to 686 8 103 tons yr for the altered period for scenarios 1 and 2 using 1970 s and 2000 lucc data as model input the simulated sediment load in the altered period was 1143 9 103 tons yr and 1137 6 103 tons yr respectively based on the eq 8 the annual sediment retention by water conservancy facilities in the altered period was estimated by subtracting the two terms and showed in fig 7b the estimated annual sediment retention fluctuated violently with a mean value of 457 1 103 tons yr during 1994 2015 the transition period of 1989 1993 is not included the construction of water conservancy facilities was the key driver of the significant reduction in sediment load observed in the nanliu river 5 discussion human activities decrease the sediment flux to the ocean through sediment retention in dams and reservoirs syvitski et al 2005 naik and jay 2011 das et al 2021 to meet the demands of growing populations most large rivers in the world are heavily dammed grill et al 2019 human activities may play an important role in the transport of water and sediment but reduce the flux of sediment reaching the world s coasts by 1 4 gt year due to sediment retention within reservoirs syvitski et al 2005 furthermore reservoirs and dams change the speed of flowing water and the water level potentially affecting the water discharge in rivers and have the most significant ability of intercepting sediment miao et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 in the yangtze river basin the reduction in sediment load is primarily induced by reservoirs liu et al 2021 and it have strongly affected riverbeds and may have accelerated or altered natural processes and river adjustment trends zheng et al 2022 the nlrb has a population of 4 38 million people accounting for 8 5 of guangxi s total population and the population density 432 persons km2 is far higher than guangxi s average level 239 persons km2 hu et al 2017 the structure of the nanliu river has been impacted by human activities zhao et al 2020 and the high density small water conservancy facilities on the tributaries have prevented sediment from entering the main channel fig 8 shows monthly averages of water discharge and ssc for the baseline period 1961 1988 and altered period 1989 2015 for the two periods streamflow had a similar regime mostly occurring in the flood season fig 8a the ssc for the baseline period presented a seasonal fluctuation from 0 015 to 0 299 kg m3 for the altered period ssc was much lower ranging from 0 023 to 0 164 kg m3 and during the flood season it was only 52 of that in the baseline period fig 8b the high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries are the primary driver for the ssc reduction in the main channel fig 9 shows the rating curves of monthly water discharge versus ssc during 1961 1988 in a rising stage of the flow january to august ssc could be divided into two stages rising from january to april and then falling from april to august from august to december ssc gradually changed to a minimum along with falling flow different from the period 1961 1988 the ssc during 1989 2015 experienced a rapid rise in march april followed by a stable period from april june reaching a peak in july during the two periods compared to the flow falling stage the ssc was higher for a given streamflow in the rising stage the rating curves of monthly ssc discharge showed clockwise patterns which were different from the yangtze river s counter clockwise pattern shi et al 1986 dai et al 2016 there is little rain before the flood season starts in april and soil cohesion in the basin has greatly decreased second the farmland on both sides of the river is busy with spring ploughing in april which makes the soil looser so the first flood in april take a lot of sediment into the river xu and ou 2007 from may to august the sediment is not enough to increase with the water flow figs 8 and 9 over the past 40 years since the reform and opening up china s urbanisation has made remarkable achievements and the level of urbanisation has increased by 1 5 times exceeding 3 7 of the global average fang 2018 urbanisation leads to an increase in hardened pavement which decreases sediment yield furthermore river sand is a necessary building material for urbanisation due to the increasing demand for building materials in recent years sand mining has been practiced in rivers and lakes jiang et al 2015 in the middle and lower reaches of the studied river the illegal mining of river sand is a serious phenomenon the sand mining area is approximately 429 95 104 m2 and the volume of sand mined is 3139 60 104 m3 zhao et al 2020 based on the density of river sand 1 4 ton m3 approximately 4395 10 104 t of river sand was excavated from the nanliu river during 2000 2016 zhao et al 2020 and the amount of sand excavated per unit area in this river was much higher than that from the yangtze river li 2017 such a large amount of sand extraction in the river seriously affects the stability and self regulation of riverbanks and channels and further affects the evolution of estuarine deltas li 2017 in the nanliu river ssc reductions and excessive sand mining in the main channel have strongly affected riverbeds leading to a year by year drop from the 1980s to the present the riverbed of the bobai and changle hydrological stations on the middle and down streams of the river dropped by approximately 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 3 0 m respectively fig 10 from the upstream to downstream riverbed scouring is more serious the local government has issued strict measures and illegal sand quarrying sites have been closed down the local government and the water conservancy department formulated a plan for sand extraction strictly delimiting the non mining areas 6 conclusions this study investigated the variations in water discharges and sediment loads in the nanliu river beibu gulf during 1961 2015 the water discharge showed a slightly decreasing trend and the sediment load showed a dramatically decreasing trend of 14 1 103 ton year compared to the baseline period 1961 1988 the sediment load in the altered period 1989 2015 decreased by 41 7 by employing the swat model with different scenarios sediment retention by high density small water conservancy facilities in the tributaries was estimated in the basin with a mean value of 457 1 103 tons yr during altered period the construction of water conservancy facilities was the key driver of the significant reduction in sediment load observed in the nanliu river the rating curves of monthly ssc discharge showed clockwise patterns which were different from the yangtze river s counter clockwise pattern ssc reductions and excessive sand mining in the main channel have strongly affected riverbeds leading to a year by year drop this finding has great implications for the strategic design and

7868,study region the southern african region consists of ten countries including angola zambia malawi namibia botswana zimbabwe mozambique south africa lesotho and swaziland frequent drought episodes in the arid and semi arid parts of the region suggest the impact of climate change and the need for a sustainable framework for groundwater level assessments study focus in this study we developed a machine learning modelling framework based on the deep belief network dbn to predict the changes in monthly groundwater levels cgwls at 1 5 month time scales for 27 groundwater wells over the southern africa region with a predictor dataset constituted by hydrological parameters groundwater level estimates and global climate indices we ascertain the possibility of forecasting changes in groundwater levels cgwl up to 5 month lead times at most locations in the study region using the quantile regression technique the strength of the dbn network at 90 and 95 confidence levels were tested and this helped to determine the accuracy of our forecasts at five months lead times over the four representative wells new hydrological insights for the region deep learning offers new capabilities in evaluating non linear hydrological systems including groundwater analysis the re injection procedure of the dbn network which allows the prior cgwl estimates to serve as inputs for the next estimate was key in maintaining the forecast accuracy in the 4th and 5th month lead times this was evidenced in the accuracy of the four representative wells r 0 91 0 87 0 81 0 75 which formed part of the test samples in cgwl analysis we also observed that the dbn is highly susceptible to local climate variables and global climate indices which are important drivers of climate change and can have strong impact on groundwater level fluctuations therefore the dbn proved to be a robust algorithm in our general assessments of groundwater level fluctuations graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater prediction deep belief network deep learning grace data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction available freshwater for human use is stored in aquifers beneath the land surface and plays an important role in global food security replenishing terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functioning and helping humans adapt to climate change cf jasechko and perrone 2021 ndehedehe et al 2021 notwithstanding a surge in the rate of groundwater stress has become a thing of concern in many of the world s largest aquifers this is a fundamental problem that has been linked to both natural and anthropogenic influences which are important drivers of aquifer depletions around the world over the past decade the rate of groundwater depletion doubled because of increased water demand due to population growth jia et al 2019 climate change cotterman et al 2018 intensified agricultural needs bhattarai et al 2021 and anthropogenic influences ashraf et al 2017 if gone unchecked this large scale groundwater withdrawal rate can lead to drought in developing economies that major rely on groundwater for agricultural water use and productions this however has increased the need for improved spatio temporal diagnosis of groundwater resources to develop optimal models and frameworks for an accurate groundwater forecasts over short and even long term periods given that monitoring bores are typically insufficient in several areas that require consistent and effective monitoring new machine learning framework using satellite observations is critical to aid water resource management and increase resilience to climate change over the past decade the rapid advancement in technology brought about the development of several new models and algorithms aimed at enhancing groundwater level forecasts for instance the use of data driven stochastic models for short term groundwater forecasts has been severely applied over several aquifers in large sub regions especially due to its simplicity in development and implementation liu et al 2021ab yin et al 2020 data driven techniques such as support vector machines liu et al 2021a wei et al 2020 yoon et al 2011 multivariate adaptive regression splines and m5 model trees rezaie balf et al 2017 boosted regression trees rahman et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 self organized maps chang et al 2016 nourani et al 2015 and the well known neural networks wu et al 2021 jeong et al 2020 sun et al 2019 amaranto et al 2018 guzman et al 2017 have been widely applied in groundwater level forecasts the simplicity of the above mentioned data driven models is easily noticed in its parameter estimation calibration techniques and its efficiency in handling different sources of uncertainties better than their physically based counterparts gianni et al 2019 burrows and doherty 2016 okwuashi et al 2020 also unlike physically based models the data driven models make groundwater estimations even without data regarding the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer zanotti et al 2019 this makes it the preferred machine learning technique in global groundwater monitoring and popularly applied procedure in various assessments such as the estimation of groundwater salinity susceptibility mosavi et al 2020 2021 sahour et al 2020 nitrate evaluation knoll et al 2019 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 groundwater potential forecasts kalantar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 groundwater fluctuation forecasts mohapatra et al 2021 choubin and malekian 2017 and other hydro climate related studies and applications panahi et al 2020 yu et al 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 he et al 2014 predominant groundwater complexities inherent in data limitations and parameter estimations over different settings such as coastal aquifers taormina et al 2012 yoon et al 2011 supra permafrost groundwater level dynamics chang et al 2015 and convoluted groundwater systems banerjee et al 2009 can also be handled efficiently by data driven models liu et al 2021a among different deep learning tools shi et al 2016 druzhkov and kustikova 2016 mathis and mathis 2020 the deep belief network dbn is becoming increasingly popular in hydrology agana and homaifar 2018 sung et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zan et al 2021 it was not until recently that deep learning technique which is regarded as a new class of machine learning models attracted significant research interest especially in pattern recognition time series analysis signal processing as well as complex modeling tasks like image processing mathis and mathis 2020 shahabi et al 2021 zhong et al 2019 given that the technique is relatively new its application in groundwater studies is still largely insufficient our study pioneers an ensemble dbn in a comprehensive assessment of groundwater level fluctuation using southern africa as a tentative test bed the dbn is a generative graphical model made up of multiple layers of hidden units with connections within the layers given its proficiency in probabilistically reconstructing its input during training gochoo et al 2021 niu et al 2020 we adapt it as a preferred choice due to the complexity and non linearity of groundwater level fluctuations past studies have also shown the proficiency of the dbn in groundwater studies for example the study undertaken by liu et al 2021b for the groundwater level assessment over the jiuquan basin using the dbn reported a satisfactory 1 3 month groundwater level forecast however their study is rife with conspicuous lags especially in the sparse number of running well dataset and the insufficient hydrological parameters used in the forecast additionally this study did not take into account the impact of land use surface water and geology as significant contributing factors in groundwater level forecast in their study these lags could impede the reliability of the results derived from their predictions to circumvent this limitation we propose a comprehensive ensemble dbn for sub regional groundwater level forecasts acknowledging the impact of hydrological factors total water storage tws precipitation and temperature global climate indices enso north atlantic oscillation nao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo indian ocean dipole iod and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and a robust number of groundwater wells in our analysis before the deep learning phase of the dbn we partition our original input parameters into training and testing subsets to prevent future data falling into the training process the overall objective of this study is to forecast the changes in groundwater levels for the study region on a 1 5 month time scales forced with extensive climate parameters for a more robust model the key objectives that are addressed in this study are to i investigate the efficiency of deep learning via dbn in diagnosing changes in groundwater levels at subsequent 1 5 month time scales ii assess the impact of grace derived tws as a forcing variable to the dbn in predicting groundwater levels in southern africa iii understand the interplay between global climate indices and groundwater extraction in the study region especially given their indirect relationship and iv identify the footprints of teleconnection patterns in groundwater assessments in addition to practical groundwater level forecasts we propose using a deterministic approach in addressing uncertainties in our analysis which is a significant factor often neglected in forecasts furthermore this study introduces the quantile regression model for this task this regression model which boasts of uncertainty detection from different sources rahmati et al 2019 is a powerful tool that has been widely used for conditional quantile estimations liu et al 2021b our study adopts this model to estimate the uncertainty in our whole groundwater level forecast over southern africa as part of our post processing tool the remainder of this study is segmented as follows section 2 gives a brief description of the study area highlighting both direct and indirect causes influencing its groundwater level fluctuations section 3 gives a thorough discussion on the data and techniques employed the interpretation and discussion of our experiments is done in section 4 while our study is finally concluded in section 5 2 study region southern africa sa is the southernmost sub region of africa located south of congo and tanzania the sub region is characterized by arid to sub humid climatic and weather patterns the southern african development community sadc has reported cases of drought episodes in the arid and semi arid parts as well as heavy rainfall following these drought regimes which sometimes lead to severe flooding therefore since this sub region relies heavily on subsistence agriculture for their income kalu et al 2021a accurate predictions of hydrological patterns are instrumental to the residents of the sub region three major wind systems have been reported to have the most significant influence on sa s climatology namely i the inter tropical convergence zone itcz which contributes to the wet and dry seasons of tropical regions ii the southeasterly wind system which brings rainfall from the indian ocean and iii the sub tropical eastern continental moist maritime system which experiences regular cyclones furthermore studies blamey et al 2018 kolusu et al 2019 have also linked the dynamics in climate and precipitation patterns over the sa region to the el nino southern oscillation phenomenon these factors are largely responsible for the overall climate extremes noticed in the region it is estimated that at least 70 of the 250 million inhabitants of the southern african countries rely on groundwater as their primary source of water lapworth et al 2017 it provides over 90 of the water used for rural domestic supplies including agriculture ecosystem health industrial growth sanitation as well as drinking this highlights the potential role of groundwater resources for socio economic development over the south african region as a sub region sa has historically been at high risk of drought an extreme hydrological phase which has been linked to several sociological holmgren and öberg 2006 and meteorological kusangaya et al 2014 factors the majority of the sub region s annual precipitation patterns is accumulated by storms from early november to march forming the sa s wet season the region s soil is saturated by the wet months of rainfall patterns which provide moisture that persists for the drier months of the remaining part of the year hydrological fluxes and global climate indices are known to disrupt the region s annual level of rainfall which often results in a decline of the region s plant life deficits of water levels in water bodies and substantial soil moisture loss this is the leading cause of drought in the sa region for instance extremely dry conditions were observed across most of southern africa during the austral summer oct mar of 2015 2016 this dry condition peaked in the early austral summer months oct dec generating the most intense drought episode in a 115 year historical record as estimated by the intensity of the standardized precipitation index over the sub continent across all spatial scales during this period the sadc reported widespread and harsh impacts of this exceptionally dry condition across many sectors of the region including significant loss of livestock and crops which resulted in an increase in the cost of food severe water shortages and a decrease in power generation and supply blamey et al 2018 by 2016 it was pertinent for the sadc to declare a regional drought disaster and nine months later six sadc countries had pronounced national drought emergencies i e malawi swaziland namibia botswana zimbabwe and lesotho whereas south africa pronounced the drought emergency status for seven of its nine provinces with a temporary red alert also pronounced for the southern and central provinces of mozambique in sa groundwater is the dominant source of freshwater especially for the rural population and many expanding cities macdonald et al 2012 this is usually the case in arid regions where groundwater proves to be the only perennial source of water recent studies however have shown the rapid development of groundwater resources in sub saharan africa villholth 2013 calow et al 2010 taylor et al 2009 and are dominantly highlighted in national development plans aimed at satisfying the need for proliferated freshwater access and agricultural intensification under rapidly increasing populations and economic growth groundwater as a source of freshwater is extremely important in the sa region especially due to the low efficiency of surface runoff in the region mcmahon et al 1987 and drinking untreated surface water has been known to result in poor health hunter et al 2010 however the recharge rate plays a crucial role in the long term viability of groundwater withdrawals as well as the ecosystem niche that depends on groundwater resources inasmuch as groundwater s high ecological and socio economic relevance as an essential and strategic resource is recognized throughout the sa region the region is still plagued with an insufficient and sparse network of running well data which lowers the current state of groundwater studies in the sub region this on its own is a significant limitation to the sustainable development of groundwater resources however efforts to enhance the situation have been made over the last decade they are noticeable through the publication of syntheses and critical assessments of the issue at national sub regional and even continental levels cf xu et al 2019 3 data 3 1 groundwater level data the groundwater level data used in this study are collected from the archives of the global groundwater information system ggis https ggis un igrac org view well and monitoring data over the southern african region consisting of namibia botswana south africa lesotho swaziland zimbabwe zambia mozambique malawi and angola see fig 1 for their locations and distributions throughout the region ggis was initiated by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco and executed by the international groundwater resources assessment center igrac to improve the quality and accessibility of groundwater assessment monitoring and information management in a global context with the temporal resolution of groundwater levels in daily time steps for most aquifers we estimated the monthly data by a temporal averaging of the daily data for nov 2007 oct 2012 note the antecedent in situ groundwater formed part of our predictors the predicted groundwater level changes for each month were integrated into the testing parameters for the next month 3 2 terrestrial water storage tws terrestrial water storage tws is a function of the dynamics of the earth s gravity fields its relation to hydrological applications is characterized by the sum of water stored in the soil underground over the land surface canopy and even as snow in this study we selected the monthly mass concentration mascon grace product rl 05 nov 2007 oct 2012 available at 0 5 degrees resolution obtained from the centre for space research csr the mascon dataset applied in our analysis was downloaded from grace 2022 the csr mascon approach applied in this study makes use of an intermediate procedure for the determination of a time variable regularization matrix save et al 2016 to evaluate the mascon solution this allows the construction of a time variable regularization based solely on the grace data ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 3 3 precipitation monthly generated tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm v7 3b43 precipitation parameters nov 2007 oct 2012 from the national aerospace and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc integrated with multiple precipitation datasets such as i assimilated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements imerg ii trmm microwave imager tmi iii visible and infrared scanner virs iv special sensor microwave imager ssm i and v rain gauge data were applied in this study the parameters are derived by averaging the trmm 3b42 v6 precipitation products they contain estimates of the total monthly precipitation recorded from 1998 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 arc degree this dataset was downloaded from noaa gsfc noaa 2022 a large overestimation in the tropical rainforest region of africa over the trmm rainfall radar is ascertained in december january february and in march april may and a minimized bias in june july august and september october november by applying the zonal mean analysis kalu et al 2021a regardless the relatively sharp bias for all models in the dry seasons when rainfall is nominal is less prominent in the dry seasons of the african tropical regions it was necessary to rescale the trmm imerg rainfall dataset to preserve and maintain a consistent spatial resolution with the other input parameters in our deep training algorithm 3 4 temperature the temperature data was derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era interim project era 2022 the global era interim assimilates the 2 m air temperature using several observational sources including data from stations satellites and radiosonde ahmed and wiese 2019 at a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 75 arc degree and 6 h respectively dee et al 2011 3 5 climate indices 3 5 1 enso enso is a recurring climatic pattern that involves variations in the temperatures of waters in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean it describes the presence of abnormally warm el nino and cold la nina sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the eastern pacific ndehedehe et al 2017 the multivariate enso index mei is the first principal component of the integrated regularized fields of total cloudiness fractions surface air pressure meridional and zonal wind components as well as the sea level pressure the units of mei are standardized thus a score of 1 denotes a complete standard deviation departure of the principal component for the corresponding period wolter and timlin 2011 given the association of the mei derived from http www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei with inter annual variability of water availability as well as its integration of six other variables and anomalies describing the pacific it was preferred in this our analysis as a significant contributor to climate change which indirectly results in the over exploitation of groundwater resources to other available indices 3 5 2 north atlantic oscillation the north atlantic oscillation nao index comprises a north south dipole of anomalies the first one is situated over greenland while the second one having an opposite sign spans through the central latitudes of the north atlantic region i e 350 n and 400 n these opposing phases of the nao are largely responsible for basin wide variations especially in the location and intensity of the north atlantic jet stream and storm track as well as the in large scale harmonization of the average meridional and zonal heat patterns and moisture transfer anyah et al 2018 this results in the high level dynamics of global precipitation and temperature patterns which is an indirect contributor to groundwater changes given its action in sub regional climate change ndehedehe et al 2019 the nao dataset for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 was downloaded from http www cpc ncep noaa gov products precip cwlink pna nao shtml and employed in our analysis 3 5 3 atlantic multi decadal oscillation the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo is a coherent variability pattern in the north atlantic ssts having duration of 720 960 months and standardly computed from the mean sst anomalies of the northern atlantic ndehedehe et al 2017 trenberth and shea 2006 past studies have correlated multi decadal variations of the sahel summer rainfall to the activities of the amo as well as its contribution to global warming trenberth and shea 2006 ndehedehe et al 2017 its indirect impact in regulating hydrological fluxes such as precipitation patterns evapotranspiration rates and latent heat transfer makes it a major contributor of indirect groundwater level changes over sub saharan africa ndehedehe et al 2017 for this study we adopted the unsmoothed amo index from the kaplan sst v2 which is downloadable at http www esrl noaa gov psd data timeseries amo 3 5 4 indian ocean dipole the indian ocean dipole iod is largely characterized by irregular oscillation of ssts which allows the alternation of warm and cold temperatures between the western and eastern part of the indian ocean it is primarily described by the anomalous sst gradient between the southeastern equatorial indian ocean and the western equatorial indian ocean which is popularly referred to as the dipole mode index dmi this study explored the monthly correlation between this dataset and the groundwater level changes for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 this data was downloaded from the japanese marine earth science and technology jamstech platform via http www jamstec go jp frcgc research d1 iod html dipole 20mode 20index html 3 5 5 pacific decadal oscillation the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is a recurring pattern of ocean atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid latitude pacific basin it is detected as either warm or cool surface waters in the pacific ocean north of 200 n the pdo can be likened to a long lived el nino like pattern of pacific climate variability having extremes symbolized by widespread oscillations in the north america climate and the pacific basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 given its irregular oscillating patterns characterized by low frequency dynamics it serves as a potential tool for future climatic explorations especially as its influences in regulating climate patterns over continental scales have been widely researched ndehedehe et al 2019 ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 the pdo dataset for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 was downloaded from https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections pdo and used in our study 4 methodology 4 1 deep belief network the deep belief network dbn is a trending topic in the field of neural networks recently it has shown higher accuracy than many prominent and conventional deep learning methods in speech hand writing recognition image recognition and other classification problems ribeiro and lopes 2011 gencoglu et al 2014 one significant feature of the dbn that differentiates it from other shallow learning networks is its ability to enhance the identification of deep neural patterns aid reasoning abilities and the possibility of encapsulating the deep difference between normal and faulty data chen et al 2021 the dbn is a class of deep neural networks that creates training datasets by utilizing the maximum probability in multiple sequentially stacked restricted boltzmann machines rbm aimed at training the weights between neurons in its network fig 3 the rbm is the basic unit of the dbn and is made up of two layers of neurons the visible and hidden layers used for training input and feature detection respectively even though a unique connection between the adjacent layers of the dbn network exists there are no relationships among the entire rbm layers proposed by geoffrey hinton in 2006 the dbn is popular for solving unsupervised learning tasks to reduce feature dimensionality it can also be used to solve supervised learning tasks to construct regression or even classification models sohn 2021 the most popular techniques in training a dbn are i the layer by layer training and ii the fine tuning training in the former an unsupervised training procedure of each rbm is undertaken to learn all the top down approach and most important generative weights in the network this is so that the hidden layer inferred from the data vector can serve as that of the higher layer succeeding layer on the other hand the latter applies the error back propagation technique to fine tune the dbn parameters after the unsupervised training procedure for this study we integrate the dual learning process of the dbn to improve the accuracy of our forecasts fig 2 we assume no target variable after the training corresponding to the study conducted by yuan et al 2021 for the unsupervised pre training process in this phase after training one of the rbms the learning parameters are conserved at the same time the outputs of the hidden layers are used as input for the next round of rbm training figs 3 4 following this procedure the rbm training undergoes a sequential training order till all the rbms are finally trained this phase is crucial in achieving an optimum solution of the initial weights of the network and the obtained parameters can be applied in phase two i e the supervised fine tuning phase phase two helps to enhance the model structure and subsequent supervised learning labeled data our modeled dbn is composed of several rbms stacked on top of one another the generative rbm s employed in our deep learning is characterized by a layer of visible units v and a layer of binary hidden units h the integrated configuration of the visible and hidden units produces a total energy function given by 1 e v h i j v i h j w i j i v i a i j h j b j where the indices of the visible and hidden layers are represented by i and j respectively w i j represents the connection of the weights between the ith visible and the jth hidden unit the state of the ith and jth hidden unit are characterized by v i and h j while a i and b j represent the biases of the visible and the hidden layers the first term i j v i h j w i j depicts the energy between the hidden and visible units with their connected weights the second term i v i a i depicts the energy in the visible layer while the third term j h j b j depicts the energy in the hidden layer the joint probability assigned to the visible and hidden layer by the rbm is given by 2 p v h e e v h z where z given as z v h e e v h is the partition function derived by adding the energy of all possible visible and hidden layer configurations upadhya and sastry 2019 if the probability of a data point represented by a state v is to be determined the marginal probability is applied removing the state of the hidden layer or vice versa such that p v h p v h with the function above the probability of either the visible or the hidden configuration for any given input parameter to be activated can be determined conveniently furthermore the parameters can be used to implement inference to decide the conditional probabilities in the model for the likelihood of the model to be maximized the gradient of the log likelihood with respect to the weights must be computed the gradient of the first term can be written as 3 δ log h exp e v h δ w i j v i p h j 1 v however it is difficult to compute the gradient of the second term inasmuch as no connections exists between visible to visible or between the hidden to hidden nodes in the rbm we can infer the connection between the visible and hidden layers using 4 p h j 1 v σ b j i v i w ji 5 p v i 1 h σ a i j h j w ji where σ represents the sigmoid function overall a dbn is characterized by an arbitrary number of stacked rbms serving as a stochastic recurrent neural network on top of each other this generates an assimilation of partially undirected and a partially directed graphical model therefore the integrated distribution between the visible layer v and the l hidden layers h t is defined as 6 p v h l h t k 0 l 2 p h t h t 1 p h l 1 h l where p h k h k 1 represents a conditional distribution for the visible units based on the hidden units of the rbm at level t and p h l 1 h l shows the integrated visible hidden distribution in the top level rbm in this study we simulated a six hidden layer i e h 1 j h 2 j and h 3 j dbn model fig 3 the apex level rbm in our modeled dbn acted as a complimentary prior from the bottom level directed sigmoid likelihood function during the first training phase we adopted the greedy unsupervised method by training separately each rbm from the model in a bottom to top style and using the obtained hidden layer from the prior phase as an input layer for the next rbm fig 3 furthermore the modeled dbn was used to project our prior estimates acquired from both in situ and satellite remote sensing techniques to another state space with binary values upadhya and sastry 2019 this was achieved by attaching the prior states in the bottom layer of the model and inferring the top hidden layer from them each rbm converts its data distribution into an aggregated posterior distribution over its hidden units this therefore divides the task of modeling its data into two i in the first task it learns generative weights that can translate the aggregated posterior distribution over the hidden units back to the data distribution and ii in the second phase it learns to model the aggregated posterior distribution over hidden units however the second task is easier for the next rbm than it was for the original input datasets because the aggregated posterior distribution is closer to a distribution that an rbm can model perfectly in the end we were able to integrate the top hidden layer parameters directly into the q learning algorithms of the dbn for further analysis fig 5 4 2 data assimilation as a result of the large data gaps in our in situ groundwater data we adopted the data assimilation da technique to make the adequate estimation of those gaps so as to achieve a more robust result with an adequate number of input variables da allows the merging of different sources of data to estimate possible states of a system as it evolves in time it integrates observation data and the underlying dynamical principles regulating the system to estimate the system state which is better than could be generated with just the discrete data or model alone also its use in the optimal estimation of hydrological variables by merging in situ data or remote sensing data into models has been significant studied and widely applied over the past years liu et al 2021a 2017 2016 montzka et al 2011 in our study we applied the ensemble kalman filtering technique enkf for estimating the data gaps in our in situ data due to its efficiency in incorporating observation data into a dynamical system obeying kalman filter theory and the monte carlo method fan et al 2017 we fed our da model with optimal in situ groundwater gw information and model gw information obtained by isolating the groundwater component from the grace tws based on the water budget approach this was achieved by subtracting discrete surface water and soil moisture datasets obtained through the global land data assimilation model gldas from the grace derived tws the snow and canopy water component of the tws was overlooked due to their insignificant contribution in driving tws dynamics in our study region this was achieved through 7 gw tws grace sm noah where gw represents the obtained groundwater data and sm depicts the soil moisture information obtained from the noah lsm model from nasa s global land data assimilation system the surface water component sw which is an integral component of the tws was masked from the gldas data the global aridity and drought areas outlined by dai 2011 over the sub saharan african region have increased substantially during the 20th and 21st century and was attributed to widespread drying since 1970 s over africa masih et al 2014 southern europe vicente serrano et al 2014 south asia annamalai et al 2013 eastern australia ndehedehe et al 2021 and many parts of the northern mid high latitudes this aridity has however resulted in significant deficits in surface water components in the tws products over these regions from 2007 to 2011 thus allowing soil moisture be the most significant driver of grace derived tws over our study region the noah lsm used in our experiment was derived from the gldas version 2 1 available from nasa s earth data site http earthdata nasa gov note the difference between tws grace and tws noah is used to quantify grace informed groundwater anomalies liu et al 2021a eq 8 also considering the error covariance and the weights based on the inverse of squared observation and model error covariance we initiated the iteration procedure of our da algorithm despite the large time consumption of our da model we employed the sequential updating of the kalman gain with an ensemble averaging of the observation data and model error covariance to achieve a finely determined result in the conventional enkf scheme the model error covariance is estimated from the ensemble forecasts in the routine of time growth of the model state the model error covariance estimate accounts for the most significant source of increase in the computational time elapsed for completing a da cycle to obtain more accurate model error covariance estimates larger ensemble sizes are imposed on the system state to achieve more computation time we achieved time growth in our system at time t through the assimilated results from the model which was however slightly affected by several random errors table 1 through an ensemble of the predicted results the mean model state and model error covariance at the next time steps are estimated for 60 month in situ data used in our experiment fig 4 we represent the observation equation at time t as 8 y t e x t n t where the model state at the time t is represented by x t y t represents the system state and observation data at time t e represents the time invariant transform matrix while n is the observation error at time t the system state is updated at every time following the execution of da to 9 x t a x t f k t y t e x t f where the assimilated model state at every time t is represented by x t a the forecast model state is represented by x t f while k t is the kalman gain the innovation vector is represented by y t e x t f it is important to adopt the kalman gain computational efficiency as it not only attempts to weigh and balance the uncertainties between the estimate and observation before proceeding to the analysis step but also minimize the covariance x t a x t f x t a x t f t 10 k t p t f e t e p t f e t r 1 where p t f represents the model error covariance at time t and r depicts the observation error covariance with time invariant parameters the time growth of the model state is accomplished using several initial conditions of j pieces using an ocean circulation model 11 x j t 1 f f x j t a w j t q t for j 1 2 j where w j t is the external forcing generated from a series of unsystematic perturbed open boundary conditions with zero mean and a given covariance gaussian distribution and q t represents the model error the ensemble mean however is computed from various forecast model states 12 x t 1 f 1 j j 1 j x t 1 f the standard deviation of the ensemble mean is derived from 13 s t 1 f j 1 j x t 1 f x t 1 f 2 j 1 model error covariance is determined by 14 p t 1 f s t 1 f s t 1 f t where s t 1 f s t 1 1 f s t 1 2 f s t 1 n f and n represents the model grid the vectors s t 1 k f ϵ r n is the kth column of matrix s t 1 f ϵ r n j the observation error covariance r is computed from the covariance of travel time dissimilarity for each transmission line generated in a high frequency band the observation error covariance minimizes a diagonal matrix given that the observed travel time uncertainties are uncorrelated between individual transmission lines 15 r e 1 2 0 0 e m 2 where the variance of travel time errors for the ith ray is given by e i 2 i 1 2 m time growth to the next time t 1 is achieved by the model using the assimilated results 16 x t 1 f f x t a this recursive looping continues until the system model convergences fig 4 4 3 uncertainty evaluation quantile regression for this analysis we ascertained the predictive uncertainty of the developed dbn models using the quantile regression qr algorithm the qr algorithm is a linear method that can be used to estimate the quantiles of a response variable even in the absence of a prescribed hypothesis koenker and bassett 1978 koenker and hallock 2001 the qr technique is well known in evaluating the strength of model and has been in use for over fifty years kasraei et al 2021 liu et al 2021b weerts et al 2011 pointed out the efficiency and robustness of applying the qr in estimating forecast errors with respect to the forecasted water levels as it provided highly accurate results in the entire quantitative modeling process we express the relationship between the observed y and predicted ypredicted for each quantile τ as follows 17 y α τ y predicted b τ where the slope and intercept of the eq 7 above is given by α τ and b τ respectively and is estimated by minimizing the sum or residuals such that 18 min i 1 n ρ τ y i α τ y predicted i where y i and y predicted i are i th samples from the dataset and qr function of the τ th quantile is ρ τ which is given by 19 ρ τ ε i τ 1 ε i ε i 0 τ ε i ε i 0 our deep learning methods generated various uncertainty values which were estimated as a set of forecasted quantiles for every desired quantile level i e ρ 0 90 and 0 95 4 4 model performance evaluation given that we set aside 4 representative groundwater wells for our validation of 1 5 month groundwater forecasts against our modeled dbn models we applied several statistical models such as the mean absolute error mae correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and a confusion matrix to ascertain the preciseness and veracity of our model as a relevant tool for hydrological estimations these statistical tools have been extensively applied in the performance evaluation of several hydrological models ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 liu et al 2021b the mae provides a stable perspective to determine the goodness of fit based on the model estimation errors while the correlation coefficient shows the degree of linearity between the forecasted and observed parameters in contrast the nse adopts a range of and 1 which represents the error extent between the simulated and the averaged observational parameters while the ideal or optimal value for the rmse is 0 this however is not usually the case due to the severe non linearity of our model network kalu et al 2021b c as well as the hydrological patterns that initiates the process we applied the following equations in our evaluation 20 mae 1 n i 1 n gwl i predicted gwl i observed 21 r i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i observed gwl i predicted gwl i predicted i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i observed 2 i 1 n gwl i predicted gwl i predicted 2 22 nse 1 i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i predicted 2 i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i observed 2 23 rmse 1 n i 1 n gwl i predicted gwl i observed 2 given that n number of input parameters gwl i observed and gwl i predicted represent the observed and predicted or simulated groundwater level at time t respectively while the mean of the observed and predicted groundwater level at time t is represented by gwl i observed and gwl i predicted respectively 5 results 5 1 implementation of proposed method 5 1 1 parameter selection prior to the training of our original parameters a preliminary evaluation is performed based on the correlation analysis of the input variables fig 2 this is necessary for the training of deep learning algorithms which require coarse correlation fit for their original input variables because a good correlation between them signifies that they are composed of more repeated information and as such may lead to a reduction in the prediction accuracy of the model while increasing the computational complexity of the entire process liu and wang 2011 hydrological variables tws precipitation temperature climate indices enso nao amo iod pdo and the in situ groundwater levels at different time lags are used as predictors while the change in groundwater levels are used as predictand supporting information 1 our choice of input variables covers a wide range of factors influencing groundwater fluctuations in the sub region for example the population density of different locations in the study area shown in fig 1 plays key roles in groundwater fluctuations of the entire sub region on the other hand regions with high population density gradually shift the residence of the human population from rural to urban areas resulting in urbanization the effect of urbanization contributes to the causal influence on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change thus resulting in temperature change qiu et al 2020 decline in tws kalu et al 2021a rainfall patterns li et al 2020 and global climate indices in regulating hydrological fluxes and patterns in large sub regional scales chen et al 2016 all these processes are either directly or indirectly tied to the groundwater variations in the respective sub regions and time scales fig 8 as such they will provide important details in understanding the dynamics of groundwater levels thus their use in our analysis given that the study area is relatively large we noticed that the correlation strength between the cgwl and the selected climate variables are affected by the region s dynamics in the landscape and climatic patterns for instance the influence of the congo and zambezi river basins on the hydrological condition of angola zambia and malawi is relatively stronger than that of namibia botswana and south africa kalu et al 2021a also high population density in regions like namibia botswana and zimbabwe fig 1 are equally direct contributors to groundwater stress of such regions and as well affects the correlation strength between the cgwl and parameters such as tws and rainfall of these regions generally the correlation coefficient between the cgwl and hydrological related variables is positive and significant at most of the well locations on the other hand the correlation between cgwl and global indices variables is dominated negatively at most stations with a magnitude below 0 4 this in turn resulted in more negative changes in groundwater fluctuation levels for our representative wells fig 7a b c e f g k m p s t this is a pointer to the indirect influence of teleconnection patterns on groundwater fluctuations this depicts those precedent hydrological variables are likely to significantly influence cgwl of the sub region based on the above analysis tws rainfall temperature climate indices and in situ groundwater well level are selected as potential input variables in our dbn network 5 1 2 implementation of the dbn model in this study the dbn is implemented to predict the cgwl at 1 5 month time scales the flow chart of the dbn model is provided in fig 2 the prior input variables are selected from our original datasets tws rainfall temperature climate indices and in situ groundwater well levels and are used in the development of our dbn model the dbn constructed an initial learning model using a training set of nine input variables six visible and hidden nodes and one output data figs 5 9 in general the dbn consists of two steps i the first phase is constructing the rbm network using unsupervised learning and ii the second phase where the rbm network learns the back propagation algorithm of supervised learning the rbm setting of epoch batch size and momentum for the construction and back propagation phases are duly represent in table 2 rbms hold two sets of random variables which we refer to as neurons one layer where the inputs go into which is referred to as the visible nodes to represent observable data and another layer of hidden variables to encapsulate dependencies of visible variables by estimating the probability distribution of the features fig 9 however the task of determining the number of nodes to use in our training for both the visible and hidden layers is a vital aspect in the regulation of the accuracy index of our model few hidden neurons provide faster training but result in scarce feature detectors in contrast more hidden neurons result in a longer training period for instance if two homogenous networks having similar errors on the training datasets with varying hidden layers are compared the one with few hidden units is likely to produce a more reliable prediction on new cases while the more complex one while diminishing the model s ability to generalize on new datasets has an increased chance of over fitting on the training dataset özesmi and özesmi 1999 also an increased number of hidden layers allow a generative model to enhance its closeness of fit while a smaller number boosts the smoothness or extrapolation proficiency of the network a generative model with one visible and one hidden layer can be likened to perform linearly and can estimate any function as long as the visible and hidden layers consist of sufficient functions however some studies that implemented generative models in their predictive analysis suggest initiating with at least two visible and hidden layers flood and kartam 1994 for our study we implemented the trial and error method to determine the optimal number of visible and hidden layers and their respective discrete nodes which was based on the experience of our dataset the strategy is implemented because of the highly problematic dependence of many optimal generative model geometries past studies have also attempted to base the number of training samples on the number of connection weights available in the network given the divergent nature of the rule of thumb procedure which was applied in our experiment we used the number of connection weights and the number of input and output neurons to estimate the number of visible and hidden neurons in our network in this procedure if only one hidden layer is to be used then the number n of connection weights should not be more than n 0 1 and the number of hidden neurons should not be less than ½ xinput xoutput theoretically one sure way of meeting these two conditions is to have a relatively large number of training datasets however walczak and cerpa 1999 suggested that the number of hidden neurons in the last layer should be equivalent to the number of decision factors utilized by domain connoisseurs in attempting the solution of the problem decision factors are the discernable constituents that make up the distinct categories of the input vector system it is determined mainly by the number of heuristic rules or clusters utilized in an expert framework we evaluated five cases to predict the cgwl at subsequent one to five month time scales using precedent datasets of tws precipitation temperature global indices and in situ groundwater data as predictors case 1 is designed to assess the potential of the dbn in predicting cgwl using limited precedent input parameters tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 and had a node formation of 9 4 4 1 in case 2 we re injected the output from case 1 into the input parameters to change the node formation to 10 4 4 1 this helped to increase the influence of in situ groundwater wells in our forecasts the predictors for the case 2 include cgwl t x1a tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 in the dbn model in case 3 the outputs from case 1 and case 2 served as additional input parameters to the dbn model the predictors for the case 3 include cgwl t x1a cgwl t 1 x1b tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 with a node formation of 11 4 4 1 in case 4 the model inputs are updated to cgwl t x1a cgwl t 1 x1b cgwl t 2 x1c tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 with a node formation of 12 4 4 1 while case 5 was characterized by all the prior outputs as well as the original input variables to generate a node formation of 13 4 4 1 table 2 as well as utilized the gbdbn model type in its estimation in contrast to the bbdbn model types utilized by other cases in the bbdbn approach all input rbms are the bernoulli bernoulli rbms whereas in the gbdbn approach the input rbm is the gaussian bernoulli rbm out of the original 5 year 60 months data used in our overall experiment 70 of the data was used for the training and 30 for validation our decision to make use of the developed dbn model to perform a 5 month ahead forecast of cgwl fig 7 of our respective wells was based on the accuracy assessment of our designed model which is presented in table 3 5 1 3 analysis of the representative stations four representative wells were selected to determine the goodness of fit of the dbn model with the in situ groundwater wells they are represented in blue in fig 1 the first two ww 200248 and d16a had the least variance and the last two stations gp00314 and holy cross 1 had the largest variance in our entire range of well datasets the correlation coefficient for the large variance wells gp00314 and holy cross 1 between cgwls and hydrological related variables tws rainfall and temperature is positive and relatively weak r less than 0 4 at current and lagged 1 4 months on the other hand the correlation is relatively strong for the least variance wells at current and lagged up to five months however the correlation coefficient between the other input parameters such as the enso nao amo iod pdo and the corresponding in changes in groundwater observations varied among the selected four stations fig 10 due to the non uniformity of groundwater wells several stations present weak signals at current and lagged for up to five months the magnitude however is usually higher at the lagged 1 3 months for groundwater anomalies in general the heterogeneity of the cgwl trend against hydrological fluxes and global climate indices depicts the different association between cgwl and climatic parameters at different time scales the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed cgwl at 1 5 months are provided in table 3 and figs 6 7 9 for the cgwl forecasts in subsequent one month the dbn performs better at stations d16a and gp00314 than at stations ww 200248 and holy cross fig 12 according to our quantile regression validation process the addition of precedent gwl outputs to case 2 to case 5 improves the performance of dbn at most selected stations according to the four metrics 5 2 validation of the cgwl estimates typically higher cgwl prediction accuracy means low uncertainty and smoother fluctuations which is a vital point in the use and planning of groundwater resources the assessment of our forecast validation was done on four representative wells consistent with the goodness of fit index the time series of the predicted cgwl at the subsequent 1 5 months coincide well with the observed cgwl at representative well 1 gp00314 and well 3 ww 200248 using the dbn model fig 6i 6iii following the increase of the lead time the dbn performance for the representative wells slightly degraded between the third and fourth month lead time however a slight improvement of the dbn performance is noticed in the fifth case as a result of constantly re injecting the output parameters especially at representative wells 2 d16a and well 3 gp00314 the impact of the re injected in situ ground water data in improving the performance of the predictions fig 6i d e 6ii d e 6iii d e and 6iv d e which recorded better rmse values than the un updated dbn testing phases except for representative well 2 d16a is obvious fig 6i b c 6ii b c 6iii b c and 6iv b c by comparison among the four selected representative stations the dbn performance in case 1 4 at stations 1 and 4 is comparatively weaker at representative wells 2 and 3 according to its higher bias and poor goodness of fit metrics the higher bias at representative wells 1 and 4 can be attributed to the significant abnormality in the cgwl trend which is difficult to be captured even by the dbn using the limited input parameters also the lower correlation between the cgwls and the input parameters are represented in wells 3 and 4 depicts such poor performance using the quantile regression estimate to ascertain the level of uncertainties in the dbn predictions at 90 and 95 confidence levels degree 2 our experiment showed that representative wells 2 fig 12b and 3 fig 12c maintained the least uncertainty in our experiment while well 1 fig 12a and 4 fig 12d contained the highest uncertainly level in our predictions this signifies that the level of non linearity in the groundwater level can also affect the prediction mode of any deep learning model as analyzed above the dbn model can adequately predict the cgwl up to a 5 month lead time even with limited input parameters at most of the wells besides this hydrological fluxes and teleconnection patterns among other factors can also influence groundwater level fluctuations thus the bias in our results the addition of gwls as input variables slightly enhanced the dbn performance index as represented in the bayesian regression plot for the histogram of inferred parameters against cgwls fig 11i 6 discussion of all the five components of terrestrial water storage the dynamics of groundwater resources are the most complex also unlike surface water the monitoring stations for groundwater level fluctuations are extremely scarce due to the cost of running and maintaining those scanlon et al 2012 this is primarily the case in developing regions like sub saharan africa where a lack of in situ data makes it difficult to adequately monitor the fluctuation of groundwater resources in the region another challenge of modeling groundwater level changes is the spatial heterogeneity experienced in the multi scale interactions between catchment climate and aquifer resources besides a significant induction of non stationary behavior in groundwater levels is on the rise especially due to the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities e g increased groundwater use climate extremes e g drought as well as the indirect influences of teleconnection patterns e g enso teleconnection patterns give rise to varied recharge rates affected by land use change and population migration and play a key role in climate change thus affecting groundwater level extraction and utilization with the improvement in satellite remote sensing techniques so as the use of grace data in monitoring freshwater resources the task of groundwater management sustainability in semi arid regions has become more efficient mcguire et al 2012 the development of physically based models requires a large amount of data to enable accurate prediction of complex quantities such as groundwater levels the acquisition of these datasets however can be extremely costly and difficult especially for developing countries that may not have enough to enable a full scale analysis for resources of interest in this study we noticed a significant number of data gaps in our in situ groundwater stations which warranted implementing the ensemble kalman filter enkf technique to assimilate data observations and model data to fill in these gaps table 1 the enkf which is a monte carlo implementation of the bayesian update program given a probability density function pdf of the modeled system state i e the prior and the data likelihood parameter i e bayes theorem is used to generate the pdf after the data likelihood has been taken into account this is referred to as the bayesian update the bayesian update is integrated with advancing the model in time thus incorporating new data from time to time this procedure was adopted to make up for the numerous gaps in the in situ well data thus improving the strength of our system state prior to the dbn training procedures figs 5 and 9 represent the node mapping architecture utilized by the deep belief network in training significantly non assimilated systems and assimilated systems respectively the node mapping architecture 9 6 6 1 is only for the case 1 of the dbn training phase representing 9 original input parameters 6 visible layers 6 hidden layers and then 1 output layer the output layer is then re injected into the second step which makes for case 2 5 each with an increasing number of input variables in their node schematics table 2 fig 6i 6iv represents the training testing and prediction phases of our modeled dbn algorithm which was sampled over our selected four representative wells in fig 6i a 6ii a 6iii a 6iv a 70 of the original input parameters was used for training and 30 for testing and prediction the strength of the system model without our case updates is represented in fig 6i b c 6ii b c 6iii b c and 6iv b c with the fourth representative well holy cross 1 having the highest rmse of 0 3839 and the first representative well ww 200248 having the least rmse of 0 2031 when the updates were applied in the model prediction we observed a fine tuned and better estimate of our system state fig 6i d e 6ii d e 6iii d e 6iv d e with the second representative well d16a recording the highest rmse of 0 4048 and the first representative well ww 200248 recording the lowest rmse of 0 1075 this shows that the system of deep learning where the prior outputs are re injected into the system states improves modeling accuracy fig 8 represents the yearly changes in spatial gws trends over the southern african region from nov 2007 to oct 2010 and a long term trend encompassing the entire study period fig 8a c representing 2007 2010 exhibited a near similar groundwater storage dynamics of the study region towards the northern part of the region which includes angola zambia malawi and parts of namibia the increasing rate of gwl in those areas can be said to be as a result of surface water presence kalu et al 2021a which helps to drive and maintain a steady annual hydrological trend in the region thus resulting in less stress on the region s aquifers on the other hand 2011 2012 saw a significant decline in gwls in these regions which once had abundant groundwater resources this decline has been reported to be a result of meteorological drought in the region caused by the influence of the enso phase chisadza et al 2015 fisher et al 2015 this draws attention to the impact of global climate indices in regulating groundwater resources and as well serves as a pointer to the steady dynamics of groundwater resources in tropical regions to assess the influence of hydrological parameters global climate indices and in situ well extraction rate in cgw levels we utilized the windows cross correlation technique in fig 10 with the procedure we injected two discrete time sequence of the predictors tws rainfall temp etc and predicatand cgwl to measure the similarities between the predictor vector and the shifted lagged copies of the predictand vector as a function of the lag our results show that precipitation fig 10b temperature fig 10c and the in situ well datasets fig 10i maintain the most significant correlation to cgwls of our study region the role of temperature and precipitation are direct pointers to the significance of evaporation and evapotranspiration in regulating groundwater level changes in the region therefore increase in temperature and latent heat transfer and poor rainfall rates can have notable influences on groundwater level fluctuations fig 11 represents the prediction accuracy of our modeled dbn framework as well as the rescaled difference between the original observations and the dbn predictions the model accuracy of our developed framework is ascertained in fig 12 where we employed the quantile regression procedure to ascertain the strength of our model the various uncertainty levels generated by our dbn were estimated as a set of forecasted quantiles for every desired quantile level at a second order 90 and 95 confidence fits the representative well with the least variance fig 12c projected the least uncertainties gpoo314 which still signifies that the severe non linearity of groundwater resources may still overwhelm the system in rare cases we also use all the original predictors to approximate the posterior distribution of our parameter of interest i e cgwl in fig 13 the bayesian framework offers credible intervals as the probabilities of the coefficients in its estimations using a baseline analysis procedure we visualized the comparison of cgwl and the predictors as well as their contributions to groundwater level fluctuations and forecast besides the inherent uncertainties associated with geological hydrological meteorological and climate data tend to increase the complexity of numerical model validation and calibration procedures barzegar et al 2017 sun et al 2016 pointed out that despite the successful acquisition of the physical processes the numerical model calibration procedures often produce unsatisfactory results with the advancement of hydrological science and operations the use of deep learning algorithms has been recently employed in monitoring groundwater levels yadav et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 the deep learning based algorithms can decipher patterns okwuashi and ndehedehe 2017 kalu et al 2022a and attempt to adapt to even non linear dynamic behavior in complex groundwater systems this has increased their use in hydrological research over the past few years each deep learning model has its strengths and weakness therefore the hybrid models which possess the ability to integrate individual models have an advantage over the individual models and have improved model performance and accuracy liu et al 2021a model performances on the other hand are severely affected by a combination of climatic and geophysical systems deep learning algorithms are extremely beneficial in estimating the system state of dynamic environments where the impacts of climate and human water demands vary with time and season in modeling groundwater systems many variables can be exploited for better system estimates for example human water demands based on population density and urbanization can provide future researchers with additional inputs that can be leveraged in the development of sustainable models for groundwater level fluctuations other deep learning methods may also be useful in modeling the complex aquifer systems to understand the dynamics of groundwater changes in different geological and meteorological formations as a result of the severe non linear association existing between climatic and catchment parameters appropriate interpretation structures okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 2021 can provide meaningful results and quantify the roles of discrete parameters in groundwater related studies 7 conclusion in this study the performance of the dbn in changes in groundwater level forecasts at one to five month lead times was investigated using the southern african region as a tentative test bed as part of an overall assessment of key predictors of groundwater using machine learning this study further evaluated the impact of global climate indices and in situ groundwater withdrawal rates in regulating groundwater levels they were included as part of the predictors in our deep learning network our modeling procedure was assessed over 27 well locations in our study region it was observed that the dbn can adequately predict the change in groundwater levels up to 5 month lead time at most of the selected stations our developed dbn model used the maximum probability in its adoption of a multiple sequential stacking of rbms in using the dbn to construct a prediction model for groundwater level fluctuations we employed the i layer to layer training procedure which enabled an unsupervised training of each rbm to learn all the top down approach and most important generative weights in the network so that the hidden layer inferred from the data vector can serve as that of the higher layer succeeding layer and ii the fine tuning training procedure which applied the error back propagation technique to fine tune the dbn parameters after the unsupervised training procedure to enhance the prediction accuracy of groundwater level we integrate the dual learning procedure of the dbn network in our experiment we assumed no target parameter after the unsupervised training process and for the supervised training process we conserved the learning parameters for each round of rbm training while using the outputs of the hidden layers were used as inputs for the next round of rbm training this led to five distinct cases of our training model having architectural dynamics of a 9 6 6 1 b 10 6 6 1 c 11 6 6 1 d 12 6 6 1 e 13 6 6 1 for each respective case the strength of our model lies in this sequential training phase which occurred till all the rbms were finally trained this pseudo back propagation procedure exhibited by the dbn for modeling non linear systems also achieves optimum solution of the initial weights of the network thus leading to refined outputs and forecasts following the enhancement of the model structure and subsequent supervised learning label data by supervised fine tuning the key outcomes from our study are summarized as follows i the inclusion of grace derived tws as an additional variable further improved the performance of the dbn in the modeling process however the performance of the dbn model decreased as the lead time increased from the subsequent one month to three months due to the network s re injection procedure which allows the prior cgwl parameter to become an input for the next estimate the fourth and fifth lead time recorded significant accuracy after our training procedure the dbn performance is highly susceptible to local climate variables and global climate indices such as enso and nao they drive land use and climate change resulting in high dynamics in groundwater level operations the modeling framework developed in this study can be beneficial to stakeholders to predict the local groundwater resources ahead of time so that adequate management strategies can be developed to mitigate risk during drought events ii the impact of global climate indices in regulating changes in groundwater fluctuation is often undermined given that it has no direct relationship and impact on groundwater level fluctuations however our study emphasized on their influence in driving groundwater levels by their role in land use change which affects the withdrawal rate in any respective region as well as the role it plays in modulating hydrological fluxes such as precipitation patterns and temperature that can also contribute to aquifer take out and refill for example past studies have reported the impacts of enso events in causing a reduction in rainfall rates that result in a longer dry season with greater water evaporation and a shorter rainy season with greater surface runoff given that these teleconnection patterns which served as inputs in our deep learning training process bears close proximity to the southern african region their application in our study is justified iii the role of data assimilation contributed significantly to enhancing the strength of our model as it was very instrumental in filling the numerous data gaps of in situ well information of our study region stations with very low in situ to model ratios had higher percentage error rates than stations with average and high in situ to model ratios therefore we observe that the enkf improved our forecast procedure as well as increased the physical understanding of our considered system estimate deep learning offers comprehensive and systematic techniques in evaluating the modalities of non linear systems such as our groundwater resource and could be a very vital tool in the assessment of other hydrological processes that can lead to extreme climate cases our use of the dbn in this study provides insight into the strength of deep learning methods in making informed decisions to mitigate the

7868,study region the southern african region consists of ten countries including angola zambia malawi namibia botswana zimbabwe mozambique south africa lesotho and swaziland frequent drought episodes in the arid and semi arid parts of the region suggest the impact of climate change and the need for a sustainable framework for groundwater level assessments study focus in this study we developed a machine learning modelling framework based on the deep belief network dbn to predict the changes in monthly groundwater levels cgwls at 1 5 month time scales for 27 groundwater wells over the southern africa region with a predictor dataset constituted by hydrological parameters groundwater level estimates and global climate indices we ascertain the possibility of forecasting changes in groundwater levels cgwl up to 5 month lead times at most locations in the study region using the quantile regression technique the strength of the dbn network at 90 and 95 confidence levels were tested and this helped to determine the accuracy of our forecasts at five months lead times over the four representative wells new hydrological insights for the region deep learning offers new capabilities in evaluating non linear hydrological systems including groundwater analysis the re injection procedure of the dbn network which allows the prior cgwl estimates to serve as inputs for the next estimate was key in maintaining the forecast accuracy in the 4th and 5th month lead times this was evidenced in the accuracy of the four representative wells r 0 91 0 87 0 81 0 75 which formed part of the test samples in cgwl analysis we also observed that the dbn is highly susceptible to local climate variables and global climate indices which are important drivers of climate change and can have strong impact on groundwater level fluctuations therefore the dbn proved to be a robust algorithm in our general assessments of groundwater level fluctuations graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater prediction deep belief network deep learning grace data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction available freshwater for human use is stored in aquifers beneath the land surface and plays an important role in global food security replenishing terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functioning and helping humans adapt to climate change cf jasechko and perrone 2021 ndehedehe et al 2021 notwithstanding a surge in the rate of groundwater stress has become a thing of concern in many of the world s largest aquifers this is a fundamental problem that has been linked to both natural and anthropogenic influences which are important drivers of aquifer depletions around the world over the past decade the rate of groundwater depletion doubled because of increased water demand due to population growth jia et al 2019 climate change cotterman et al 2018 intensified agricultural needs bhattarai et al 2021 and anthropogenic influences ashraf et al 2017 if gone unchecked this large scale groundwater withdrawal rate can lead to drought in developing economies that major rely on groundwater for agricultural water use and productions this however has increased the need for improved spatio temporal diagnosis of groundwater resources to develop optimal models and frameworks for an accurate groundwater forecasts over short and even long term periods given that monitoring bores are typically insufficient in several areas that require consistent and effective monitoring new machine learning framework using satellite observations is critical to aid water resource management and increase resilience to climate change over the past decade the rapid advancement in technology brought about the development of several new models and algorithms aimed at enhancing groundwater level forecasts for instance the use of data driven stochastic models for short term groundwater forecasts has been severely applied over several aquifers in large sub regions especially due to its simplicity in development and implementation liu et al 2021ab yin et al 2020 data driven techniques such as support vector machines liu et al 2021a wei et al 2020 yoon et al 2011 multivariate adaptive regression splines and m5 model trees rezaie balf et al 2017 boosted regression trees rahman et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 self organized maps chang et al 2016 nourani et al 2015 and the well known neural networks wu et al 2021 jeong et al 2020 sun et al 2019 amaranto et al 2018 guzman et al 2017 have been widely applied in groundwater level forecasts the simplicity of the above mentioned data driven models is easily noticed in its parameter estimation calibration techniques and its efficiency in handling different sources of uncertainties better than their physically based counterparts gianni et al 2019 burrows and doherty 2016 okwuashi et al 2020 also unlike physically based models the data driven models make groundwater estimations even without data regarding the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer zanotti et al 2019 this makes it the preferred machine learning technique in global groundwater monitoring and popularly applied procedure in various assessments such as the estimation of groundwater salinity susceptibility mosavi et al 2020 2021 sahour et al 2020 nitrate evaluation knoll et al 2019 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 groundwater potential forecasts kalantar et al 2019 lee et al 2020 groundwater fluctuation forecasts mohapatra et al 2021 choubin and malekian 2017 and other hydro climate related studies and applications panahi et al 2020 yu et al 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 he et al 2014 predominant groundwater complexities inherent in data limitations and parameter estimations over different settings such as coastal aquifers taormina et al 2012 yoon et al 2011 supra permafrost groundwater level dynamics chang et al 2015 and convoluted groundwater systems banerjee et al 2009 can also be handled efficiently by data driven models liu et al 2021a among different deep learning tools shi et al 2016 druzhkov and kustikova 2016 mathis and mathis 2020 the deep belief network dbn is becoming increasingly popular in hydrology agana and homaifar 2018 sung et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zan et al 2021 it was not until recently that deep learning technique which is regarded as a new class of machine learning models attracted significant research interest especially in pattern recognition time series analysis signal processing as well as complex modeling tasks like image processing mathis and mathis 2020 shahabi et al 2021 zhong et al 2019 given that the technique is relatively new its application in groundwater studies is still largely insufficient our study pioneers an ensemble dbn in a comprehensive assessment of groundwater level fluctuation using southern africa as a tentative test bed the dbn is a generative graphical model made up of multiple layers of hidden units with connections within the layers given its proficiency in probabilistically reconstructing its input during training gochoo et al 2021 niu et al 2020 we adapt it as a preferred choice due to the complexity and non linearity of groundwater level fluctuations past studies have also shown the proficiency of the dbn in groundwater studies for example the study undertaken by liu et al 2021b for the groundwater level assessment over the jiuquan basin using the dbn reported a satisfactory 1 3 month groundwater level forecast however their study is rife with conspicuous lags especially in the sparse number of running well dataset and the insufficient hydrological parameters used in the forecast additionally this study did not take into account the impact of land use surface water and geology as significant contributing factors in groundwater level forecast in their study these lags could impede the reliability of the results derived from their predictions to circumvent this limitation we propose a comprehensive ensemble dbn for sub regional groundwater level forecasts acknowledging the impact of hydrological factors total water storage tws precipitation and temperature global climate indices enso north atlantic oscillation nao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo indian ocean dipole iod and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and a robust number of groundwater wells in our analysis before the deep learning phase of the dbn we partition our original input parameters into training and testing subsets to prevent future data falling into the training process the overall objective of this study is to forecast the changes in groundwater levels for the study region on a 1 5 month time scales forced with extensive climate parameters for a more robust model the key objectives that are addressed in this study are to i investigate the efficiency of deep learning via dbn in diagnosing changes in groundwater levels at subsequent 1 5 month time scales ii assess the impact of grace derived tws as a forcing variable to the dbn in predicting groundwater levels in southern africa iii understand the interplay between global climate indices and groundwater extraction in the study region especially given their indirect relationship and iv identify the footprints of teleconnection patterns in groundwater assessments in addition to practical groundwater level forecasts we propose using a deterministic approach in addressing uncertainties in our analysis which is a significant factor often neglected in forecasts furthermore this study introduces the quantile regression model for this task this regression model which boasts of uncertainty detection from different sources rahmati et al 2019 is a powerful tool that has been widely used for conditional quantile estimations liu et al 2021b our study adopts this model to estimate the uncertainty in our whole groundwater level forecast over southern africa as part of our post processing tool the remainder of this study is segmented as follows section 2 gives a brief description of the study area highlighting both direct and indirect causes influencing its groundwater level fluctuations section 3 gives a thorough discussion on the data and techniques employed the interpretation and discussion of our experiments is done in section 4 while our study is finally concluded in section 5 2 study region southern africa sa is the southernmost sub region of africa located south of congo and tanzania the sub region is characterized by arid to sub humid climatic and weather patterns the southern african development community sadc has reported cases of drought episodes in the arid and semi arid parts as well as heavy rainfall following these drought regimes which sometimes lead to severe flooding therefore since this sub region relies heavily on subsistence agriculture for their income kalu et al 2021a accurate predictions of hydrological patterns are instrumental to the residents of the sub region three major wind systems have been reported to have the most significant influence on sa s climatology namely i the inter tropical convergence zone itcz which contributes to the wet and dry seasons of tropical regions ii the southeasterly wind system which brings rainfall from the indian ocean and iii the sub tropical eastern continental moist maritime system which experiences regular cyclones furthermore studies blamey et al 2018 kolusu et al 2019 have also linked the dynamics in climate and precipitation patterns over the sa region to the el nino southern oscillation phenomenon these factors are largely responsible for the overall climate extremes noticed in the region it is estimated that at least 70 of the 250 million inhabitants of the southern african countries rely on groundwater as their primary source of water lapworth et al 2017 it provides over 90 of the water used for rural domestic supplies including agriculture ecosystem health industrial growth sanitation as well as drinking this highlights the potential role of groundwater resources for socio economic development over the south african region as a sub region sa has historically been at high risk of drought an extreme hydrological phase which has been linked to several sociological holmgren and öberg 2006 and meteorological kusangaya et al 2014 factors the majority of the sub region s annual precipitation patterns is accumulated by storms from early november to march forming the sa s wet season the region s soil is saturated by the wet months of rainfall patterns which provide moisture that persists for the drier months of the remaining part of the year hydrological fluxes and global climate indices are known to disrupt the region s annual level of rainfall which often results in a decline of the region s plant life deficits of water levels in water bodies and substantial soil moisture loss this is the leading cause of drought in the sa region for instance extremely dry conditions were observed across most of southern africa during the austral summer oct mar of 2015 2016 this dry condition peaked in the early austral summer months oct dec generating the most intense drought episode in a 115 year historical record as estimated by the intensity of the standardized precipitation index over the sub continent across all spatial scales during this period the sadc reported widespread and harsh impacts of this exceptionally dry condition across many sectors of the region including significant loss of livestock and crops which resulted in an increase in the cost of food severe water shortages and a decrease in power generation and supply blamey et al 2018 by 2016 it was pertinent for the sadc to declare a regional drought disaster and nine months later six sadc countries had pronounced national drought emergencies i e malawi swaziland namibia botswana zimbabwe and lesotho whereas south africa pronounced the drought emergency status for seven of its nine provinces with a temporary red alert also pronounced for the southern and central provinces of mozambique in sa groundwater is the dominant source of freshwater especially for the rural population and many expanding cities macdonald et al 2012 this is usually the case in arid regions where groundwater proves to be the only perennial source of water recent studies however have shown the rapid development of groundwater resources in sub saharan africa villholth 2013 calow et al 2010 taylor et al 2009 and are dominantly highlighted in national development plans aimed at satisfying the need for proliferated freshwater access and agricultural intensification under rapidly increasing populations and economic growth groundwater as a source of freshwater is extremely important in the sa region especially due to the low efficiency of surface runoff in the region mcmahon et al 1987 and drinking untreated surface water has been known to result in poor health hunter et al 2010 however the recharge rate plays a crucial role in the long term viability of groundwater withdrawals as well as the ecosystem niche that depends on groundwater resources inasmuch as groundwater s high ecological and socio economic relevance as an essential and strategic resource is recognized throughout the sa region the region is still plagued with an insufficient and sparse network of running well data which lowers the current state of groundwater studies in the sub region this on its own is a significant limitation to the sustainable development of groundwater resources however efforts to enhance the situation have been made over the last decade they are noticeable through the publication of syntheses and critical assessments of the issue at national sub regional and even continental levels cf xu et al 2019 3 data 3 1 groundwater level data the groundwater level data used in this study are collected from the archives of the global groundwater information system ggis https ggis un igrac org view well and monitoring data over the southern african region consisting of namibia botswana south africa lesotho swaziland zimbabwe zambia mozambique malawi and angola see fig 1 for their locations and distributions throughout the region ggis was initiated by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco and executed by the international groundwater resources assessment center igrac to improve the quality and accessibility of groundwater assessment monitoring and information management in a global context with the temporal resolution of groundwater levels in daily time steps for most aquifers we estimated the monthly data by a temporal averaging of the daily data for nov 2007 oct 2012 note the antecedent in situ groundwater formed part of our predictors the predicted groundwater level changes for each month were integrated into the testing parameters for the next month 3 2 terrestrial water storage tws terrestrial water storage tws is a function of the dynamics of the earth s gravity fields its relation to hydrological applications is characterized by the sum of water stored in the soil underground over the land surface canopy and even as snow in this study we selected the monthly mass concentration mascon grace product rl 05 nov 2007 oct 2012 available at 0 5 degrees resolution obtained from the centre for space research csr the mascon dataset applied in our analysis was downloaded from grace 2022 the csr mascon approach applied in this study makes use of an intermediate procedure for the determination of a time variable regularization matrix save et al 2016 to evaluate the mascon solution this allows the construction of a time variable regularization based solely on the grace data ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 3 3 precipitation monthly generated tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm v7 3b43 precipitation parameters nov 2007 oct 2012 from the national aerospace and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc integrated with multiple precipitation datasets such as i assimilated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements imerg ii trmm microwave imager tmi iii visible and infrared scanner virs iv special sensor microwave imager ssm i and v rain gauge data were applied in this study the parameters are derived by averaging the trmm 3b42 v6 precipitation products they contain estimates of the total monthly precipitation recorded from 1998 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 arc degree this dataset was downloaded from noaa gsfc noaa 2022 a large overestimation in the tropical rainforest region of africa over the trmm rainfall radar is ascertained in december january february and in march april may and a minimized bias in june july august and september october november by applying the zonal mean analysis kalu et al 2021a regardless the relatively sharp bias for all models in the dry seasons when rainfall is nominal is less prominent in the dry seasons of the african tropical regions it was necessary to rescale the trmm imerg rainfall dataset to preserve and maintain a consistent spatial resolution with the other input parameters in our deep training algorithm 3 4 temperature the temperature data was derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era interim project era 2022 the global era interim assimilates the 2 m air temperature using several observational sources including data from stations satellites and radiosonde ahmed and wiese 2019 at a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 75 arc degree and 6 h respectively dee et al 2011 3 5 climate indices 3 5 1 enso enso is a recurring climatic pattern that involves variations in the temperatures of waters in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean it describes the presence of abnormally warm el nino and cold la nina sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the eastern pacific ndehedehe et al 2017 the multivariate enso index mei is the first principal component of the integrated regularized fields of total cloudiness fractions surface air pressure meridional and zonal wind components as well as the sea level pressure the units of mei are standardized thus a score of 1 denotes a complete standard deviation departure of the principal component for the corresponding period wolter and timlin 2011 given the association of the mei derived from http www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei with inter annual variability of water availability as well as its integration of six other variables and anomalies describing the pacific it was preferred in this our analysis as a significant contributor to climate change which indirectly results in the over exploitation of groundwater resources to other available indices 3 5 2 north atlantic oscillation the north atlantic oscillation nao index comprises a north south dipole of anomalies the first one is situated over greenland while the second one having an opposite sign spans through the central latitudes of the north atlantic region i e 350 n and 400 n these opposing phases of the nao are largely responsible for basin wide variations especially in the location and intensity of the north atlantic jet stream and storm track as well as the in large scale harmonization of the average meridional and zonal heat patterns and moisture transfer anyah et al 2018 this results in the high level dynamics of global precipitation and temperature patterns which is an indirect contributor to groundwater changes given its action in sub regional climate change ndehedehe et al 2019 the nao dataset for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 was downloaded from http www cpc ncep noaa gov products precip cwlink pna nao shtml and employed in our analysis 3 5 3 atlantic multi decadal oscillation the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo is a coherent variability pattern in the north atlantic ssts having duration of 720 960 months and standardly computed from the mean sst anomalies of the northern atlantic ndehedehe et al 2017 trenberth and shea 2006 past studies have correlated multi decadal variations of the sahel summer rainfall to the activities of the amo as well as its contribution to global warming trenberth and shea 2006 ndehedehe et al 2017 its indirect impact in regulating hydrological fluxes such as precipitation patterns evapotranspiration rates and latent heat transfer makes it a major contributor of indirect groundwater level changes over sub saharan africa ndehedehe et al 2017 for this study we adopted the unsmoothed amo index from the kaplan sst v2 which is downloadable at http www esrl noaa gov psd data timeseries amo 3 5 4 indian ocean dipole the indian ocean dipole iod is largely characterized by irregular oscillation of ssts which allows the alternation of warm and cold temperatures between the western and eastern part of the indian ocean it is primarily described by the anomalous sst gradient between the southeastern equatorial indian ocean and the western equatorial indian ocean which is popularly referred to as the dipole mode index dmi this study explored the monthly correlation between this dataset and the groundwater level changes for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 this data was downloaded from the japanese marine earth science and technology jamstech platform via http www jamstec go jp frcgc research d1 iod html dipole 20mode 20index html 3 5 5 pacific decadal oscillation the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is a recurring pattern of ocean atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid latitude pacific basin it is detected as either warm or cool surface waters in the pacific ocean north of 200 n the pdo can be likened to a long lived el nino like pattern of pacific climate variability having extremes symbolized by widespread oscillations in the north america climate and the pacific basin ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 given its irregular oscillating patterns characterized by low frequency dynamics it serves as a potential tool for future climatic explorations especially as its influences in regulating climate patterns over continental scales have been widely researched ndehedehe et al 2019 ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 the pdo dataset for the period of nov 2007 oct 2012 was downloaded from https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections pdo and used in our study 4 methodology 4 1 deep belief network the deep belief network dbn is a trending topic in the field of neural networks recently it has shown higher accuracy than many prominent and conventional deep learning methods in speech hand writing recognition image recognition and other classification problems ribeiro and lopes 2011 gencoglu et al 2014 one significant feature of the dbn that differentiates it from other shallow learning networks is its ability to enhance the identification of deep neural patterns aid reasoning abilities and the possibility of encapsulating the deep difference between normal and faulty data chen et al 2021 the dbn is a class of deep neural networks that creates training datasets by utilizing the maximum probability in multiple sequentially stacked restricted boltzmann machines rbm aimed at training the weights between neurons in its network fig 3 the rbm is the basic unit of the dbn and is made up of two layers of neurons the visible and hidden layers used for training input and feature detection respectively even though a unique connection between the adjacent layers of the dbn network exists there are no relationships among the entire rbm layers proposed by geoffrey hinton in 2006 the dbn is popular for solving unsupervised learning tasks to reduce feature dimensionality it can also be used to solve supervised learning tasks to construct regression or even classification models sohn 2021 the most popular techniques in training a dbn are i the layer by layer training and ii the fine tuning training in the former an unsupervised training procedure of each rbm is undertaken to learn all the top down approach and most important generative weights in the network this is so that the hidden layer inferred from the data vector can serve as that of the higher layer succeeding layer on the other hand the latter applies the error back propagation technique to fine tune the dbn parameters after the unsupervised training procedure for this study we integrate the dual learning process of the dbn to improve the accuracy of our forecasts fig 2 we assume no target variable after the training corresponding to the study conducted by yuan et al 2021 for the unsupervised pre training process in this phase after training one of the rbms the learning parameters are conserved at the same time the outputs of the hidden layers are used as input for the next round of rbm training figs 3 4 following this procedure the rbm training undergoes a sequential training order till all the rbms are finally trained this phase is crucial in achieving an optimum solution of the initial weights of the network and the obtained parameters can be applied in phase two i e the supervised fine tuning phase phase two helps to enhance the model structure and subsequent supervised learning labeled data our modeled dbn is composed of several rbms stacked on top of one another the generative rbm s employed in our deep learning is characterized by a layer of visible units v and a layer of binary hidden units h the integrated configuration of the visible and hidden units produces a total energy function given by 1 e v h i j v i h j w i j i v i a i j h j b j where the indices of the visible and hidden layers are represented by i and j respectively w i j represents the connection of the weights between the ith visible and the jth hidden unit the state of the ith and jth hidden unit are characterized by v i and h j while a i and b j represent the biases of the visible and the hidden layers the first term i j v i h j w i j depicts the energy between the hidden and visible units with their connected weights the second term i v i a i depicts the energy in the visible layer while the third term j h j b j depicts the energy in the hidden layer the joint probability assigned to the visible and hidden layer by the rbm is given by 2 p v h e e v h z where z given as z v h e e v h is the partition function derived by adding the energy of all possible visible and hidden layer configurations upadhya and sastry 2019 if the probability of a data point represented by a state v is to be determined the marginal probability is applied removing the state of the hidden layer or vice versa such that p v h p v h with the function above the probability of either the visible or the hidden configuration for any given input parameter to be activated can be determined conveniently furthermore the parameters can be used to implement inference to decide the conditional probabilities in the model for the likelihood of the model to be maximized the gradient of the log likelihood with respect to the weights must be computed the gradient of the first term can be written as 3 δ log h exp e v h δ w i j v i p h j 1 v however it is difficult to compute the gradient of the second term inasmuch as no connections exists between visible to visible or between the hidden to hidden nodes in the rbm we can infer the connection between the visible and hidden layers using 4 p h j 1 v σ b j i v i w ji 5 p v i 1 h σ a i j h j w ji where σ represents the sigmoid function overall a dbn is characterized by an arbitrary number of stacked rbms serving as a stochastic recurrent neural network on top of each other this generates an assimilation of partially undirected and a partially directed graphical model therefore the integrated distribution between the visible layer v and the l hidden layers h t is defined as 6 p v h l h t k 0 l 2 p h t h t 1 p h l 1 h l where p h k h k 1 represents a conditional distribution for the visible units based on the hidden units of the rbm at level t and p h l 1 h l shows the integrated visible hidden distribution in the top level rbm in this study we simulated a six hidden layer i e h 1 j h 2 j and h 3 j dbn model fig 3 the apex level rbm in our modeled dbn acted as a complimentary prior from the bottom level directed sigmoid likelihood function during the first training phase we adopted the greedy unsupervised method by training separately each rbm from the model in a bottom to top style and using the obtained hidden layer from the prior phase as an input layer for the next rbm fig 3 furthermore the modeled dbn was used to project our prior estimates acquired from both in situ and satellite remote sensing techniques to another state space with binary values upadhya and sastry 2019 this was achieved by attaching the prior states in the bottom layer of the model and inferring the top hidden layer from them each rbm converts its data distribution into an aggregated posterior distribution over its hidden units this therefore divides the task of modeling its data into two i in the first task it learns generative weights that can translate the aggregated posterior distribution over the hidden units back to the data distribution and ii in the second phase it learns to model the aggregated posterior distribution over hidden units however the second task is easier for the next rbm than it was for the original input datasets because the aggregated posterior distribution is closer to a distribution that an rbm can model perfectly in the end we were able to integrate the top hidden layer parameters directly into the q learning algorithms of the dbn for further analysis fig 5 4 2 data assimilation as a result of the large data gaps in our in situ groundwater data we adopted the data assimilation da technique to make the adequate estimation of those gaps so as to achieve a more robust result with an adequate number of input variables da allows the merging of different sources of data to estimate possible states of a system as it evolves in time it integrates observation data and the underlying dynamical principles regulating the system to estimate the system state which is better than could be generated with just the discrete data or model alone also its use in the optimal estimation of hydrological variables by merging in situ data or remote sensing data into models has been significant studied and widely applied over the past years liu et al 2021a 2017 2016 montzka et al 2011 in our study we applied the ensemble kalman filtering technique enkf for estimating the data gaps in our in situ data due to its efficiency in incorporating observation data into a dynamical system obeying kalman filter theory and the monte carlo method fan et al 2017 we fed our da model with optimal in situ groundwater gw information and model gw information obtained by isolating the groundwater component from the grace tws based on the water budget approach this was achieved by subtracting discrete surface water and soil moisture datasets obtained through the global land data assimilation model gldas from the grace derived tws the snow and canopy water component of the tws was overlooked due to their insignificant contribution in driving tws dynamics in our study region this was achieved through 7 gw tws grace sm noah where gw represents the obtained groundwater data and sm depicts the soil moisture information obtained from the noah lsm model from nasa s global land data assimilation system the surface water component sw which is an integral component of the tws was masked from the gldas data the global aridity and drought areas outlined by dai 2011 over the sub saharan african region have increased substantially during the 20th and 21st century and was attributed to widespread drying since 1970 s over africa masih et al 2014 southern europe vicente serrano et al 2014 south asia annamalai et al 2013 eastern australia ndehedehe et al 2021 and many parts of the northern mid high latitudes this aridity has however resulted in significant deficits in surface water components in the tws products over these regions from 2007 to 2011 thus allowing soil moisture be the most significant driver of grace derived tws over our study region the noah lsm used in our experiment was derived from the gldas version 2 1 available from nasa s earth data site http earthdata nasa gov note the difference between tws grace and tws noah is used to quantify grace informed groundwater anomalies liu et al 2021a eq 8 also considering the error covariance and the weights based on the inverse of squared observation and model error covariance we initiated the iteration procedure of our da algorithm despite the large time consumption of our da model we employed the sequential updating of the kalman gain with an ensemble averaging of the observation data and model error covariance to achieve a finely determined result in the conventional enkf scheme the model error covariance is estimated from the ensemble forecasts in the routine of time growth of the model state the model error covariance estimate accounts for the most significant source of increase in the computational time elapsed for completing a da cycle to obtain more accurate model error covariance estimates larger ensemble sizes are imposed on the system state to achieve more computation time we achieved time growth in our system at time t through the assimilated results from the model which was however slightly affected by several random errors table 1 through an ensemble of the predicted results the mean model state and model error covariance at the next time steps are estimated for 60 month in situ data used in our experiment fig 4 we represent the observation equation at time t as 8 y t e x t n t where the model state at the time t is represented by x t y t represents the system state and observation data at time t e represents the time invariant transform matrix while n is the observation error at time t the system state is updated at every time following the execution of da to 9 x t a x t f k t y t e x t f where the assimilated model state at every time t is represented by x t a the forecast model state is represented by x t f while k t is the kalman gain the innovation vector is represented by y t e x t f it is important to adopt the kalman gain computational efficiency as it not only attempts to weigh and balance the uncertainties between the estimate and observation before proceeding to the analysis step but also minimize the covariance x t a x t f x t a x t f t 10 k t p t f e t e p t f e t r 1 where p t f represents the model error covariance at time t and r depicts the observation error covariance with time invariant parameters the time growth of the model state is accomplished using several initial conditions of j pieces using an ocean circulation model 11 x j

a this recursive looping continues until the system model convergences fig 4 4 3 uncertainty evaluation quantile regression for this analysis we ascertained the predictive uncertainty of the developed dbn models using the quantile regression qr algorithm the qr algorithm is a linear method that can be used to estimate the quantiles of a response variable even in the absence of a prescribed hypothesis koenker and bassett 1978 koenker and hallock 2001 the qr technique is well known in evaluating the strength of model and has been in use for over fifty years kasraei et al 2021 liu et al 2021b weerts et al 2011 pointed out the efficiency and robustness of applying the qr in estimating forecast errors with respect to the forecasted water levels as it provided highly accurate results in the entire quantitative modeling process we express the relationship between the observed y and predicted ypredicted for each quantile τ as follows 17 y α τ y predicted b τ where the slope and intercept of the eq 7 above is given by α τ and b τ respectively and is estimated by minimizing the sum or residuals such that 18 min i 1 n ρ τ y i α τ y predicted i where y i and y predicted i are i th samples from the dataset and qr function of the τ th quantile is ρ τ which is given by 19 ρ τ ε i τ 1 ε i ε i 0 τ ε i ε i 0 our deep learning methods generated various uncertainty values which were estimated as a set of forecasted quantiles for every desired quantile level i e ρ 0 90 and 0 95 4 4 model performance evaluation given that we set aside 4 representative groundwater wells for our validation of 1 5 month groundwater forecasts against our modeled dbn models we applied several statistical models such as the mean absolute error mae correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and a confusion matrix to ascertain the preciseness and veracity of our model as a relevant tool for hydrological estimations these statistical tools have been extensively applied in the performance evaluation of several hydrological models ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 liu et al 2021b the mae provides a stable perspective to determine the goodness of fit based on the model estimation errors while the correlation coefficient shows the degree of linearity between the forecasted and observed parameters in contrast the nse adopts a range of and 1 which represents the error extent between the simulated and the averaged observational parameters while the ideal or optimal value for the rmse is 0 this however is not usually the case due to the severe non linearity of our model network kalu et al 2021b c as well as the hydrological patterns that initiates the process we applied the following equations in our evaluation 20 mae 1 n i 1 n gwl i predicted gwl i observed 21 r i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i observed gwl i predicted gwl i predicted i 1 n gwl i observed gwl i observed 2 i 1 n gwl i predicted gwl i predicted 2 22 nse 1 i 1 n

represent the observed and predicted or simulated groundwater level at time t respectively while the mean of the observed and predicted groundwater level at time t is represented by gwl i observed and gwl i predicted respectively 5 results 5 1 implementation of proposed method 5 1 1 parameter selection prior to the training of our original parameters a preliminary evaluation is performed based on the correlation analysis of the input variables fig 2 this is necessary for the training of deep learning algorithms which require coarse correlation fit for their original input variables because a good correlation between them signifies that they are composed of more repeated information and as such may lead to a reduction in the prediction accuracy of the model while increasing the computational complexity of the entire process liu and wang 2011 hydrological variables tws precipitation temperature climate indices enso nao amo iod pdo and the in situ groundwater levels at different time lags are used as predictors while the change in groundwater levels are used as predictand supporting information 1 our choice of input variables covers a wide range of factors influencing groundwater fluctuations in the sub region for example the population density of different locations in the study area shown in fig 1 plays key roles in groundwater fluctuations of the entire sub region on the other hand regions with high population density gradually shift the residence of the human population from rural to urban areas resulting in urbanization the effect of urbanization contributes to the causal influence on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change thus resulting in temperature change qiu et al 2020 decline in tws kalu et al 2021a rainfall patterns li et al 2020 and global climate indices in regulating hydrological fluxes and patterns in large sub regional scales chen et al 2016 all these processes are either directly or indirectly tied to the groundwater variations in the respective sub regions and time scales fig 8 as such they will provide important details in understanding the dynamics of groundwater levels thus their use in our analysis given that the study area is relatively large we noticed that the correlation strength between the cgwl and the selected climate variables are affected by the region s dynamics in the landscape and climatic patterns for instance the influence of the congo and zambezi river basins on the hydrological condition of angola zambia and malawi is relatively stronger than that of namibia botswana and south africa kalu et al 2021a also high population density in regions like namibia botswana and zimbabwe fig 1 are equally direct contributors to groundwater stress of such regions and as well affects the correlation strength between the cgwl and parameters such as tws and rainfall of these regions generally the correlation coefficient between the cgwl and hydrological related variables is positive and significant at most of the well locations on the other hand the correlation between cgwl and global indices variables is dominated negatively at most stations with a magnitude below 0 4 this in turn resulted in more negative changes in groundwater fluctuation levels for our representative wells fig 7a b c e f g k m p s t this is a pointer to the indirect influence of teleconnection patterns on groundwater fluctuations this depicts those precedent hydrological variables are likely to significantly influence cgwl of the sub region based on the above analysis tws rainfall temperature climate indices and in situ groundwater well level are selected as potential input variables in our dbn network 5 1 2 implementation of the dbn model in this study the dbn is implemented to predict the cgwl at 1 5 month time scales the flow chart of the dbn model is provided in fig 2 the prior input variables are selected from our original datasets tws rainfall temperature climate indices and in situ groundwater well levels and are used in the development of our dbn model the dbn constructed an initial learning model using a training set of nine input variables six visible and hidden nodes and one output data figs 5 9 in general the dbn consists of two steps i the first phase is constructing the rbm network using unsupervised learning and ii the second phase where the rbm network learns the back propagation algorithm of supervised learning the rbm setting of epoch batch size and momentum for the construction and back propagation phases are duly represent in table 2 rbms hold two sets of random variables which we refer to as neurons one layer where the inputs go into which is referred to as the visible nodes to represent observable data and another layer of hidden variables to encapsulate dependencies of visible variables by estimating the probability distribution of the features fig 9 however the task of determining the number of nodes to use in our training for both the visible and hidden layers is a vital aspect in the regulation of the accuracy index of our model few hidden neurons provide faster training but result in scarce feature detectors in contrast more hidden neurons result in a longer training period for instance if two homogenous networks having similar errors on the training datasets with varying hidden layers are compared the one with few hidden units is likely to produce a more reliable prediction on new cases while the more complex one while diminishing the model s ability to generalize on new datasets has an increased chance of over fitting on the training dataset özesmi and özesmi 1999 also an increased number of hidden layers allow a generative model to enhance its closeness of fit while a smaller number boosts the smoothness or extrapolation proficiency of the network a generative model with one visible and one hidden layer can be likened to perform linearly and can estimate any function as long as the visible and hidden layers consist of sufficient functions however some studies that implemented generative models in their predictive analysis suggest initiating with at least two visible and hidden layers flood and kartam 1994 for our study we implemented the trial and error method to determine the optimal number of visible and hidden layers and their respective discrete nodes which was based on the experience of our dataset the strategy is implemented because of the highly problematic dependence of many optimal generative model geometries past studies have also attempted to base the number of training samples on the number of connection weights available in the network given the divergent nature of the rule of thumb procedure which was applied in our experiment we used the number of connection weights and the number of input and output neurons to estimate the number of visible and hidden neurons in our network in this procedure if only one hidden layer is to be used then the number n of connection weights should not be more than n 0 1 and the number of hidden neurons should not be less than ½ xinput xoutput theoretically one sure way of meeting these two conditions is to have a relatively large number of training datasets however walczak and cerpa 1999 suggested that the number of hidden neurons in the last layer should be equivalent to the number of decision factors utilized by domain connoisseurs in attempting the solution of the problem decision factors are the discernable constituents that make up the distinct categories of the input vector system it is determined mainly by the number of heuristic rules or clusters utilized in an expert framework we evaluated five cases to predict the cgwl at subsequent one to five month time scales using precedent datasets of tws precipitation temperature global indices and in situ groundwater data as predictors case 1 is designed to assess the potential of the dbn in predicting cgwl using limited precedent input parameters tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 and had a node formation of 9 4 4 1 in case 2 we re injected the output from case 1 into the input parameters to change the node formation to 10 4 4 1 this helped to increase the influence of in situ groundwater wells in our forecasts the predictors for the case 2 include cgwl t x1a tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 in the dbn model in case 3 the outputs from case 1 and case 2 served as additional input parameters to the dbn model the predictors for the case 3 include cgwl t x1a cgwl t 1 x1b tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 with a node formation of 11 4 4 1 in case 4 the model inputs are updated to cgwl t x1a cgwl t 1 x1b cgwl t 2 x1c tws t precip t temp t 1 t 2 enso t nao t amo t iod t pdo t gwl t 1 with a node formation of 12 4 4 1 while case 5 was characterized by all the prior outputs as well as the original input variables to generate a node formation of 13 4 4 1 table 2 as well as utilized the gbdbn model type in its estimation in contrast to the bbdbn model types utilized by other cases in the bbdbn approach all input rbms are the bernoulli bernoulli rbms whereas in the gbdbn approach the input rbm is the gaussian bernoulli rbm out of the original 5 year 60 months data used in our overall experiment 70 of the data was used for the training and 30 for validation our decision to make use of the developed dbn model to perform a 5 month ahead forecast of cgwl fig 7 of our respective wells was based on the accuracy assessment of our designed model which is presented in table 3 5 1 3 analysis of the representative stations four representative wells were selected to determine the goodness of fit of the dbn model with the in situ groundwater wells they are represented in blue in fig 1 the first two ww 200248 and d16a had the least variance and the last two stations gp00314 and holy cross 1 had the largest variance in our entire range of well datasets the correlation coefficient for the large variance wells gp00314 and holy cross 1 between cgwls and hydrological related variables tws rainfall and temperature is positive and relatively weak r less than 0 4 at current and lagged 1 4 months on the other hand the correlation is relatively strong for the least variance wells at current and lagged up to five months however the correlation coefficient between the other input parameters such as the enso nao amo iod pdo and the corresponding in changes in groundwater observations varied among the selected four stations fig 10 due to the non uniformity of groundwater wells several stations present weak signals at current and lagged for up to five months the magnitude however is usually higher at the lagged 1 3 months for groundwater anomalies in general the heterogeneity of the cgwl trend against hydrological fluxes and global climate indices depicts the different association between cgwl and climatic parameters at different time scales the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed cgwl at 1 5 months are provided in table 3 and figs 6 7 9 for the cgwl forecasts in subsequent one month the dbn performs better at stations d16a and gp00314 than at stations ww 200248 and holy cross fig 12 according to our quantile regression validation process the addition of precedent gwl outputs to case 2 to case 5 improves the performance of dbn at most selected stations according to the four metrics 5 2 validation of the cgwl estimates typically higher cgwl prediction accuracy means low uncertainty and smoother fluctuations which is a vital point in the use and planning of groundwater resources the assessment of our forecast validation was done on four representative wells consistent with the goodness of fit index the time series of the predicted cgwl at the subsequent 1 5 months coincide well with the observed cgwl at representative well 1 gp00314 and well 3 ww 200248 using the dbn model fig 6i 6iii following the increase of the lead time the dbn performance for the representative wells slightly degraded between the third and fourth month lead time however a slight improvement of the dbn performance is noticed in the fifth case as a result of constantly re injecting the output parameters especially at representative wells 2 d16a and well 3 gp00314 the impact of the re injected in situ ground water data in improving the performance of the predictions fig 6i d e 6ii d e 6iii d e and 6iv d e which recorded better rmse values than the un updated dbn testing phases except for representative well 2 d16a is obvious fig 6i b c 6ii b c 6iii b c and 6iv b c by comparison among the four selected representative stations the dbn performance in case 1 4 at stations 1 and 4 is comparatively weaker at representative wells 2 and 3 according to its higher bias and poor goodness of fit metrics the higher bias at representative wells 1 and 4 can be attributed to the significant abnormality in the cgwl trend which is difficult to be captured even by the dbn using the limited input parameters also the lower correlation between the cgwls and the input parameters are represented in wells 3 and 4 depicts such poor performance using the quantile regression estimate to ascertain the level of uncertainties in the dbn predictions at 90 and 95 confidence levels degree 2 our experiment showed that representative wells 2 fig 12b and 3 fig 12c maintained the least uncertainty in our experiment while well 1 fig 12a and 4 fig 12d contained the highest uncertainly level in our predictions this signifies that the level of non linearity in the groundwater level can also affect the prediction mode of any deep learning model as analyzed above the dbn model can adequately predict the cgwl up to a 5 month lead time even with limited input parameters at most of the wells besides this hydrological fluxes and teleconnection patterns among other factors can also influence groundwater level fluctuations thus the bias in our results the addition of gwls as input variables slightly enhanced the dbn performance index as represented in the bayesian regression plot for the histogram of inferred parameters against cgwls fig 11i 6 discussion of all the five components of terrestrial water storage the dynamics of groundwater resources are the most complex also unlike surface water the monitoring stations for groundwater level fluctuations are extremely scarce due to the cost of running and maintaining those scanlon et al 2012 this is primarily the case in developing regions like sub saharan africa where a lack of in situ data makes it difficult to adequately monitor the fluctuation of groundwater resources in the region another challenge of modeling groundwater level changes is the spatial heterogeneity experienced in the multi scale interactions between catchment climate and aquifer resources besides a significant induction of non stationary behavior in groundwater levels is on the rise especially due to the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities e g increased groundwater use climate extremes e g drought as well as the indirect influences of teleconnection patterns e g enso teleconnection patterns give rise to varied recharge rates affected by land use change and population migration and play a key role in climate change thus affecting groundwater level extraction and utilization with the improvement in satellite remote sensing techniques so as the use of grace data in monitoring freshwater resources the task of groundwater management sustainability in semi arid regions has become more efficient mcguire et al 2012 the development of physically based models requires a large amount of data to enable accurate prediction of complex quantities such as groundwater levels the acquisition of these datasets however can be extremely costly and difficult especially for developing countries that may not have enough to enable a full scale analysis for resources of interest in this study we noticed a significant number of data gaps in our in situ groundwater stations which warranted implementing the ensemble kalman filter enkf technique to assimilate data observations and model data to fill in these gaps table 1 the enkf which is a monte carlo implementation of the bayesian update program given a probability density function pdf of the modeled system state i e the prior and the data likelihood parameter i e bayes theorem is used to generate the pdf after the data likelihood has been taken into account this is referred to as the bayesian update the bayesian update is integrated with advancing the model in time thus incorporating new data from time to time this procedure was adopted to make up for the numerous gaps in the in situ well data thus improving the strength of our system state prior to the dbn training procedures figs 5 and 9 represent the node mapping architecture utilized by the deep belief network in training significantly non assimilated systems and assimilated systems respectively the node mapping architecture 9 6 6 1 is only for the case 1 of the dbn training phase representing 9 original input parameters 6 visible layers 6 hidden layers and then 1 output layer the output layer is then re injected into the second step which makes for case 2 5 each with an increasing number of input variables in their node schematics table 2 fig 6i 6iv represents the training testing and prediction phases of our modeled dbn algorithm which was sampled over our selected four representative wells in fig 6i a 6ii a 6iii a 6iv a 70 of the original input parameters was used for training and 30 for testing and prediction the strength of the system model without our case updates is represented in fig 6i b c 6ii b c 6iii b c and 6iv b c with the fourth representative well holy cross 1 having the highest rmse of 0 3839 and the first representative well ww 200248 having the least rmse of 0 2031 when the updates were applied in the model prediction we observed a fine tuned and better estimate of our system state fig 6i d e 6ii d e 6iii d e 6iv d e with the second representative well d16a recording the highest rmse of 0 4048 and the first representative well ww 200248 recording the lowest rmse of 0 1075 this shows that the system of deep learning where the prior outputs are re injected into the system states improves modeling accuracy fig 8 represents the yearly changes in spatial gws trends over the southern african region from nov 2007 to oct 2010 and a long term trend encompassing the entire study period fig 8a c representing 2007 2010 exhibited a near similar groundwater storage dynamics of the study region towards the northern part of the region which includes angola zambia malawi and parts of namibia the increasing rate of gwl in those areas can be said to be as a result of surface water presence kalu et al 2021a which helps to drive and maintain a steady annual hydrological trend in the region thus resulting in less stress on the region s aquifers on the other hand 2011 2012 saw a significant decline in gwls in these regions which once had abundant groundwater resources this decline has been reported to be a result of meteorological drought in the region caused by the influence of the enso phase chisadza et al 2015 fisher et al 2015 this draws attention to the impact of global climate indices in regulating groundwater resources and as well serves as a pointer to the steady dynamics of groundwater resources in tropical regions to assess the influence of hydrological parameters global climate indices and in situ well extraction rate in cgw levels we utilized the windows cross correlation technique in fig 10 with the procedure we injected two discrete time sequence of the predictors tws rainfall temp etc and predicatand cgwl to measure the similarities between the predictor vector and the shifted lagged copies of the predictand vector as a function of the lag our results show that precipitation fig 10b temperature fig 10c and the in situ well datasets fig 10i maintain the most significant correlation to cgwls of our study region the role of temperature and precipitation are direct pointers to the significance of evaporation and evapotranspiration in regulating groundwater level changes in the region therefore increase in temperature and latent heat transfer and poor rainfall rates can have notable influences on groundwater level fluctuations fig 11 represents the prediction accuracy of our modeled dbn framework as well as the rescaled difference between the original observations and the dbn predictions the model accuracy of our developed framework is ascertained in fig 12 where we employed the quantile regression procedure to ascertain the strength of our model the various uncertainty levels generated by our dbn were estimated as a set of forecasted quantiles for every desired quantile level at a second order 90 and 95 confidence fits the representative well with the least variance fig 12c projected the least uncertainties gpoo314 which still signifies that the severe non linearity of groundwater resources may still overwhelm the system in rare cases we also use all the original predictors to approximate the posterior distribution of our parameter of interest i e cgwl in fig 13 the bayesian framework offers credible intervals as the probabilities of the coefficients in its estimations using a baseline analysis procedure we visualized the comparison of cgwl and the predictors as well as their contributions to groundwater level fluctuations and forecast besides the inherent uncertainties associated with geological hydrological meteorological and climate data tend to increase the complexity of numerical model validation and calibration procedures barzegar et al 2017 sun et al 2016 pointed out that despite the successful acquisition of the physical processes the numerical model calibration procedures often produce unsatisfactory results with the advancement of hydrological science and operations the use of deep learning algorithms has been recently employed in monitoring groundwater levels yadav et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 the deep learning based algorithms can decipher patterns okwuashi and ndehedehe 2017 kalu et al 2022a and attempt to adapt to even non linear dynamic behavior in complex groundwater systems this has increased their use in hydrological research over the past few years each deep learning model has its strengths and weakness therefore the hybrid models which possess the ability to integrate individual models have an advantage over the individual models and have improved model performance and accuracy liu et al 2021a model performances on the other hand are severely affected by a combination of climatic and geophysical systems deep learning algorithms are extremely beneficial in estimating the system state of dynamic environments where the impacts of climate and human water demands vary with time and season in modeling groundwater systems many variables can be exploited for better system estimates for example human water demands based on population density and urbanization can provide future researchers with additional inputs that can be leveraged in the development of sustainable models for groundwater level fluctuations other deep learning methods may also be useful in modeling the complex aquifer systems to understand the dynamics of groundwater changes in different geological and meteorological formations as a result of the severe non linear association existing between climatic and catchment parameters appropriate interpretation structures okwuashi and ndehedehe 2020 2021 can provide meaningful results and quantify the roles of discrete parameters in groundwater related studies 7 conclusion in this study the performance of the dbn in changes in groundwater level forecasts at one to five month lead times was investigated using the southern african region as a tentative test bed as part of an overall assessment of key predictors of groundwater using machine learning this study further evaluated the impact of global climate indices and in situ groundwater withdrawal rates in regulating groundwater levels they were included as part of the predictors in our deep learning network our modeling procedure was assessed over 27 well locations in our study region it was observed that the dbn can adequately predict the change in groundwater levels up to 5 month lead time at most of the selected stations our developed dbn model used the maximum probability in its adoption of a multiple sequential stacking of rbms in using the dbn to construct a prediction model for groundwater level fluctuations we employed the i layer to layer training procedure which enabled an unsupervised training of each rbm to learn all the top down approach and most important generative weights in the network so that the hidden layer inferred from the data vector can serve as that of the higher layer succeeding layer and ii the fine tuning training procedure which applied the error back propagation technique to fine tune the dbn parameters after the unsupervised training procedure to enhance the prediction accuracy of groundwater level we integrate the dual learning procedure of the dbn network in our experiment we assumed no target parameter after the unsupervised training process and for the supervised training process we conserved the learning parameters for each round of rbm training while using the outputs of the hidden layers were used as inputs for the next round of rbm training this led to five distinct cases of our training model having architectural dynamics of a 9 6 6 1 b 10 6 6 1 c 11 6 6 1 d 12 6 6 1 e 13 6 6 1 for each respective case the strength of our model lies in this sequential training phase which occurred till all the rbms were finally trained this pseudo back propagation procedure exhibited by the dbn for modeling non linear systems also achieves optimum solution of the initial weights of the network thus leading to refined outputs and forecasts following the enhancement of the model structure and subsequent supervised learning label data by supervised fine tuning the key outcomes from our study are summarized as follows i the inclusion of grace derived tws as an additional variable further improved the performance of the dbn in the modeling process however the performance of the dbn model decreased as the lead time increased from the subsequent one month to three months due to the network s re injection procedure which allows the prior cgwl parameter to become an input for the next estimate the fourth and fifth lead time recorded significant accuracy after our training procedure the dbn performance is highly susceptible to local climate variables and global climate indices such as enso and nao they drive land use and climate change resulting in high dynamics in groundwater level operations the modeling framework developed in this study can be beneficial to stakeholders to predict the local groundwater resources ahead of time so that adequate management strategies can be developed to mitigate risk during drought events ii the impact of global climate indices in regulating changes in groundwater fluctuation is often undermined given that it has no direct relationship and impact on groundwater level fluctuations however our study emphasized on their influence in driving groundwater levels by their role in land use change which affects the withdrawal rate in any respective region as well as the role it plays in modulating hydrological fluxes such as precipitation patterns and temperature that can also contribute to aquifer take out and refill for example past studies have reported the impacts of enso events in causing a reduction in rainfall rates that result in a longer dry season with greater water evaporation and a shorter rainy season with greater surface runoff given that these teleconnection patterns which served as inputs in our deep learning training process bears close proximity to the southern african region their application in our study is justified iii the role of data assimilation contributed significantly to enhancing the strength of our model as it was very instrumental in filling the numerous data gaps of in situ well information of our study region stations with very low in situ to model ratios had higher percentage error rates than stations with average and high in situ to model ratios therefore we observe that the enkf improved our forecast procedure as well as increased the physical understanding of our considered system estimate deep learning offers comprehensive and systematic techniques in evaluating the modalities of non linear systems such as our groundwater resource and could be a very vital tool in the assessment of other hydrological processes that can lead to extreme climate cases our use of the dbn in this study provides insight into the strength of deep learning methods in making informed decisions to mitigate the

severe soil erosion due to frequent flooding in the area abdella and mekuanent 2021 similarly bilate river overflowed at the end of july 2006 and affected 5370 humbo wereda residents orke and li 2021 hence it is critical to have a reliable quantile estimates to enhance flood management works in the area a quantile of return period t can be reliably estimated from data record length of n only if t n hosking and wallis 1997 however in developing countries like ethiopia catchments are either ungauged or the gauged ones rarely satisfies t n to overcome this challenge regional flood frequency analysis rffa is recommended rao and srinivas 2006 2008 rffa is a method that is adopted to estimate magnitude and frequency of floods at target locations in river basins that do not have adequate site specific peak flow data basu and srinivas 2014 it involves formation of a region for the target site using regionalization approaches and subsequently pooling peak flow information from the region to arrive at desired flood quantile estimates for the target location burn and goel 2000 basu and srinivas 2014 a group of watersheds that are comparable interms of flood generating mechanism establishes a homogeneous region and the process to identify hydrologically homogeneous region is known as regionalization rao and srinivas 2008 a number of regionalization methods are used for identifying regions each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages among the existing approaches are method of residuals thomas and benson 1975 canonical correlation analysis cavadias 1990 ouarda et al 2001 region of influence approach roi and its extension burn 1990a 1990b hierarchical approach and its extension to roi gabriele and nigel 1991 zolt and burn 1996 and cluster analysis mosley 1981 tasker 1982 rao and srinivas 2008 a detailed comparisons of some of the methods has been shown in the reviewed literatures cunnane 1988 bob and rasmussen 1995 rao and srinivas 2006 haddad et al 2011 2015 in rffa watersheds are often delineated using variety of variables depicting hydrology e g topography climatology landuse land cover and soil and cluster analysis gained recognition for its effectiveness in interpreting patterns in multivariate dataset rao and srinivas 2008 basu and srinivas 2014 adequate data availability is an issue in the rvlb and to a large extent ethiopia most studies have paid little attention to the use of regional flow information for flood frequency analysis in the region only a few studies on the rffa of ethiopian basins have been conducted gebeyehu 1989 studied flood frequency analysis ffa for the whole country ethiopia and delineated regions on the basis of geographical similarity the limitation of this method is that regions generated using this technique will not necessarily be homogeneous in terms of flood generating mechanism because of high spatial variability in the physiographic or hydrological characteristics of the catchments in this type of region burn and goel 2000 moreover it is not also practical in ethiopia due to large topographical variability in the country furthermore correlation between stations in such regions will be high which may result in regionalization subjectivity wiltshire 1985 sine and moges 2013 regionalized watersheds in the blue nile river basin using statistical parameters e g l moment statistics and delineated five homogeneous regions mengistu et al 2022 have also conducted rffa for the genale dawa river basin and delineated three homogeneous regions using index flood and l moment approach however using flood statistics both to form regions and subsequently to evaluate homogeneity of the catchments can result in homogeneous regions but not necessarily effective for rffa because of the two main reasons listed below first regional estimates of l moment statistics will not be much different from at site sample l moment statistics second there is a tendency to group together all sites that have high outliers moreover it is recommended that the regionalization using variety of catchment characteristics that affects flood characteristics and homogeneity of final regions be tested by flood statistics hosking and wallis 1997 this paper addresses the identification of hydrologically homogeneous regions and subsequently assesses flood frequency analysis for rvlb in ethiopia therefore the study comprises two main parts the first part describes regionalization of watersheds in the rvlb using cluster analysis depending on variety of watershed characteristics affecting hydrologic response of the area the homogeneity of the identified regions was checked using coefficient of variation cv and l coefficient of variation lcv based homogeneity statistics wiltshire 1986 hosking and wallis 1993 the second part assess flood frequency analysis ffa of the delineated regions using regional flow data the developed regional frequency curve will be useful to estimate flood quantile for the data scarce catchments in the rvlb which will help for water resources developments in the area 2 description of the study area the rvlb is part of the great east african rift system geographically located between 36o46 to 39o41 e and 4o37 to 8o42 n the basin as shown in fig 1 has an area of approximately 52 739 km2 the basin has a wider elevation gradient ranging from 343 m in the valley floor to around 4200 m above mean sea level in the eastern and western part the catchments within the basin are well characterized in a range from gentle slope to very steep slopes thus 30 79 of the area is classified as gentle slope 17 89 18 09 and 14 72 of the catchment area are classified as slopping moderate steep and very steep slope respectively the rainfall distribution in the study area is bimodal with the short rainy season lasting from march to may and the long rainy season lasting from june to september with annual rainfall ranging from 786 mm to 1223 mm rvlb contains 28 river flow stations out of this two stations with record length less than ten years were not used for the analysis following the suggestion by england et al 2019 ams in three stations were found dependent and removed from the analysis based on independence and stationarity check table 2 similarly five stations were found discordant from their respective regions based on discordance measure and removed from further analysis fig 3 accordingly ams from daily streamflow records of 18 stations ranging from 1993 to 2016 was used for the analysis 3 methods 3 1 independence and stationarity tests according to rao and hamed 2000 suggestion in statistical flood frequency analysis data series are expected to be independent and stationary no stationarity in flood record mainly occur due to natural disaster e g forest fires anthropogenic actions land use changes primarily because of urbanization and deforestation and effect of climate change cunderlik and burn 2003 abdul aziz and burn 2006 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 haktanir and citakoglu 2014 mostofi zadeh et al 2020 in using annual maximum am approach all peaks are generally considered independent mangini et al 2018 an important test for analysis of randomness of am series was performed by using wald wolfowitz w w test wald and wolfowitz 1943 rao and hamed 2000 given a sample of size n for data x 1 x 2 x n the statistic r is computed using eq 1 1 r i 1 n 1 x i x i 1 x 1 r follows a normal distribution with mean and variance when the elements in sample are independent as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 r s 1 2 s 2 n 1 3 var r s 2 2 s 4 n 1 r 2 s 1 4 4 s 1 s 3 s 2 2 2 s 4 n 1 n 2 where s r n m r and m r is the rth moment of the sample about the origin the statistic u r r var r 1 2 is approximately normally distributed with mean zero and variance unity and is used to test the hypothesis of independence at significance level by comparing the statistic u with the standard normal variate u α 2 corresponding to a probability of exceedence α 2 rao and hamed 2000 3 2 identification of homogeneous regions in the past catchments were regionalized using geographically contagious regions based on geographical or administrative boundaries but this practice does not guarantee hydrological similarity furthermore at site flood statistics have been used to regionalize catchments and subsequently used to test regional homogeneity which is impractical this study focusses on using variety of watershed attributes that affects hydrological response of the basin rao and srinivas 2008 therefore in this study attributes used for regionalization of catchments in the rvlb are physiographic characteristics such as drainage area length of longest stream in the sub basins percentage of area covered by water shape indicator of catchments such as gravelius index drainage characteristics of the catchments such as stream density meteorological characteristics such as mean annual rainfall geographical location of attributes such as latitude longitude minimum elevation maximum elevation mean elevation at the streamflow gauging stations soil cover characteristics such as percentages of the catchment area covered by fine and medium coarse medium and coarse and medium interms of particle size landuse pattern such as percentages of catchment area covered by moderately cultivated intensively cultivated grassland riparian vegetation shurbland exposed surface forest urban area alpine vegetation woodland and marshland as shown in table 1 cluster analysis is used to group watersheds in to cluster or region using watershed related attributes isik et al 2008 regionalization attributes within the cluster must be as similar as possible while those between clusters must be as dissimilar as possible rao and srinivas 2008 basu and srinivas 2016 initialization and local minima have no effect on hierarchical clustering processes but initial guesses have an effect on k mean clustering processes like number of clusters in the sense that attributes can transfer from one cluster to another to reduce the objective function the k mean clustering procedures are dynamic the attributes committed to a cluster in the initial stages of a hierarchical clustering procedure cannot be transferred to another so in this study catchments are first grouped using the hierarchical method and then clustered using the k means method based on the number of clusters from the agglomeration schedule there are several hierarchical clustering techniques such as single linkage total linkage centroid ward s minimum variance and the average distance method wards method was identified by many researchers as the algorithm that outperforms other approaches in separating relatively dense clusters with low within group variance unal et al 2003 murtagh 2014 the criteria for linking clusters is based on the assumption that ward s criterion is minimally increased at each point of clustering ward s approach tends to remove small clusters and generate clusters of about the same size murtagh 2014 4 w k 1 p i 1 n j 1 m x kij x kj 2 5 x kj 1 n i 1 n x kij where w is the sum of squares of the total within cluster error p denotes the number of clusters n denotes the number of gauging stations in each cluster m denotes the number of variables months in elements x kij j th variable at the i th element in the k th cluster and x kj average value of the i th elements at the j th variable in the k th cluster squared euclidean distance is used as a resemblance degree for clustering 6 d ij k 1 n x ik x jk 2 k means clustering allows the transfer of attributes from one cluster to another which is not possible with hierarchical methods ralamboundrainy 1995 7 j j 1 n i 1 n x i j c j 2 where x i j c j 2 is the selected distance measure between a data point x i j and the cluster center c j the basic algorithm follows the following steps for the specified number of clusters k a split the data into initial k clusters b the means or centroids of the k clusters are computed c calculate the distance of each centroid for each case and allocate it to the closest centroid d repeat steps 2 and 3 until no catchments are reallocated 3 2 1 homogeneity tests the discordance estimator is used to detect sites that are significantly out of sync with the rest of the group discordance measurement d based on statistical characteristics calculates how far a proposed site is from the region s center rao hamed 2000 to declare site i to be discordant d i of that specific site has to pass certain critical value that depends on the number of sites in the region suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 8 d i 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where d i is the discordancy amount for catchment i n is the number of catchments in the region u i is a vector containing the l cv l skewness and l kurtosis for a catchment i u is the regional mean for u i and a is expressed as 9 a j 1 n u j u u j u t furthermore homogeneity of identified regions have been checked by using dispersion measures on the basis of cv and lcv lettenmaier and potter 1985 have examined the values of average cv and site to site cv cc of both conventional moment and l moment for the target region as the value of cc and cv the get higher homogeneity of the region will be reduced accordingly the value of cc should not be more than 0 3 the detailed procedures for calculating the cc of both conventional and l moments are provided by lettenmaier and potter 1985 cunnane 1989 3 3 choice of distribution model and parameter estimation methods only the peak flow in a record year is considered in the am flow series all peaks above a certain fixed value are used for analysis in partial duration pd models according to henrik et al 1997 the flood quantile estimated by the am method as q t and that acquired from the pd as q t are usually unequal and from a statistical standpoint the method with the smallest sampling variance has an advantage cunnane 1989 investigated the relative values of var q t and var q t and discovered that var q t var q t provided that λ 1 65 where λ is the average number of peaks per years used in the pd series for λ 1 65 the reverse was true this demonstrates that when λ is small am method is statistically more efficient than pd method but when λ is large it is less efficient in many real scenarios the assumptions of the pd model may not be acceptable if λ is increased to a high level additionally the pd model may not be independent which can affect the assumption of independence of flood peaks for statistical analysis wmo 1989 henrik et al 1997 several distribution models have been proposed for flood modeling but none has gained universal acceptance for instance us water resources council uswrc 1967 recommended the log pearson type 3 lp3 distribution eventhougth arora and singh 1989 suggests the need for the revision natural environmental research council nerc 1975 suggested the generalized extreme value gev distribution for the united kingdom and ireland mcmahon and srikanthan 1981 used moment ratio diagrams on 172 series of annual maximum flood and found that log pearson type 3 lp3 satisfactorily covers the data point in the diagram cicioni et al 1973 tested 2 parameter log normal ln2 2 parameter gamma g2 pearson type 3 p3 and extreme value type 1 ev1 distributions on 108 series of flood data and concluded that ln2 as the best however rossi et al 1984 recommended two component extreme value distribution tcev spence 1973 compared four distributions normal ln2 ev1 and log ev1 on am series of 161 drainage basins in the canadian plains and suggested ln2 as a suitable distribution for the area l moment ratio diagram lmrd have been recommended as useful tool for identifying between candidate distributions to explain regional data hosking 1990 the curve can help to visually inspect the theoretical relationship between lcs and lcv of candidate distributions goodness of fit gof test statistics measures the quality of distribution to fit based on hypothetical values defined by significance level the distribution is considered to be chosen when the calculated values of gof statistics are lower than the hypothetical value i e level of significance in this study commonly used tests such as anderson darling ad and kolmogorov smirnov ks were used ad test statistics compares an observed and expected cumulative distribution function cdf the ad test gives more weight to the tail of the distribution model than ks kamal et al 2017 the ad test hypothesis is rejected if the test statistics is greater than the critical value i e 2 5018 at 95 level of confidence α 0 05 the test statistics a2 is described in the eq 10 the kolmogorov smirnov ks test relates the empirical cumulative frequency s n x with the cumulative distribution function of an assumed theoretical distribution f x x the highest variance among s n x and f x x is the k s test statistic frank 2012 similarly the ks test hypothesis is rejected if the test statistics is greater than the critical value i e 0 13253 at 95 level of confidence α 0 05 the test statistics d is described in the eq 11 10 a 2 i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x x i ln 1 f x x n 1 i n n 11 d max f x x s n x in this study 10 different statistical distribution models were considered method of moment mom probability weighted moment pwm and maximum likelihood ml are the most commonly used parameter estimation methods and used in this study also variability of flow quantiles based on different parameter estimation methods pem can be measured using standard error of estimates see cunnane 1989 see helps to compare and select the most efficient parameter estimation method the lowest see value for the fitted distribution detailed procedures to calculate see is provided by rao and hamed 2000 some statistical distributions such as ln 2 pwm do not have an analytical solution for calculating see and are thus excluded from the results shown in table 7 3 4 regional frequency curve and regression model the regional quantile estimates q t are calculated using eq 12 the regional mean values lcv lcs and lck were used to compute dimensionless regional frequency distribution for regional estimates rao and hamed 2000 for a given return period t the regional frequency factors q t and q t i respectively were computed and q t are calculated 12 q t μ i q t where q t is the quantile estimates obtained using regional distribution for the given return period and μ i is the at site mean flow regional regression was built as a multiple regression representing the relationship between mean annual flood dependent variable and catchment characteristic independent variables david 1993 13 q β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p 1 x p 1 where q is the mean flood x i is the catchment characteristics and β i is regression coefficients independent have been selected based on stepwise akaike information criterion aic and applied to the regression equations to predict mean annual flow maf in each region as shown in the eq 13 isik et al 2008 validation of regional regression model was assessed using pseudo ungauged catchments that were not used in the development of regression equation by computing the relative error between observed and estimated flows as shown in eq 14 14 re q p q o q o 1 100 where q p and q o are predicted and observed quantile flows respectively re is the computed relative error 4 results and discussion 4 1 independence and stationarity analysis wolfowitz 1942 haddad and moravej 1943 determined the critical test statistics μ for the am series to be independent and stationary at 95 level of confidence is 1 96 prior to analyzing flood frequency in the basin data series from those stations were checked for am randomness as shown in table 2 gato wosha and melka oda stations test statistics μ resulted 2 343 2 856 and 2 681 respectively as a result those three stations are removed from the analysis while the hypothesis of independence and stationarity is confirmed for the remaining stations 4 2 cluster analysis the main purpose of hierarchical clustering in this study was to get optimum number of cluster and to have initial cluster memberships of the catchments then using outputs from hierarchical method the k means approach have been computed to obtain possible homogeneous groups after several iterations using the proximity matrix squared euclidean distance was calculated between all pairs of attributes the screen plot of distances coefficients column against stage using agglomeration schedule was used to decide number of clusters fig 2 when there is a big change between the coefficients of two succeeding stages the trend in the screen plot altered and elbow occurs this indicates that the heterogeneity of the clusters being combined is growing and that it would be an ideal to stop the clustering process before the clusters become too different yim and ramdeen 2015 as shown in fig 2 there is a greater difference in the coefficients between stages 4 and 5 with a change of about 0 225 this is the first clear escalation from visual inspection of screen plot and agglomeration schedule therefore cluster has been chosen to stop at 4th stage suggesting four cluster is optimal to form hydrologically homogeneous regions in the rvlb the cluster membership is obtained after five iterations based on the proposed similarity measure using k means algorithm two catchments are grouped in cluster one six catchments in cluster two ten catchments in cluster three and ten in cluster four table 3 4 3 discordancy measure adjusting the regions and reginal homogeneity tests once a set of initial regions are identified using cluster analysis it is necessary to assess the regions hydrological similarity and made the required adjustments the tests applied in this study are discordance measure and dispersion analysis cv and lcv based homogeneity measure based on the preliminary definition sketch for discordancy ferfuro and gombora catchments are found to be discordant from region two as the average regional l moments of this region is far from the average value chiufa and rinzaf catchments are also stations that are discordant from region three for the region four gidabo near measso is found to be discordant fig 3 according to the options suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 to improve the physical coherence and homogeneity of the regions one or more sites that are grossly discordant within the region can be eliminated therefore stations from each region that are found grossly discordant based on sketch for discordancy fig 3 are eliminated and discordance measure was computed for the rest of stations found in each region fig 4 the discordance value of each station within a corresponding region is provided in table 4 region one consists only one gauged station thus cosidered as independent homogeneous region and at site frequency curve was developed independently using unique distribution model it fitted number of stations in region two is four and in this case d i value is 1 in very small region like region two the statistics d i is not very informative as it is difficult to whether a site is grossly unusual when there are a few other sites with which to compare it hosking and wallis 1997 so further homogeneity tests is required for region two region three which contains seven stations the critical value is d i 1 917 and no stations have passed this value for region four critical value is d i 1 648 as it contains six stations and again no station have passed the threshold value table 4 the cv and lcv values of am flows are computed understand the statistical behavior of the stations in order to form a hydrologically homogeneous region as shown in table 5 all regions satisfy the criteria of cc being less than 0 3 in both conventional moments and lcvs 4 4 selection of distribution models parameters and standard error estimation 4 4 1 selection of regional distribution model for any given region the preliminary candidate distribution were selected by visual assessment based on lmrd lcs vs lck using regional average moment ratios lcv lcs and lck analogous to τ τ3 and τ4 fig 5 accordingly for region one the only candidate distribution selected is gev to be checked by the proposed goodness of fit measures for the region two visually inspected candidate distributions are gamma and ln2 for region three ln2 gamma gev gp and wakeby are chosen as a candidate distribution for final selection finally the candidate regional distribution for region four are gp wakeby gamma gev and ln2 fig 5 the regional goodness of fit test gof was used in this study to determine the final best fit regional distribution model easyfit software available at http www mathwave com easyfit distribution fitting html computes three gof tests accordingly from the available tests on easyfit kolmogorov smrinov ks and anderson darling ad tests have been used for regional analysis and distributions with three or more parameters the chi squared test is not considered a high power test cunnane 1989 kamal et al 2017 therefore the chi squared test has not been used for gof test in this study the critical value at 95 confidence level i e α 0 05 for the distribution to be accepted to fit to certain data using ks and ad tests are 0 13253 and 2 5018 respectively accordingly gev has given rank number one and accepted by both ks and ad tests as the test statistics are lower than the critical value for the region two both gof tests have given rank number one to ln2 and the test statistics is accepted by both ks and ad for the distribution to fit to this region again for the case of region three wakeby distribution is selected based on the given rank and the test statistics by both method finally for region four gp is selected as the best fit regional distribution based on the rank given and the test statistics of being lower than the critical value at 95 confidence level table 6 4 4 2 parameter and standard error estimation table 7 shows the summary of parameter estimates by those three methods mom pwm and ml using dimensionless regional flood data for gev ln2 and gp distributions parameters have been computed using all methods proposed on this study and ready to be compared based on see for wakeby distribution mom is not feasible and pwm has certain assumptions like all parameters should be positive but in this study when pwm is applied it violates this assumptions rao and hamed 2000 so ml method becomes the only choice here table 8 shows see of parameters corresponding to a given return period for gev of region one mom is the one with the lowest standard error so gev with mom parameter estimation method is selected to drive frequency curve for this region for region two of ln2 see is calculated analytically using mom and ml method only because there is no analytical method to calculate for ln2 pwm so ml is selected as it has lowest see compared to mom to drive regional frequency curve for region two for the region three of wakeby distribution there is no mathematical expression to calculate see estimates eventhougth there is numerical approximation to calculate see for this method as the main objective of calculating see here is to compare among the proposed methods see has not been approximated for wakeby distribution therefore ml were chosen by default for regional frequency curve derivation for region three for region four of gp distribution ml has lowest see compared to mom and pwm at the given return period so gp with ml is chosen to drive frequency curve for region four the standard error of estimates is typically expressed as a unit of flow data fitted to a distribution model in this case as a unit of standardized non dimensionless flows 4 5 derivation of regional frequency curve for the homogeneous regions of rvlb the dimensionless regional quantile estimates q t of each region in the rvlb at the given return period t is described in the following table table 9 is used to calculate flood quantile at any site in a particular region by simply multiplying the dimensionless regional quantile by the mean flood at that site for the required return period alternatively regional frequency curve is developed as shown in fig 6 using regional flood quantile estimates at the corresponding return period these curves are helpful for any water resource development in the homogeneous regions of rvlb that have no adequate site specific data for ffa 4 6 mean flood estimation for ungauged catchments in the regions regression equations are developed to predict maf for ungauged areas in the homogeneous regions of rvlb the ungauged catchments clustered in deferent regions depending on various catchment characteristics using k mean method are segen in region one guder in region two woji in region three shafe baso and bisare in region four respectively table 3 regression equations are derived using the relationship between dependent variable maf and independent variables catchment characteristics of the gauged catchments within the specific region accordingly maf of ungauged catchments within each specific region can be estimated using easily available catchment characteristics depending on specific equation derived aic was used select potential catchment characteristics for predicting maf yamashita et al 2007 among the sequence of models generated using stepwise aic forward regression the one with the lowest aic has been chosen for each region region 2 3 and 4 as shown in table 10 region one consists only one gauged catchment and performing regression analysis for single catchment is not possible therefore in this study regression analysis for region one has not been computed as described in table 10 for region two percentage of intensively cultivated is the only independent variable chosen through stepwise aic forward regression lowest aic 31 239 to predict maf in this region similarly for region three percentage of grassland and maximum elevation are the ones selected to predict maf because of their lowest aic value of 75 411and 60 583 respectively from this region finally for region four three independent variables stream density percentage of medium and length of the longest stream are selected to predict maf lowest aic 51 164 48 272 and 34 434 respectively table 11 presents the developed regression equation used for maf estimation in the ungauged areas in the homogenous region of rvlb to validate the performance of regional regression equation certain gauged catchments were considered ungauged and were not used for the development of regression equation the pseudo ungauged catchments selected are kola from region two ketar fete from region three and hamassa wajifo from region four table 12 as shown in table 11 for region two developed regression equation is statistically insignificant p 0 19 at α 0 05 moreover relative error between observed and estimated maf is 0 511 using kola as pseudo ungauged catchment table 12 thus the developed regression equation is weak in predicting maf in this region and further study is recommended in region three the equation performs well r2 0 899 and statistically significant p 0 02 at α 0 05 additionally the relative error between observed and estimated maf is 0 039 using ketar fete as pseudo ungauged catchment thus the equation derived for region three can be used for maf estimation of woji catchment table 11 similarly for region four the equation performs well r2 0 994 and statistically significant at α 0 05 i e p 0 04 the relative error between observed and estimated maf using hamassa wajifo as pseudo ungauged catchment is also 0 166 so the equation derived for region four can be used for maf estimation of shafe baso and bisare catchments respectively table 11 in general once maf of such ungauged areas is estimated quantile estimates at the required return period can be calculated using the derived regional frequency curves for specific region table 9 5 conclusion in this study catchments in the rvlb were regionalized using catchment characteristics and hydrological homogeneity of the delineated regions were tested by using flood statistics accordingly using k mean method four regions were identified and certain adjustments were made to the stations clustered in the regions to improve hydrological homogeneity of the proposed regions after the adjustments made all regions have satisfied the proposed homogeneity criteria discordance measure cv and lcv based homogeneity tests following regionalization of catchments ffa for the hydrologically homogeneous regions in the rvlb were conducted the candidate regional distribution have been visually selected using l moment diagram and final selection was done based on goodness of fit tests kolmogorov smrinov ks and anderson darling ad accordingly generalized extreme value gev lognormal ln2 wakeby and generalized pareto gp distributions respectively for region one up to four are the selected regional distribution for ffa in the respective regions using standard error estimates efficient parameter estimations method was compared and the one with the lowest see was selected accordingly mom was chosen for region one and ml was found to be efficient for the rest of the regions regional frequency curve was developed using regional flood quantile estimates at the corresponding return period for each homogeneous region in the rvlb the frequency curve developed for region four is stepper than the others this region receives more rainfall and very high elevation difference within the reach can be considered as one of the causes of destructive flood in the area moreover this region is characterized by severe land degradation that is resulting in soil erosion and thus flooding that is affecting communities living at the river banks and around chamo and abaya lakes the frequency curves for the other regions region one two and three are rather gentler compared to region four even if these curves seems gentler compared to region four there is a major flood problem in such regions flooding in these regions can be caused due to adjustments of floodplains due to rapid expansion of agricultural and urban landuse and natural floodplains e g shurbland grassland in addition to this change and variability of rainfall and streamflow can be the reason for the occurrence of hydrological extremes in such regions regression equation was also developed for ffa in the ungauged areas of homogeneous regions of rvlb using easily available data catchment characteristics to validate the performance of regression model certain stations were not used in the development of regression equation and considered pseudo ungauged catchments the relative error between observed and estimated were computed for all regions except region one which contains only one gauged catchment accordingly for region two regression equation performed weak to predict mean annual flow for the pseudo ungauged catchment kola in the region but for regions three and four the equations performed very well in predicting the mean annual flow for the pseudo ungauged catchments ketar fete and hamassa wajifo hence to improve the performance of regionalization and ffa in the basin regionalization of catchments could assess soft clustering rather than only focusing on hard clustering because in reality most catchments bear partial similarity to several clusters and one cannot fully justify assigning a catchment to one cluster or another in addition to this the impact of climate change on flood response of the catchments area required to improve reliability of ffa in the basin in conclusion the result of this study provides vital information to enhance flood management work in the rvlb where flood is a problem and data availability is a challenge to quantify the upcoming floods reliably declaration of competing interest we

7869,study region rift valley lakes basin ethiopia study focus we performed regionalization of catchments using k means method based on variety of catchment characteristics and tested hydrological homogeneity of the regions using flood statistics following that flood frequency analysis ffa for the identified regions was computed using regional flow data new hydrological insights for the region four hydrologically homogeneous regions were identified generalized extreme value gev lognormal ln2 wakeby and generalized pareto gp were the best fitted distribution models for regions one up to four respectively maximum likelihood was chosen as the most efficient parameter estimation method for regions two three and four whereas the method of moment was chosen for region one region one contained one gauged catchment therefore regression equation was not developed for this region the linear regression between mean annual flood maf and catchment characteristics performed well r2 0 827 0 899 and 0 994 for regions two three and four respectively the relative errors between observed and estimated maf in the pseudo ungauged catchments resulted 0 511 0 039 and 0 166 for regions two three and four respectively hence the developed regional frequency curves and regression equations can be used for flood estimation at the required return period t in the homogeneous regions of the basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords rift valley lakes basin regionalization flood frequency analysis regression equation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flood is a natural occurrence that can cause a significant harm to the people environment property and infrastructure in ethiopia flood is a major social and environmental challenge the catastrophic floods that struck the country in 1988 1996 2006 and 2020 resulted in the loss of lives and massive destruction of property and infrastructure tefere 2015 ocha 2020 when it comes to the rift valley lake basin rvlb the problem is very common for example flood events that happened in the weito and hare catchments from 11 to 18 april 2020 resulted in the displacement of 3048 peoples destruction of 34 houses and the damage of 234 ha of farmland ocha 2020 more than 50 persons were injured by floods in the kulfo catchment between october and november 2015 mekon et al 2016 moreover this catchment is characterized by severe soil erosion due to frequent flooding in the area abdella and mekuanent 2021 similarly bilate river overflowed at the end of july 2006 and affected 5370 humbo wereda residents orke and li 2021 hence it is critical to have a reliable quantile estimates to enhance flood management works in the area a quantile of return period t can be reliably estimated from data record length of n only if t n hosking and wallis 1997 however in developing countries like ethiopia catchments are either ungauged or the gauged ones rarely satisfies t n to overcome this challenge regional flood frequency analysis rffa is recommended rao and srinivas 2006 2008 rffa is a method that is adopted to estimate magnitude and frequency of floods at target locations in river basins that do not have adequate site specific peak flow data basu and srinivas 2014 it involves formation of a region for the target site using regionalization approaches and subsequently pooling peak flow information from the region to arrive at desired flood quantile estimates for the target location burn and goel 2000 basu and srinivas 2014 a group of watersheds that are comparable interms of flood generating mechanism establishes a homogeneous region and the process to identify hydrologically homogeneous region is known as regionalization rao and srinivas 2008 a number of regionalization methods are used for identifying regions each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages among the existing approaches are method of residuals thomas and benson 1975 canonical correlation analysis cavadias 1990 ouarda et al 2001 region of influence approach roi and its extension burn 1990a 1990b hierarchical approach and its extension to roi gabriele and nigel 1991 zolt and burn 1996 and cluster analysis mosley 1981 tasker 1982 rao and srinivas 2008 a detailed comparisons of some of the methods has been shown in the reviewed literatures cunnane 1988 bob and rasmussen 1995 rao and srinivas 2006 haddad et al 2011 2015 in rffa watersheds are often delineated using variety of variables depicting hydrology e g topography climatology landuse land cover and soil and cluster analysis gained recognition for its effectiveness in interpreting patterns in multivariate dataset rao and srinivas 2008 basu and srinivas 2014 adequate data availability is an issue in the rvlb and to a large extent ethiopia most studies have paid little attention to the use of regional flow information for flood frequency analysis in the region only a few studies on the rffa of ethiopian basins have been conducted gebeyehu 1989 studied flood frequency analysis ffa for the whole country ethiopia and delineated regions on the basis of geographical similarity the limitation of this method is that regions generated using this technique will not necessarily be homogeneous in terms of flood generating mechanism because of high spatial variability in the physiographic or hydrological characteristics of the catchments in this type of region burn and goel 2000 moreover it is not also practical in ethiopia due to large topographical variability in the country furthermore correlation between stations in such regions will be high which may result in regionalization subjectivity wiltshire 1985 sine and moges 2013 regionalized watersheds in the blue nile river basin using statistical parameters e g l moment statistics and delineated five homogeneous regions mengistu et al 2022 have also conducted rffa for the genale dawa river basin and delineated three homogeneous regions using index flood and l moment approach however using flood statistics both to form regions and subsequently to evaluate homogeneity of the catchments can result in homogeneous regions but not necessarily effective for rffa because of the two main reasons listed below first regional estimates of l moment statistics will not be much different from at site sample l moment statistics second there is a tendency to group together all sites that have high outliers moreover it is recommended that the regionalization using variety of catchment characteristics that affects flood characteristics and homogeneity of final regions be tested by flood statistics hosking and wallis 1997 this paper addresses the identification of hydrologically homogeneous regions and subsequently assesses flood frequency analysis for rvlb in ethiopia therefore the study comprises two main parts the first part describes regionalization of watersheds in the rvlb using cluster analysis depending on variety of watershed characteristics affecting hydrologic response of the area the homogeneity of the identified regions was checked using coefficient of variation cv and l coefficient of variation lcv based homogeneity statistics wiltshire 1986 hosking and wallis 1993 the second part assess flood frequency analysis ffa of the delineated regions using regional flow data the developed regional frequency curve will be useful to estimate flood quantile for the data scarce catchments in the rvlb which will help for water resources developments in the area 2 description of the study area the rvlb is part of the great east african rift system geographically located between 36o46 to 39o41 e and 4o37 to 8o42 n the basin as shown in fig 1 has an area of approximately 52 739 km2 the basin has a wider elevation gradient ranging from 343 m in the valley floor to around 4200 m above mean sea level in the eastern and western part the catchments within the basin are well characterized in a range from gentle slope to very steep slopes thus 30 79 of the area is classified as gentle slope 17 89 18 09 and 14 72 of the catchment area are classified as slopping moderate steep and very steep slope respectively the rainfall distribution in the study area is bimodal with the short rainy season lasting from march to may and the long rainy season lasting from june to september with annual rainfall ranging from 786 mm to 1223 mm rvlb contains 28 river flow stations out of this two stations with record length less than ten years were not used for the analysis following the suggestion by england et al 2019 ams in three stations were found dependent and removed from the analysis based on independence and stationarity check table 2 similarly five stations were found discordant from their respective regions based on discordance measure and removed from further analysis fig 3 accordingly ams from daily streamflow records of 18 stations ranging from 1993 to 2016 was used for the analysis 3 methods 3 1 independence and stationarity tests according to rao and hamed 2000 suggestion in statistical flood frequency analysis data series are expected to be independent and stationary no stationarity in flood record mainly occur due to natural disaster e g forest fires anthropogenic actions land use changes primarily because of urbanization and deforestation and effect of climate change cunderlik and burn 2003 abdul aziz and burn 2006 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 haktanir and citakoglu 2014 mostofi zadeh et al 2020 in using annual maximum am approach all peaks are generally considered independent mangini et al 2018 an important test for analysis of randomness of am series was performed by using wald wolfowitz w w test wald and wolfowitz 1943 rao and hamed 2000 given a sample of size n for data x 1 x 2 x n the statistic r is computed using eq 1 1 r i 1 n 1 x i x i 1 x 1 r follows a normal distribution with mean and variance when the elements in sample are independent as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 r s 1 2 s 2 n 1 3 var r s 2 2 s 4 n 1 r 2 s 1 4 4 s 1 s 3 s 2 2 2 s 4 n 1 n 2 where s r n m r and m r is the rth moment of the sample about the origin the statistic u r r var r 1 2 is approximately normally distributed with mean zero and variance unity and is used to test the hypothesis of independence at significance level by comparing the statistic u with the standard normal variate u α 2 corresponding to a probability of exceedence α 2 rao and hamed 2000 3 2 identification of homogeneous regions in the past catchments were regionalized using geographically contagious regions based on geographical or administrative boundaries but this practice does not guarantee hydrological similarity furthermore at site flood statistics have been used to regionalize catchments and subsequently used to test regional homogeneity which is impractical this study focusses on using variety of watershed attributes that affects hydrological response of the basin rao and srinivas 2008 therefore in this study attributes used for regionalization of catchments in the rvlb are physiographic characteristics such as drainage area length of longest stream in the sub basins percentage of area covered by water shape indicator of catchments such as gravelius index drainage characteristics of the catchments such as stream density meteorological characteristics such as mean annual rainfall geographical location of attributes such as latitude longitude minimum elevation maximum elevation mean elevation at the streamflow gauging stations soil cover characteristics such as percentages of the catchment area covered by fine and medium coarse medium and coarse and medium interms of particle size landuse pattern such as percentages of catchment area covered by moderately cultivated intensively cultivated grassland riparian vegetation shurbland exposed surface forest urban area alpine vegetation woodland and marshland as shown in table 1 cluster analysis is used to group watersheds in to cluster or region using watershed related attributes isik et al 2008 regionalization attributes within the cluster must be as similar as possible while those between clusters must be as dissimilar as possible rao and srinivas 2008 basu and srinivas 2016 initialization and local minima have no effect on hierarchical clustering processes but initial guesses have an effect on k mean clustering processes like number of clusters in the sense that attributes can transfer from one cluster to another to reduce the objective function the k mean clustering procedures are dynamic the attributes committed to a cluster in the initial stages of a hierarchical clustering procedure cannot be transferred to another so in this study catchments are first grouped using the hierarchical method and then clustered using the k means method based on the number of clusters from the agglomeration schedule there are several hierarchical clustering techniques such as single linkage total linkage centroid ward s minimum variance and the average distance method wards method was identified by many researchers as the algorithm that outperforms other approaches in separating relatively dense clusters with low within group variance unal et al 2003 murtagh 2014 the criteria for linking clusters is based on the assumption that ward s criterion is minimally increased at each point of clustering ward s approach tends to remove small clusters and generate clusters of about the same size murtagh 2014 4 w k 1 p i 1 n j 1 m x kij x kj 2 5 x kj 1 n i 1 n x kij where w is the sum of squares of the total within cluster error p denotes the number of clusters n denotes the number of gauging stations in each cluster m denotes the number of variables months in elements x kij j th variable at the i th element in the k th cluster and x kj average value of the i th elements at the j th variable in the k th cluster squared euclidean distance is used as a resemblance degree for clustering 6 d ij k 1 n x ik x jk 2 k means clustering allows the transfer of attributes from one cluster to another which is not possible with hierarchical methods ralamboundrainy 1995 7 j j 1 n i 1 n x i j c j 2 where x i j c j 2 is the selected distance measure between a data point x i j and the cluster center c j the basic algorithm follows the following steps for the specified number of clusters k a split the data into initial k clusters b the means or centroids of the k clusters are computed c calculate the distance of each centroid for each case and allocate it to the closest centroid d repeat steps 2 and 3 until no catchments are reallocated 3 2 1 homogeneity tests the discordance estimator is used to detect sites that are significantly out of sync with the rest of the group discordance measurement d based on statistical characteristics calculates how far a proposed site is from the region s center rao hamed 2000 to declare site i to be discordant d i of that specific site has to pass certain critical value that depends on the number of sites in the region suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 8 d i 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where d i is the discordancy amount for catchment i n is the number of catchments in the region u i is a vector containing the l cv l skewness and l kurtosis for a catchment i u is the regional mean for u i and a is expressed as 9 a j 1 n u j u u j u t furthermore homogeneity of identified regions have been checked by using dispersion measures on the basis of cv and lcv lettenmaier and potter 1985 have examined the values of average cv and site to site cv cc of both conventional moment and l moment for the target region as the value of cc and cv the get higher homogeneity of the region will be reduced accordingly the value of cc should not be more than 0 3 the detailed procedures for calculating the cc of both conventional and l moments are provided by lettenmaier and potter 1985 cunnane 1989 3 3 choice of distribution model and parameter estimation methods only the peak flow in a record year is considered in the am flow series all peaks above a certain fixed value are used for analysis in partial duration pd models according to henrik et al 1997 the flood quantile estimated by the am method as q t and that acquired from the pd as q t are usually unequal and from a statistical standpoint the method with the smallest sampling variance has an advantage cunnane 1989 investigated the relative values of var q t and var q t and discovered that var q t var q t provided that λ 1 65 where λ is the average number of peaks per years used in the pd series for λ 1 65 the reverse was true this demonstrates that when λ is small am method is statistically more efficient than pd method but when λ is large it is less efficient in many real scenarios the assumptions of the pd model may not be acceptable if λ is increased to a high level additionally the pd model may not be independent which can affect the assumption of independence of flood peaks for statistical analysis wmo 1989 henrik et al 1997 several distribution models have been proposed for flood modeling but none has gained universal acceptance for instance us water resources council uswrc 1967 recommended the log pearson type 3 lp3 distribution eventhougth arora and singh 1989 suggests the need for the revision natural environmental research council nerc 1975 suggested the generalized extreme value gev distribution for the united kingdom and ireland mcmahon and srikanthan 1981 used moment ratio diagrams on 172 series of annual maximum flood and found that log pearson type 3 lp3 satisfactorily covers the data point in the diagram cicioni et al 1973 tested 2 parameter log normal ln2 2 parameter gamma g2 pearson type 3 p3 and extreme value type 1 ev1 distributions on 108 series of flood data and concluded that ln2 as the best however rossi et al 1984 recommended two component extreme value distribution tcev spence 1973 compared four distributions normal ln2 ev1 and log ev1 on am series of 161 drainage basins in the canadian plains and suggested ln2 as a suitable distribution for the area l moment ratio diagram lmrd have been recommended as useful tool for identifying between candidate distributions to explain regional data hosking 1990 the curve can help to visually inspect the theoretical relationship between lcs and lcv of candidate distributions goodness of fit gof test statistics measures the quality of distribution to fit based on hypothetical values defined by significance level the distribution is considered to be chosen when the calculated values of gof statistics are lower than the hypothetical value i e level of significance in this study commonly used tests such as anderson darling ad and kolmogorov smirnov ks were used ad test statistics compares an observed and expected cumulative distribution function cdf the ad test gives more weight to the tail of the distribution model than ks kamal et al 2017 the ad test hypothesis is rejected if the test statistics is greater than the critical value i e 2 5018 at 95 level of confidence α 0 05 the test statistics a2 is described in the eq 10 the kolmogorov smirnov ks test relates the empirical cumulative frequency s n x with the cumulative distribution function of an assumed theoretical distribution f x x the highest variance among s n x and f x x is the k s test statistic frank 2012 similarly the ks test hypothesis is rejected if the test statistics is greater than the critical value i e 0 13253 at 95 level of confidence α 0 05 the test statistics d is described in the eq 11 10 a 2 i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x x i ln 1 f x x n 1 i n n 11 d max f x x s n x in this study 10 different statistical distribution models were considered method of moment mom probability weighted moment pwm and maximum likelihood ml are the most commonly used parameter estimation methods and used in this study also variability of flow quantiles based on different parameter estimation methods pem can be measured using standard error of estimates see cunnane 1989 see helps to compare and select the most efficient parameter estimation method the lowest see value for the fitted distribution detailed procedures to calculate see is provided by rao and hamed 2000 some statistical distributions such as ln 2 pwm do not have an analytical solution for calculating see and are thus excluded from the results shown in table 7 3 4 regional frequency curve and regression model the regional quantile estimates q t are calculated using eq 12 the regional mean values lcv lcs and lck were used to compute dimensionless regional frequency distribution for regional estimates rao and hamed 2000 for a given return period t the regional frequency factors q t and q t i respectively were computed and q t are calculated 12 q t μ i q t where q t is the quantile estimates obtained using regional distribution for the given return period and μ i is the at site mean flow regional regression was built as a multiple regression representing the relationship between mean annual flood dependent variable and catchment characteristic independent variables david 1993 13 q β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p 1 x p 1 where q is the mean flood x i is the catchment characteristics and β i is regression coefficients independent have been selected based on stepwise akaike information criterion aic and applied to the regression equations to predict mean annual flow maf in each region as shown in the eq 13 isik et al 2008 validation of regional regression model was assessed using pseudo ungauged catchments that were not used in the development of regression equation by computing the relative error between observed and estimated flows as shown in eq 14 14 re q p q o q o 1 100 where q p and q o are predicted and observed quantile flows respectively re is the computed relative error 4 results and discussion 4 1 independence and stationarity analysis wolfowitz 1942 haddad and moravej 1943 determined the critical test statistics μ for the am series to be independent and stationary at 95 level of confidence is 1 96 prior to analyzing flood frequency in the basin data series from those stations were checked for am randomness as shown in table 2 gato wosha and melka oda stations test statistics μ resulted 2 343 2 856 and 2 681 respectively as a result those three stations are removed from the analysis while the hypothesis of independence and stationarity is confirmed for the remaining stations 4 2 cluster analysis the main purpose of hierarchical clustering in this study was to get optimum number of cluster and to have initial cluster memberships of the catchments then using outputs from hierarchical method the k means approach have been computed to obtain possible homogeneous groups after several iterations using the proximity matrix squared euclidean distance was calculated between all pairs of attributes the screen plot of distances coefficients column against stage using agglomeration schedule was used to decide number of clusters fig 2 when there is a big change between the coefficients of two succeeding stages the trend in the screen plot altered and elbow occurs this indicates that the heterogeneity of the clusters being combined is growing and that it would be an ideal to stop the clustering process before the clusters become too different yim and ramdeen 2015 as shown in fig 2 there is a greater difference in the coefficients between stages 4 and 5 with a change of about 0 225 this is the first clear escalation from visual inspection of screen plot and agglomeration schedule therefore cluster has been chosen to stop at 4th stage suggesting four cluster is optimal to form hydrologically homogeneous regions in the rvlb the cluster membership is obtained after five iterations based on the proposed similarity measure using k means algorithm two catchments are grouped in cluster one six catchments in cluster two ten catchments in cluster three and ten in cluster four table 3 4 3 discordancy measure adjusting the regions and reginal homogeneity tests once a set of initial regions are identified using cluster analysis it is necessary to assess the regions hydrological similarity and made the required adjustments the tests applied in this study are discordance measure and dispersion analysis cv and lcv based homogeneity measure based on the preliminary definition sketch for discordancy ferfuro and gombora catchments are found to be discordant from region two as the average regional l moments of this region is far from the average value chiufa and rinzaf catchments are also stations that are discordant from region three for the region four gidabo near measso is found to be discordant fig 3 according to the options suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 to improve the physical coherence and homogeneity of the regions one or more sites that are grossly discordant within the region can be eliminated therefore stations from each region that are found grossly discordant based on sketch for discordancy fig 3 are eliminated and discordance measure was computed for the rest of stations found in each region fig 4 the discordance value of each station within a corresponding region is provided in table 4 region one consists only one gauged station thus cosidered as independent homogeneous region and at site frequency curve was developed independently using unique distribution model it fitted number of stations in region two is four and in this case d i value is 1 in very small region like region two the statistics d i is not very informative as it is difficult to whether a site is grossly unusual when there are a few other sites with which to compare it hosking and wallis 1997 so further homogeneity tests is required for region two region three which contains seven stations the critical value is d i 1 917 and no stations have passed this value for region four critical value is d i 1 648 as it contains six stations and again no station have passed the threshold value table 4 the cv and lcv values of am flows are computed understand the statistical behavior of the stations in order to form a hydrologically homogeneous region as shown in table 5 all regions satisfy the criteria of cc being less than 0 3 in both conventional moments and lcvs 4 4 selection of distribution models parameters and standard error estimation 4 4 1 selection of regional distribution model for any given region the preliminary candidate distribution were selected by visual assessment based on lmrd lcs vs lck using regional average moment ratios lcv lcs and lck analogous to τ τ3 and τ4 fig 5 accordingly for region one the only candidate distribution selected is gev to be checked by the proposed goodness of fit measures for the region two visually inspected candidate distributions are gamma and ln2 for region three ln2 gamma gev gp and wakeby are chosen as a candidate distribution for final selection finally the candidate regional distribution for region four are gp wakeby gamma gev and ln2 fig 5 the regional goodness of fit test gof was used in this study to determine the final best fit regional distribution model easyfit software available at http www mathwave com easyfit distribution fitting html computes three gof tests accordingly from the available tests on easyfit kolmogorov smrinov ks and anderson darling ad tests have been used for regional analysis and distributions with three or more parameters the chi squared test is not considered a high power test cunnane 1989 kamal et al 2017 therefore the chi squared test has not been used for gof test in this study the critical value at 95 confidence level i e α 0 05 for the distribution to be accepted to fit to certain data using ks and ad tests are 0 13253 and 2 5018 respectively accordingly gev has given rank number one and accepted by both ks and ad tests as the test statistics are lower than the critical value for the region two both gof tests have given rank number one to ln2 and the test statistics is accepted by both ks and ad for the distribution to fit to this region again for the case of region three wakeby distribution is selected based on the given rank and the test statistics by both method finally for region four gp is selected as the best fit regional distribution based on the rank given and the test statistics of being lower than the critical value at 95 confidence level table 6 4 4 2 parameter and standard error estimation table 7 shows the summary of parameter estimates by those three methods mom pwm and ml using dimensionless regional flood data for gev ln2 and gp distributions parameters have been computed using all methods proposed on this study and ready to be compared based on see for wakeby distribution mom is not feasible and pwm has certain assumptions like all parameters should be positive but in this study when pwm is applied it violates this assumptions rao and hamed 2000 so ml method becomes the only choice here table 8 shows see of parameters corresponding to a given return period for gev of region one mom is the one with the lowest standard error so gev with mom parameter estimation method is selected to drive frequency curve for this region for region two of ln2 see is calculated analytically using mom and ml method only because there is no analytical method to calculate for ln2 pwm so ml is selected as it has lowest see compared to mom to drive regional frequency curve for region two for the region three of wakeby distribution there is no mathematical expression to calculate see estimates eventhougth there is numerical approximation to calculate see for this method as the main objective of calculating see here is to compare among the proposed methods see has not been approximated for wakeby distribution therefore ml were chosen by default for regional frequency curve derivation for region three for region four of gp distribution ml has lowest see compared to mom and pwm at the given return period so gp with ml is chosen to drive frequency curve for region four the standard error of estimates is typically expressed as a unit of flow data fitted to a distribution model in this case as a unit of standardized non dimensionless flows 4 5 derivation of regional frequency curve for the homogeneous regions of rvlb the dimensionless regional quantile estimates q t of each region in the rvlb at the given return period t is described in the following table table 9 is used to calculate flood quantile at any site in a particular region by simply multiplying the dimensionless regional quantile by the mean flood at that site for the required return period alternatively regional frequency curve is developed as shown in fig 6 using regional flood quantile estimates at the corresponding return period these curves are helpful for any water resource development in the homogeneous regions of rvlb that have no adequate site specific data for ffa 4 6 mean flood estimation for ungauged catchments in the regions regression equations are developed to predict maf for ungauged areas in the homogeneous regions of rvlb the ungauged catchments clustered in deferent regions depending on various catchment characteristics using k mean method are segen in region one guder in region two woji in region three shafe baso and bisare in region four respectively table 3 regression equations are derived using the relationship between dependent variable maf and independent variables catchment characteristics of the gauged catchments within the specific region accordingly maf of ungauged catchments within each specific region can be estimated using easily available catchment characteristics depending on specific equation derived aic was used select potential catchment characteristics for predicting maf yamashita et al 2007 among the sequence of models generated using stepwise aic forward regression the one with the lowest aic has been chosen for each region region 2 3 and 4 as shown in table 10 region one consists only one gauged catchment and performing regression analysis for single catchment is not possible therefore in this study regression analysis for region one has not been computed as described in table 10 for region two percentage of intensively cultivated is the only independent variable chosen through stepwise aic forward regression lowest aic 31 239 to predict maf in this region similarly for region three percentage of grassland and maximum elevation are the ones selected to predict maf because of their lowest aic value of 75 411and 60 583 respectively from this region finally for region four three independent variables stream density percentage of medium and length of the longest stream are selected to predict maf lowest aic 51 164 48 272 and 34 434 respectively table 11 presents the developed regression equation used for maf estimation in the ungauged areas in the homogenous region of rvlb to validate the performance of regional regression equation certain gauged catchments were considered ungauged and were not used for the development of regression equation the pseudo ungauged catchments selected are kola from region two ketar fete from region three and hamassa wajifo from region four table 12 as shown in table 11 for region two developed regression equation is statistically insignificant p 0 19 at α 0 05 moreover relative error between observed and estimated maf is 0 511 using kola as pseudo ungauged catchment table 12 thus the developed regression equation is weak in predicting maf in this region and further study is recommended in region three the equation performs well r2 0 899 and statistically significant p 0 02 at α 0 05 additionally the relative error between observed and estimated maf is 0 039 using ketar fete as pseudo ungauged catchment thus the equation derived for region three can be used for maf estimation of woji catchment table 11 similarly for region four the equation performs well r2 0 994 and statistically significant at α 0 05 i e p 0 04 the relative error between observed and estimated maf using hamassa wajifo as pseudo ungauged catchment is also 0 166 so the equation derived for region four can be used for maf estimation of shafe baso and bisare catchments respectively table 11 in general once maf of such ungauged areas is estimated quantile estimates at the required return period can be calculated using the derived regional frequency curves for specific region table 9 5 conclusion in this study catchments in the rvlb were regionalized using catchment characteristics and hydrological homogeneity of the delineated regions were tested by using flood statistics accordingly using k mean method four regions were identified and certain adjustments were made to the stations clustered in the regions to improve hydrological homogeneity of the proposed regions after the adjustments made all regions have satisfied the proposed homogeneity criteria discordance measure cv and lcv based homogeneity tests following regionalization of catchments ffa for the hydrologically homogeneous regions in the rvlb were conducted the candidate regional distribution have been visually selected using l moment diagram and final selection was done based on goodness of fit tests kolmogorov smrinov ks and anderson darling ad accordingly generalized extreme value gev lognormal ln2 wakeby and generalized pareto gp distributions respectively for region one up to four are the selected regional distribution for ffa in the respective regions using standard error estimates efficient parameter estimations method was compared and the one with the lowest see was selected accordingly mom was chosen for region one and ml was found to be efficient for the rest of the regions regional frequency curve was developed using regional flood quantile estimates at the corresponding return period for each homogeneous region in the rvlb the frequency curve developed for region four is stepper than the others this region receives more rainfall and very high elevation difference within the reach can be considered as one of the causes of destructive flood in the area moreover this region is characterized by severe land degradation that is resulting in soil erosion and thus flooding that is affecting communities living at the river banks and around chamo and abaya lakes the frequency curves for the other regions region one two and three are rather gentler compared to region four even if these curves seems gentler compared to region four there is a major flood problem in such regions flooding in these regions can be caused due to adjustments of floodplains due to rapid expansion of agricultural and urban landuse and natural floodplains e g shurbland grassland in addition to this change and variability of rainfall and streamflow can be the reason for the occurrence of hydrological extremes in such regions regression equation was also developed for ffa in the ungauged areas of homogeneous regions of rvlb using easily available data catchment characteristics to validate the performance of regression model certain stations were not used in the development of regression equation and considered pseudo ungauged catchments the relative error between observed and estimated were computed for all regions except region one which contains only one gauged catchment accordingly for region two regression equation performed weak to predict mean annual flow for the pseudo ungauged catchment kola in the region but for regions three and four the equations performed very well in predicting the mean annual flow for the pseudo ungauged catchments ketar fete and hamassa wajifo hence to improve the performance of regionalization and ffa in the basin regionalization of catchments could assess soft clustering rather than only focusing on hard clustering because in reality most catchments bear partial similarity to several clusters and one cannot fully justify assigning a catchment to one cluster or another in addition to this the impact of climate change on flood response of the catchments area required to improve reliability of ffa in the basin in conclusion the result of this study provides vital information to enhance flood management work in the rvlb where flood is a problem and data availability is a challenge to quantify the upcoming floods reliably declaration of competing interest we
