8900,intensification of olive production could suppose an increase of natural resources consumption as well as an acceleration of soil degradation studies of soil and trees combining different strategies of water management and fertilization to solve these drawbacks are scarce and contradictory the aim of this work was to describe the effect of organic and inorganic fertilization in soil parameters water availability physico chemical properties and greenhouse gas emissions and tree development fruit and crown growth pattern in rainfed and irrigated conditions in two different olive systems hedgerow and intensive the solid olive mill by product called alperujo compost ac was added as organic fertilization in both systems and two irrigation managements full and deficit at the hedgerow sites were also considered the addition of ac tended to increase soil water retention and soil organic matter som displaying on average about 15 and 20 more respectively in soils treated compared to their controls in both experiments irrigation rather than compost addition was the factor controlling the evolution of both fruit and tree growth however ac seemed influenced fruit production specially at the hedgerow system that yielded 30 and 41 more for the deficit and full irrigation management with compost than their respective controls emissions of ghe did not generally increase with the ac addition and showed a marked seasonal character in both sites regardless irrigation at the hedgerow site the full irrigation regimen tended to increase co2 and ch4 soil fluxes the agronomic use of organic wastes combined with a deficit irrigation strategy proved to be an efficient tool for nutrient recycling and promoting a zero waste circular economy and a water conservation strategy keywords rdi fruit growth vegetative growth gas emission rainfed som data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction olive cultivation in mediterranean areas has been traditionally low input rainfed systems with low tree densities located in marginal areas however the trend towards olive grove intensification to meet society s needs in these areas characterized by medium to poor soil fertility and water scarcity is having a significant impact on water and soil resources gómez limón et al 2012 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 kostelenos and kiritsakis 2017 although there is no doubt of the environmental problems that this fast and large scale intensification is causing i e increased rates of soil fertility loss over exploitation of water resources increased use of fertilizers fernández lobato et al 2021 zipori et al 2020 there is also a growing recognition of the potential of agricultural practices to somehow palliate and compensate for these adverse consequences in this sense fertilization and irrigation control have been pointed out as pivotal management tools to preserve soil fertility and water resources maintaining in turn production bai et al 2018 li et al 2021 soil organic amendments through compost have been postulated as a solid instrument to increase c stocks potentially constraining at the same time soil greenhouse gases ghg emissions namely carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o in agroecosystems calvano and tamborrino 2022 de sosa et al 2022 forte et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 soils are closely entangled with atmospheric and climate processes through the c n and hydrologic cycles in fact new strategies intended to reduce the environmental impacts of olive groves and improve soil quality are focused on enhancing and preserving soil organic matter som limiting emissions brevik 2012 brilli et al 2019 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 however this effective and complex link between nutrient storage irrigation and reduction of ghg emissions is not well understood some studies have showed that depending on the nature of the organic amendment rate and time of application soil characteristics climatic conditions and spreading methods a priming effect of the native som can result and also soil borne ghg emissions can be enhanced compared to mineral fertilizers brenzinger et al 2021 de rosa et al 2018 graham et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 together with fertilization the irrigation management can exert a strong influence on nutrient availability and leaching soil properties and som mineralization khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 morgado et al 2022 zipori et al 2015 researches on this field have demonstrated that irrigation management can maximize the agronomic performance of the organic amendments increasing yield and biomass production or improve soil properties hirich et al 2014 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 mairech et al 2021 michalopoulos et al 2020 while other studies found no significant relation between the irrigation management and significant changes in most of the soil chemical and microbial parameters kavvadias et al 2018 sanz cobena et al 2017 showed how changes in soil conditions between irrigated and rainfed crops could heavily alter soil microbial processes involved in c co2 ch4 and n n2o fluxes drastically altering the reserves of these elements in the soil likewise sapkota et al 2020 concluded that optimizing irrigation may assist in reducing ch4 emissions and net global warming potential gwp other studies however have pointed to lower the intensification of olive groves i e tree densities and irrigation vs rainfed as the key to reduce the emission and c footprint fernández lobato et al 2021 therefore establishing solid nexus between irrigation and soil amendment is of vital importance to promote natural resources conservation and olive groves productivity in systems with different demands especially under a climate change scenario olive trees have showed an enormous capacity to store co2 eq mainly in their fruits and through plant growth brilli et al 2019 proietti et al 2016 in this sense some studies have showed the potential of olive wastes derived compost to increase vegetative growth improving therefore c sequestration proietti et al 2015 amendments derived from pomace originated from 2 phase olive oil extraction process called in spanish alperujo ac the major wastes from the oil industry have been showed to alter the availability of n inorganic and organic forms p and k content during som decomposition de sosa et al 2022 panettieri et al 2022 however this nutrient availability provided by the organic amendment that it is needed to achieve a growth improvement could be restricted under conditions of water stress ekinci et al 2015 it is clear and fully established for obvious reasons the direct repercussion that irrigation has on fruit development and vegetative growth caruso et al 2014 gucci et al 2019a however the number of studies that integrate the synergetic effects of the organic amendments and irrigation regimens in olive systems with different densities and therefore different nutritional needs is very limited the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of fertilization and irrigation management in two different systems traditional rainfed and high density in hedgerow olive systems to identify the potential to carbon sequestration and gwp specifically we aim to assess 1 broad changes in patterns of som decomposition over time 2 emissions patterns of ghg emissions after the addition of an exogenous source of c with and without irrigation control 3 fruit and crown growth and yield responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area

treatments were applied as follows ac fertilization treatment had several applications fig s1 in december 2020 ac was applied only in the intensive plots with a fertilizer spreader in the lanes in between the tree rows and incorporated manually into the soil at a rate of 17 t ha 1 with the aim to increase soc by at least 20 of the initial soil c content in july 2021 the same product with the same dose and procedure to be incorporated into the soil as mentioned above was applied in the hedgerow plots in march 2022 ac at the same rate of 17 t ha 1 was applied as described before in both sites mineral fertilization in control plots had a different fertilization plan in each site in march 2022 nitrofoska perfect 15 5 20 at a rate of 286 kg ha 1 at the intensive rainfed site and 105 kg

soil water content swc the profile of swc was measured every 10 cm between the depths of 0 1 and 1 m using a portable profile probe fdr pr2 y hh2 delta t u k connected to a data logger prior to gas sampling i e july september november 2021and january march april and june 2022 proﬁle probes were used within access inserted into augered holes in the soil the access tubes were placed in the central line of each plot out of 5 lines of trees at the hedgerow system and underneath the central tree of the plot in the intensive system and their reading was taken as representative of the water content of the zone different depth of soil water distribution i e 0 20 and 0 100 cm were represented to identify different patterns of swc within the soil profile measurements were performed from july 2021 to june 2022 this period included two different growing season 2021 with a great fruit load in hedgerow system data not shown and 2022 with very small yield the initial manufacturer s default calibration for this type of soil optimized according to our soil conditions was employed delta t devices 2016 2 6 olive fruit size fruit yield and tree growth tree growth measurements were performed in march and september 2022 for which three olive trees per plot at the hedgerow system and the central tree of the plot at the intensive system were selected tree growth rate was calculated as the difference of tree volume growth between the initial and final measurements divided by the number of days between them to determine the crown volume one vertical and two horizontal diameters of the crown were measured with the same frequency using a measuring pole with marks every 20 cm it was assumed that the crown shape was similar to a sphere in order to estimate the volume fruit size evolution was monitored during 2022 campaign to do so ten olive fruits were randomly selected each time from trees of each experimental plot in both systems and the fruit length diameter and volume were recorded with a calimeter measurements started from day 133 may 13th 2022 with the fruit formation and finished day 251 september 8th 2022 just after the harvest for the olive grove in hedgerow and from day 169 june th 2022 to day 294 october 21st 2022 in the intensive system for the regression equation of the intensive plots it was only considered till day 188 july 7th 2022 as the final point of the linear growth phase of the fruits just before the water stress started yield components in relation to the number of inflorescence per shoot and number of fruit per inflorescence was estimated in a sample of ten shoots per plot in both systems at day 237 august 25th 2022 olive harvest was carried out in september and november 2022 and the fruit yield was recorded for the total number of trees of each plot and treatment 2 7 statistical analysis a two way anova was performed for the hedgerow plots to test the effect of compost addition and irrigation on soil physico chemical parameters tree growth olive fruit size number of inflorescences and fruits yield and ghg emissions and a one way anova with compost addition as main factors was performed in the intensive plots for all statistical tests p 0 05 was selected as the significance cut off value statistical analysis was performed with spss v25 for windows ibm corp armonk ny 3 results 3 1 soil water profile distribution in general different patterns of soil water distribution from the portable profile probe were detected along the soil profile fig 2 the irrigation regimen exerted the greatest influence near the surface 0 20 cm fig 2a thus the f irrigation regime displayed on average in the months of july21 to april22 38 more swc than the d regimen irrespective of the fertilization treatment that had little or no effect in april22 a punctual reduction of ca 44 of the swc for the f treatment compared to fc was detected in june22 the rise in temperatures and the lack of rainfall exacerbated this difference between the two irrigation regimens causing a reduction of the water content of 86 from the d regime to the f irrigation irrespective of the fertilization treatment regarding the deeper soil layers 0 100 cm fig 2c the swc tended to follow a pattern of greater water reduction consumption in the plots receiving ac i e dc fc thus in the months of july21 sept21 november21 and january22 soil amended with mineral fertilization displayed on average 36 more swc than the ones organically amended whereas in march22 all regimens tended to show quite similar water contents in april22 and june22 the f irrigation showed on average 27 more swc than the rest of the treatments amalgamated together patterns of soil water distribution were very similar between the fertilization treatments at the intensive plots fig 2b and d the total profile showed greater water content in plots treated with ac in march22 and april22 ca 15 whereas in june22 the trend tended to reverse displaying the control plots 9 8 more water than the rc treatment in the deep profile 3 2 soil physical and chemical parameters 3 2 1 hedgerow olive site under fertilization and irrigation management a great oscillation with time of most of the soil chemical parameters was detected regardless the irrigation and fertilization treatments the addition of ac rather than irrigation exerted the greatest influence on soil chemical parameters tables 1 and s5 although it was only significant for the first sampling time compost addition tended to promote soil gwc displaying on average for all sampling times 20 and 11 more water content in soils with dc and fc treatments respectively compared to their respective controls the same trend was seen for som which was promoted approximately 23 in plots treated with ac the wsc was significantly affected by the ac addition in all sampling times tables 1 and s5 p 0 05 thus the treatments with ac showed an average percentage for all sampling times of ca 30 more than the control irrespective the irrigation regimen the final balance expressed in of c loss or store of som comparing the absolute values from november21 to september22 was of 8 20 14 8 8 27 27 5 for the d dc f and fc respectively and for the wsc was 8 5 12 6 7 5 89 5 following the same order of treatments the irrigation effect was mainly detected in april22 in which the f regimen caused an increase of 14 in gwc and a reduction of 14 in som irrespective of the fertilization treatment tables 1 and s5 p 0 05 in september22 the f irrigation decreased wsc in 17 compared to the d treatment and irrespective of the compost addition 3 2 2 intensive olive grove under fertilization management and rainfed conditions the ac effect was very specific to some soil properties and limited to particular sampling times tables 2 and s6 on average for all sampling times soil gwc was enhanced by 20 more in soils with ac than the control although this difference was not significant the addition of ac also increased som and wsc in 20 and 38 on average in april22 and september22 respectively tables 2 and s6 p 0 05 the final balance expressed in of c loss or store of som comparing the absolute values from november21 to september22 was of 4 3 12 7 for the r and rc respectively and for the wsc was 3 01 33 1 following the same order of treatments 3 3 response of yield fruit and tree growth irrigation rather than compost addition was the main factor controlling the evolution of both fruit and tree growth fig 3 table 3 tree crown growth at the hedgerow plots was driven by the irrigation management both in the initial and final dates table 3 the average tree growth rate for the f regimen was 42 higher than the d irrigation regardless of the compost addition although the compost effect did not significant influenced the final crown volume the initial volume was 26 smaller in trees with dc treatment and 10 with the fc management compared to their controls table 3 such differences were decreased in d treatment at the end of the season when dc was only 7 smaller than d because of a greater growth rate along the season no significant differences were found in the rainfed site table 3 initial and final crown volume were slightly greater at the inorganic fertilization but differences were only around 10 irrigation at the hedgerow site conditioned the fruit development fig 3a thus the f regime yielded greater fruit growth rates during practically all the fruit development slope of the regression was greater in f than in d in each fertilization strategy moreover d trees presented several periods of reduction in fruit volume in the second half of the experiment because of water stress conditions however just before harvest the water status recovery of d trees permitted that only the effect of the compost influenced in the final fruit volume p 0 05 thus treatments with inorganic fertilization i e d f presented on average an increase in the final fruit volume of 11 compared to the plots treated with ac with no differences between the irrigation managements at the intensive plots the compost addition triggered both greater initial fruit growth rates during the linear phase of growth and larger final volumes ca 20 increase although this difference did not result significant fig 3b the number of inflorescence per shoot and fruit per inflorescence was not significantly different in any of the systems table s4 number of fruits were almost the same with slightly more than 1 fruit per inflorescence in the hedgerow site but around 1 in the intensive plots on the other hand the number of inflorescence were slightly greater in fc and dc than in their controls this trend was greater in fc which displayed on average 20 more inflorescences than f while the increase in dc was only 6 the intensive system presented the same number of inflorescence per shoot regarding fruit yield no significant differences were detected with respect to the addition of ac and the irrigation regimens in any of the sites fig 4 although it was not significant compost seemed to be the most relevant factor influencing fruit production specially at the hedgerow system thus dc and fc treatments yielded 30 and 41 more than their respective controls whereas the addition of ac only caused a 3 yield improvement at the intensive plots although in absolute values the f irrigation induced a 28 of harvest improvement regardless of the addition of compost there was a great variability among the individual plots fig 4 the yield of the rainfed system was greater than the hedgerow because of the alternate bearing pattern of this latter site this was likely related with the pruning of the hedgerow which was too strong and increase the alternate bearing of this cultivar a comparison of an isolated season is not adequate and more data are needed for obtaining some conclusions 3 4 contribution of greenhouse gases 3 4 1 trends of co2 fluxes emissions of co2 did not generally differ either with the compost addition or irrigation management but they did show a marked seasonal character fig 5a and b regardless of the compost addition in the hedgerow site the f irrigation regimen tended to increase co2 emission raising the fluxes by 38 in july21 and 15 on average in september21 and march22 but this difference was not significant in november21 dc and fc treatments increased co2 emissions by 19 and 70 respectively in comparison with their controls while we detected a certain inhibitory effect on co2 emissions at this sampling time for the f treatment from november22 onward all treatments showed very similar emission patterns fig 5a at the intensive plots the compost addition did not cause significant differences between treated and control plots fig 5b nevertheless plots treated with ac tended to increase by 11 and 35 co2 emissions in november21 and march22 respectively the seasonal pattern of this site was very similar to the hedgerow plots but with a greater reduction during summer period jul21 sept21 jun22 3 4 2 trends of n2o fluxes at the hedgerow system no significant differences were found regarding n2o patterns emissions and irrigation or fertilization management fig 5c in general pulses of n2o fluxes were detected depending on the treatment and the sampling time and therefore statistical differences were very difficult to detect fig 5c the f irrigation regimen seemed to enhance n2o emissions in november21 compared to the rest of the treatments and the greatest variability of n2o emission patterns among plots of the same treatment was observed in june22 all treatments showed a similar emission behavior during the rest of the sampling times at the intensive plots no effect of the compost addition was detected during the course of the experiment fig 5d displaying both the organic and the mineral fertilization very low emission rates 3 4 3 trends of ch4 fluxes different patterns of ch4 emissions were detected according to the irrigation regimen and the sampling time at the hedgerow system fig 5e thus emissions of ch4 from the plots receiving f irrigation regardless the compost addition were significantly higher in january and april22 160 and 52 respectively compared to the d irrigation plots that behaved as sinks p 0 05 although the addition of compost was not a significant factor in any of the ch4 emission points there seemed to be a direct correlation between the intensity of irrigation and the compost application thus in april22 the d irrigation plots receiving mineral fertilization increase in ca 33 on average ch4 emission although there was great variability among plots with the same treatment whereas the f irrigated plots amended with compost emitted 50 more than its respective control in june22 soils of all irrigation regimens acted as ch4 sinks but with different intensity while the d regimen captured 20 76 µg ch4 c m2 h 1 the potential of soil ch4 uptake decreased by 60 for the f regimen on the other hand no significant trends in term of ch4 emissions were observed after the compost application at the rainfed traditional site fig 5 f but ac presented lower values in sept21 and nov 21 overall both treatments followed a very similar emitting sinking behavior during the course of the experiment the seasonal pattern of both sites was very different at rainfed site ch4 emission was almost steady and the period of changes was reduced to sept21 and nov 21 but in hedgerow site this pattern was dynamic in all the season and in all treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water distribution under different irrigation strategies the success of irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation depends largely on the crop ability to handle variability in profile stored soil water in periods of water shortage without compromising yield bell et al 2020 this irrigation regimen is commonly recommended for olive hedgerow orchards with high tree densities because it limits excessive growth and nutrient flushing padilla díaz et al 2018 as it was expected the analysis of the subsurface soil layers 0 20 cm reflected in general the influence of the irrigation management to store water at surface level however it is worth mentioning that although the trend of greater swc on the first 20 soil centimeters was clear for the f irrigation regimen irrespective of the fertilization treatment there seemed to be a certain change in soil moisture dynamics and not a general reduction of swc in april22 in plots with the f strategy this theory is reinforced by the fact that the analysis of the whole soil profile placed this particular treatment as the one with more swc in absolute values this particular event could have been caused by the influence of heterogeneous environmental factors such as antecedent precipitations or soil properties that can exert a strong influence on soil moisture dynamics huang et al 2016 regarding the distribution of swc in deeper soil layers we did not found a greater root stimulation and soil water extraction at depth as a consequence of the deficit irrigation regimen which contrasts with previous studies chai et al 2016 what is interesting to note is that although fertilization appeared to be a significant factor for the distribution of the swc at depth plots receiving the organic treatments showed this natural tendency of greater water consumption prior to the compost addition this natural trend seemed to be maintained until march22 when more abundant precipitation events were recorded and all treatments tended to equalize the swc due to the great soil spatial variability this approach to measuring water at depth has a number of limitations as the difficulty to know up to what extent compost addition has modulated this response needing therefore widening the variables considered in future research likewise the effect of the compost at depth at the intensive plots was difficult to determine as in june22 after the second compost addition there seemed to be a change in trend of swc after the antecedent precipitations to our knowledge there is no previous study of how the organic amendments can influence water distribution at deeper soil depths in olive orchards so comparing the results is difficult further research should be done to investigate this effect over longer period of times and repeated compost application 4 2 role of organic amendments and water inputs in the soil in olive groves with different management developing sustainable strategies to preserve and enhance som are much needed to palliate the environmental impacts of olive groves intensification as well as climate change previous research has provided evidence that organic amendments are a feasible solution to enhance soil c stocks as we also found if we compared treated plots with controls farooqi et al 2018 regni et al 2017 however the ability to store c in the soil especially with high tree densities was positive but limited similarly regni et al 2017 found a low amount but higher than the control plots of c sequestered in the soil following the application of olive pomace and sánchez garcía et al 2016 did not detect a significant increase of som if not in wsc after the addition of ac which was attributed to the easily degradable compounds that triggered the mineralization processes in our case due to the easily degradable character of the compost wsc was the parameter that best reflected the positive effect of ac although wsc only accounts for a small portion of total organic c in soils it has been established as a good indicator of soil quality wang et al 2019 xu et al 2011 and there was no doubt that its increment was related to the compost addition it is interesting to note how the rc treatment was the only one that reflected a positive significant increment of som throughout time reveling the importance of the agronomic practices i e tree density organic amendment dose in maintaining or enhancing the soil c sink function irrigation however and contrary to expectations did not have a strong effect on most of the soil chemical parameters we hypothesized that this lack of effect could be related to the complex interaction of precipitation events and irrigation that somehow mask a clear trend with the irrigation control this theory is supported by a close analysis to som losses throughout time accounting for the som loss from november21 to march22 four months and the one between march22 and april22 one month is noteworthy that the loss intensity in most of the treatments was much higher in just one month that the previous period and this loss occurred more intensely with full irrigation therefore there must be a joint effect of a heavy precipitation event 182 mm that probably played an important role in runoff generation and soil erosion and the irrigation regime likewise kavvadias et al 2018 found challenging to identify an irrigation effect due to the effect of high precipitations or arampatzis et al 2018 that observed a greater impact on soil moisture due to the sampling seasonality or the soil management rather than the irrigation regimens 4 3 fruit yield and growth evolution in olive groves with different management it is generally assumed that irrigation can greatly help to improve a better vegetative and reproductive growth caruso et al 2014 gucci et al 2019b patumi et al 2002 in this sense deficit irrigation is a common practice in orchards to improve water use efficiency without compromising yield gucci et al 2019 the results of this experiment are in good agreement with those statements allowing us to make several key assumptions firstly irrigation was the determinant factor for tree growth and secondly trees from the d irrigation regimen could perfectly recover from the ups and downs of water shortage but moderately reducing yield such yield reduction in d treatment was likely related with the initial lower crown volume of this treatment and have to be better evaluated in a multi seasonal experiment likewise fernández et al 2013 found that although a deficit irrigation strategy meant a moderate decrease in oil yield it managed the best balance between water saving tree vigor and oil production and garcía et al 2017 also added that this effects can be over ride by autumn precipitations moreover girón et al 2015 concluded that an adequate rehydration after a water stress period during pit hardening would eliminate any differences between full and deficit irrigation in quantity and quality of the yield it is interesting to note that a fruit volume decrease in the fc treatment was detected whereas for the f treatment the fruit volume was not reduced being the amount of water supplied for both treatments practically the same we hypothesized that this event could be related to two factors first that the amount of irrigation could be less than the trees needed because of the increase of eto as the irrigation scheduling was performed the week before however in our opinion this decrease is most related to a possible drawback of the methodology to estimate the fruit volume as ten fruits were randomized selected each week changes between weeks could increase even considering that the trend of fc was to decrease in fruit volume from june onwards in addition the seasonal pattern is almost linear the last 4 data in f and fc treatments suggested that there is a decrease in the fruit growth at the end of the experiment then the decrease in fruit volume in fc could be related to variations in the measure that confirm these tendencies on the other hand there is evidence of the beneficial role that organic amendments play in crop productivity hale et al 2021 regni et al 2017 however contrasting results are often presented regni et al 2017 found that 8 years of organic amendment produced a higher fruit yield than the control plots and tejada and benítez 2020 reported positive results in plots organically amended conversely other studies stated that the positive effect of the application of organic materials on vegetative activity and fruit yield can be dependent of the rate of substrate mineralization and the timing of nutrients release stating that in some cases the productivity levels of systems with or without an extra source of c can be comparable fernández hernández et al 2014 lópez piñeiro et al 2011 oldfield et al 2018 in our case the study of fruit size development and yield led to different conclusions on the one hand the analysis of the fruit size indicated that the compost addition slightly reduced the fruit size but being this still widely within the caliber of table olives girón et al 2015 on the other hand in terms of productivity trees from organic amended soils invested more energy and resources in increasing olive production and probably differences in yield will come significant after repeated applications of the ac for a longer period of time regni et al 2017 tejada and benítez 2020 then the slight decrease in fruit size could not affect the final farmer profit if the increase in yield would be confirmed 4 4 role of organic amendment application on greenhouse gas emission from soil it is well established that the addition of organic amendments can lead to ghg emission by processes such as priming effect methanogenesis nitrification and denitrification forte et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 walling and vaneeckhaute 2020 in our case the addition of ac caused very punctual pulses of co2 and n2o that was probably inferred by processes such as microbial activation or growth before easily available som thangarajan et al 2013 as in sánchez garcía et al 2016 losses associated to ghg emissions after the compost addition had a prominent seasonal character mainly affected by the temperature and the water fill pore space in terms of fertilization november21 sample point represents a particular case it is difficult to establish solid patterns as gas emissions did not correlate with any of the soil variables measured which it is not uncommon due to the existence of multiple simultaneous and intertwined relationships between the soil plant system and the atmosphere gaseous phase brevik 2012 oertel et al 2016 it is interesting to note that at the november21 sampling point a certain inhibitory effect of co2 emission was detected for the full irrigation regimen with mineral fertilization whereas for the rest of the treatments som decomposition seemed to be enhanced previous studies have reported a certain inhibitory effect of co2 emissions at specific times usually linked to the addition of nutritional treatments for example n application maris et al 2015 attributed this inhibition to the fact that n application could reduce extracellular enzyme activity and the fungal population resulting in a reduction in the co2 flux this was also observed by ding et al 2006 while xiao et al 2005 found an enhancement of co2 fluxes after n fertilization and lee et al 2007 found no effect at all displaying contradictory patterns of emissions we hypothesize that this inhibitory effect could be related to the strong coupling of c n ratio that directly affects to som decomposition santos et al 2021 the lowest c content found for this treatment together with the mineral fertilization could have induced changes in nutrient stoichiometry being a limiting factor for emission in this specific case but further research is needed to reach sound conclusions for the rest of the treatments it seemed that when there is more c available the c n relation increased and more n is needed to maintain microbial optimal growth and therefore n mineralization is enhanced providing a source of inorganic compounds whose final end can turn into n2o emissions as seen in the months of november21 mullen 2015 reich et al 2006 although emissions of n2o were extremely low for all treatments during the whole experiment it is worth mentioning that dc treatment exhibited a complete different behavior than the rest of the treatments in june22 as water soluble n usually follows the same patter as wsc we hypothesized that this pulse of n2o could be related to a greater n and c availability in this treatment although this overall impact on n2o emissions was insignificant as it has been showed before with this type of compost sánchez garcía et al 2016 de sosa et al 2022 other studies however have pointed to the contrasting soil moisture and temperature conditions that drive autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as the responsible for these pulses barton et al 2008 butterbach bahl et al 2013 sapkota et al 2020 however this trend should be confirmed over time several studies have also identified a greater increase in ch4 emissions after the addition of organic amendments than from mineral fertilizer soils lee et al 2010 yang et al 2010 but this is usually associated with poorly aerated soils and high rates of liquid organic fertilizer which it is not our study case thus regarding compost addition we did not detect any change in the ch4 emission patterns neither in the hedgerow system nor in the intensive plots there is evidence that supports that irrigation practices can change emission patterns due to the influence on microbial process and relocation of nutrient supply oertel et al 2016 fares et al 2017 sapkota et al 2020 in our study the effect of irrigation control was apparently no significant as studies such as maris et al 2015 and franco luesma et al 2019 have identified before nonetheless we did observe a raise of co2 fluxes with the full irrigation management independently of the fertilization strategy in some of the hottest months that could be attributed to an acceleration of microbial respiration of som mediated by the increase in swc sapkota et al 2020 under rainfed conditions however the low water availability in these months became the rate limiting factor for co2 and n2o emissions being in absolute values lower than those of the irrigated plots this leaves evidence that at least under water stress conditions irrigation rather than compost addition exerted a clear influence on co2 and n2o emission patterns irrigation played also a pivotal role controlling patterns of ch4 emissions the production of ch4 is a strictly anaerobic microbial process named methanogenesis but that is usually negligible in non flooded soils because they are well aerated if the soil acts as a sink or source of ch4 will depend on the balance between the ch4 production by methanogens and the consumption by methanotrophs that in turn it is controlled by shifts in water regimes that change the redox potential and the microbial activity jiao et al 2006 thangarajan et al 2013 previous studies have stated that reduced irrigation practices can decrease ch4 emissions and although our emission factor was negligible compared to other crops we did observe how the d irrigation regimen tended systematically to reduce ch4 fluxes oertel et al 2016 sapkota et al 2020 in the case of the intensive site it was the conditions of soil moisture that modulated the function of the soil as a ch4 source or sink by enhancing or not the ch4 oxidation hernández 2010 5 conclusions soil application of organic matter from organic residues can be an alternative to increase soil fertility and efficiency of irrigation the agronomic use of organic wastes from agricultural activities presented important benefits towards closing nutrient cycles enhancing the circular economy and adding extra value to the food produced the results obtained indicated that the deficit irrigation strategy accompanied by the addition of alperujo compost maintained soil fertility and did not increase the risks of greenhouse gas emissions in hedgerow olive groves although future research is necessary the contribution of compost would allow considerable savings in irrigation water without compromising crop production under these conditions traditional rainfed agriculture was also favoured by the inclusion of alperujo compost improving soil fertility and maintaining sustainable yield production comparable to or even higher than those obtained with mineral fertilization

8900,intensification of olive production could suppose an increase of natural resources consumption as well as an acceleration of soil degradation studies of soil and trees combining different strategies of water management and fertilization to solve these drawbacks are scarce and contradictory the aim of this work was to describe the effect of organic and inorganic fertilization in soil parameters water availability physico chemical properties and greenhouse gas emissions and tree development fruit and crown growth pattern in rainfed and irrigated conditions in two different olive systems hedgerow and intensive the solid olive mill by product called alperujo compost ac was added as organic fertilization in both systems and two irrigation managements full and deficit at the hedgerow sites were also considered the addition of ac tended to increase soil water retention and soil organic matter som displaying on average about 15 and 20 more respectively in soils treated compared to their controls in both experiments irrigation rather than compost addition was the factor controlling the evolution of both fruit and tree growth however ac seemed influenced fruit production specially at the hedgerow system that yielded 30 and 41 more for the deficit and full irrigation management with compost than their respective controls emissions of ghe did not generally increase with the ac addition and showed a marked seasonal character in both sites regardless irrigation at the hedgerow site the full irrigation regimen tended to increase co2 and ch4 soil fluxes the agronomic use of organic wastes combined with a deficit irrigation strategy proved to be an efficient tool for nutrient recycling and promoting a zero waste circular economy and a water conservation strategy keywords rdi fruit growth vegetative growth gas emission rainfed som data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction olive cultivation in mediterranean areas has been traditionally low input rainfed systems with low tree densities located in marginal areas however the trend towards olive grove intensification to meet society s needs in these areas characterized by medium to poor soil fertility and water scarcity is having a significant impact on water and soil resources gómez limón et al 2012 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 kostelenos and kiritsakis 2017 although there is no doubt of the environmental problems that this fast and large scale intensification is causing i e increased rates of soil fertility loss over exploitation of water resources increased use of fertilizers fernández lobato et al 2021 zipori et al 2020 there is also a growing recognition of the potential of agricultural practices to somehow palliate and compensate for these adverse consequences in this sense fertilization and irrigation control have been pointed out as pivotal management tools to preserve soil fertility and water resources maintaining in turn production bai et al 2018 li et al 2021 soil organic amendments through compost have been postulated as a solid instrument to increase c stocks potentially constraining at the same time soil greenhouse gases ghg emissions namely carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o in agroecosystems calvano and tamborrino 2022 de sosa et al 2022 forte et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 soils are closely entangled with atmospheric and climate processes through the c n and hydrologic cycles in fact new strategies intended to reduce the environmental impacts of olive groves and improve soil quality are focused on enhancing and preserving soil organic matter som limiting emissions brevik 2012 brilli et al 2019 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 however this effective and complex link between nutrient storage irrigation and reduction of ghg emissions is not well understood some studies have showed that depending on the nature of the organic amendment rate and time of application soil characteristics climatic conditions and spreading methods a priming effect of the native som can result and also soil borne ghg emissions can be enhanced compared to mineral fertilizers brenzinger et al 2021 de rosa et al 2018 graham et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 together with fertilization the irrigation management can exert a strong influence on nutrient availability and leaching soil properties and som mineralization khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 morgado et al 2022 zipori et al 2015 researches on this field have demonstrated that irrigation management can maximize the agronomic performance of the organic amendments increasing yield and biomass production or improve soil properties hirich et al 2014 kavvadias and koubouris 2019 mairech et al 2021 michalopoulos et al 2020 while other studies found no significant relation between the irrigation management and significant changes in most of the soil chemical and microbial parameters kavvadias et al 2018 sanz cobena et al 2017 showed how changes in soil conditions between irrigated and rainfed crops could heavily alter soil microbial processes involved in c co2 ch4 and n n2o fluxes drastically altering the reserves of these elements in the soil likewise sapkota et al 2020 concluded that optimizing irrigation may assist in reducing ch4 emissions and net global warming potential gwp other studies however have pointed to lower the intensification of olive groves i e tree densities and irrigation vs rainfed as the key to reduce the emission and c footprint fernández lobato et al 2021 therefore establishing solid nexus between irrigation and soil amendment is of vital importance to promote natural resources conservation and olive groves productivity in systems with different demands especially under a climate change scenario olive trees have showed an enormous capacity to store co2 eq mainly in their fruits and through plant growth brilli et al 2019 proietti et al 2016 in this sense some studies have showed the potential of olive wastes derived compost to increase vegetative growth improving therefore c sequestration proietti et al 2015 amendments derived from pomace originated from 2 phase olive oil extraction process called in spanish alperujo ac the major wastes from the oil industry have been showed to alter the availability of n inorganic and organic forms p and k content during som decomposition de sosa et al 2022 panettieri et al 2022 however this nutrient availability provided by the organic amendment that it is needed to achieve a growth improvement could be restricted under conditions of water stress ekinci et al 2015 it is clear and fully established for obvious reasons the direct repercussion that irrigation has on fruit development and vegetative growth caruso et al 2014 gucci et al 2019a however the number of studies that integrate the synergetic effects of the organic amendments and irrigation regimens in olive systems with different densities and therefore different nutritional needs is very limited the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of fertilization and irrigation management in two different systems traditional rainfed and high density in hedgerow olive systems to identify the potential to carbon sequestration and gwp specifically we aim to assess 1 broad changes in patterns of som decomposition over time 2 emissions

calibration for this type of soil optimized according to our soil conditions was employed delta t devices 2016 2 6 olive fruit size fruit yield and tree growth tree growth measurements were performed in march and september 2022 for which three olive trees per plot at the hedgerow system and the central tree of the plot at the intensive system were selected tree growth rate was calculated as the difference of tree volume growth between the initial and final measurements divided by the number of days between them to determine the crown volume one vertical and two horizontal diameters of the crown were measured with the same frequency using a measuring pole with marks every 20 cm it was assumed that the crown shape was similar to a sphere in order to estimate the volume fruit size evolution was monitored during 2022 campaign to do so ten olive fruits were randomly selected each time from trees of each experimental plot in both systems and the fruit length diameter and volume were recorded with a calimeter measurements started from day 133 may 13th 2022 with the fruit formation and finished day 251 september 8th 2022 just after the harvest for the olive grove in hedgerow and from day 169 june th 2022 to day 294 october 21st 2022 in the intensive system for the regression equation of the intensive plots it was only considered till day 188 july 7th 2022 as the final point of the linear growth phase of the fruits just before the water stress started yield components in relation to the number of inflorescence per shoot and number of fruit per inflorescence was

distribution in general different patterns of soil water distribution from the portable profile probe were detected along the soil profile fig 2 the irrigation regimen exerted the greatest influence near the surface 0 20 cm fig 2a thus the f irrigation regime displayed on average in the months of july21 to april22 38 more swc than the d regimen irrespective of the fertilization treatment that had little or no effect in april22 a punctual reduction of ca 44 of the swc for the f treatment compared to fc was detected in june22 the rise in temperatures and the lack of rainfall exacerbated this difference between the two irrigation regimens causing a reduction of the water content of 86 from the d regime to the f irrigation irrespective of the fertilization treatment regarding the deeper soil layers 0 100 cm fig 2c the swc tended to follow a pattern of greater water reduction consumption in the plots receiving ac i e dc fc thus in the months of july21 sept21 november21 and january22 soil amended with mineral fertilization displayed on average 36 more swc than the ones organically amended whereas in march22 all regimens tended to show quite similar water contents in april22 and june22 the f irrigation showed on average 27 more swc than the rest of the treatments amalgamated together patterns of soil water distribution were very similar between the fertilization treatments at the intensive plots fig 2b and d the total profile showed greater water content in plots treated with ac in march22 and april22 ca 15 whereas in june22 the trend tended to reverse displaying the control plots 9 8 more water than the rc treatment in the deep profile 3 2 soil physical and chemical parameters 3 2 1 hedgerow olive site under fertilization and irrigation management a great oscillation with time of most of the soil chemical parameters was detected regardless the irrigation and fertilization treatments the addition of ac rather than irrigation exerted the greatest influence on soil chemical parameters tables 1 and s5 although it was only significant for the first sampling time compost addition tended to promote soil gwc displaying on average for all sampling times 20 and 11 more water content in soils with dc and fc treatments respectively compared to their respective controls the same trend was seen for som which was promoted approximately 23 in plots treated with ac the wsc was significantly affected by the ac addition in all sampling times tables 1 and s5 p 0 05 thus the treatments with ac showed an average percentage for all sampling times of ca 30 more than the control irrespective the irrigation regimen the final balance expressed in of c loss or store of som comparing the absolute values from november21 to september22 was of 8 20 14 8 8 27 27 5 for the d dc f and fc respectively and for the wsc was 8 5 12 6 7 5 89 5 following the same order of treatments the irrigation effect was mainly detected in april22 in which the f regimen caused an increase of 14 in gwc and a reduction of 14 in som irrespective of the fertilization treatment tables 1 and s5 p 0 05 in september22 the f irrigation decreased wsc in 17 compared to the d treatment and irrespective of the compost addition 3 2 2 intensive olive grove under fertilization management and rainfed conditions the ac effect was very specific to some soil properties and limited to particular sampling times tables 2 and s6 on average for all sampling times soil gwc was enhanced by 20 more in soils with ac than the control although this difference was not significant the addition of ac also increased som and wsc in 20 and 38 on average in april22 and september22 respectively tables 2 and s6 p 0 05 the final balance expressed in of c loss or store of som comparing the absolute values from november21 to september22 was of 4 3 12 7 for the r and rc respectively and for the wsc was 3 01 33 1 following the same order of treatments 3 3 response of yield fruit and tree growth irrigation rather than compost addition was the main factor controlling the evolution of both fruit and tree growth fig 3 table 3 tree crown growth at the hedgerow plots was driven by the irrigation management both in the initial and final dates table 3 the average tree growth rate for the f regimen was 42 higher than the d irrigation regardless of the compost addition although the compost effect did not significant influenced the final crown volume the initial volume was 26 smaller in trees with dc treatment and 10 with the fc management compared to their controls table 3 such differences were decreased in d treatment at the end of the season when dc was only 7 smaller than d because of a greater growth rate along the season no significant differences were found in the rainfed site table 3 initial and final crown volume were slightly greater at the inorganic fertilization but differences were only around 10 irrigation at the hedgerow site conditioned the fruit development fig 3a thus the f regime yielded greater fruit growth rates during practically all the fruit development slope of the regression was greater in f than in d in each fertilization strategy moreover d trees presented several periods of reduction in fruit volume in the second half of the experiment because of water stress conditions however just before harvest the water status recovery of d trees permitted that only the effect of the compost influenced in the final fruit volume p 0 05 thus treatments with inorganic fertilization i e d f presented on average an increase in the final fruit volume of 11 compared to the plots treated with ac with no differences between the irrigation managements at the intensive plots the compost addition triggered both greater initial fruit growth rates during the linear phase of growth and larger final volumes ca 20 increase although this difference did not result significant fig 3b the number of inflorescence per shoot and fruit per inflorescence was not significantly different in any of the systems table s4 number of fruits were almost the same with slightly more than 1 fruit per inflorescence in the hedgerow site but around 1 in the intensive plots on the other hand the number of inflorescence were slightly greater in fc and dc than in their controls this trend was greater in fc which displayed on average 20 more inflorescences than f while the increase in dc was only 6 the intensive system presented the same number of inflorescence per shoot regarding fruit yield no significant differences were detected with respect to the addition of ac and the irrigation regimens in any of the sites fig 4 although it was not significant compost seemed to be the most relevant factor influencing fruit production specially at the hedgerow system thus dc and fc treatments yielded 30 and 41 more than their respective controls whereas the addition of ac only caused a 3 yield improvement at the intensive plots although in absolute values the f irrigation induced a 28 of harvest improvement regardless of the addition of compost there was a great variability among the individual plots fig 4 the yield of the rainfed system was greater than the hedgerow because of the alternate bearing pattern of this latter site this was likely related with the pruning of the hedgerow which was too strong and increase the alternate bearing of this cultivar a comparison of an isolated season is not adequate and more data are needed for obtaining some conclusions 3 4 contribution of greenhouse gases 3 4 1 trends of co2 fluxes emissions of co2 did not generally differ either with the compost addition or irrigation management but they did show a marked seasonal character fig 5a and b regardless of the compost addition in the hedgerow site the f irrigation regimen tended to increase co2 emission raising the fluxes by 38 in july21 and 15 on average in september21 and march22 but this difference was not significant in november21 dc and fc treatments increased co2 emissions by 19 and 70 respectively in comparison with their controls while we detected a certain inhibitory effect on co2 emissions at this sampling time for the f treatment from november22 onward all treatments showed very similar emission patterns fig 5a at the intensive plots the compost addition did not cause significant differences between treated and control plots fig 5b nevertheless plots treated with ac tended to increase by 11 and 35 co2 emissions in november21 and march22 respectively the seasonal pattern of this site was very similar to the hedgerow plots but with a greater reduction during summer period jul21 sept21 jun22 3 4 2 trends of n2o fluxes at the hedgerow system no significant differences were found regarding n2o patterns emissions and irrigation or fertilization management fig 5c in general pulses of n2o fluxes were detected depending on the treatment and the sampling time and therefore statistical differences were very difficult to detect fig 5c the f irrigation regimen seemed to enhance n2o emissions in november21 compared to the rest of the treatments and the greatest variability of n2o emission patterns among plots of the same treatment was observed in june22 all treatments showed a similar emission behavior during the rest of the sampling times at the intensive plots no effect of the compost addition was detected during the course of the experiment fig 5d displaying both the organic and the mineral fertilization very low emission rates 3 4 3 trends of ch4 fluxes different patterns of ch4 emissions were detected according to the irrigation regimen and the sampling time at the hedgerow system fig 5e thus emissions of ch4 from the plots receiving f irrigation regardless the compost addition were significantly higher in january and april22 160 and 52 respectively compared to the d irrigation plots that behaved as sinks p 0 05 although the addition of compost was not a significant factor in any of the ch4 emission points there seemed to be a direct correlation between the intensity of irrigation and the compost application thus in april22 the d irrigation plots receiving mineral fertilization increase in ca 33 on average ch4 emission although there was great variability among plots with the same treatment whereas the f irrigated plots amended with compost emitted 50 more than its respective control in june22 soils of all irrigation regimens acted as ch4 sinks but with different intensity while the d regimen captured 20 76 µg ch4 c m2 h 1 the potential of soil ch4 uptake decreased by 60 for the f regimen on the other hand no significant trends in term of ch4 emissions were observed after the compost application at the rainfed traditional site fig 5 f but ac presented lower values in sept21 and nov 21 overall both treatments followed a very similar emitting sinking behavior during the course of the experiment the seasonal pattern of both sites was very different at rainfed site ch4 emission was almost steady and the period of changes was reduced to sept21 and nov 21 but in hedgerow site this pattern was dynamic in all the season and in all treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water distribution under different irrigation strategies the success of irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation depends largely on the crop ability to handle variability in profile stored soil water in periods of water shortage without compromising yield bell et al 2020 this irrigation regimen is commonly recommended for olive hedgerow orchards with high tree densities because it limits excessive growth and nutrient flushing padilla díaz et al 2018 as it was expected the analysis of the subsurface soil layers 0 20 cm reflected in general the influence of the irrigation management to store water at surface level however it is worth mentioning that although the trend of greater swc on the first 20 soil centimeters was clear for the f irrigation regimen irrespective of the fertilization treatment there seemed to be a certain change in soil moisture dynamics and not a general reduction of swc in april22 in plots with the f strategy this theory is reinforced by the fact that the analysis of the whole soil profile placed this particular treatment as the one with more swc in absolute values this particular event could have been caused by the influence of heterogeneous environmental factors such as antecedent precipitations or soil properties that can exert a strong influence on soil moisture dynamics huang et al 2016 regarding the distribution of swc in deeper soil layers we did not found a greater root stimulation and soil water extraction at depth as a consequence of the deficit irrigation regimen which contrasts with previous studies chai et al 2016 what is interesting to note is that although fertilization appeared to be a significant factor for the distribution of the swc at depth plots receiving the organic treatments showed this natural tendency of greater water consumption prior to the compost addition this natural trend seemed to be maintained until march22 when more abundant precipitation events were recorded and all treatments tended to equalize the swc due to the great soil spatial variability this approach to measuring water at depth has a number of limitations as the difficulty to know up to what extent compost addition has modulated this response needing therefore widening the variables considered in future research likewise the effect of the compost at depth at the intensive plots was difficult to determine as in june22 after the second compost addition there seemed to be a change in trend of swc after the antecedent precipitations to our knowledge there is no previous study of how the organic amendments can influence water distribution at deeper soil depths in olive orchards so comparing the results is difficult further research should be done to investigate this effect over longer period of times and repeated compost application 4 2 role of organic amendments and water inputs in the soil in olive groves with different management developing sustainable strategies to preserve and enhance som are much needed to palliate the environmental impacts of olive groves intensification as well as climate change previous research has provided evidence that organic amendments are a feasible solution to enhance soil c stocks as we also found if we compared treated plots with controls farooqi et al 2018 regni et al 2017 however the ability to store c in the soil especially with high tree densities was positive but limited similarly regni et al 2017 found a low amount but higher than the control plots of c sequestered in the soil following the application of olive pomace and sánchez garcía et al 2016 did not detect a significant increase of som if not in wsc after the addition of ac which was attributed to the easily degradable compounds that triggered the mineralization processes in our case due to the easily degradable character of the compost wsc was the parameter that best reflected the positive effect of ac although wsc only accounts for a small portion of total organic c in soils it has been established as a good indicator of soil quality wang et al 2019 xu et al 2011 and there was no doubt that its increment was related to the compost addition it is interesting to note how the rc treatment was the only one that reflected a positive significant increment of som throughout time reveling the importance of the agronomic practices i e tree density organic amendment dose in maintaining or enhancing the soil c sink function irrigation however and contrary to expectations did not have a strong effect on most of the soil chemical parameters we hypothesized that this lack of effect could be related to the complex interaction of precipitation events and irrigation that somehow mask a clear trend with the irrigation control this theory is supported by a close analysis to som losses throughout time accounting for the som loss from november21 to march22 four months and the one between march22 and april22 one month is noteworthy that the loss intensity in most of the treatments was much higher in just one month that the previous period and this loss occurred more intensely with full irrigation therefore there must be a joint effect of a heavy precipitation event 182 mm that probably played an important role in runoff generation and soil erosion and the irrigation regime likewise kavvadias et al 2018 found challenging to identify an irrigation effect due to the effect of high precipitations or arampatzis et al 2018 that observed a greater impact on soil moisture due to the sampling seasonality or the soil management rather than the irrigation regimens 4 3 fruit yield and growth evolution in olive groves with different management it is generally assumed that irrigation can greatly help to improve a better vegetative and reproductive growth caruso et al 2014 gucci et al 2019b patumi et al 2002 in this sense deficit irrigation is a common practice in orchards to improve water use efficiency without compromising yield gucci et al 2019 the results of this experiment are in good agreement with those statements allowing us to make several key assumptions firstly irrigation was the determinant factor for tree growth and secondly trees from the d irrigation regimen could perfectly recover from the ups and downs of water shortage but moderately reducing yield such yield reduction in d treatment was likely related with the initial lower crown volume of this treatment and have to be better evaluated in a multi seasonal experiment likewise fernández et al 2013 found that although a deficit irrigation strategy meant a moderate decrease in oil yield it managed the best balance between water saving tree vigor and oil production and garcía et al 2017 also added that this effects can be over ride by autumn precipitations moreover girón et al 2015 concluded that an adequate rehydration after a water stress period during pit hardening would eliminate any differences between full and deficit irrigation in quantity and quality of the yield it is interesting to note that a fruit volume decrease in the fc treatment was detected whereas for the f treatment the fruit volume was not reduced being the amount of water supplied for both treatments practically the same we hypothesized that this event could be related to two factors first that the amount of irrigation could be less than the trees needed because of the increase of eto as the irrigation scheduling was performed the week before however in our opinion this decrease is most related to a possible drawback of the methodology to estimate the fruit volume as ten fruits were randomized selected each week changes between weeks could increase even considering that the trend of fc was to decrease in fruit volume from june onwards in addition the seasonal pattern is almost linear the last 4 data in f and fc treatments suggested that there is a decrease in the fruit growth at the end of the experiment then the decrease in fruit volume in fc could be related to variations in the measure that confirm these tendencies on the other hand there is evidence of the beneficial role that organic amendments play in crop productivity hale et al 2021 regni et al 2017 however contrasting results are often presented regni et al 2017 found that 8 years of organic amendment produced a higher fruit yield than the control plots and tejada and benítez 2020 reported positive results in plots organically amended conversely other studies stated that the positive effect of the application of organic materials on vegetative activity and fruit yield can be dependent of the rate of substrate mineralization and the timing of nutrients release stating that in some cases the productivity levels of systems with or without an extra source of c can be comparable fernández hernández et al 2014 lópez piñeiro et al 2011 oldfield et al 2018 in our case the study of fruit size development and yield led to different conclusions on the one hand the analysis of the fruit size indicated that the compost addition slightly reduced the fruit size but being this still widely within the caliber of table olives girón et al 2015 on the other hand in terms of productivity trees from organic amended soils invested more energy and resources in increasing olive production and probably differences in yield will come significant after repeated applications of the ac for a longer period of time regni et al 2017 tejada and benítez 2020 then the slight decrease in fruit size could not affect the final farmer profit if the increase in yield would be confirmed 4 4 role of organic amendment application on greenhouse gas emission from soil it is well established that the addition of organic amendments can lead to ghg emission by processes such as priming effect methanogenesis nitrification and denitrification forte et al 2017 thangarajan et al 2013 walling and vaneeckhaute 2020 in our case the addition of ac caused very punctual pulses of co2 and n2o that was probably inferred by processes such as microbial activation or growth before easily available som thangarajan et al 2013 as in sánchez garcía et al 2016 losses associated to ghg emissions after the compost addition had a prominent seasonal character mainly affected by the temperature and the water fill pore space in terms of fertilization november21 sample point represents a particular case it is difficult to establish solid patterns as gas emissions did not correlate with any of the soil variables measured which it is not uncommon due to the existence of multiple simultaneous and intertwined relationships between the soil plant system and the atmosphere gaseous phase brevik 2012 oertel et al 2016 it is interesting to note that at the november21 sampling point a certain inhibitory effect of co2 emission was detected for the full irrigation regimen with mineral fertilization whereas for the rest of the treatments som decomposition seemed to be enhanced previous studies have reported a certain inhibitory effect of co2 emissions at specific times usually linked to the addition of nutritional treatments for example n application maris et al 2015 attributed this inhibition to the fact that n application could reduce extracellular enzyme activity and the fungal population resulting in a reduction in the co2 flux this was also observed by ding et al 2006 while xiao et al 2005 found an enhancement of co2 fluxes after n fertilization and lee et al 2007 found no effect at all displaying contradictory patterns of emissions we hypothesize that this inhibitory effect could be related to the strong coupling of c n ratio that directly affects to som decomposition santos et al 2021 the lowest c content found for this treatment together with the mineral fertilization could have induced changes in nutrient stoichiometry being a limiting factor for emission in this specific case but further research is needed to reach sound conclusions for the rest of the treatments it seemed that when there is more c available the c n relation increased and more n is needed to maintain microbial optimal growth and therefore n mineralization is enhanced providing a source of inorganic compounds whose final end can turn into n2o emissions as seen in the months of november21 mullen 2015 reich et al 2006 although emissions of n2o were extremely low for all treatments during the whole experiment it is worth mentioning that dc treatment exhibited a complete different behavior than the rest of the treatments in june22 as water soluble n usually follows the same patter as wsc we hypothesized that this pulse of n2o could be related to a greater n and c availability in this treatment although this overall impact on n2o emissions was insignificant as it has been showed before with this type of compost sánchez garcía et al 2016 de sosa et al 2022 other studies however have pointed to the contrasting soil moisture and temperature conditions that drive autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as the responsible for these pulses barton et al 2008 butterbach bahl et al 2013 sapkota et al 2020 however this trend should be confirmed over time several studies have also identified a greater increase in ch4 emissions after the addition of organic amendments than from mineral fertilizer soils lee et al 2010 yang et al 2010 but this is usually associated with poorly aerated soils and high rates of liquid organic fertilizer which it is not our study case thus regarding compost addition we did not detect any change in the ch4 emission patterns neither in the hedgerow system nor in the intensive plots there is evidence that supports that irrigation practices can change emission patterns due to the influence on microbial process and relocation of nutrient supply oertel et al 2016 fares et al 2017 sapkota et al 2020 in our study the effect of irrigation control was apparently no significant as studies such as maris et al 2015 and franco luesma et al 2019 have identified before nonetheless we did observe a raise of co2 fluxes with the full irrigation management independently of the fertilization strategy in some of the hottest months that could be attributed to an acceleration of microbial respiration of som mediated by the increase in swc sapkota et al 2020 under rainfed conditions however the low water availability in these months became the rate limiting factor for co2 and n2o emissions being in absolute values lower than those of the irrigated plots this leaves evidence that at least under water stress conditions irrigation rather than compost addition exerted a clear influence on co2 and n2o emission patterns irrigation played also a pivotal role controlling patterns of ch4 emissions the production of ch4 is a strictly anaerobic microbial process named methanogenesis but that is usually negligible in non flooded soils because they are well aerated if the soil acts as a sink or source of ch4 will depend on the balance between the ch4 production by methanogens and the consumption by methanotrophs that in turn it is controlled by shifts in water regimes that change the redox potential and the microbial activity jiao et al 2006 thangarajan et al 2013 previous studies have stated that reduced irrigation practices can decrease ch4 emissions and although our emission factor was negligible compared to other crops we did observe how the d irrigation regimen tended systematically to reduce ch4 fluxes oertel et al 2016 sapkota et al 2020 in the case of the intensive site it was the conditions of soil moisture that modulated the function of the soil as a ch4 source or sink by enhancing or not the ch4 oxidation hernández 2010 5 conclusions soil application of organic matter from organic residues can be an alternative to increase soil fertility and efficiency of irrigation the agronomic use of organic wastes from agricultural activities presented important benefits towards closing nutrient cycles enhancing the circular economy and adding extra value to the food produced the results obtained indicated that the deficit irrigation strategy accompanied by the addition of alperujo compost maintained soil fertility and did not increase the risks of greenhouse gas emissions in hedgerow olive groves although future research is necessary the contribution of compost would allow considerable savings in irrigation water without compromising crop production under these conditions traditional rainfed agriculture was also favoured by the inclusion of alperujo compost improving soil fertility and maintaining sustainable yield production comparable to or even higher than those obtained with mineral fertilization

8901,well structured institutional arrangements for irrigation canal scheduling facilitate the implementation of integrated water governance however there is a structural mismatch between the actual hierarchical institutional arrangements of canal scheduling and the traditional single level canal scheduling models single level models simplify hierarchically related decision makers hdms into a centralized decision maker cdm which casts doubt on the feasibility of single level models for canal scheduling in multi level canal networks accordingly we propose a bilevel canal scheduling approach involving a pair of hdms i e an agency at the upper level and farmers at the lower level the hdms have two assignments for making decisions on canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively for comparison two traditional models are developed 1 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a 2 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a which responsible only for canal water allocation plans these models are applied to post harvest supplementary irrigation in hetao irrigation district the results show that the planned water use in the hdm 2a model is 3 81 million m3 lower than that in the cdm 2a model which is more in line with the water saving willingness of farmers furthermore we find that the cdm 2a model outperforms the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from water use plans and the cdm 1a model outperforms the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from field water demands however the better performances of the cdm 2a and cdm 1a models are achieved by making farmers water use plans exceed their real demand or depriving their decision making rights so the results of the two models cannot be realized in canal scheduling practice our findings provide new insights into the formation mechanism of the gap between theoretical canal scheduling models and practices and also provide a reference for designing irrigation water management regimes keywords canal water allocation irrigation water management hierarchical decision making optimization pareto front data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigation canal scheduling is to prepare an operational schedule for different levels of water supply canals within an institutional arrangement in which the proper flow rate and the starting and ending time of water delivery are specified for each level of canals the institutional arrangements for irrigation canal scheduling involve a set of rules and norms and the organizational structure required for the enforcement which stipulates who takes charge of the water allocation delivery metering and charging hassenforder and barone 2019 under proper institutional arrangements exact volumes of water are delivered on request to the main canals secondary canals tertiary canals etc in multi level canal networks with complex institutional arrangements irrigation canal scheduling is likely to be challenging because of multiple conflicting objectives across hierarchical levels in the canal network and many stakeholders involved such as canal management canal operators farmers and possibly environmental authorities accordingly when attempting to understand irrigation water management systems it is important to consider institutional arrangements including the hierarchical decision making framework the objectives of the decision makers involved and the conflicts among them and to accurately model the effects of institutional arrangements on irrigation performance the institutional inertia of irrigation water management the inability of institutions to formulate timely responses to crop water demand change hinders timely irrigation through efficient canal scheduling at different canal levels hence delivering the precise amount of water to a specific level of outlet at the right time requires a high degree of institutional coordination over the past few decades intensive management practices have been conducted to gradually shift irrigation water management regimes from a centralized rigid institutional arrangement to a hierarchical adaptive and inclusive regime china s administrative measures for water planning 2014 stipulate the hierarchical water management regime water users at lower levels should formulate water use plans and report them to the upper level management departments upper level departments are responsible for coordinating and balancing the water use plans of all users currently the multi level institutional arrangement is a common irrigation management practice in many large scale irrigation systems with hierarchical canal networks such as the hetao irrigation system in china the belitang irrigation system in indonesia murtiningrum 2021 the chancay lambayeque irrigation system in peru vos and vincent 2011 and the lower jhelum canal system in pakistan ghumman et al 2014 the major canals in the hetao irrigation district include three levels the general main canal the main canal and the sub main canal which are under the responsibility of three levels of management departments respectively such as the general administration of hetao irrigation district the yongji irrigation area bureau and the xile management office in the chancay lambayeque irrigation system the system management was turned over from the ministry of agriculture to the three level water users association wua in 1992 where the operation and maintenance of the main secondary and tertiary canals are undertaken by junta de usuarios comisión de regantes and comités de regantes respectively vos and vincent 2011 the multi level institutional arrangement brings out three characteristics of decision making in the irrigation system 1 a specific decision hierarchy for each decision maker 2 multiple decision makers involved and 3 multiple decision making objectives with each decision maker having its objective these hierarchical institutional arrangements undoubtedly affect the behavior of the decision makers and the effectiveness of canal scheduling therefore it is necessary to develop hierarchical irrigation canal scheduling models for better understanding the mechanism of the institutional arrangements changes that have been made all over the world mathematically identifying the effects of institutional arrangements on canal scheduling performance proposing better institutional settings for canal scheduling and bridging the gap between theoretical models and practice in canal scheduling wang et al 2020 in recent decades we have witnessed the improvement of canal scheduling models to facilitate the flexible arrangement of water delivery discharge and duration for water users especially from single objective functions to multi objective functions the optimization objectives of canal scheduling models are more diverse and complex ranging from supplying water on time and in quantity for farmers anwar and haq 2013 anwar and haq 2016 reducing the opening and closing operations of canal gates for canal operators monem and namdarian 2005 zafra cabeza et al 2011 minimizing water conveyance losses for water supply departments liu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 improving the equality and adequacy of irrigation water allocation for all water use groups fereres and soriano 2006 delgoda et al 2017 however most of the existing canal scheduling models generally integrate decision makers at different decision making levels into a single level centralized decision maker cdm and integrate objectives belonging to each independent decision maker into multiple objectives of the cdm the single level cdm modeling framework violates the hierarchical decision making structure for canal scheduling in reality although a few studies proposed hierarchical canal scheduling models based on decomposition coordination theory delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 decomposition coordination is a hierarchical method in a computational sense for single level large scale canal scheduling problems in which the subsystems decomposed from the whole canal system are the lower level the coordinator is the upper level and the objective of coordination is to satisfy the association constraints of the subsystems the hierarchy of decomposition coordination models is completely different from the hierarchy in the institutional and managerial sense which cannot reflect the leader follower relationship and interactions of involved decision makers under a hierarchical institutional framework although it is based on the hierarchical topology of the canal system the structural violation of decision making on water delivery discharge and duration in traditional single level models may lead to a significant gap between modeling research and canal scheduling practice which inevitably raises concerns about whether the traditional single level model can be used to solve the practical canal scheduling problems or whether the single level model is practical to address the limitations of traditional single level canal scheduling models we introduce bilevel programming for canal scheduling modeling bilevel programming is a prominent approach to solving an optimization problem with a hierarchical structure it is a subclass of multi level programming consisting only of the upper level as the leader and the lower level as the follower candler and townsley 1982 hu et al 2010 bilevel programming has been widely used in water management such as water allocation hu et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 wang et al 2019 reservoir operation optimization guo et al 2012 burrow and newman 2020 wang et al 2020 and flood management wang and zhang 2018 the irrigation canal scheduling can be modeled as a bilevel problem which involves two hierarchically related decision makers hdms i e the government authority agency at the upper level and water users farmers at the lower level the agency and the farmers are responsible for making canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 develop a bilevel irrigation canal scheduling model for improving the practicability of canal scheduling optimization models and 2 compare and analyze the characteristics of canal scheduling in typical management regimes and explore how the management regime affects canal scheduling hoping to provide effective decision support for irrigation water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of irrigation canals in this study the canal scheduling model is developed based on the operation pattern of major canals major canals deliver water continuously and the water discharge changes over time the water delivery process of major canals requires a decision on the water discharge for each time interval in a two level canal system fig 1 the sum of the water discharge of all the sub main canals at a time interval plus the water conveyance loss at that time interval should be equal to the water supply of the main canal therefore when optimizing the canal water delivery process of the upper and lower canals only the water discharge or water volume of the lower level canals for each time interval is required for decision making according to the available water supply the canal scheduling model will optimize the water discharge for each time interval in each sub main canal based on the objectives and constraints so as to obtain a water delivery process that adapts to the available water amount 2 2 procedure of canal scheduling this section describes the canal scheduling procedure in three typical management regimes 1 two hdms with two assignments hdm 2a in the hdm 2a regime the agency and the farmer are responsible for the two assignments of making canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively the interaction between an agency and farmers is a process of sequential decision making based on the information given by the other first the agency sends information to farmers farmers formulate their water use plans according to the agency s information and water demand regulation of fields and then pass their plans back to the agency then the agency takes a holistic view coordinates the water use plans of all farmers to maximize the economic benefits of the whole irrigation district and releases the final canal water allocation plans farmers can change their water use plans during this process and the agency re coordinates the new plans the interaction between the agency and farmers can take place several times 2 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a in the cdm 2a regime the cdm acts on behalf of the agency and the farmers to make decisions on both canal water allocation and water use plans 3 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a in the cdm 1a regime the cdm is responsible only for making the water allocation plans according to field water demand based on the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a management regimes the corresponding canal scheduling models are developed the schematic representations of hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models are shown in fig 2 2 3 establishment of canal scheduling models 2 3 1 hdm 2a canal scheduling model the proposed hdm 2a model is established based on bilevel programming bilevel programming is developed to cope with the hierarchical decision making process with two independent decision makers i e the leader at the upper level and the follower at the lower level candler and townsley 1982 hansen et al 1992 the bilevel programming reflects the right of subordinate parts of large units to find and select their own best decisions depending on the environmental data described by the upper variables posed by the management dempe 2002 in this context leaders can indirectly influence the decision region of followers by transmitting their decision information to followers but cannot interfere with the decision making behavior of followers colson et al 2007 the lower and upper levels are the inner and outer problems of bilevel programming and the lower level problem is defined as a part of the constraints of the upper problem the mathematical expression of bilevel programming is 1 min x f x y s t g x y 0 y arg min y f x y s t g x y 0 where f and f are the objective functions of the upper and lower levels respectively g and g are the sets of constraints of the upper and lower levels respectively x and y are the sets of decision variables of the upper and lower levels respectively 2 3 1 1 upper level of the hdm 2a model for the management of an irrigation district the agency is more concerned with equity of water allocation water use efficiency and water revenue the agency must allocate the limited irrigation water effectively to maximize the overall irrigation profit which requires reducing water conveyance loss so that more water can be delivered to the end of the canals besides as farmers are the end users of irrigation water the agency must also consider farmers willingness to use water to increase their satisfaction with water allocation practices therefore in this study it is assumed that the agency has two objectives minimizing the total water conveyance loss rate and minimizing the deviation between canal water allocation plans and water use plans the upper level model is subjected to the following constraints maximum water supply constraints capacity constraints total water allocation constraints and integrity constraints the mathematic expression of the upper level model is given by 2 minimize w i j f f 1 f 2 3 f 1 i 1 i j 1 j w i j p i j 2 4 f 2 l m l s l m l s i 1 i j 1 j w i j where f is the objective of the upper level model f 1 and f 2 are the normalized values of objectives f 1 and f 2 w i j is the water allocation of canal j in the i th time interval m3 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 l m is the water conveyance loss of the main canal m3 l s is the water conveyance loss of sub main canals m3 i is the total number of irrigation intervals and j is the total number of canals the water conveyance loss can be calculated with eqs 5 7 5 l m i 1 i f a u m u q i u l u δ t 6 l s i 1 i j 1 j f a j m j q i j d l j δ t 7 l f a m q l t a l q 1 m t 100 where a is the water permeability coefficient m is the water permeability index q is the canal water discharge m3 s 1 l is the length of a canal km and t is the water delivery time s the optimization of the upper level model should conform to the following constraints 1 maximum water supply constraint the maximum water supply constraint is to ensure that the sum of the required water allocation of all canals including the actual water allocation of each canal and water conveyance loss does not exceed the maximum water supply in every water delivery time interval 8 q i u q i max where q i u is the discharge of the main canal in the i th time interval m3 s 1 q i max is the discharge of the maximum water supply in the i th time interval m3 s 1 2 capacity constraint the capacity constraint ensures that the discharges of canals do not exceed their design discharges at any time interval 9 q i j d q s j where q ij d is the discharge of canal j in the i th time interval m3 q sj is the design discharge of canal j m3 s 1 3 total water allocation constraint the total water allocation for all canals should not be higher than the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period and should not be lower than the water demand 10 i 1 i j 1 j w i j w max 11 i 1 i j 1 j w i j i 1 i j 1 j d i j where w max is the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period m3 d i j is the water demand for canal j in the i th time interval m3 4 integrity constraint the integrity constraint is to ensure that each canal only contains a complete and uninterrupted water delivery process during irrigation with no significant flow fluctuation and the overall trend of a discharge hydrograph increases first and then decreases 12 q i q i 1 0 i i p e a k q i q i 1 0 i i p e a k where q i is the discharge in the i

2a model unlike the agency s focus on overall irrigation profits farmers are more concerned with individual benefits zhang et al 2019 in practice farmers water costs are highly related to their planned water use and they are interested in optimizing their water use plans to achieve better soil conditions with as little water as possible so it is necessary to reduce the deviation between the water use plan and the field water demand meanwhile since the final executable canal water allocation plans are not always the same as water use plans it is also necessary to reduce the deviation between water use plans and canal water allocation plans to achieve a higher level of water use plan implementation the lower level model is subjected to the following constraints maximum water supply constraints capacity constraints total water use constraints and integrity constraints the lower level model is mathematically expressed as follows 13 minimize p i j f f 1 f 2 14 f 1 i 1 i j 1 j p i j d i j 2 15 f 2 i 1 i j 1 j p i j w i j 2 where f is the objective of the lower level model f 1 and f 2 are the normalized values of objectives f 1 and f 2 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 d i j is the water demand for canal j in the i th time interval m3 except for the total water use constraint other constraints of the lower level model are the same as those of the upper level model the total water use constraint is to ensure that the total water use of all canals should not be higher than the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period and should not be lower than the total water demand 16 i 1 i j 1 j p i j w max 17 i 1 i j 1 j p i j i 1 i j 1 j d i j 2 3 2 cdm 2a canal scheduling model the canal scheduling model based on the cdm management regime is a single level model where the agency and farmers are represented by a cdm for comparison this study established a cdm 2a model with two objectives objective 1 is the agency s objective that is to reduce the water conveyance loss rate and reduce the deviation of canal water allocation plans from water use plans corresponding to the upper level objective of the hdm 2a model objective 2 is for farmers to reduce the deviation between water use plans and water demand plans and to reduce the deviation between water use plans and canal water allocation plans corresponding to the lower level objective of the hdm 2a model the mathematic expression of the cdm 2a model is 18 minimize f f 1 f 2 19 minimize f f 1 f 2 where f and f are the objective functions of the cdm 2a model the constraints of the cdm 2a model include all the constraints of the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model 2 3 3 cdm 1a canal scheduling model the cdm 1a model assumes that a highly centralized decision maker develops canal water allocation plans only based on field water demands without regard to farmers views on how to use irrigation water the optimization objective of the cdm 1a model is to reduce water conveyance losses and deviations of the canal water allocation plan from the water demand plan the mathematic expression of the cdm 1a model is 20 minimize z z 1 f 2 21 z 1 i 1 i j 1 j w i j d i j 2 where z is the objective function of the cdm 1a model z 1 is the normalized value of objectives z 1 the constraints of the cdm 1a model are the same as the upper level of the hdm 2a model 2 4 field water demand plan generally a field water demand plan is only related to crop soil and agrometeorological factors grashey jansen 2014 ouyang et al 2018 regardless of the amount of available water or whether the superimposition of water demand plans for all irrigated areas will cause overloading of the water supply canal in other words the field water demand plan reflects objective water demand patterns in the field but it is probably infeasible in this study the field water demand serves as a base for optimizing farmers water use plans which must be obtained before canal scheduling the target of optimizing the water demand plan is to minimize the total volume of irrigation water under the premise of meeting the suitable range of soil moisture content smc and soil salinity ss as much as possible since the field water demand plan is related to the movement of irrigation water in the soil we introduce the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989 to simulate the smc and ss at a specific date caused by random water demand plans the objective function of the water demand plan optimization model is defined as 22 minimize d i 1 i j 1 j d i j 1 m d e v 23 m d e v j 1 j s m c min s m c j s m c min j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max if s m c j s m c min j 1 j s m c j s m c max s m c max j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max if s m c j s m c max j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max otherwise where d is the objective of the water demand plan optimization model m dev is the coefficient of irrigation effects smc j is the soil moisture content of canal j at a certain time after irrigation ss j is the soil salinity of canal j at a certain time after irrigation mg l 1 smc min is the lower limit of soil moisture content smc max is the upper limit of soil moisture content ss max is the upper limit soil salinity mg l 1 the shaw model is an important module coupled in the field water demand model the shaw based water demand plan calculation steps are as follows i generate a large number of water demand plans ii input water demand plans into the shaw model to simulate soil moisture content smc and soil salinity ss at a specific date after irrigation for each water demand plan iii calculate the objective value for each water demand plan with the simulated smc and ss iv select the optimal water demand plan based on the objective values the shaw model is designed to simulate water heat and solute migration in the one dimensional soil profile under temperature variation huang et al 2006 li et al 2012 the shaw model stratifies the soil with each soil layer represented by a node the main inputs of the shaw model are initial soil moisture and temperature profiles site characteristics including simulation period location and slope of the site parameters describing snowpack canopy and residue and soil hydraulic characteristics and daily weather data the outputs of the shaw model include soil water potential water content salinity and temperature of each node from the beginning to the end of the simulation period the three governing equations of the shaw are as follows 1 heat flux governing equation 24 z k s t z ρ l c l q l z s c s t t ρ i l f θ i t l v q v z ρ v t where z is soil depth m k s is soil thermal

models 2 5 1 parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm for complex optimization canal scheduling models are non convex discontinuous and non linear so mathematical programming approaches can hardly solve it therefore we adopted a modified particle swarm optimization pso coupled with open multi processing openmp to approach the optimal solution the optimization procedure is given in fig 3 the models mentioned above contain a considerable number of variables which significantly increases the risk of the classical particle swarm optimization algorithm falling into the local optimal solution shi and eberhart 1998 so in this study the parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization psse pso jiang et al 2007 is used to solve the problem of classical pso that converges too fast at the initial stage the psse pso divides a random population into several subpopulations all the subpopulations evolved separately and then merged for the subsequent random population division the optimization will stop until the calculation reaches a specified iteration number the division and merging is an effective interference strategy to avoid the particle swarm trapping in the local optimal and force the particle swarm to move to a larger solution space open multi processing openmp is widely accepted as a standard for high level shared memory parallel programming in fortran c and c it can allocate a task to multiple threads for parallel execution to reduce the computation time users can easily construct parallel regions using statements of standard openmp to implement programming nested parallelization an mey et al 2007 for example in fortran a parallel region can be constructed by adding the statements omp parallel and omp end parallel at the beginning and end of the specified code respectively compilers that support openmp can find these statements and activate parallel operations 2 5 2 genetic algorithm ii for dual objective programming as described above the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model the cdm 2a model and the cdm 1a model all belong to dual objective programming the classical optimization method for coping with dual objective is to convert the dual objective optimization problem to a single objective optimization problem by assigning weights to two objectives however a group of weights for two objectives represents only one preference of the decision maker by changing the weights of the two objectives a set of optimal solutions known as nondominated solutions or pareto optimal solutions can be obtained for the different preferences of the decision maker the method of weighting can only obtain one particular pareto optimal solution at a time so it has to be applied many times to find multiple solutions to improve computation efficiency we adopt the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to find as many pareto optimal solutions as possible in one single run nsga was first proposed by srinivas and deb 1995 the main difference from the genetic algorithm ga is that the nsga assigns a nondomination rank to each solution except for the nondominated sorting its selection crossover and variation operators are the same as ga nsga ii improves on nsga by reducing the computational complexity introducing the elitism approach to speed up the computation and using crowding distance to obviate the need for specifying a sharing parameter deb et al 2002 the nsga ii has been shown to perform better in converging to the actual pareto front 2 6 study area and data preparation we demonstrate the proposed hdm 2a model for canal scheduling of autumn irrigation in the yongji irrigation area yongji of the hetao irrigation district hetao autumn irrigation is an annual post harvest irrigation from mid september to mid november in hetao with the purpose of leaching the salt from the soil surface and freezing a moderate amount of irrigation water in the soil so as to provide suitable smc and ss for the coming spring sowing period mid april in this case study the canal scheduling model is run for the entire autumn irrigation period i e from september 20th to november 20th and the scheduling period is divided into 12 time intervals each containing 5 days the shaw model is run from september 20th to april 15th of the following year to simulate the changes of smc and ss after irrigation and obtain the smc and ss of the spring sowing period to explore the influence of management regimes on canal scheduling the cdm 2a and the cdm 1a models are applied for comparison 2 6 1 study area inner mongolia hetao irrigation district located in the north of china hetao 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is a typical seasonal frozen soil area with a freezing period of up to six months every year autumn irrigation is a unique irrigation mode conducted in the non growth period in hetao after the autumn harvest due to the influence of temperature difference mineralized phreatic water continuously migrates and accumulates to the layer of frozen soil and the soil moisture content of the frozen layer is saturated meanwhile salt also accumulates in the frozen layer with the upward migration of water which is one of the causes of the formation of saline alkali land in hetao autumn irrigation is a significant measure conducted after harvest to leach surface salt to the bottom soil and preserve appropriate moisture in the topsoil for the growth of crops during the coming spring sowing period to model the autumn irrigation canal scheduling we choose the yongji irrigation area yongji 40 36 41 13 n 107 13 107 42 e located in the middle of hetao as our study area the backbone water delivery system of yongji consists of the yongji main canal and six sub main canals fig 4 the physical characteristic of all canals describing the location length designed capacity and irrigated area are given in table 1 2 6 2 overview of irrigation management in the hetao irrigation district canal scheduling in hetao is managed in a hierarchical way according to the level of the canals the administrative structure of hetao consists of the general administration of irrigation district the irrigation area bureau the management office and the management section which are responsible for the canal scheduling tasks of the general main canal main canals sub main canals and field canals respectively the general administration allocates the water quotas for each irrigation area according to the water allocated by the inner mongolia autonomous region and the established allocation ratio of the irrigation area the bureau then allocates the water quota to the management offices within its jurisdiction and subsequently the office allocates the water quota to sections after water quotas are sent from top to bottom water plans are drawn up from the lowest level and passed back in turn from bottom to top finally the approved water use plans i e canal water allocation plans are released from top to bottom the multi level regime for water management in hetao is illustrated in fig 5 2 6 3 data preparation 2 6 3 1 shaw model data the shaw model simulated the period from the beginning of autumn irrigation to the spring sowing of the following year from september 20th to april 15th of the following year the essential input data for the shaw model include 1 general information about the simulated site location and slope of the site number of nodes parameters describing snowpack canopy and residue 2 soil soil related parameters soil particle composition soil bulk density soil hydraulic characteristics and initial soil moisture and temperature profiles 3 daily or hourly meteorological data temperature wind speed humidity precipitation and solar radiation we used the meteorological data with daily time steps collected at the linhe station near bayan nur city as the input of the shaw model snow cover was not taken into account as the snow was scarce during the simulation period besides since the ground is exposed after the autumn harvest canopy and residue are not considered soil textures of the areas irrigated by the six sub main canals were tested before autumn irrigation the soil samples from 5 depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm were drilled to measure the soil bulk density particle composition and soil water content the soil temperature profiles were measured by inserting thermocouples into the five soil layers since the soil hydraulic characteristics saturated conductivity k s air entry potential φ e and pore size allocation index b are difficult to measure directly these soil parameters were first estimated with the campbell empirical equation campbell and shiozawa 1992 based on the soil bulk density and particle composition then these soil parameters were optimized with the observed data of soil water and salt dynamics during the freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2001 the optimized soil hydraulic characteristics were validated by the observed water and salt dynamic data from 2001 to 2002 the simulated values of the shaw model were compared with the measured values using the relative root mean square error rmse the rmse of smc is from 0 016 to 0 058 and the rmse of ss is from 0 008 to 0 031 mol kg 1 the shaw model shows higher accuracy in its simulation of smc regarding ss except for the surface salinity during the thawing period the difference between the simulated and measured salinity is acceptable 2 6 3 2 data for canal scheduling optimization in this study canal scheduling involves the agency and the farmer as two independent decision makers and each decision maker has two objectives the optimal solution of the canal scheduling model is not unique with the change of decision makers preferences for their two objectives the non uniqueness makes it difficult to compare the decision making characteristics and application performances of hierarchical and centralized canal scheduling models in this regard it is more important to focus on the competition between the agency and the farmer in hierarchical and centralized decision making frameworks rather than between the agency s or farmers own two objectives therefore to avoid non uniqueness one of the most typical scenarios in practice is chosen to optimize the water allocation plan and the water use plan in which the weights of the two objectives of the agency and the farmer are set to be equal before running the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models the field water demand plan must be calculated using the model developed in section 2 4 and the total water demand is 234 6 million m3 in addition the total water availability in the three models is set to 256 1 million m3 with reference to the actual autumn irrigation situation in yongji 3 results the hdm 2a model and the cdm 2a model are developed based on a hierarchical and centralized management regime respectively except for the management regime the two models share the same optimization objectives decision variables and constraints in this section the canal scheduling performances in hierarchical and centralized management regimes are compared in terms of the water allocation and water use plans of the hdm 2a model and the cdm 2a model and the optimal interests of the involved decision makers 3 1 comparison of water allocation and planned water use in hierarchical and centralized models compared with the hdm 2a model better canal water allocation performance can be found with the cdm 2a model as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the difference between the total amount of water allocation and planned water use of the cdm 2a model is lower and the coefficient of determination between the water allocation plan and the water use plan r a u 2 is higher compared to the hdm 2a model the difference between the total amount of planned water use and water allocation of the cdm 2a model is 6 46 million m3 while that of the hdm 2a model is 10 53 million m3 the r a u 2 of the cdm 2a model is 0 996 while the latter is 0 981 the time series of water allocation and water use plans are depicted in fig 7a b however the better water allocation performance of the cdm 2a regime in reducing the difference between water allocation and planned water use is realized by depriving farmers right to make water use plans the total amount of water use specified by the cdm 2a model actually significantly deviates from the water use plans made by farmers the planned water use of the cdm 2a model is 3 81 million m3 higher than that of the hdm 2a model and the gap with the field water demand is even more significant as seen in fig 6 the difference between total planned water use and total demand of the cdm 2a model is 13 76 million m3 higher than that of the hdm 2a model 9 94 million m3 on the other hand the water use plan of the cdm 2a model is less correlated with the field water demand plan as shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination between the water use plan and the water demand plan r u d 2 of the cdm 2a model is 0 969 lower than that of the hdm 2a model 0 975 the time series of water use and water demand plans of the six sub main canals are depicted in fig 8a b 3 2 optimal interests for decision makers in hierarchical and centralized models as mentioned above the cdm 2a model allows for smaller deviations between water allocation and water use plans which facilitates decision makers to achieve higher interests as shown in fig 9a b f and f represent the objective values for the agency and farmers respectively and the smaller the objective values the higher the interests of decision makers point a in fig 9a b represents the optimal objective values of the hdm 2a model and point b represents the optimal objective values of the cdm 2a model under the specified weights obviously point b dominates point a i e point b is superior to point a in terms of both the agency s and the farmers objectives for points a and b the canal water allocation performance is mainly influenced by deviations between the water allocation and water use plans as the difference in loss rates arising from the water allocation plans of the hdm 2a and cdm 2a models is slight at 5 45 and 5 60 respectively see table 2 however the better objective values obtained by the cdm 2a model are an exaggeration of the achievable results in practice the cdm 2a model s exaggeration of decision makers objective value is not limited to the equally weighted preference setting i e point b fig 9a shows the pareto front pf of the cdm 2a model blue dots on the pf of the cdm 2a model from point u to point v the weight of the agency s objective gradually increases and the weight of the farmer s objective gradually decreases to explore the exaggeration more scenarios are analyzed as shown in fig 9a points p and p q and q r and r s and s v and v are five pairs of cdm 2a and hdm 2a solutions each of which shares the same value of farmers benefit the cdm 2a model increases the agency benefits compared to the hdm 2a model in all five cases taking points s and s as an example the water allocation and water use plans for the two points are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively it can be seen that the cdm 2a model s allocation plan is more consistent with the water use plan the blue areas in fig 10 are smaller and the hdm 2a model s allocation plan deviates more from the water use plan the blue areas in fig 11 are larger wang et al 2020 also found that simplifying a hierarchical decision making framework with a cdm 2a regime may exaggerate the objective values of decision makers shafiee jood et al 2018 pointed out that what makes hdm 2a results inferior to those of cdm 2a is the cost necessary to obtain a more realistic solution to a hierarchical decision problem therefore despite the better water allocation performance of the cdm 2a model only the results of the hdm 2a model can be achieved in the canal scheduling practice 4 discussion this section discusses the canal scheduling characteristics in different management regimes based on the optimization results of the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models both the hdm 2a and cdm 2a regimes consider the role of involved decision makers and the following part first compares the competition of decision makers in the hdm 2a and cdm 2a regimes then the strengths and weaknesses of the cdm 1a regime are discussed 4 1 differences in the competition between decision makers under the hdm 2a regime and the cdm 2a regime in the cdm 2a regime there is a broader competition space between the objective of the agency and the objective of farmers the blue shaded area marked with the pf in fig 9b shows the competition space between the agency and farmers in the cdm 2a regime where the agency s objective values range from 0 62 to 0 76 and farmers objective values range from 0 017 to 0 29 the red points in fig 9b are the feasible objective values of the hdm 2a model and the envelope of feasible values red dashed line in fig 9b is the pf of the hdm 2a model according to the pf the competition space of the hdm 2a model pink shaded area is depicted in fig 9b as can be seen the competition space between the agency and farmers in the hdm 2a regime is significantly narrowed with the agency s objective values varying from 0 67 to 0 673 and farmers objective values varying from 0 036 to 0 057 the broader competition space of the cdm 2a regime is due to the wide range of variations in the weights of the centralized decision maker for the two stakeholders objectives from point u to point v the weight of the agency s objective increases from 0 to 1 and the weight of the farmers objective decreases from 1 to 0 however the hdm 2a regime requires farmers to obey the agency which fundamentally negates the possibility of farmers objective being weighted close to 1 besides in the hdm 2a regime farmers also have the decision making right to report their own water use plans which means farmers objective cannot be weighted close to 0 either moreover the cdm 2a regime presents a strong or weak competitive relationship as the weight of the centralized decision maker changes between the two stakeholders objectives whereas only relatively weak competition exists in the hdm 2a regime the competitive relationships implied by segments u c and d v are nonexistent for the hdm 2a regime for example in segment d v a slight improvement in the objective value of the agency is brought about at the considerable expense of the benefits of farmers for every 1 increase in the objective value of the agency the objective value of farmers will reduce by 12 84 such a competitive relationship obviously negates the farmer s decision making right similarly in segment u c for every 1 increase in the objective value of farmers the objective value of the agency will reduce by 21 74 which negates the agency s position as the leader in water allocation the hdm 2a regime emphasizes decision making rights and hierarchy so the pf of the hdm 2a model shrinks to a smaller range segment a z in segment a z the competition between decision makers is weaker and for every 1 reduction in the objective value of farmers the objective value of the agency increases by only 0 3 in summary compared with the cdm 2a regime the competition space for decision makers is narrower and the competitive relationship between the agency and the farmers is relatively weak in the hdm 2a regime this is because the hierarchical institution must consider the two necessary conditions of farmers independent decision making rights and their decision making rights being lower than that of the agency 4 2 characteristics of canal water allocation in the cdm 1a regime the cdm 1a model does not consider the water use plan and directly optimizes the water allocation plan to meet the field water demand plan and reduce water conveyance losses the simplicity of the cdm 1a model structure and the lower complexity of the objectives make the cdm 1a model perform no worse than the hdm 2a and cdm 2a models on certain optimization metrics as shown in fig 6 the water allocation of the cdm 1a model is closest to the water demand with a difference of 8 58 million m3 the water allocation plan of the cdm 1a model is the most consistent with the water demand plan as shown by the highest coefficients of determination between the water allocation plan and the water demand plan r a d 2 see table 2 in terms of reducing the water conveyance loss rate the cdm 1a model performs better in reducing the loss rate than the cdm 2a model and is only slightly inferior to the hdm 2a model see table 2 considering water use plans or the decision making attributes of water users will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the institutional arrangements compared with the highly centralized cdm 1a regime this institutional complexity may bring about the side effect of reducing water management efficiency wallis and ison 2011 however this does not mean that the cdm 1a regime is worth adopting on the contrary as the decentralization and complexity of contemporary water management systems have already formed it is difficult for the cdm 1a regime to adapt to such realities for example the cdm 1a regime is subject to information asymmetries as direct users of water farmers are naturally more experienced in obtaining information on field water demand such as the planting structure soil texture and agrometeorological conditions zhou et al 2021 in contrast managers must invest in obtaining demand information of all farmers which is inefficient and time consuming especially in complex multi level canal networks 4 3 implication and limitation this study extends knowledge to the formation mechanism of the gap between theoretical canal scheduling models and practices induced by the institutional arrangements changes it opens new paths toward mathematically identifying the effects of institutional arrangements on canal scheduling performance through a hierarchical canal scheduling model that matches the hierarchical management of the canal system which can be helpful for designing better irrigation water management institutions still some concerns need further research firstly as this study mainly focuses on the decision making features of three typical management regimes the non uniqueness of the optimal solution of the hdm 2a model is not mentioned the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model are dual objective problems for any upper level variable the lower level model calculates the corresponding pareto optimal solutions that is the lower level optimal solution will change as the preference of the lower level decision maker for the two objectives changes which means that the lower level decision maker may choose a solution that is favorable or unfavorable to the upper level decision maker by the same token the optimal solution of the upper level model is not unique as well the non uniqueness of the solutions of the upper and lower models suggests that there is space for cooperation between leaders and followers how to quantify the cooperation space of decision makers and how to promote their willingness to cooperate remains to be further explored secondly the proposed hdm 2a model is a one leader one follower bilevel water allocation model which implicitly assumes that the water use plans of the six farmers at the lower level are determined by a farmer representative rather than a multi follower model that directly considers the water using behavior of involved farmers in general farmers water using behavior is influenced by economic motivations i e the economic benefits of water use directly determine their water use plans wang et al 2008 water users usually have different payoffs from water use due to differences in soil texture and planting structure accordingly when water users are independent decision makers they are naturally driven by economic benefits to trade water to make more efficient use of water for the whole irrigation district so further research is needed to explore the interaction of water users in a multi follower bilevel framework 5 conclusions to improve the practicality of the canal scheduling model a novel canal scheduling model based on bilevel programming is proposed in this study which involves two hierarchically related decision makers hdms the hdms the agency and farmers have two assignments hdm 2a for making decisions on canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively furthermore two traditional models based on a centralized decision maker cdm are developed for comparison 1 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a 2 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a which responsible only for canal water allocation plans the comparison indicated two major differences firstly the hdm 2a model effectively reduce the planned water use of lower level decision makers farmers by 381 m3 compared to the cdm 2a model although the cdm 2a model and the cdm 1a model outperform the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from water use plans and the deviation of water allocation plans from field water demands the better performances of the two models are achieved by making farmers planned water use exceed their actual demand or by taking away their decision making rights therefore the results of the two cdm models cannot be realized in canal scheduling practice secondly the hdm 2a model successfully reflects the fact there is only a weak competitive relationship between farmers and the agency due to their independent decision making rights and specific hierarchy while the cdm 2a model exaggerates the competitive relationship between the two decision makers objectives which means a slight increase in the objective value of the agency farmers can be achieved at the considerable expense of farmers the agency s interest this study provides a more reasonable method for canal scheduling under hierarchical institutional arrangement which is helpful for designing better irrigation water management

8901,well structured institutional arrangements for irrigation canal scheduling facilitate the implementation of integrated water governance however there is a structural mismatch between the actual hierarchical institutional arrangements of canal scheduling and the traditional single level canal scheduling models single level models simplify hierarchically related decision makers hdms into a centralized decision maker cdm which casts doubt on the feasibility of single level models for canal scheduling in multi level canal networks accordingly we propose a bilevel canal scheduling approach involving a pair of hdms i e an agency at the upper level and farmers at the lower level the hdms have two assignments for making decisions on canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively for comparison two traditional models are developed 1 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a 2 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a which responsible only for canal water allocation plans these models are applied to post harvest supplementary irrigation in hetao irrigation district the results show that the planned water use in the hdm 2a model is 3 81 million m3 lower than that in the cdm 2a model which is more in line with the water saving willingness of farmers furthermore we find that the cdm 2a model outperforms the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from water use plans and the cdm 1a model outperforms the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from field water demands however the better performances of the cdm 2a and cdm 1a models are achieved by making farmers water use plans exceed their real demand or depriving their decision making rights so the results of the two models cannot be realized in canal scheduling practice our findings provide new insights into the formation mechanism of the gap between theoretical canal scheduling models and practices and also provide a reference for designing irrigation water management regimes keywords canal water allocation irrigation water management hierarchical decision making optimization pareto front data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigation canal scheduling is to prepare an operational schedule for different levels of water supply canals within an institutional arrangement in which the proper flow rate and the starting and ending time of water delivery are specified for each level of canals the institutional arrangements for irrigation canal scheduling involve a set of rules and norms and the organizational structure required for the enforcement which stipulates who takes charge of the water allocation delivery metering and charging hassenforder and barone 2019 under proper institutional arrangements exact volumes of water are delivered on request to the main canals secondary canals tertiary canals etc in multi level canal networks with complex institutional arrangements irrigation canal scheduling is likely to be challenging because of multiple conflicting objectives across hierarchical levels in the canal network and many stakeholders involved such as canal management canal operators farmers and possibly environmental authorities accordingly when attempting to understand irrigation water management systems it is important to consider institutional arrangements including the hierarchical decision making framework the objectives of the decision makers involved and the conflicts among them and to accurately model the effects of institutional arrangements on irrigation performance the institutional inertia of irrigation water management the inability of institutions to formulate timely responses to crop water demand change hinders timely irrigation through efficient canal scheduling at different canal levels hence delivering the precise amount of water to a specific level of outlet at the right time requires a high degree of institutional coordination over the past few decades intensive management practices have been conducted to gradually shift irrigation water management regimes from a centralized rigid institutional arrangement to a hierarchical adaptive and inclusive regime china s administrative measures for water planning 2014 stipulate the hierarchical water management regime water users at lower levels should formulate water use plans and report them to the upper level management departments upper level departments are responsible for coordinating and balancing the water use plans of all users currently the multi level institutional arrangement is a common irrigation management practice in many large scale irrigation systems with hierarchical canal networks such as the hetao irrigation system in china the belitang irrigation system in indonesia murtiningrum 2021 the chancay lambayeque irrigation system in peru vos and vincent 2011 and the lower jhelum canal system in pakistan ghumman et al 2014 the major canals in the hetao irrigation district include three levels the general main canal the main canal and the sub main canal which are under the responsibility of three levels of management departments respectively such as the general administration of hetao irrigation district the yongji irrigation area bureau and the xile management office in the chancay lambayeque irrigation system the system management was turned over from the ministry of agriculture to the three level water users association wua in 1992 where the operation and maintenance of the main secondary and tertiary canals are undertaken by junta de usuarios comisión de regantes and comités de regantes respectively vos and vincent 2011 the multi level institutional arrangement brings out three characteristics of decision making in the irrigation system 1 a specific decision hierarchy for each decision maker 2 multiple decision makers involved and 3 multiple decision making objectives with each decision maker having its objective these hierarchical institutional arrangements undoubtedly affect the behavior of the decision makers and the effectiveness of canal scheduling therefore it is necessary to develop hierarchical irrigation canal scheduling models for better understanding the mechanism of the institutional arrangements changes that have been made all over the world mathematically identifying the effects of institutional arrangements on canal scheduling performance proposing better institutional settings for canal scheduling and bridging the gap between theoretical models and practice in canal scheduling wang et al 2020 in recent decades we have witnessed the improvement of canal scheduling models to facilitate the flexible arrangement of water delivery discharge and duration for water users especially from single objective functions to multi objective functions the optimization objectives of canal scheduling models are more diverse and complex ranging from supplying water on time and in quantity for farmers anwar and haq 2013 anwar and haq 2016 reducing the opening and closing operations of canal gates for canal operators monem and namdarian 2005 zafra cabeza et al 2011 minimizing water conveyance losses for water supply departments liu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 improving the equality and adequacy of irrigation water allocation for all water use groups fereres and soriano 2006 delgoda et al 2017 however most of the existing canal scheduling models generally integrate decision makers at different decision making levels into a single level centralized decision maker cdm and integrate objectives belonging to each independent decision maker into multiple objectives of the cdm the single level cdm modeling framework violates the hierarchical decision making structure for canal scheduling in reality although a few studies proposed hierarchical canal scheduling models based on decomposition coordination theory delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 decomposition coordination is a hierarchical method in a computational sense for single level large scale canal scheduling problems in which the subsystems decomposed from the whole canal system are the lower level the coordinator is the upper level and the objective of coordination is to satisfy the association constraints of the subsystems the hierarchy of decomposition coordination models is completely different from the hierarchy in the institutional and managerial sense which cannot reflect the leader follower relationship and interactions of involved decision makers under a hierarchical institutional framework although it is based on the hierarchical topology of the canal system the structural violation of decision making on water delivery discharge and duration in traditional single level models may lead to a significant gap between modeling research and canal scheduling practice which inevitably raises concerns about whether the traditional single level model can be used to solve the practical canal scheduling problems or whether the single level model is practical to address the limitations of traditional single level canal scheduling models we introduce bilevel programming for canal scheduling modeling bilevel programming is a prominent approach to solving an optimization problem with a hierarchical structure it is a subclass of multi level programming consisting only of the upper level as the leader and the lower level as the follower candler and townsley 1982 hu et al 2010 bilevel programming has been widely used in water management such as water allocation hu et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 wang et al 2019 reservoir operation optimization guo et al 2012 burrow and newman 2020 wang et al 2020 and flood management wang and zhang 2018 the irrigation canal scheduling can be modeled as a bilevel problem which involves two hierarchically related decision makers hdms i e the government authority agency at the upper level and water users farmers at the lower level the agency and the farmers are responsible for making canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 develop a bilevel irrigation canal scheduling model for improving the practicability of canal scheduling optimization models and 2 compare and analyze the characteristics of canal scheduling in typical management regimes and explore how the management regime affects canal scheduling hoping to provide effective decision support for irrigation water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of irrigation canals in this study the canal scheduling model is developed based on the operation pattern of major canals major canals deliver water continuously and the water discharge changes over time the water delivery process of major canals requires a decision on the water discharge for each time interval in a two level canal system fig 1 the sum of the water discharge of all the sub main canals at a time interval plus the water conveyance loss at that time interval should be equal to the water supply of the main canal therefore when optimizing the canal water delivery process of the upper and lower canals only the water discharge or water volume of the lower level canals for each time interval is required for decision making according to the available water supply the canal scheduling model will optimize the water discharge for each time interval in each sub main canal based on the objectives and constraints so as to obtain a water delivery process that adapts to the available water amount 2 2 procedure of canal scheduling this section describes the canal scheduling procedure in three typical management regimes 1 two hdms with two assignments hdm 2a in the hdm 2a regime the agency and the farmer are responsible for the two assignments of making canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively the interaction between an agency and farmers is a process of sequential decision making based on the information given by the other first the agency sends information to farmers farmers formulate their water use plans according to the agency s information and water demand regulation of fields and then pass their plans back to the agency then the agency takes a holistic view coordinates the water use plans of all farmers to maximize the economic benefits of the whole irrigation district and releases the final canal water allocation plans farmers can change their water use plans during this process and the agency re coordinates the new plans the interaction between the agency and farmers can take place several times 2 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a in the cdm 2a regime the cdm acts on behalf of the agency and the farmers to make decisions on both canal water allocation and water use plans 3 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a in the cdm 1a regime the cdm is responsible only for making the water allocation plans according to field water demand based on the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a management regimes the corresponding canal scheduling models are developed the schematic representations of hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models are shown in fig 2 2 3 establishment of canal scheduling models 2 3 1 hdm 2a canal scheduling model the proposed hdm 2a model is established based on bilevel programming bilevel programming is developed to cope with the hierarchical decision making process with two independent decision makers i e the leader at the upper level and the follower at the lower level candler and townsley 1982 hansen et al 1992 the bilevel programming reflects the right of subordinate parts of large units to find and select their own best decisions depending on the environmental data described by the upper variables posed by the management dempe 2002 in this context leaders can indirectly influence the decision region of followers by transmitting their decision information to followers but cannot interfere with the decision making behavior of followers colson et al 2007 the lower and upper levels are the inner and outer problems of bilevel programming and the lower level problem is defined as a part of the constraints of the upper problem the mathematical expression of bilevel programming is 1 min x f x y s t g x y 0 y arg min y f x y s t g x y 0 where f and f are the objective functions of the upper and lower levels respectively g and g are the sets of constraints of the upper and lower levels respectively x and y are the sets of decision variables of the upper and lower levels respectively 2 3 1 1 upper level of the hdm 2a model for the management of an irrigation district the agency is more concerned with equity of water allocation water use efficiency and water revenue the agency must allocate the limited irrigation water effectively to maximize the overall irrigation profit which requires reducing water conveyance loss so that more water can be delivered to the end of the canals besides as farmers are the end users of irrigation water the agency must also consider farmers willingness to use water to increase their satisfaction with water allocation practices therefore in this study it is assumed that the agency has two objectives minimizing the total water conveyance loss rate and minimizing the deviation between canal water allocation plans and water use plans the upper level model is subjected to the following constraints maximum water supply constraints capacity constraints total water allocation constraints and integrity constraints the mathematic expression of the upper level model is given by 2 minimize w i j f f 1 f 2 3 f 1 i 1 i j 1 j w i j p i j 2 4 f 2 l m l s l m l s i 1 i j 1 j w i j where f is the objective of the upper level model f 1 and f 2 are the normalized values of objectives f 1 and f 2 w i j is the water allocation of canal j in the i th time interval m3 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 l m is the water conveyance loss of the main canal m3 l s is the water conveyance loss of sub main canals m3 i is the total number of irrigation intervals and j is the total number of canals the water conveyance loss can be calculated with eqs 5 7 5 l m i 1 i f a u m u q i u l u δ t 6 l s i 1 i j 1 j f a j m j q i j d l j δ t 7 l f a m q l t a l q 1 m t 100 where a is the water permeability coefficient m is the water permeability index q is the canal water discharge m3 s 1 l is the length of a canal km and t is the water delivery time s the optimization of the upper level model should conform to the following constraints 1 maximum water supply constraint the maximum water supply constraint is to ensure that the sum of the required water allocation of all canals including the actual water allocation of each canal and water conveyance loss does not exceed the maximum water supply in every water delivery time interval 8 q i u q i max where q i u is the discharge of the main canal in the i th time interval m3 s 1 q i max is the discharge of the maximum water supply in the i th time interval m3 s 1 2 capacity constraint the capacity constraint ensures that the discharges of canals do not exceed their design discharges at any time interval 9 q i j d q s j where q ij d is the discharge of canal j in the i th time interval m3 q sj is the design discharge of canal j m3 s 1 3 total water allocation constraint the total water allocation for all canals should not be higher than the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period and should not be lower than the water demand 10 i 1 i j 1 j w i j w max 11 i 1 i j 1 j w i j i 1 i j 1 j d i j where w max is the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period m3 d i j is the water demand for canal j in the i th time interval m3 4 integrity constraint the integrity constraint is to ensure that each canal only contains a complete and uninterrupted water delivery process during irrigation with no significant flow fluctuation and the overall trend of a discharge hydrograph increases first and then decreases 12 q i q i 1 0 i i p e a k q i q i 1 0 i i p e a k where q i is the discharge in the i th time interval m3 s 1 i peak is the serial number of the time interval with the largest water discharge 2 3 1 2 lower level of the hdm 2a model farmers are the lower level decision maker of the hdm 2a model unlike the agency s focus on overall irrigation profits farmers are more concerned with individual benefits zhang et al 2019 in practice farmers water costs are highly related to their planned water use and they are interested in optimizing their water use plans to achieve better soil conditions with as little water as possible so it is necessary to reduce the deviation between the water use plan and the field water demand meanwhile since the final executable canal water allocation plans are not always the same as water use plans it is also necessary to reduce the deviation between water use plans and canal water allocation plans to achieve a higher level of water use plan implementation the lower level model is subjected to the following constraints maximum water supply constraints capacity constraints total water use constraints and integrity constraints the lower level model is mathematically expressed as follows 13 minimize p i j f f 1 f 2 14 f 1 i 1 i j 1 j p i j d i j 2 15 f 2 i 1 i j 1 j p i j w i j 2 where f is the objective of the lower level model f 1 and f 2 are the normalized values of objectives f 1 and f 2 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 p i j is the planned water use of canal j in the i th time interval m3 d i j is the water demand for canal j in the i th time interval m3 except for the total water use constraint other constraints of the lower level model are the same as those of the upper level model the total water use constraint is to ensure that the total water use of all canals should not be higher than the amount of water available for the entire irrigation period and should not be lower than the total water demand 16 i 1 i j 1 j p i j w max 17 i 1 i j 1 j p i j i 1 i j 1 j d i j 2 3 2 cdm 2a canal scheduling model the canal scheduling model based on the cdm management regime is a single level model where the agency and farmers are represented by a cdm for comparison this study established a cdm 2a model with two objectives objective 1 is the agency s objective that is to reduce the water conveyance loss rate and reduce the deviation of canal water allocation plans from water use plans corresponding to the upper level objective of the hdm 2a model objective 2 is for farmers to reduce the deviation between water use plans and water demand plans and to reduce the deviation between water use plans and canal water allocation plans corresponding to the lower level objective of the hdm 2a model the mathematic expression of the cdm 2a model is 18 minimize f f 1 f 2 19 minimize f f 1 f 2 where f and f are the objective functions of the cdm 2a model the constraints of the cdm 2a model include all the constraints of the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model 2 3 3 cdm 1a canal scheduling model the cdm 1a model assumes that a highly centralized decision maker develops canal water allocation plans only based on field water demands without regard to farmers views on how to use irrigation water the optimization objective of the cdm 1a model is to reduce water conveyance losses and deviations of the canal water allocation plan from the water demand plan the mathematic expression of the cdm 1a model is 20 minimize z z 1 f 2 21 z 1 i 1 i j 1 j w i j d i j 2 where z is the objective function of the cdm 1a model z 1 is the normalized value of objectives z 1 the constraints of the cdm 1a model are the same as the upper level of the hdm 2a model 2 4 field water demand plan generally a field water demand plan is only related to crop soil and agrometeorological factors grashey jansen 2014 ouyang et al 2018 regardless of the amount of available water or whether the superimposition of water demand plans for all irrigated areas will cause overloading of the water supply canal in other words the field water demand plan reflects objective water demand patterns in the field but it is probably infeasible in this study the field water demand serves as a base for optimizing farmers water use plans which must be obtained before canal scheduling the target of optimizing the water demand plan is to minimize the total volume of irrigation water under the premise of meeting the suitable range of soil moisture content smc and soil salinity ss as much as possible since the field water demand plan is related to the movement of irrigation water in the soil we introduce the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989 to simulate the smc and ss at a specific date caused by random water demand plans the objective function of the water demand plan optimization model is defined as 22 minimize d i 1 i j 1 j d i j 1 m d e v 23 m d e v j 1 j s m c min s m c j s m c min j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max if s m c j s m c min j 1 j s m c j s m c max s m c max j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max if s m c j s m c max j 1 j max s s j s s max 0 s s max otherwise where d is the objective of the water demand plan optimization model m dev is the coefficient of irrigation effects smc j is the soil moisture content of canal j at a certain time after irrigation ss j is the soil salinity of canal j at a certain time after irrigation mg l 1 smc min is the lower limit of soil moisture content smc max is the upper limit of soil moisture content ss max is the upper limit soil salinity mg l 1 the shaw model is an important module coupled in the field water demand model the shaw based water demand plan calculation steps are as follows i generate a large number of water demand plans ii input water demand plans into the shaw model to simulate soil moisture content smc and soil salinity ss at a specific date after irrigation for each water demand plan iii calculate the objective value for each water demand plan with the simulated smc and ss iv select the optimal water demand plan based on the objective values the shaw model is designed to simulate water heat and solute migration in the one dimensional soil profile under temperature variation huang et al 2006 li et al 2012 the shaw model stratifies the soil with each soil layer represented by a node the main inputs of the shaw model are initial soil moisture and temperature profiles site characteristics including simulation period location and slope of the site parameters describing snowpack canopy and residue and soil hydraulic characteristics and daily weather data the outputs of the shaw model include soil water potential water content salinity and temperature of each node from the beginning to the end of the simulation period the three governing equations of the shaw are as follows 1 heat flux governing equation 24 z k s t z ρ l c l q l z s c s t t ρ i l f θ i t l v q v z ρ v t where z is soil depth m k s is soil thermal conductivity w m 1c 1 t is soil temperature c ρ l is the density of water kg m 3 c l is the specific heat capacity of water j kg 1 c 1 q l is the liquid water flux m s 1 c s is the volumetric heat capacity j kg 1 c 1 t is the time s ρ i is the density of ice kg m 3 l f is the latent heat of freezing j kg 1 θ i is the volumetric ice content m3 m 3 q v is the water vapor flux kg m 2s 1 ρ v is the vapor density kg m 3 2 water flux governing equation 25 θ l t ρ i ρ l θ i t z k ψ z 1 1 ρ l q v z u where k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 ψ is soil matric potential m θ l is volumetric

solution mol kg 1 v is a term of soil degradation and root absorption based on the simulation of the shaw model the smc j and ss j at a specific time after irrigation are mathematically expressed as 27 s m c j f θ i θ l 28 s s j f s optimizing the water demand plan is only restricted to capacity and integrity constraints without considering the maximum water supply 2 5 solution techniques to the models 2 5 1 parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm for complex optimization canal scheduling models are non convex discontinuous and non linear so mathematical programming approaches can hardly solve it therefore we adopted a modified particle swarm optimization pso coupled with open multi processing openmp to approach the optimal solution the optimization procedure is given in fig 3 the models mentioned above contain a considerable number of variables which significantly increases the risk of the classical particle swarm optimization algorithm falling into the local optimal solution shi and eberhart 1998 so in this study the parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization psse pso jiang et al 2007 is used to solve the problem of classical pso that converges too fast at the initial stage the psse pso divides a random population into several subpopulations all the subpopulations evolved separately and then merged for the subsequent random population division the optimization will stop until the calculation reaches a specified iteration number the division and merging is an effective interference strategy to avoid the particle swarm trapping in the local optimal and force the particle swarm to move to a larger solution space open multi processing openmp is widely accepted as a standard for high level shared memory parallel programming in fortran c and c it can allocate a task to multiple threads for parallel execution to reduce the computation time users can easily construct parallel regions using statements of standard openmp to implement programming nested parallelization an mey et al 2007 for example in fortran a parallel region can be constructed by adding the statements omp parallel and omp end parallel at the beginning and end of the specified code respectively compilers that support openmp can find these statements and activate parallel operations 2 5 2 genetic algorithm ii for dual objective programming as described above the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model the cdm 2a model and the cdm 1a model all belong to dual objective programming the classical optimization method for coping with dual objective is to convert the dual objective optimization problem to a single objective optimization problem by assigning weights to two objectives however a group of weights for two objectives represents only one preference of the decision maker by changing the weights of the two objectives a set of optimal solutions known as nondominated solutions or pareto optimal solutions can be obtained for the different preferences of the decision maker the method of weighting can only obtain one particular pareto optimal solution at a time so it has to be applied many times to find multiple solutions to improve computation efficiency we adopt the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to find as many pareto optimal solutions as possible in one single run nsga was first proposed by srinivas and deb 1995 the main difference from the genetic algorithm ga is that the nsga assigns a nondomination rank to each solution except for the nondominated sorting its selection crossover and variation operators are the same as ga nsga ii improves on nsga by reducing the computational complexity introducing the elitism approach to speed up the computation and using crowding distance to obviate the need for specifying a sharing parameter deb et al 2002 the nsga ii has been shown to perform better in converging to the actual pareto front 2 6 study area and data preparation we demonstrate the proposed hdm 2a model for canal scheduling of autumn irrigation in the yongji irrigation area yongji of the hetao irrigation district hetao autumn irrigation is an annual post harvest irrigation from mid september to mid november in hetao with the purpose of leaching the salt from the soil surface and freezing a moderate amount of irrigation water in the soil so as to provide suitable smc and ss for the coming spring sowing period mid april in this case study the canal scheduling model is run for the entire autumn irrigation period i e from september 20th to november 20th and the scheduling period is divided into 12 time intervals each containing 5 days the shaw model is run from september 20th to april 15th of the following year to simulate the changes of smc and ss after irrigation and obtain the smc and ss of the spring sowing period to explore the influence of management regimes on canal scheduling the cdm 2a and the cdm 1a models are applied for comparison 2 6 1 study area inner mongolia hetao irrigation district located in the north of china hetao 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is a typical seasonal frozen soil area with a freezing period of up to six months every year autumn irrigation is a unique irrigation mode conducted in the non growth period in hetao after the autumn harvest due to the influence of temperature difference mineralized phreatic water continuously migrates and accumulates to the layer of frozen soil and the soil moisture content of the frozen layer is saturated meanwhile salt also accumulates in the frozen layer with the upward migration of water which is one of the causes of the formation of saline alkali land in hetao autumn irrigation is a significant measure conducted after harvest to leach surface salt to the bottom soil and preserve appropriate moisture in the topsoil for the growth of crops during the coming spring sowing period to model the autumn irrigation canal scheduling we choose the yongji irrigation area yongji 40 36 41 13 n 107 13 107 42 e located in the middle of hetao as our study area the backbone water delivery system of yongji consists of the yongji main canal and six sub main canals fig 4 the physical characteristic of all canals describing the location length designed capacity and irrigated area are given in table 1 2 6 2 overview of irrigation management in the hetao irrigation district canal scheduling in hetao is managed in a hierarchical way according to the level of the canals the administrative structure of hetao consists of the general administration of irrigation district the irrigation area bureau the management office and the management section which are responsible for the canal scheduling tasks of the general main canal main canals sub main canals and field canals respectively the general administration allocates the water quotas for each irrigation area according to the water allocated by the inner mongolia autonomous region and the established allocation ratio of the irrigation area the bureau then allocates the water quota to the management offices within its jurisdiction and subsequently the office allocates the water quota to sections after water quotas are sent from top to bottom water plans are drawn up from the lowest level and passed back in turn from bottom to top finally the approved water use plans i e canal water allocation plans are released from top to bottom the multi level regime for water management in hetao is illustrated in fig 5 2 6 3 data preparation 2 6 3 1 shaw model data the shaw model simulated the period from the beginning of autumn irrigation to the spring sowing of the following year from september 20th to april 15th of the following year the essential input data for the shaw model include 1 general information about the simulated site location and slope of the site number of nodes parameters describing snowpack canopy and residue 2 soil soil related parameters soil particle composition soil bulk density soil hydraulic characteristics and initial soil moisture and temperature profiles 3 daily or hourly meteorological data temperature wind speed humidity precipitation and solar radiation we used the meteorological data with daily time steps collected at the linhe station near bayan nur city as the input of the shaw model snow cover was not taken into account as the snow was scarce during the simulation period besides since the ground is exposed after the autumn harvest canopy and residue are not considered soil textures of the areas irrigated by the six sub main canals were tested before autumn irrigation the soil samples from 5 depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm were drilled to measure the soil bulk density particle composition and soil water content the soil temperature profiles were measured by inserting thermocouples into the five soil layers since the soil hydraulic characteristics saturated conductivity k s air entry potential φ e and pore size allocation index b are difficult to measure directly these soil parameters were first estimated with the campbell empirical equation campbell and shiozawa 1992 based on the soil bulk density and particle composition then these soil parameters were optimized with the observed data of soil water and salt dynamics during the freezing thawing period from 2000 to 2001 the optimized soil hydraulic characteristics were validated by the observed water and salt dynamic data from 2001 to 2002 the simulated values of the shaw model were compared with the measured values using the relative root mean square error rmse the rmse of smc is from 0 016 to 0 058 and the rmse of ss is from 0 008 to 0 031 mol kg 1 the shaw model shows higher accuracy in its simulation of smc regarding ss except for the surface salinity during the thawing period the difference between the simulated and measured salinity is acceptable 2 6 3 2 data for canal scheduling optimization in this study canal scheduling involves the agency and the farmer as two independent decision makers and each decision maker has two objectives the optimal solution of the canal scheduling model is not unique with the change of decision makers preferences for their two objectives the non uniqueness makes it difficult to compare the decision making characteristics and application performances of hierarchical and centralized canal scheduling models in this regard it is more important to focus on the competition between the agency and the farmer in hierarchical and centralized decision making frameworks rather than between the agency s or farmers own two objectives therefore to avoid non uniqueness one of the most typical scenarios in practice is chosen to optimize the water allocation plan and the water use plan in which the weights of the two objectives of the agency and the farmer are set to be equal before running the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models the field water demand plan must be calculated using the model developed in section 2 4 and the total water demand is 234 6 million m3 in addition the total water availability in the three models is set to 256 1 million m3 with reference to the actual autumn irrigation situation in yongji 3 results the hdm 2a model and the cdm 2a model are developed based on a hierarchical and centralized management regime respectively except for the management regime the two models share the same optimization objectives decision variables and constraints in this section the canal scheduling performances in hierarchical and centralized management regimes are compared in terms of the water allocation and water use plans of the hdm 2a model and the cdm 2a model and the optimal interests of the involved decision makers 3 1 comparison of water allocation and planned water use in hierarchical and centralized models compared with the hdm 2a model better canal water allocation performance can be found with the cdm 2a model as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the difference between the total amount of water allocation and planned water use of the cdm 2a model is lower and the coefficient of determination between the water allocation plan and the water use plan r a u 2 is higher compared to the hdm 2a model the difference between the total amount of planned water use and water allocation of the cdm 2a model is 6 46 million m3 while that of the hdm 2a model is 10 53 million m3 the r a u 2 of the cdm 2a model is 0 996 while the latter is 0 981 the time series of water allocation and water use plans are depicted in fig 7a b however the better water allocation performance of the cdm 2a regime in reducing the difference between water allocation and planned water use is realized by depriving farmers right to make water use plans the total amount of water use specified by the cdm 2a model actually significantly deviates from the water use plans made by farmers the planned water use of the cdm 2a model is 3 81 million m3 higher than that of the hdm 2a model and the gap with the field water demand is even more significant as seen in fig 6 the difference between total planned water use and total demand of the cdm 2a model is 13 76 million m3 higher than that of the hdm 2a model 9 94 million m3 on the other hand the water use plan of the cdm 2a model is less correlated with the field water demand plan as shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination between the water use plan and the water demand plan r u d 2 of the cdm 2a model is 0 969 lower than that of the hdm 2a model 0 975 the time series of water use and water demand plans of the six sub main canals are depicted in fig 8a b 3 2 optimal interests for decision makers in hierarchical and centralized models as mentioned above the cdm 2a model allows for smaller deviations between water allocation and water use plans which facilitates decision makers to achieve higher interests as shown in fig 9a b f and f represent the objective values for the agency and farmers respectively and the smaller the objective values the higher the interests of decision makers point a in fig 9a b represents the optimal objective values of the hdm 2a model and point b represents the optimal objective values of the cdm 2a model under the specified weights obviously point b dominates point a i e point b is superior to point a in terms of both the agency s and the farmers objectives for points a and b the canal water allocation performance is mainly influenced by deviations between the water allocation and water use plans as the difference in loss rates arising from the water allocation plans of the hdm 2a and cdm 2a models is slight at 5 45 and 5 60 respectively see table 2 however the better objective values obtained by the cdm 2a model are an exaggeration of the achievable results in practice the cdm 2a model s exaggeration of decision makers objective value is not limited to the equally weighted preference setting i e point b fig 9a shows the pareto front pf of the cdm 2a model blue dots on the pf of the cdm 2a model from point u to point v the weight of the agency s objective gradually increases and the weight of the farmer s objective gradually decreases to explore the exaggeration more scenarios are analyzed as shown in fig 9a points p and p q and q r and r s and s v and v are five pairs of cdm 2a and hdm 2a solutions each of which shares the same value of farmers benefit the cdm 2a model increases the agency benefits compared to the hdm 2a model in all five cases taking points s and s as an example the water allocation and water use plans for the two points are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively it can be seen that the cdm 2a model s allocation plan is more consistent with the water use plan the blue areas in fig 10 are smaller and the hdm 2a model s allocation plan deviates more from the water use plan the blue areas in fig 11 are larger wang et al 2020 also found that simplifying a hierarchical decision making framework with a cdm 2a regime may exaggerate the objective values of decision makers shafiee jood et al 2018 pointed out that what makes hdm 2a results inferior to those of cdm 2a is the cost necessary to obtain a more realistic solution to a hierarchical decision problem therefore despite the better water allocation performance of the cdm 2a model only the results of the hdm 2a model can be achieved in the canal scheduling practice 4 discussion this section discusses the canal scheduling characteristics in different management regimes based on the optimization results of the hdm 2a cdm 2a and cdm 1a models both the hdm 2a and cdm 2a regimes consider the role of involved decision makers and the following part first compares the competition of decision makers in the hdm 2a and cdm 2a regimes then the strengths and weaknesses of the cdm 1a regime are discussed 4 1 differences in the competition between decision makers under the hdm 2a regime and the cdm 2a regime in the cdm 2a regime there is a broader competition space between the objective of the agency and the objective of farmers the blue shaded area marked with the pf in fig 9b shows the competition space between the agency and farmers in the cdm 2a regime where the agency s objective values range from 0 62 to 0 76 and farmers objective values range from 0 017 to 0 29 the red points in fig 9b are the feasible objective values of the hdm 2a model and the envelope of feasible values red dashed line in fig 9b is the pf of the hdm 2a model according to the pf the competition space of the hdm 2a model pink shaded area is depicted in fig 9b as can be seen the competition space between the agency and farmers in the hdm 2a regime is significantly narrowed with the agency s objective values varying from 0 67 to 0 673 and farmers objective values varying from 0 036 to 0 057 the broader competition space of the cdm 2a regime is due to the wide range of variations in the weights of the centralized decision maker for the two stakeholders objectives from point u to point v the weight of the agency s objective increases from 0 to 1 and the weight of the farmers objective decreases from 1 to 0 however the hdm 2a regime requires farmers to obey the agency which fundamentally negates the possibility of farmers objective being weighted close to 1 besides in the hdm 2a regime farmers also have the decision making right to report their own water use plans which means farmers objective cannot be weighted close to 0 either moreover the cdm 2a regime presents a strong or weak competitive relationship as the weight of the centralized decision maker changes between the two stakeholders objectives whereas only relatively weak competition exists in the hdm 2a regime the competitive relationships implied by segments u c and d v are nonexistent for the hdm 2a regime for example in segment d v a slight improvement in the objective value of the agency is brought about at the considerable expense of the benefits of farmers for every 1 increase in the objective value of the agency the objective value of farmers will reduce by 12 84 such a competitive relationship obviously negates the farmer s decision making right similarly in segment u c for every 1 increase in the objective value of farmers the objective value of the agency will reduce by 21 74 which negates the agency s position as the leader in water allocation the hdm 2a regime emphasizes decision making rights and hierarchy so the pf of the hdm 2a model shrinks to a smaller range segment a z in segment a z the competition between decision makers is weaker and for every 1 reduction in the objective value of farmers the objective value of the agency increases by only 0 3 in summary compared with the cdm 2a regime the competition space for decision makers is narrower and the competitive relationship between the agency and the farmers is relatively weak in the hdm 2a regime this is because the hierarchical institution must consider the two necessary conditions of farmers independent decision making rights and their decision making rights being lower than that of the agency 4 2 characteristics of canal water allocation in the cdm 1a regime the cdm 1a model does not consider the water use plan and directly optimizes the water allocation plan to meet the field water demand plan and reduce water conveyance losses the simplicity of the cdm 1a model structure and the lower complexity of the objectives make the cdm 1a model perform no worse than the hdm 2a and cdm 2a models on certain optimization metrics as shown in fig 6 the water allocation of the cdm 1a model is closest to the water demand with a difference of 8 58 million m3 the water allocation plan of the cdm 1a model is the most consistent with the water demand plan as shown by the highest coefficients of determination between the water allocation plan and the water demand plan r a d 2 see table 2 in terms of reducing the water conveyance loss rate the cdm 1a model performs better in reducing the loss rate than the cdm 2a model and is only slightly inferior to the hdm 2a model see table 2 considering water use plans or the decision making attributes of water users will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the institutional arrangements compared with the highly centralized cdm 1a regime this institutional complexity may bring about the side effect of reducing water management efficiency wallis and ison 2011 however this does not mean that the cdm 1a regime is worth adopting on the contrary as the decentralization and complexity of contemporary water management systems have already formed it is difficult for the cdm 1a regime to adapt to such realities for example the cdm 1a regime is subject to information asymmetries as direct users of water farmers are naturally more experienced in obtaining information on field water demand such as the planting structure soil texture and agrometeorological conditions zhou et al 2021 in contrast managers must invest in obtaining demand information of all farmers which is inefficient and time consuming especially in complex multi level canal networks 4 3 implication and limitation this study extends knowledge to the formation mechanism of the gap between theoretical canal scheduling models and practices induced by the institutional arrangements changes it opens new paths toward mathematically identifying the effects of institutional arrangements on canal scheduling performance through a hierarchical canal scheduling model that matches the hierarchical management of the canal system which can be helpful for designing better irrigation water management institutions still some concerns need further research firstly as this study mainly focuses on the decision making features of three typical management regimes the non uniqueness of the optimal solution of the hdm 2a model is not mentioned the upper and lower levels of the hdm 2a model are dual objective problems for any upper level variable the lower level model calculates the corresponding pareto optimal solutions that is the lower level optimal solution will change as the preference of the lower level decision maker for the two objectives changes which means that the lower level decision maker may choose a solution that is favorable or unfavorable to the upper level decision maker by the same token the optimal solution of the upper level model is not unique as well the non uniqueness of the solutions of the upper and lower models suggests that there is space for cooperation between leaders and followers how to quantify the cooperation space of decision makers and how to promote their willingness to cooperate remains to be further explored secondly the proposed hdm 2a model is a one leader one follower bilevel water allocation model which implicitly assumes that the water use plans of the six farmers at the lower level are determined by a farmer representative rather than a multi follower model that directly considers the water using behavior of involved farmers in general farmers water using behavior is influenced by economic motivations i e the economic benefits of water use directly determine their water use plans wang et al 2008 water users usually have different payoffs from water use due to differences in soil texture and planting structure accordingly when water users are independent decision makers they are naturally driven by economic benefits to trade water to make more efficient use of water for the whole irrigation district so further research is needed to explore the interaction of water users in a multi follower bilevel framework 5 conclusions to improve the practicality of the canal scheduling model a novel canal scheduling model based on bilevel programming is proposed in this study which involves two hierarchically related decision makers hdms the hdms the agency and farmers have two assignments hdm 2a for making decisions on canal water allocation plans and water use plans respectively furthermore two traditional models based on a centralized decision maker cdm are developed for comparison 1 one cdm with two assignments cdm 2a 2 one cdm with one assignment cdm 1a which responsible only for canal water allocation plans the comparison indicated two major differences firstly the hdm 2a model effectively reduce the planned water use of lower level decision makers farmers by 381 m3 compared to the cdm 2a model although the cdm 2a model and the cdm 1a model outperform the hdm 2a model in reducing the deviation of water allocation plans from water use plans and the deviation of water allocation plans from field water demands the better performances of the two models are achieved by making farmers planned water use exceed their actual demand or by taking away their decision making rights therefore the results of the two cdm models cannot be realized in canal scheduling practice secondly the hdm 2a model successfully reflects the fact there is only a weak competitive relationship between farmers and the agency due to their independent decision making rights and specific hierarchy while the cdm 2a model exaggerates the competitive relationship between the two decision makers objectives which means a slight increase in the objective value of the agency farmers can be achieved at the considerable expense of farmers the agency s interest this study provides a more reasonable method for canal scheduling under hierarchical institutional arrangement which is helpful for designing better irrigation water management

8902,adapting agriculture to climate change without deteriorating natural resources e g water and energy is critical to sustainable development in this paper we first comprehensively evaluate six agricultural adaptations in response to climate change 2021 2050 through the lens of the water energy food wef nexus in saskatchewan canada using a previously developed nexus model wef sask the adaptations involve agronomic measures early planting date reducing soil evaporation irrigation expansion genetic improvement cultivars with larger growing degree days gdd requirement and combinations of individual adaptations the results show that the selected adaptations compensate for crop yield losses wheat canola pea caused by climate change to various extents however from a nexus perspective there are mixed effects on water productivity wp total agricultural water green and blue use energy consumption for irrigation and hydropower generation individual adaptations such as early planting date and increased gdd requirement compensate for yield losses in both rainfed 0 60 and irrigated 18 100 conditions with extra use of green water 5 7 blue water 2 14 and energy for irrigation 2 14 reducing soil water evaporation benefits the overall wef nexus by compensating for rainfed yield losses 25 82 with less use of blue water and energy consumption for irrigation the combination of the above three adaptations has the potential to sustain agricultural production in water scarce regions if irrigation expansion is also included the combined adaptation almost fully offsets agricultural production losses from climate change but significantly increases blue water use 143 174 and energy consumption for irrigation while reducing hydropower production 3 this study provides an approach to comprehensively evaluating agricultural adaptation strategies in response to climate change and insights to inform decision makers keywords agricultural adaptation strategies climate change impacts water energy food nexus water productivity sustainable development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change can severely affect agriculture given that farming activities are directly dependent on climatic conditions young et al 2012 threatening global and local food security altieri and nicholls 2017 rising temperatures can advance crop phenology and shorten growing cycles craufurd and wheeler 2009 zabel et al 2021 these effects are likely to reduce the total biomass and crop yield which are widely reported in studies involving data observations artificial warming experiments and crop model simulations asseng et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 moore et al 2021 ullah et al 2022 furthermore warmer temperatures intensify evapotranspiration and quickly deplete the soil water which induces water stress limiting the yield potential as demonstrated by he et al 2012 for spring wheat in saskatchewan canada the threat to food security forces individuals and communities to respond and adapt to climate change thayer et al 2020 sustaining agricultural productivity requires targeted agronomic measures e g changing planting date changing fertilizer irrigation changing crop type soil conservation and crop diversification and genetic improvements abid et al 2015 ladha et al 2021 such as breeding cultivars with larger gdd requirements however adopting adaptation options over extended areas may cause unintended consequences due to associated externalities to other sectors thayer et al 2020 the agricultural sector strongly connects with the water and energy sectors 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals are attributed to agriculture and 30 of the world s consumed energy results from food production and supply chain furthermore global projections show a 60 increase in food demand a 10 increase in irrigation water withdrawals by 2050 and up to 50 increase in energy consumption by 2035 fao 2014 the wef nexus approach helps identify the intersections feedback loops trade offs and synergies between water energy and food hoff 2011 fao 2014 abdelkader et al 2018 abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 wu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 therefore this approach is useful and necessary to evaluate alternative adaptation strategies to sustainably manage the limited resources by improving the overall system efficiency which relies on reducing trade offs while promoting synergies some studies have addressed the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in maintaining agricultural production reliability zabel et al 2021 while only a few studies analyzed the associated externalities to water or energy sectors in agricultural production rosenzweig et al 2004 found cultivars adapted to projected climate change may have higher water demand than currently used varieties huang et al 2018 indicated that extended irrigation likely reduces river discharge at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario lee et al 2020 adopted water footprint m3 tonne and energy footprint gj tonne metrics as linkage indicators to paddy rice production and indicated that intermittent irrigation could save irrigation water as well as the associated energy use in the irrigation water supply but lower yield under climate change although the effects of different practical agronomic measures on crop yield have been widely addressed at field scales the large scale effects on agricultural production water resources energy consumption and power generation under changing climate remain understudied moreover many agricultural adaptation studies focus on irrigation techniques and expansion which is only feasible in water abundant areas whereas only 20 of the world s cultivated land is irrigated but accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawals fao 2011 rainfed agriculture accounts for 80 of the world s cultivated land and provides 60 of agricultural production furthermore climate change affects the conversion between irrigated and rainfed land due to uncertain water availability elliott et al 2014 thus other agricultural adaptations that can enhance rainfed crop yield are also important perhaps more robustly ensuring food security under changing climate and socioeconomic environments the effects of agricultural adaptations on the water energy food nexus particularly under climate change remain understudied this study selected agricultural adaptation strategies that are most likely to be widely applied in practice in response to climate change moreover we designed the combinations of the individual adaptation strategies and first applied a comprehensive wef nexus modeling framework in the case of saskatchewan canada to explore the sustainable ones that can benefit the agriculture sector without deteriorating water and energy resources specifically this study analyzes crop growth responses e g growing cycle length first flowering date biomass to climate change and the effects of agricultural adaptations on crop production the consequences of these adaptations to water and energy resources such as blue water use energy consumption for irrigation and hydropower production are further quantified at the provincial scale where development plans and policy decisions are often designed and implemented wu et al 2021 2 methodology 2 1 study area saskatchewan one of the prairie provinces in western canada covers 651 036 km2 and about 95 of the provincial population lives in the southern half of the province kulshreshtha et al 2012 where almost all of the agricultural activities occur southern saskatchewan fig 1 focused on this study is a semi arid area with an annual mean temperature of 0 6 3 9 c and annual precipitation of 319 415 mm climate atlas of canada 2019 saskatchewan relies on an agricultural and resource based economy and provides a consistent and reliable supply of food worldwide with international sales of 16 3 billion in 2020 increased by 60 since 2011 accounting for more than 55 of total provincial exports the province occupies large shares of the world food export market and is the world s largest exporter of peas 42 lentils 68 durum wheat 56 mustard seed 29 flaxseed 26 and oats 42 government of saskatchewan 2021 therefore the sustainability of agricultural production in this region plays an important role in global food security when the world population is estimated to increase to nine billion by 2050 fao 2009 drought has frequently occurred throughout measured climate records in saskatchewan the province may experience further challenges in environmental and socioeconomic sectors from changing climate and water availability the provincial transboundary rivers the south saskatchewan river ssr and the north saskatchewan river nsr originating from the rocky mountains in the upstream province of alberta provide the most reliable water resource for irrigation and hydropower production however the local flows in southern saskatchewan are highly variable resulting in situations from droughts to floods saskatchewan water security agency 2012 additionally irrigated agriculture along with oil and gas potash and other industries are important growth sectors that need sufficient and sustainable water supplies potentially resulting in competitive water use with municipal power generation recreational and ecological sectors saskatchewan water security agency 2012 2 2 modeling framework fig 2 shows the schematic of the proposed methodology in this study the central part is the water energy food wef nexus model that quantifies interactions among wef sectors driven by climate variables surface flows coming from alberta and agricultural adaptation strategies the previously developed wef sask built in stella 1 9 wu et al 2021 is such a nexus tool and was adopted in this study wef sask couples with climate change projections a hydrological model hypr ahmed et al 2020 driven by climate scenarios to simulate future local flows and stochastic transboundary flows nazemi et al 2013 to simulate crop production water demand supply energy consumption production and interactions among wef sectors under plausible future hydroclimatic scenarios furthermore the effects of agricultural adaptations on the wef nexus were evaluated interactions among wef sectors in fig 2 were quantified as follows water use for food feed was estimated by soil water balance cropland area and irrigation efficiency water use for energy production including thermal power cooling and crude oil natural gas extraction was calculated according to the water use coefficient m3 gj and energy production gj moreover hydropower as clean energy was simulated by the water resource system in wef sask water supply for irrigation consumes energy which was estimated based on the volume of irrigation water total pressure head and pump and motor efficiency energy consumption for food feed production was estimated according to the energy input coefficient e g mj ha and cropland area food crops such as wheat and canola can be used to produce bioenergy the demand of which was estimated based on the blending mandate e g 25 ethanol 11

interactions in wef sask can be referred to wu et al 2021 the lars 5 5 weather generator was used to downscale and generate ensembles of climate realizations from general circulation models gcms semenov and barrow 2002 climate scenarios include a baseline climate 1986 2014 and four climate change signals miroc6 ssp126 hadgem3 gc31 ll ssp245 ukesm1 0 ll ssp370 and fgoals g3 ssp585 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 in 2021 2050 which were selected as representatives of the entire range of future climate projections wu et al 2022 these four climate change scenarios projected from four gcms the british hadgem3 and ukesm the chinese fgoals and the japanese miroc6 represent four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and four radiative forcings 2 6 4 5 7 0 and 8 5wm 2 by 2100 for each climate scenario including the baseline 100 stochastic realizations of daily time series were generated using the lars 5 5 weather generator one hundred realizations of the critical water source to saskatchewan transboundary flows incoming from alberta were generated by the stochastic approach developed by nazemi et al 2013 based on the historical records during 1980 2010 the sequence number from 1 to 100 of 100 realizations of a climate scenario corresponds to the same sequence number from 1 to 100 of 100 realizations of the transboundary flow given five climate scenarios baseline and four ssps 500 hydroclimatic runs were made in total these hydroclimatic conditions were combined with each of the six agricultural adaptation strategies and no strategy which are explained in the next section resulting in a total of 3500 runs in this study the details of hydroclimatic scenarios are described by wu et al 2022 this study first comprehensively assesses agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change from a water energy food nexus perspective the output indicators in this study focus on rainfed and irrigated crop production water productivity green and blue water use in crop production energy consumption for irrigation water supply and application and hydropower production 2 2 1 crop production and agricultural adaptation strategies the crop model in the previously developed wef sask is derived from the classical mitscherlich equation harmsen 2000 and the fao aquacrop water driven model fao 2020 eq 1 wu et al 2021 the mitscherlich equation was used to capture the nutrient application effects on crop production and a simplified aquacrop version was mainly used to simulate crop yield response to meteorological variables the details of the crop production simulation are described by wu et al 2021 1 y 1 e c 1 n 1 e c 2 p f hi hi o b where y crop yield tonne ha n nitrogen application rate kg ha yr p phosphorus as p2o5 application rate kg ha yr c1 crop specific activity coefficient associated with n c2 crop specific activity coefficient associated with p f hi adjustment factor considering severe water and temperature stress hi o reference harvest index b cumulative dry biomass production at crop maturity tonne ha in this study we assume that nutrient management will be well implemented in the future and the negative effects of nutrient application rate were ignored therefore the crop yield is the product of the harvest index f hi hi o and biomass production which is the same as in aquacrop biomass b tonne ha accumulation during the crop growing cycle emergence to maturity is estimated from normalized biomass water productivity wp tonne ha and a sum of the ratio of the daily crop transpiration tr i mm d to the reference evapotranspiration eto i mm eq 2 fao 2020 2 b wp tr i eto i the provincial scale yield calibration parameters include c1 c2 and other parameters related to soil water stresses air temperature stresses canopy development biomass production and yield formation apart from c1 and c2 other parameters were assigned the recommended values by raes et al 2018 based on extensive calibration validation processes of aquacrop and by allen et al 1998 then the powell gradient search technique powell 2009 built in stella 1 9 was applied to calibrate validate the remaining crop parameters with the historical yield at the provincial scale statistics canada 2021a by maximizing the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the model performance is demonstrated in the supplemental file variations of temperature and rainfall in the critical growth stage such as the reproductive stage are crucial to crop growth and production thus the 10 day mean maximum minimum temperature and accumulated rainfall under near future climate change 2021 2050 during the crop growing season from may to september were calculated to help analyze crop responses to changing climate since crop yield is determined by biomass accumulation and harvest index hi indicators related to biomass and harvest index were selected biomass accumulation is related to the growing cycle length emergence to maturity water stress induced by high temperature and insufficient rainfall and cold stress therefore four indicators were selected to evaluate biomass growing cycle length transpiration without water stress tro actual transpiration tr and tr tro severe water heat and cold stress affect pollination in the flowering period and thus the harvest index which is mainly affected by severe water stress in the flowering period in this study therefore the first flowering date was used to help evaluate the harvest index the growth stage is determined by growing degree days gdd mkhabela and bullock 2012 government of saskatchewan 2013 the crop model was used to simulate the rainfed yield of 12 principal field crops cereals wheat barley oats rye and canary seed oilseeds canola flaxseed and mustard seed pulses chickpeas lentils and peas and tame hay and eight irrigated crops cereals wheat barley oilseeds canola flaxseed potato peas forage crops tame hay corn silage the provincial scale yield tonne ha of each crop is the sum of the weighted average yield from the eight basins using crop area as the weight the crop area in each basin is estimated by aggregating the small agriculture census divisions according to the division area data statistics canada 2021b and the census subdivision map statistics canada 2019 to cope with global warming problems in agriculture such as heat induced water stress and shortened crop growing cycles shifting the planting date may allow crops to grow in more favorable conditions wang et al 2022 and selecting cultivars with long growing cycles increases biomass accumulation asseng et al 2019 zabel et al 2021 however these two strategies cannot guarantee higher water productivity and the adaptation of reducing non productive water use e g soil water evaporation should be considered irrigation expansion is a traditional agricultural adaptation strategy but is limited by water availability schmitt et al 2022 furthermore individual strategies have limited effects on crop production lorite et al 2022 and therefore combined strategies should be investigated considering the applicability to large scales regional water availability and plausible future climate conditions six agricultural adaptation strategies reflecting genetic improvement and agronomic management were designed to cope with climate change pd 15 advancing the planting date by 15 days to take advantage of the anticipated earlier spring thaw alleviate water stress and extend the length of the crop growing cycle gdd 10 10 increase in growing degree days requirement in potential new cultivars to extend the length of crop growing cycle this strategy increases the gdd requirement of a certain crop so that the crop needs more days to reach maturity resulting in larger biomass accumulation and evapotranspiration et e 50 reducing daily soil water evaporation by 50 using agronomic methods such as mulching to reduce non productive water consumption while promoting effective water use through transpiration pge the combination of pd 15 gdd 10 and e 50 ie irrigation expansion to improve food feed production by withdrawing more blue water from the current 50 000 ha to the potential of 250 000 ha in the lake diefenbaker area pgei the combination of pge and ie it is worth noting that whereas large irrigation expansion strategies ie and pgei are often only feasible in water abundant areas other strategies mentioned above pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and pge can also be applied to water scarce areas finally we assessed the effects of these adaption strategies on crop yield crop water productivity green and blue water use in crop production the associated energy demand for irrigation water supply and hydropower production under various hydroclimatic conditions 2 2 2 water productivity and crop water use water productivity wp kg m3 of rainfed and irrigated crops is defined as the ratio of yield kg ha to actual evapotranspiration et m3 ha during the growing cycle eq 3 fernández et al 2020 3 wp yield kg ha et m 3 ha kg m 3 wp is important in agricultural and water management because higher wp indicates higher yield in water limited conditions or water savings in water sufficient conditions the green and blue water terms mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 were used in this study because the source storage and use of the two water components are different blue water stored in natural rivers lakes and aquifers can be abstracted diverted transported and stored in artificial reservoirs and has a larger range of beneficial uses e g irrigation households and industries than green water which is stored in the soil and primarily used in situ for biomass growth food feed or energy crops and agroforestry hoekstra 2019 therefore it is necessary to distinguish between blue and green water when assessing agricultural adaptation strategies as trade offs often occur in blue water among economic sectors while not in green water in irrigated agriculture blue water evapotranspiration et b is equal to the actual net irrigation based on wef sask output wu et al 2021 and the green water evapotranspiration et g is equal to the actual water evapotranspiration et a minus et b hoekstra et al 2011 green water use m3 of all crops within the province is the accumulation of green crop water use over the rainfed and irrigated cropland blue water use m3 is the actual irrigation water supply simulated by wef sask model based on crop soil water balance cropland area irrigation efficiency and water availability irrigation water supply affects the water resource system in wef sask and thus hydropower production 3 results 3 1 climate change and crop responses fig 3 shows mean temperature and total rainfall on a 10 day scale from may to september to help analyze crop growth responses to climate in the future 2021 2050 compared to the baseline 1986 2014 rainfed wheat growth in the south saskatchewan river basin ssrb shows an example to analyze the impacts of climate change and the adaptive effects of strategies on crop production fig 4 demonstrates indicators closely related to biomass growing cycle length transpiration without water stress tro actual transpiration tr and tr tro and the indicator closely related to harvest index the first flowering date first of all climate impacts on wheat growth under the no strategy ns scenario white bars are analyzed here fig 4 shows a large wheat biomass reduction 20 in ssrb under ssp126 and ssp370 due to the shorter growing cycle length and relatively higher water stress which can be inferred by tr and tr tro the actual transpiration tr is limited by less rainfall from late june to august fig 3 when the crop experiences a canopy development to maturity additionally warmer temperature strengthens the atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration which quickly depletes soil moisture and induces water stress the model results show little impact of heat stress e g maximum temperature 35 on the wheat harvest index which is therefore considered to be only affected by severe water stress during the flowering period early to mid july under different ssps the severe water stress reduces the number of flowers not pollinated and the harvest index fraction of yield to total biomass under ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 fig 4 on the other hand as seen in fig 4 ssp245 slightly increases the tr tro ratio due to relatively high rainfall during the growing cycle compared to the baseline fig 3 moreover the harvest index under ssp245 fig 4 is not negatively affected because of the earlier first flowering date 11 days earlier than the baseline which can help avoid severe water stress during the flowering period in mid july as discussed above warmer temperatures will reduce the growing cycle length and thus reduce biomass production this reduction can be either exacerbated or alleviated by rainfall conditions in rainfed agriculture severe water stress may occur in july as almost all ssps show decreased rainfall in this period in southern saskatchewan which will likely reduce the harvest index of those rainfed crops whose flowering period is in july such as wheat the earlier flowering period may help avoid severe water stress and maintain the harvest index agricultural adaptation strategies alter the interactions between crops and the environment and affect crop production crop response to various adaptation strategies is also demonstrated in fig 4 the pd 15 strategy green bars can improve biomass accumulation compared to the no strategy scenario white bars this strategy allows crops to experience cooler temperatures which prolong the growing cycle and may alleviate water stress induced by high temperatures more atmospheric water demand during the entire growing cycle additionally the pd 15 strategy may slightly improve the harvest index compared to the no strategy scenario by alleviating severe water stress in the flowering period by advancing the first flowering date from mid july to early july such as under ssp126 fig 4 the gdd 10 strategy blue bars extends the growing cycle length and improves biomass accumulation compared to the no strategy scenario however this strategy likely postpones the first flowering date to mid july and makes the crop experience severe water stress caused by worse rainfall conditions fig 3 leading to a reduction in the harvest index the e 50 strategy red bars reduces non effective soil water evaporation and alleviates water stress higher tr tro particularly the severe water stress during the flowering period thus more soil water is diverted to transpiration improving biomass production and harvest index the combined strategy pge black bars takes advantage of the early planting date pd 15 larger gdd requirement gdd 10 and effective water use e 50 and has the potential to largely compensate for the reduction in both biomass and harvest index resulting from climate change 3 2 effects of adaptation strategies on crop yield et and wp wheat canola and peas are representative crops for cereals oilseeds and pulses respectively as described in section 2 2 1 to show the impacts of climate change and adaptive strategies on crop yield and crop evapotranspiration et in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture fig 5 crop yield is likely to be reduced due to climate change if no strategy ns is adopted white bars warmer temperature shortens the growing cycle length of both rainfed and irrigated crops rainfed crops are also negatively affected by high temperature and rainfall induced water stress that affects biomass accumulation and even harvest index in contrast water was a non limiting factor in biomass production and harvest index in irrigated crops with sufficient irrigation water supply ssp370 and ssp126 have less rainfall than baseline starting from july in most basins fig 3 and cause a 20 25 reduction in the rainfed yield of wheat canola and peas in contrast a moderately warmer temperature combined with higher rainfall such as ssp585 fig 3 reduces the yield of wheat canola and peas by 10 fig 5 the agricultural adaptation strategies colored bars potentially compensate for the rainfed crop yield losses caused by climate change to various extents pd 15 and gdd 10 individually can compensate for 0 60 of rainfed yield wheat canola peas losses while e 50 shows more stable and effective compensation 25 82 of rainfed yield losses across all ssps the combined strategy pge has a large potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change on crop yield compensating for 45 87 of rainfed yield wheat canola peas losses under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp370 even increasing the rainfed yield above the baseline under ssp585 given that irrigation expansion has large scale effects on blue water use and hydropower production the pgei strategy combination of pge and irrigation expansion is not analyzed here but in section 3 3 to show the nexus effects climate change also reduces the irrigated crop yield under no strategy primarily due to the shortened growing cycle length which reduces seasonal light interception and photosynthesis islam et al 2012 the strategies discussed above show different effects on irrigated crop yield given the negligible soil water stress pd 15 and gdd 10 are more effective in yield loss compensation 18 100 unlike rainfed agriculture although the e 50 red bars strategy saves water from ineffective soil water evaporation this strategy does not affect the yield of irrigated crops because no water stress occurs with or without the adoption of the strategy like rainfed agriculture the pge strategy effectively enhances irrigated crop yield and even exceeds the baseline climate level under ssp585 crop evapotranspiration et during the growing cycle is affected by the magnitude of the daily reference et rate the length of the growing cycle and soil water availability rising temperature increases the vapor pressure deficit and intensifies transpiration and soil water evaporation rate to meet the atmospheric water demand higher atmospheric water demand also potentially causes water stress for crops along with shortened growing cycle due to a warmer climate yield reduction may occur while et increases fig 5 shows climate change likely reduces et in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture under the no strategy scenario white bars mainly due to the shortened growing cycle and variable soil water availability although the daily reference evapotranspiration eto or the evaporation power is intensified adaptation strategies affect et in different ways the pd 15 and gdd 10 strategies extend the growing cycle and thus increase et compared to no strategy in contrast the e 50 strategy reduces soil water evaporation and thus always reduces et below no strategy level the pge strategy that combines the pd 15 gdd 10 and e 50 also increases crop et above no strategy level in rainfed and irrigated agriculture unlike rainfed agriculture the pd 15 and gdd 10 strategies increase et of irrigated crops e g wheat canola peas at a larger level even higher than the baseline level because water stress is not a limiting factor for et fig 6 shows the effects of adaptation strategies on water productivity wp of rainfed and irrigated crops under climate change the wp concept helps evaluate the effective or productive use of water under alternative adaptation strategies aiming to achieve more crop per drop which is of great importance in both agricultural production and water resource management higher wp values mean higher yield in water limited conditions or water savings in water sufficient conditions climate change likely reduces crop wp because rising temperature increases vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric water demand adaptation strategies show various impacts on wp given that pd 15 and gdd 10 extend the growing cycle both crop yield and et increase and thus wp is either increased or decreased under these two strategies compared to the no strategy scenario the e 50 strategy largely improves crop wp even exceeding the baseline level such as under ssp585 compared to no strategy level in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture in addition the pge strategy also largely improves wp indicating that the combination of adaptation strategies containing an effective water use strategy e g e 50 likely enhances wp 3 3 effects of adaptation strategies on total crop production and water and energy use agricultural adaptation strategies are essential to maintain food and feed production meanwhile they also bring externalities as agricultural activities are inevitably connected to water and energy sectors fig 7 shows the average annual total food and feed production water use and energy use for irrigation and provincial hydropower production during 2021 2050 under climate change with without adaptations two additional strategies are also assessed irrigation expansion ie that benefits the rural economy and the combined strategy pgei combination of pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and ie total water use in crop production is differentiated into green and blue water use in million cubic meters mcm given the difference between green and blue water in storage and use hoekstra 2019 blue water is the actual irrigation water use restricted by water availability the mean values of 100 realizations of these indicators under ssps and baseline dashed lines were compared fig 7 shows that all individual strategies improve crop production moderately compared to no strategy level however neither can alone fully offset crop production losses from climate change in contrast the combination of possible strategies the pgei strategy is robust to climate change scenarios assessed in this study to almost fully offset the food feed production losses from climate change even exceeding the baseline crop production by 12 under ssp585 the ssp370 scenario slightly reduces agricultural production by only 2 with the pgei strategy similarly the pge strategy also significantly compensates for the loss of food and feed production even exceeding the baseline production under ssp585 7 this result suggests that the combination of agronomic measures and genetic improvements to crop varieties has the potential to largely or even fully offset the agricultural production losses from climate change in those semi arid areas where large irrigation expansion is not feasible due to water scarcity the agricultural adaptation strategies show various impacts on water and energy use in agriculture as seen in fig 7 compared to the no strategy scenario the e 50 strategy moderately reduces the green and blue water use and energy consumption while effectively improving crop production whereas the individual strategies pd 15 and gdd 10 moderately increase the use of green water 5 7 blue water 2 14 and energy for irrigation 2 14 owing to involving irrigation expansion ie the pgei strategy significantly increases blue water use also the associated energy use for irrigation water supply by 143 174 overall strategies involving effective water use such as reducing soil water evaporation e 50 pge can effectively improve agricultural production with much less or even no extra use of blue water and energy compared to strategies involving large irrigation expansion ie pgei given the hydropower irrigation trade off in saskatchewan hassanzadeh et al 2016 wu et al 2021 agricultural adaptations may affect hydropower production and this potential issue is analyzed here it is worth noting that the variations of hydropower production in fig 7 predominantly result from the stochasticity of the inflows from alberta as seen in fig 7 irrigation expansion alone ie or combined with other strategies pgei obviously reduces hydropower production while the remaining strategies show slight impacts despite increasing total agricultural production by 4 1 1 1 3 mt irrigation expansion alone increases energy use for irrigation by 135 170 31 36 gwh and reduces hydropower production by 3 92 109 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario under various climate scenarios indicating a significant increase in energy demand while reducing renewable energy supply therefore large irrigation expansion requires cautious evaluation and management particularly under future uncertainties other agricultural adaptations without significantly intensifying water use trade offs should also be considered for example the e 50 strategy alone shows slight synergetic benefits by reducing energy use for irrigation with the existing irrigated area by 10 16 2 4 gwh while increasing hydropower production by 0 15 5 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario in addition the pge strategy has little impact on energy use for irrigation water supply and hydropower production 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural adaptations affecting the water energy food nexus and sustainable development sustainable agriculture is critical to achieving many sustainable development goals sdgs such as ending poverty and zero hunger fao 2015 and ensuring human well being without deteriorating the surrounding ecosystems capacity environmental integrity and social economic functions fao 2018 agricultural adaptations are key to reducing the negative impacts of climate change on food production previous adaptation assessments focus on the agriculture sector abid et al 2015 ladha et al 2021 while ignoring the broader scale influences on other sectors which may directly or indirectly affect other sdgs such as clean energy and water fao 2015 given that food energy and water are fundamental resources for human welfare the important linkages and feedback loops among them need to be identified and quantified in other words nexus thinking and management become important in agricultural sustainability practices to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate agricultural adaptations individually and in combination under a wide range of climate conditions through the lens of the wef nexus this complex and challenging endeavor was conducted by applying a comprehensive modeling framework that couples a wef nexus model a hydrological model and climate change projections wu et al 2021 irrigation is a widely used measure for enhancing food production by withdrawing blue water to supplement the water deficit when green water does not meet crop water requirements expanding irrigation offers opportunities to offset the reduction in food production due to water stress which may be exacerbated by global warming higher atmospheric water demand however irrigation expansion is not always feasible due to freshwater limitations which might even cause reverting cropland from irrigated to rainfed management under future climate change elliott et al 2014 in regions where there is potential for expanding irrigation such as saskatchewan by 400 whereas total crop production increases by 4 large amounts of blue water withdrawal require extra energy by 135 170 for irrigation water supply while reducing hydropower production by 3 putting pressure on clean energy transition and climate change mitigation instead of seeking more blue water supply through irrigation expansion which also requires considerable investments in irrigation infrastructure adaptations promoting food production by expanding green water use with no extra or relatively low cost merit attention unlike blue water which has a wide range of uses green water is primarily used in situ for biomass growth hoekstra 2019 avoiding competition over water between different sectors in addition given that rising temperature accelerates crop development and shortens the growing cycles asseng et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 naturally measures that extend growing cycles and increase biomass accumulation as well as the yield are more adaptive to global warming examples of such adaptations are advancing the planting date or selecting crop varieties with larger growing degree days gdd requirements where more green water is used for crop production in both rainfed and irrigated conditions irrigation water demand will also rise but slightly compared to large irrigation expansion fig 7 adaptations that target more use of either green or blue water e g irrigation advancing planting date and selecting varieties with larger gdd requirement to meet crop transpiration and atmospheric water demand may not increase crop water productivity wp reducing non effective water use i e soil water evaporation allows to divert more water to productive transpiration promoting yield increase in rainfed crops saving water in irrigated crops and increasing wp under both conditions van donk et al 2010 suggested that 65 100 mm of more irrigation water is required to grow the extra 1 6 tons ha of corn yield benefited from crop residue management in our case study reducing soil evaporation also shows synergetic benefits by saving energy consumption for irrigation by 10 16 2 4 gwh while slightly increasing hydropower production by 0 15 5 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario furthermore reducing soil water evaporation combined with other adaptations except irrigation expansion allows higher resilience of the food production system under climate change without diminishing blue water resources and hydropower production fig 7 4 2 policy implications as discussed above the wef nexus analysis reveals trade offs and synergies and therefore has the potential to promote policy coherence in actual resources management take for example saskatchewan in which strategies for multiple systems including natural systems land water forests communities infrastructure and economy government of saskatchewan 2017 have been made to improve the resilience of the province to climate change however current sectoral policies lead to trade offs for instance in the energy sector saskatchewan has proposed plans to double its renewable electricity capacity by 2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions in electricity production by 40 below the 2005 level nevertheless large irrigation expansion which is currently underway in the lake diefenbaker area reduces hydropower production and thus impedes renewable energy expansion therefore there is a need to build shared principles and values as well as a consistent understanding of nexus issues weitz et al 2017 among actors such as farmers and hydropower enterprises to achieve policy coherence moreover multiple adaptations particularly those that can bring synergetic benefits e g reducing soil evaporation or avoid significant deterioration in water and energy sectors should also be considered 4 3 limitations and potential future research this study is a step forward toward comprehensively evaluating various agricultural adaptation strategies from the water energy food nexus perspective under a wide range of future hydroclimatic conditions however some limitations exist in this study i the model does not capture the process of rising temperatures affecting photorespiration rates and photosynthetic efficiency and ignoring crop yield quality and ii this study evaluates agricultural adaptation strategies at a provincial scale however proper strategies often vary across locations for example the optimal planting date for a crop depends on the meteorological conditions and often varies from place to place therefore future studies should i evaluate the effects of climate change on crop photosynthetic efficiency and crop yield quality using modeling methods to help identify adaptation strategies such as breeding heat resistant crop varieties and ii design optimize and evaluate agricultural adaptation strategies from a nexus perspective under finer spatial resolutions such as agricultural divisions to capture the heterogeneity of meteorological conditions 5 conclusions the effects of agricultural adaptation strategies on the water energy food nexus under climate change have been evaluated based on a comprehensive framework coupling a wef nexus model wef sask a hydrological model hypr simulating local flows stochastic transboundary flows and climate change projections our findings show that reducing soil evaporation e 50 brings synergetic benefits to the overall wef nexus by improving rainfed crop yield and water productivity reducing or maintaining nearly historical blue water use and energy consumption for irrigation and slightly increasing hydropower production the pge strategy a combination of advancing the planting date pd 15 growing cultivars with higher requirements of growing degree days gdd 10 largely compensates for climate change induced crop yield losses under both rainfed and irrigated conditions and effectively increases water productivity while not deteriorating water resources and hydropower production thus the pge strategy has the potential in sustaining agricultural production in water scarce regions where large irrigation expansion is infeasible if irrigation expansion ie is also included the pgei strategy combination of pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and ie almost fully offsets crop production losses however this strategy significantly increases blue water use also the associated energy use for irrigation water supply by 143 174 and reduces provincial hydropower production by 3 under various climate change scenarios therefore large irrigation expansion should be well assessed and cautiously managed and multiple adaptations should be applied to achieve sustainable agriculture this study shows that wef nexus analysis has the

8902,adapting agriculture to climate change without deteriorating natural resources e g water and energy is critical to sustainable development in this paper we first comprehensively evaluate six agricultural adaptations in response to climate change 2021 2050 through the lens of the water energy food wef nexus in saskatchewan canada using a previously developed nexus model wef sask the adaptations involve agronomic measures early planting date reducing soil evaporation irrigation expansion genetic improvement cultivars with larger growing degree days gdd requirement and combinations of individual adaptations the results show that the selected adaptations compensate for crop yield losses wheat canola pea caused by climate change to various extents however from a nexus perspective there are mixed effects on water productivity wp total agricultural water green and blue use energy consumption for irrigation and hydropower generation individual adaptations such as early planting date and increased gdd requirement compensate for yield losses in both rainfed 0 60 and irrigated 18 100 conditions with extra use of green water 5 7 blue water 2 14 and energy for irrigation 2 14 reducing soil water evaporation benefits the overall wef nexus by compensating for rainfed yield losses 25 82 with less use of blue water and energy consumption for irrigation the combination of the above three adaptations has the potential to sustain agricultural production in water scarce regions if irrigation expansion is also included the combined adaptation almost fully offsets agricultural production losses from climate change but significantly increases blue water use 143 174 and energy consumption for irrigation while reducing hydropower production 3 this study provides an approach to comprehensively evaluating agricultural adaptation strategies in response to climate change and insights to inform decision makers keywords agricultural adaptation strategies climate change impacts water energy food nexus water productivity sustainable development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change can severely affect agriculture given that farming activities are directly dependent on climatic conditions young et al 2012 threatening global and local food security altieri and nicholls 2017 rising temperatures can advance crop phenology and shorten growing cycles craufurd and wheeler 2009 zabel et al 2021 these effects are likely to reduce the total biomass and crop yield which are widely reported in studies involving data observations artificial warming experiments and crop model simulations asseng et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 moore et al 2021 ullah et al 2022 furthermore warmer temperatures intensify evapotranspiration and quickly deplete the soil water which induces water stress limiting the yield potential as demonstrated by he et al 2012 for spring wheat in saskatchewan canada the threat to food security forces individuals and communities to respond and adapt to climate change thayer et al 2020 sustaining agricultural productivity requires targeted agronomic measures e g changing planting date changing fertilizer irrigation changing crop type soil conservation and crop diversification and genetic improvements abid et al 2015 ladha et al 2021 such as breeding cultivars with larger gdd requirements however adopting adaptation options over extended areas may cause unintended consequences due to associated externalities to other sectors thayer et al 2020 the agricultural sector strongly connects with the water and energy sectors 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals are attributed to agriculture and 30 of the world s consumed energy results from food production and supply chain furthermore global projections show a 60 increase in food demand a 10 increase in irrigation water withdrawals by 2050 and up to 50 increase in energy consumption by 2035 fao 2014 the wef nexus approach helps identify the intersections feedback loops trade offs and synergies between water energy and food hoff 2011 fao 2014 abdelkader et al 2018 abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 wu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 therefore this approach is useful and necessary to evaluate alternative adaptation strategies to sustainably manage the limited resources by improving the overall system efficiency which relies on reducing trade offs while promoting synergies some studies have addressed the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in maintaining agricultural production reliability zabel et al 2021 while only a few studies analyzed the associated externalities to water or energy sectors in agricultural production rosenzweig et al 2004 found cultivars adapted to projected climate change may have higher water demand than currently used varieties huang et al 2018 indicated that extended irrigation likely reduces river discharge at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario lee et al 2020 adopted water footprint m3 tonne and energy footprint gj tonne metrics as linkage indicators to paddy rice production and indicated that intermittent irrigation could save irrigation water as well as the associated energy use in the irrigation water supply but lower yield under climate change although the effects of different practical agronomic measures on crop yield have been widely addressed at field scales the large scale effects on agricultural production water resources energy consumption and power generation under changing climate remain understudied moreover many agricultural adaptation studies focus on irrigation techniques and expansion which is only feasible in water abundant areas whereas only 20 of the world s cultivated land is irrigated but accounts for 70 of freshwater withdrawals fao 2011 rainfed agriculture accounts for 80 of the world s cultivated land and provides 60 of agricultural production furthermore climate change affects the conversion between irrigated and rainfed land due to uncertain water availability elliott et al 2014 thus other agricultural adaptations that can enhance rainfed crop yield are also important perhaps more robustly ensuring food security under changing climate and socioeconomic environments the effects of agricultural adaptations on the water energy food nexus particularly under climate change remain understudied this study selected agricultural adaptation strategies that are most likely to be widely applied in practice in response to climate change moreover we designed the combinations of the individual adaptation strategies and first applied a comprehensive wef nexus modeling framework in the case of saskatchewan canada to explore the sustainable ones that can benefit the agriculture sector without deteriorating water and energy resources specifically this study analyzes crop growth responses e g growing cycle length first flowering date biomass to climate change and the effects of agricultural adaptations on crop production the consequences of these adaptations to water and energy resources such as blue water use energy consumption for irrigation and hydropower production are further quantified at the provincial scale where development plans and policy decisions are often designed and implemented wu et al 2021 2 methodology 2 1 study area saskatchewan one of the prairie provinces in western canada covers 651 036 km2 and about 95 of the provincial population lives in the southern half of the province kulshreshtha et al 2012 where almost all of the agricultural activities occur southern saskatchewan fig 1 focused on this study is a semi arid area with an annual mean temperature of 0 6 3 9 c and annual precipitation of 319 415 mm climate atlas of canada 2019 saskatchewan relies on an agricultural and resource based economy and provides a consistent and reliable supply of food worldwide with international sales of 16 3 billion in 2020 increased by 60 since 2011 accounting for more than 55 of total provincial exports the province occupies large shares of the world food export market and is the world s largest exporter of peas 42 lentils 68 durum wheat 56 mustard seed 29 flaxseed 26 and oats 42 government of saskatchewan 2021 therefore the sustainability of agricultural production in this region plays an important role in global food security when the world population is estimated to increase to nine billion by 2050 fao 2009 drought has frequently occurred throughout measured climate records in saskatchewan the province may experience further challenges in environmental and socioeconomic sectors from changing climate and water availability the provincial transboundary rivers the south saskatchewan river ssr and the north saskatchewan river nsr originating from the rocky mountains in the upstream province of alberta provide the most reliable water resource for irrigation and hydropower production however the local flows in southern saskatchewan are highly variable resulting in situations from droughts to floods saskatchewan water security agency 2012 additionally irrigated agriculture along with oil and gas potash and other industries are important growth sectors that need sufficient and sustainable water supplies potentially resulting in competitive water use with municipal power generation recreational and ecological sectors saskatchewan water security agency 2012 2 2 modeling framework fig 2 shows the schematic of the proposed methodology in this study the central part is the water energy food wef nexus model that quantifies interactions among wef sectors driven by climate variables surface flows coming from alberta and agricultural adaptation strategies the previously developed wef sask built in stella 1 9 wu et al 2021 is such a nexus tool and was adopted in this study wef sask couples with climate change projections a hydrological model hypr ahmed et al 2020 driven by climate scenarios to simulate future local flows and stochastic transboundary flows nazemi et al 2013 to simulate crop production water demand supply energy consumption production and interactions among wef sectors under plausible future hydroclimatic scenarios furthermore the effects of agricultural adaptations on the wef nexus were evaluated interactions among wef sectors in fig 2 were quantified as follows water use for food feed was estimated by soil water balance cropland area and irrigation efficiency water use for energy production including thermal power cooling and crude oil natural gas extraction was calculated according to the water use coefficient m3 gj and energy production gj moreover hydropower as clean energy was simulated by the water resource system in wef sask water supply for irrigation consumes energy which was estimated based on the volume of irrigation water total pressure head and pump and motor efficiency energy consumption for food feed production was estimated according to the energy input coefficient e g mj ha and cropland area food crops such as wheat and canola can be used to produce bioenergy the demand of which was estimated based on the blending mandate e g 25 ethanol 11 biodiesel and total gasoline diesel demand in the transportation sector further bioenergy demand was converted to feedstocks requirement e g wheat and canola seed the detailed quantifications of wef interactions in wef sask can be referred to wu et al 2021 the lars 5 5 weather generator was used to downscale and generate ensembles of climate realizations from general circulation models gcms semenov and barrow 2002 climate scenarios include a baseline climate 1986 2014 and four climate change signals miroc6 ssp126 hadgem3 gc31 ll ssp245 ukesm1 0 ll ssp370 and fgoals g3 ssp585 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 in 2021 2050 which were selected as representatives of the entire range of future climate projections wu et al 2022 these four climate change scenarios projected from four gcms the british hadgem3 and ukesm the chinese fgoals and the japanese miroc6 represent four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and four radiative forcings 2 6 4 5 7 0 and 8 5wm 2 by 2100 for each climate scenario including the baseline 100 stochastic realizations of daily time series were generated using the lars 5 5 weather generator one hundred realizations of the critical water source to saskatchewan transboundary flows incoming from alberta were generated by the stochastic approach developed by nazemi et al 2013 based on the historical records during 1980 2010 the sequence number from 1 to 100 of 100 realizations of a climate scenario corresponds to the same sequence number from 1 to 100 of 100 realizations of the transboundary flow given five climate scenarios baseline and four ssps 500 hydroclimatic runs were made in total these hydroclimatic conditions were combined with each of the six agricultural adaptation strategies and no strategy which are explained in the next section resulting in a total of 3500 runs in this study the details of hydroclimatic scenarios are described by wu et al 2022 this study first comprehensively assesses agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change from a water energy food nexus perspective the output indicators in this study focus on rainfed and irrigated crop production water productivity green and blue water use in crop production energy consumption for irrigation water supply and application and hydropower production 2 2 1 crop production and agricultural adaptation strategies the crop model in the previously developed wef sask is derived from the classical mitscherlich equation harmsen 2000 and the fao aquacrop water driven model fao 2020 eq 1 wu et al 2021 the mitscherlich equation was used to capture the nutrient application effects on crop production and a simplified aquacrop version was mainly used to simulate crop yield response to meteorological variables the details of the crop production simulation are described by wu et al 2021 1 y 1 e c 1 n 1 e c 2 p f hi hi o b where y crop yield tonne ha n nitrogen application rate kg ha yr p phosphorus as p2o5

temperature stress hi o reference harvest index b cumulative dry biomass production at crop maturity tonne ha in this study we assume that nutrient management will be well implemented in the future and the negative effects of nutrient application rate were ignored therefore the crop yield is the product of the harvest index f hi hi o and biomass production which is the same as in aquacrop biomass b tonne ha accumulation during the crop growing cycle emergence to maturity is estimated from normalized biomass water productivity wp tonne ha and a sum of the ratio of the daily crop

soil water stresses air temperature stresses canopy development biomass production and yield formation apart from c1 and c2 other parameters were assigned the recommended values by raes et al 2018 based on extensive calibration validation processes of aquacrop and by allen et al 1998 then the powell gradient search technique powell 2009 built in stella 1 9 was applied to calibrate validate the remaining crop parameters with the historical yield at the provincial scale statistics canada 2021a by maximizing the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse the model performance is demonstrated in the supplemental file variations of temperature and rainfall in the critical growth stage such as the reproductive stage are crucial to crop growth and production thus the 10 day mean maximum minimum temperature and accumulated rainfall under near future climate change 2021 2050 during the crop growing season from may to september were calculated to help analyze crop responses to changing climate since crop yield is determined by biomass accumulation and harvest index hi indicators related to biomass and harvest index were selected biomass accumulation is related to the growing cycle length emergence to maturity water stress induced by high temperature and insufficient rainfall and cold stress therefore four indicators were selected to evaluate biomass growing cycle length transpiration without water stress tro actual transpiration tr and tr tro severe water heat and cold stress affect pollination in the flowering period and thus the harvest index which is mainly affected by severe water stress in the flowering period in this study therefore the first flowering date was used to help evaluate the harvest index the growth stage is determined by growing degree days gdd mkhabela and bullock 2012 government of saskatchewan 2013 the crop model was used to simulate the rainfed yield of 12 principal field crops cereals wheat barley oats rye and canary seed oilseeds canola flaxseed and mustard seed pulses chickpeas lentils and peas and tame hay and eight irrigated crops cereals wheat barley oilseeds canola flaxseed potato peas forage crops tame hay corn silage the provincial scale yield tonne ha of each crop is the sum of the weighted average yield from the eight basins using crop area as the weight the crop area in each basin is estimated by aggregating the small agriculture census divisions according to the division area data statistics canada 2021b and the census subdivision map statistics canada 2019 to cope with global warming problems in agriculture such as heat induced water stress and shortened crop growing cycles shifting the planting date may allow crops to grow in more favorable conditions wang et al 2022 and selecting cultivars with long growing cycles increases biomass accumulation asseng et al 2019 zabel et al 2021 however these two strategies cannot guarantee higher water productivity and the adaptation of reducing non productive water use e g soil water evaporation should be considered irrigation expansion is a traditional agricultural adaptation strategy but is limited by water availability schmitt et al 2022 furthermore individual strategies have limited effects on crop production lorite et al 2022 and therefore combined strategies should be investigated considering the applicability to large scales regional water availability and plausible future climate conditions six agricultural adaptation strategies reflecting genetic improvement and agronomic management were designed to cope with climate change pd 15 advancing the planting date by 15 days to take advantage of the anticipated earlier spring thaw alleviate water stress and extend the length of the crop growing cycle gdd 10 10 increase in growing degree days requirement in potential new cultivars to extend the length of crop growing cycle this strategy increases the gdd requirement of a certain crop so that the crop needs more days to reach maturity resulting in larger biomass accumulation and evapotranspiration et e 50 reducing daily soil water evaporation by 50 using agronomic methods such as mulching to reduce non productive water consumption while promoting effective water use through transpiration pge the combination of pd 15 gdd 10 and e 50 ie irrigation expansion to improve food feed production by withdrawing more blue water from the current 50 000 ha to the potential of 250 000 ha in the lake diefenbaker area pgei the combination of pge and ie it is worth noting that whereas large irrigation expansion strategies ie and pgei are often only feasible in water abundant areas other strategies mentioned above pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and pge can also be applied to water scarce areas finally we assessed the effects of these adaption strategies on crop yield crop water productivity green and blue water use in crop production the associated energy demand for irrigation water supply and hydropower production under various hydroclimatic conditions 2 2 2 water productivity and crop water use water productivity wp kg m3 of rainfed and irrigated crops is defined as the ratio of yield kg ha to actual evapotranspiration et m3 ha during the growing cycle eq 3 fernández et al 2020 3 wp yield kg ha et m 3 ha kg m 3 wp is important in agricultural and water management because higher wp indicates higher yield in water limited conditions or water savings in water sufficient conditions the green and blue water terms mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 were used in this study because the source storage and use of the two water components are different blue water stored in natural rivers lakes and aquifers can be abstracted diverted transported and stored in artificial reservoirs and has a larger range of beneficial uses e g irrigation households and industries than green water which is stored in the soil and primarily used in situ for biomass growth food feed or energy crops and agroforestry hoekstra 2019 therefore it is necessary to distinguish between blue and green water when assessing agricultural adaptation strategies as trade offs often occur in blue water among economic sectors while not in green water in irrigated agriculture blue water evapotranspiration et b is equal to the actual net irrigation based on wef sask output wu et al 2021 and the green water evapotranspiration et g is equal to the actual water evapotranspiration et a minus et b hoekstra et al 2011 green water use m3 of all crops within the province is the accumulation of green crop water use over the rainfed and irrigated cropland blue water use m3 is the actual irrigation water supply simulated by wef sask model based on crop soil water balance cropland area irrigation efficiency and water availability irrigation water supply affects the water resource system in wef sask and thus hydropower production 3 results 3 1 climate change and crop responses fig 3 shows mean temperature and total rainfall on a 10 day scale from may to september to help analyze crop growth responses to climate in the future 2021 2050 compared to the baseline 1986 2014 rainfed wheat growth in the south saskatchewan river basin ssrb shows an example to analyze the impacts of climate change and the adaptive effects of strategies on crop production fig 4 demonstrates indicators closely related to biomass growing cycle length transpiration without water stress tro actual transpiration tr and tr tro and the indicator closely related to harvest index the first flowering date first of all climate impacts on wheat growth under the no strategy ns scenario white bars are analyzed here fig 4 shows a large wheat biomass reduction 20 in ssrb under ssp126 and ssp370 due to the shorter growing cycle length and relatively higher water stress which can be inferred by tr and tr tro the actual transpiration tr is limited by less rainfall from late june to august fig 3 when the crop experiences a canopy development to maturity additionally warmer temperature strengthens the atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration which quickly depletes soil moisture and induces water stress the model results show little impact of heat stress e g maximum temperature 35 on the wheat harvest index which is therefore considered to be only affected by severe water stress during the flowering period early to mid july under different ssps the severe water stress reduces the number of flowers not pollinated and the harvest index fraction of yield to total biomass under ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 fig 4 on the other hand as seen in fig 4 ssp245 slightly increases the tr tro ratio due to relatively high rainfall during the growing cycle compared to the baseline fig 3 moreover the harvest index under ssp245 fig 4 is not negatively affected because of the earlier first flowering date 11 days earlier than the baseline which can help avoid severe water stress during the flowering period in mid july as discussed above warmer temperatures will reduce the growing cycle length and thus reduce biomass production this reduction can be either exacerbated or alleviated by rainfall conditions in rainfed agriculture severe water stress may occur in july as almost all ssps show decreased rainfall in this period in southern saskatchewan which will likely reduce the harvest index of those rainfed crops whose flowering period is in july such as wheat the earlier flowering period may help avoid severe water stress and maintain the harvest index agricultural adaptation strategies alter the interactions between crops and the environment and affect crop production crop response to various adaptation strategies is also demonstrated in fig 4 the pd 15 strategy green bars can improve biomass accumulation compared to the no strategy scenario white bars this strategy allows crops to experience cooler temperatures which prolong the growing cycle and may alleviate water stress induced by high temperatures more atmospheric water demand during the entire growing cycle additionally the pd 15 strategy may slightly improve the harvest index compared to the no strategy scenario by alleviating severe water stress in the flowering period by advancing the first flowering date from mid july to early july such as under ssp126 fig 4 the gdd 10 strategy blue bars extends the growing cycle length and improves biomass accumulation compared to the no strategy scenario however this strategy likely postpones the first flowering date to mid july and makes the crop experience severe water stress caused by worse rainfall conditions fig 3 leading to a reduction in the harvest index the e 50 strategy red bars reduces non effective soil water evaporation and alleviates water stress higher tr tro particularly the severe water stress during the flowering period thus more soil water is diverted to transpiration improving biomass production and harvest index the combined strategy pge black bars takes advantage of the early planting date pd 15 larger gdd requirement gdd 10 and effective water use e 50 and has the potential to largely compensate for the reduction in both biomass and harvest index resulting from climate change 3 2 effects of adaptation strategies on crop yield et and wp wheat canola and peas are representative crops for cereals oilseeds and pulses respectively as described in section 2 2 1 to show the impacts of climate change and adaptive strategies on crop yield and crop evapotranspiration et in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture fig 5 crop yield is likely to be reduced due to climate change if no strategy ns is adopted white bars warmer temperature shortens the growing cycle length of both rainfed and irrigated crops rainfed crops are also negatively affected by high temperature and rainfall induced water stress that affects biomass accumulation and even harvest index in contrast water was a non limiting factor in biomass production and harvest index in irrigated crops with sufficient irrigation water supply ssp370 and ssp126 have less rainfall than baseline starting from july in most basins fig 3 and cause a 20 25 reduction in the rainfed yield of wheat canola and peas in contrast a moderately warmer temperature combined with higher rainfall such as ssp585 fig 3 reduces the yield of wheat canola and peas by 10 fig 5 the agricultural adaptation strategies colored bars potentially compensate for the rainfed crop yield losses caused by climate change to various extents pd 15 and gdd 10 individually can compensate for 0 60 of rainfed yield wheat canola peas losses while e 50 shows more stable and effective compensation 25 82 of rainfed yield losses across all ssps the combined strategy pge has a large potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change on crop yield compensating for 45 87 of rainfed yield wheat canola peas losses under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp370 even increasing the rainfed yield above the baseline under ssp585 given that irrigation expansion has large scale effects on blue water use and hydropower production the pgei strategy combination of pge and irrigation expansion is not analyzed here but in section 3 3 to show the nexus effects climate change also reduces the irrigated crop yield under no strategy primarily due to the shortened growing cycle length which reduces seasonal light interception and photosynthesis islam et al 2012 the strategies discussed above show different effects on irrigated crop yield given the negligible soil water stress pd 15 and gdd 10 are more effective in yield loss compensation 18 100 unlike rainfed agriculture although the e 50 red bars strategy saves water from ineffective soil water evaporation this strategy does not affect the yield of irrigated crops because no water stress occurs with or without the adoption of the strategy like rainfed agriculture the pge strategy effectively enhances irrigated crop yield and even exceeds the baseline climate level under ssp585 crop evapotranspiration et during the growing cycle is affected by the magnitude of the daily reference et rate the length of the growing cycle and soil water availability rising temperature increases the vapor pressure deficit and intensifies transpiration and soil water evaporation rate to meet the atmospheric water demand higher atmospheric water demand also potentially causes water stress for crops along with shortened growing cycle due to a warmer climate yield reduction may occur while et increases fig 5 shows climate change likely reduces et in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture under the no strategy scenario white bars mainly due to the shortened growing cycle and variable soil water availability although the daily reference evapotranspiration eto or the evaporation power is intensified adaptation strategies affect et in different ways the pd 15 and gdd 10 strategies extend the growing cycle and thus increase et compared to no strategy in contrast the e 50 strategy reduces soil water evaporation and thus always reduces et below no strategy level the pge strategy that combines the pd 15 gdd 10 and e 50 also increases crop et above no strategy level in rainfed and irrigated agriculture unlike rainfed agriculture the pd 15 and gdd 10 strategies increase et of irrigated crops e g wheat canola peas at a larger level even higher than the baseline level because water stress is not a limiting factor for et fig 6 shows the effects of adaptation strategies on water productivity wp of rainfed and irrigated crops under climate change the wp concept helps evaluate the effective or productive use of water under alternative adaptation strategies aiming to achieve more crop per drop which is of great importance in both agricultural production and water resource management higher wp values mean higher yield in water limited conditions or water savings in water sufficient conditions climate change likely reduces crop wp because rising temperature increases vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric water demand adaptation strategies show various impacts on wp given that pd 15 and gdd 10 extend the growing cycle both crop yield and et increase and thus wp is either increased or decreased under these two strategies compared to the no strategy scenario the e 50 strategy largely improves crop wp even exceeding the baseline level such as under ssp585 compared to no strategy level in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture in addition the pge strategy also largely improves wp indicating that the combination of adaptation strategies containing an effective water use strategy e g e 50 likely enhances wp 3 3 effects of adaptation strategies on total crop production and water and energy use agricultural adaptation strategies are essential to maintain food and feed production meanwhile they also bring externalities as agricultural activities are inevitably connected to water and energy sectors fig 7 shows the average annual total food and feed production water use and energy use for irrigation and provincial hydropower production during 2021 2050 under climate change with without adaptations two additional strategies are also assessed irrigation expansion ie that benefits the rural economy and the combined strategy pgei combination of pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and ie total water use in crop production is differentiated into green and blue water use in million cubic meters mcm given the difference between green and blue water in storage and use hoekstra 2019 blue water is the actual irrigation water use restricted by water availability the mean values of 100 realizations of these indicators under ssps and baseline dashed lines were compared fig 7 shows that all individual strategies improve crop production moderately compared to no strategy level however neither can alone fully offset crop production losses from climate change in contrast the combination of possible strategies the pgei strategy is robust to climate change scenarios assessed in this study to almost fully offset the food feed production losses from climate change even exceeding the baseline crop production by 12 under ssp585 the ssp370 scenario slightly reduces agricultural production by only 2 with the pgei strategy similarly the pge strategy also significantly compensates for the loss of food and feed production even exceeding the baseline production under ssp585 7 this result suggests that the combination of agronomic measures and genetic improvements to crop varieties has the potential to largely or even fully offset the agricultural production losses from climate change in those semi arid areas where large irrigation expansion is not feasible due to water scarcity the agricultural adaptation strategies show various impacts on water and energy use in agriculture as seen in fig 7 compared to the no strategy scenario the e 50 strategy moderately reduces the green and blue water use and energy consumption while effectively improving crop production whereas the individual strategies pd 15 and gdd 10 moderately increase the use of green water 5 7 blue water 2 14 and energy for irrigation 2 14 owing to involving irrigation expansion ie the pgei strategy significantly increases blue water use also the associated energy use for irrigation water supply by 143 174 overall strategies involving effective water use such as reducing soil water evaporation e 50 pge can effectively improve agricultural production with much less or even no extra use of blue water and energy compared to strategies involving large irrigation expansion ie pgei given the hydropower irrigation trade off in saskatchewan hassanzadeh et al 2016 wu et al 2021 agricultural adaptations may affect hydropower production and this potential issue is analyzed here it is worth noting that the variations of hydropower production in fig 7 predominantly result from the stochasticity of the inflows from alberta as seen in fig 7 irrigation expansion alone ie or combined with other strategies pgei obviously reduces hydropower production while the remaining strategies show slight impacts despite increasing total agricultural production by 4 1 1 1 3 mt irrigation expansion alone increases energy use for irrigation by 135 170 31 36 gwh and reduces hydropower production by 3 92 109 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario under various climate scenarios indicating a significant increase in energy demand while reducing renewable energy supply therefore large irrigation expansion requires cautious evaluation and management particularly under future uncertainties other agricultural adaptations without significantly intensifying water use trade offs should also be considered for example the e 50 strategy alone shows slight synergetic benefits by reducing energy use for irrigation with the existing irrigated area by 10 16 2 4 gwh while increasing hydropower production by 0 15 5 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario in addition the pge strategy has little impact on energy use for irrigation water supply and hydropower production 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural adaptations affecting the water energy food nexus and sustainable development sustainable agriculture is critical to achieving many sustainable development goals sdgs such as ending poverty and zero hunger fao 2015 and ensuring human well being without deteriorating the surrounding ecosystems capacity environmental integrity and social economic functions fao 2018 agricultural adaptations are key to reducing the negative impacts of climate change on food production previous adaptation assessments focus on the agriculture sector abid et al 2015 ladha et al 2021 while ignoring the broader scale influences on other sectors which may directly or indirectly affect other sdgs such as clean energy and water fao 2015 given that food energy and water are fundamental resources for human welfare the important linkages and feedback loops among them need to be identified and quantified in other words nexus thinking and management become important in agricultural sustainability practices to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate agricultural adaptations individually and in combination under a wide range of climate conditions through the lens of the wef nexus this complex and challenging endeavor was conducted by applying a comprehensive modeling framework that couples a wef nexus model a hydrological model and climate change projections wu et al 2021 irrigation is a widely used measure for enhancing food production by withdrawing blue water to supplement the water deficit when green water does not meet crop water requirements expanding irrigation offers opportunities to offset the reduction in food production due to water stress which may be exacerbated by global warming higher atmospheric water demand however irrigation expansion is not always feasible due to freshwater limitations which might even cause reverting cropland from irrigated to rainfed management under future climate change elliott et al 2014 in regions where there is potential for expanding irrigation such as saskatchewan by 400 whereas total crop production increases by 4 large amounts of blue water withdrawal require extra energy by 135 170 for irrigation water supply while reducing hydropower production by 3 putting pressure on clean energy transition and climate change mitigation instead of seeking more blue water supply through irrigation expansion which also requires considerable investments in irrigation infrastructure adaptations promoting food production by expanding green water use with no extra or relatively low cost merit attention unlike blue water which has a wide range of uses green water is primarily used in situ for biomass growth hoekstra 2019 avoiding competition over water between different sectors in addition given that rising temperature accelerates crop development and shortens the growing cycles asseng et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 naturally measures that extend growing cycles and increase biomass accumulation as well as the yield are more adaptive to global warming examples of such adaptations are advancing the planting date or selecting crop varieties with larger growing degree days gdd requirements where more green water is used for crop production in both rainfed and irrigated conditions irrigation water demand will also rise but slightly compared to large irrigation expansion fig 7 adaptations that target more use of either green or blue water e g irrigation advancing planting date and selecting varieties with larger gdd requirement to meet crop transpiration and atmospheric water demand may not increase crop water productivity wp reducing non effective water use i e soil water evaporation allows to divert more water to productive transpiration promoting yield increase in rainfed crops saving water in irrigated crops and increasing wp under both conditions van donk et al 2010 suggested that 65 100 mm of more irrigation water is required to grow the extra 1 6 tons ha of corn yield benefited from crop residue management in our case study reducing soil evaporation also shows synergetic benefits by saving energy consumption for irrigation by 10 16 2 4 gwh while slightly increasing hydropower production by 0 15 5 gwh compared to the no strategy scenario furthermore reducing soil water evaporation combined with other adaptations except irrigation expansion allows higher resilience of the food production system under climate change without diminishing blue water resources and hydropower production fig 7 4 2 policy implications as discussed above the wef nexus analysis reveals trade offs and synergies and therefore has the potential to promote policy coherence in actual resources management take for example saskatchewan in which strategies for multiple systems including natural systems land water forests communities infrastructure and economy government of saskatchewan 2017 have been made to improve the resilience of the province to climate change however current sectoral policies lead to trade offs for instance in the energy sector saskatchewan has proposed plans to double its renewable electricity capacity by 2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions in electricity production by 40 below the 2005 level nevertheless large irrigation expansion which is currently underway in the lake diefenbaker area reduces hydropower production and thus impedes renewable energy expansion therefore there is a need to build shared principles and values as well as a consistent understanding of nexus issues weitz et al 2017 among actors such as farmers and hydropower enterprises to achieve policy coherence moreover multiple adaptations particularly those that can bring synergetic benefits e g reducing soil evaporation or avoid significant deterioration in water and energy sectors should also be considered 4 3 limitations and potential future research this study is a step forward toward comprehensively evaluating various agricultural adaptation strategies from the water energy food nexus perspective under a wide range of future hydroclimatic conditions however some limitations exist in this study i the model does not capture the process of rising temperatures affecting photorespiration rates and photosynthetic efficiency and ignoring crop yield quality and ii this study evaluates agricultural adaptation strategies at a provincial scale however proper strategies often vary across locations for example the optimal planting date for a crop depends on the meteorological conditions and often varies from place to place therefore future studies should i evaluate the effects of climate change on crop photosynthetic efficiency and crop yield quality using modeling methods to help identify adaptation strategies such as breeding heat resistant crop varieties and ii design optimize and evaluate agricultural adaptation strategies from a nexus perspective under finer spatial resolutions such as agricultural divisions to capture the heterogeneity of meteorological conditions 5 conclusions the effects of agricultural adaptation strategies on the water energy food nexus under climate change have been evaluated based on a comprehensive framework coupling a wef nexus model wef sask a hydrological model hypr simulating local flows stochastic transboundary flows and climate change projections our findings show that reducing soil evaporation e 50 brings synergetic benefits to the overall wef nexus by improving rainfed crop yield and water productivity reducing or maintaining nearly historical blue water use and energy consumption for irrigation and slightly increasing hydropower production the pge strategy a combination of advancing the planting date pd 15 growing cultivars with higher requirements of growing degree days gdd 10 largely compensates for climate change induced crop yield losses under both rainfed and irrigated conditions and effectively increases water productivity while not deteriorating water resources and hydropower production thus the pge strategy has the potential in sustaining agricultural production in water scarce regions where large irrigation expansion is infeasible if irrigation expansion ie is also included the pgei strategy combination of pd 15 gdd 10 e 50 and ie almost fully offsets crop production losses however this strategy significantly increases blue water use also the associated energy use for irrigation water supply by 143 174 and reduces provincial hydropower production by 3 under various climate change scenarios therefore large irrigation expansion should be well assessed and cautiously managed and multiple adaptations should be applied to achieve sustainable agriculture this study shows that wef nexus analysis has the

8903,drought evolution is a complex dynamic process showing continuous characteristics in space time currently the researches on drought dynamics from multiple dimensions are limited and should be improved further therefore a three dimensional identification method was adopted to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of classified drought events namely two month drought events within year drought events and cross year drought events in northwest china during1961 2018 furthermore more spatial variables of drought event such as start and end location drought orientation and rotation were extracted to describe the dynamic migration trajectories of drought events significantly drought rotation helped to reveal the forcing mechanisms such as the influence of climate and land surface behind their spatial development the results showed that a total of 169 drought events were identified over 1961 2018 and drought variables duration area severity and migration distance represented fluctuating decreasing trend with the rate of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a the dynamic migration process of individual drought event was objectively and effectively depicted from a three dimensional perspective which was consistent with the historical drought records in study area regarding the classified events drought magnitude was more severe in 1961 1980 than that in 1981 2018 and three primary migration patterns east to east west to west and south to south were identified in northwest china within year drought events mostly started in the first three quarters and finished in the second half year whilst the situation was reversed for the cross year drought events spatially alxa league of inner mongolia and northwest qinghai province were two main drought centers additionally drought events characterized by clockwise rotation migration were mostly distributed in the plateau and southeast climate zones and that was anticlockwise rotation in the westerly climate zone noticeably the east to east pathways were mainly located in the east part of the study area while the west to west and south to south trajectories were dominated in the west part keywords three dimensional perspective drought identification dynamic process drought classification characteristic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the extreme hydro climatic events such as drought and flood frequently occurred under global climate change which brings more serious challenges to flood control and drought relief dai et al 2020 han et al 2021 drought refers to an imbalance of water supply and demand that triggered by a prolonged lack of precipitation or excessive evapotranspiration over a region for months or years wang et al 2017a it is a regional migration phenomenon characterized by significantly temporal continuity and spatial dynamics behavior causing serious damage to the water resources ecological environment and social economy l c li et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of the spatio temporal dynamic evolution of drought is crucial for early warning systems and formulating reliable resistance strategies to ensure food security recently many studies have been devoted to the drought evaluation about its temporal e g frequency period and spatial e g area severity characteristics ferijal et al 2021 wang and liu 2022 for example statistical methods such as mann kendall trend analysis kalisa et al 2020 wavelet analysis feng and su 2019 empirical orthogonal functions zhou and liu 2018 and principal component analysis had provided useful reference for the estimation of spatio temporal characteristics of drought similar studies were implemented in other areas sun et al 2018 he et al 2021 byakatonda et al 2018 these researches generally reduced drought events to a lower order subspace and analyzed the driught evolution from temporal and spatial scale separately in other word they mainly fpcus on the temporal evolution of drought in a given space domain or spatial distributions of drought in a given time domain separately zhou et al 2019 in reality drought events often show distinct heterogeneity and continuity properties at different spatio temporal scales liu et al 2021 wen et al 2020 therefore the lower dimension subspace drought characteristics analysis cannot sufficiently capture the real spatio temporal continuous evolution characteristics of drought events in order to improve spatial tracking and simulation ability of drought the spatio temporal synchronous identification and characterization of drought events have been studied in the last decades andreadis et al 2005 proposed a clustering algorithm to consider the spatial and temporal property of individual drought events as a contiguous portion and used severity area duration curves to merge the spatio temporal information into drought characterization lloyd hughes 2012 extended the clustering algorithm into three dimensional space and applied the explicit drought identification method in drought analysis across european thereafter the three dimensional framework was adopted by many later researches such as xu et al 2015a chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 feng et al 2021 luo et al 2022 and j li et al 2022 compared with the lower dimension subspace drought analysis the 3 d drought identification method could extract more drought information and elucidate the dynamic variation of drought characteristics in a space time continuous perspective which are informative in exploring the spatio temporal structure and processes of actual drought events posteriorly the trajectory information is considered into the spatio temporal dynamic propagation process of drought events which is only limited to a few studies herrera estrada et al 2017 implemented the spatial tracking of drought events based on calculating the displacement between consecutive centroids in time which can describe how drought moves in space and time diaz et al 2019 proposed an approach to build the spatial path of drought such a path can explicitly define the onset and end of each drought event over time and space the aforementioned spatio temporal information of drought particularly its barycenter location and paths can not only describe the evolution trend of drought events over time but also reflect the liquidity and aggregation of drought events in space which is necessary for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction ling et al 2022 in view of the satellite remote sensing data availability and advances in spatio temporal analysis the development of methodologies to evaluate the dynamic evolution of drought is still in progress currently drought duration severity spatial extent as well as drought migration paths onset and end location are used to describe the drought dynamics however their behavior description methods for the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought events are not systematic and should be improved therefore a novel spatial variable of drought namely drought rotation is used in this study which is usually considered as a feature when tracking objects in spaces such as cyclones chavas et al 2017 rahman et al 2018 diaz et al 2020 it can visually reflect the dynamic migration characteristics of drought events in the circumferential direction and help to understand the control elements on driving the spatial behavior of drought so far this feature has not been applied and explored much in drought research northwestern china is located in the interior of eurasia it is influenced by three climate types including westerly climate plateau climate and southeast monsoon climate which causes significant differences in climate features between annual and inter annual scales given this background the primary aims of this study are to 1 identify the spatio temporal drought characteristics from three dimentional perspective 2 reveal the dynamic evolution process of individual drought events and 3 investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of migration features of classified drought events 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area northwestern china including shanxi gansu and qinghai provinces and the ningxia hui and the western part of inner mongolia autonomous regions is selected as the study area fig 1 it is located between 89 25 111 27 e and 31 33 42 48 n with a total area of approximately 1 87 million km2 which accounts for about 19 46 of china the altitude ranges from 184 mm to 6672 mm which represents significant difference in space and is decreasing from west to east the main terrain of study area consists of mountains plateaus and basins and the geomorphological pattern show as qinghai tibet plateau gobi desert desert steppe and loess plateau from west to east in proper order jiang et al 2022 the climate in the southeastern part of study area is controlled by the east asian monsoon called southeast climate zone whereas the other parts belong to the plateau climate and westerlies climate zone z b han et al 2021 which is dominated by dry and cold in winter and wet and hot in summer the annual precipitation ranges from 50 mm to 900 mm and most rains fall between june and september which accounts for 72 of the total annual precipitation the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 800 1600 mm with significant spatial variation decreasing from north to south the average annual temperature is about 9 with lower temperatures in higher elevations and higher temperatures in lower elevations cao et al 2021 2022 the study area is located in an arid and semi arid climate zone together with complex topographies it suffers from a lack of water resources the contradiction between water supply and demand is prominent and the drought events occur frequently in recent years on the basis of the records of china meteorological disaster dictionary and china flood and drought disaster typical drought events with serious severity are shown in supplementary material table s2 2 2 data soil moisture could directly influence transpiration and root water uptake of crops and is always considered as the governing parameter of the agricultural drought process thereby the soil moisture based index is more straightforward for agricultural drought assessment cai et al 2021 soil moisture data is often obtained through in situ observation land surface models or remote sensing methods and the latter two products have been widely used during the recent decades due to the advantages of long time series and continuous spatial coverage m cao et al 2022 using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques global land data assimilation system gldas ingests satellite and ground based observational data products and generates optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes gldas contains four land surface models i e noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model also the application of soil moisture datasets from gldas has been validated all over the world showing accurate performances liu et al 2019 cammalleri et al 2017 in this study the root zone soil moisture data during 1961 2018 extracted from gldasv2 0 noah were used for agricultural drought index calculation with temporal and spatial resolutions of month and 0 25 respectively these data products can be obtained online https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas noah025 m 2 0 the validation of the accuracy of soil moisture from gldas is shown in supplementary material fig s2 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized soil moisture index in this study the standardized soil moisture index ssmi is selected to assess and monitor the agricultural drought and the calculation process is similar to the standardized precipitation index spi however the difference from the spi is that the input variable of calculation for ssmi is replaced by soil moisture data and the probability distribution function is also changed to a normal distribution y li et al 2022 the normal distribution is selected as the optimal distribution of sm series is shown in supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 the main steps of the calculation are 1 obtaining the time series of soil moisture data at a certain time scale 2 computing the probability of the cumulative soil moisture data using normal distribution 3 converting to a cumulative distribution function cdf and then the ssmi is calculated by the inverse normalization of the cdf table 1 shows the agricultural drought classification standard 2 3 2 characterisation of drought dynamics in this study drought dynamics are defined in space and time which depends on tracking the drought area in each time step the complete characterization of drought dynamics can be realized based on two phases i e spatio temporal continuous drought events identification and drought migration trajectory identification and that is composed of the four main steps 1 drought clusters identification 2 temporal connection of drought clusters 3 centroids localization and 4 centroids linkage fig 2 2 3 2 1 drought clusters identification in the spatial context the spatial continuity of the grid cells in drought is determined at each time step three month timescale ssmi is used to extract drought clusters at each time step and the ssmi value of 1 is selected as the drought threshold i e ssmi 3 1 is concerned as drought condition first the location of these cells under drought condition are explored based on the binary algorithm a numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit 1 or 0 at each month and the value of 1 and 0 is used to shown drought and non drought condition in a certain cell respectively then the binary grid is scanned using 3 3 cells and the adjacent drought cells are merged into one cluster a new drought cluster is created until the nearest neighboring cells are not in drought the above procedures are implemented at each month and a lot of drought clusters marked with different symbols would be identified specially a drought cluster threshold a should be aforehand given eliminating the occurrence of spurious long drought events because of the tenuous spatial continuity the a value is approximately 1 6 of the study area i e 47 cells in this study which is similar to that used by xu et al 2015a the reason for selecting the area threshold 1 6 of the total area is described in supplementary material fig s4 2 3 2 2 temporal connection of drought clusters the temporal connection of drought clusters between adjacent months is determined by judging their overlap area a in space the drought clusters between adjacent months are considered as belonging to the same event if their overlap area conforms to the following two criteria 1 the overlap area between two clusters accounts for at least 50 of the smaller cluster 2 the overlap area a is larger than a the former is to ensure that two drought clusters are continuous and connected in space and the latter is to assure the effectiveness of the overlap area j li et al 2020 this searching process is repeated from the second month to the last ultimately all drought events are identified as a series of drought clusters in continuous time 2 3 2 3 centroids localisation in terms of drought cluster its centroid c is abstractly considered that the drought intensity of each grid cell is concentrated at this point and the coordinates of the centroid are calculated by weighting the drought intensity value of each grid cell within the drought cluster the geographic location of drought event in month is defined by the coordinates of the centroid at each time step 2 3 2 4 centroids linkage in terms of a drought event the spatial tracking of the drought event including the migration path path length direction velocity and rotation features can be completely recorded by connecting the location information of monthly drought clusters centroids after the application of above four steps seven spatio temporal drought variables can be extracted to visually overview the dynamic propagation process of drought the procedure for calculating drought characteristics is described in the following paragraph 1 drought duration d it is the time interval from the initiation to the termination of one event in the three dimensional drought structure it is defined as the time length between the beginning and ending time of the drought space fig 3 2 drought area a it refers to the total area affected by a drought event in the three dimensional drought structure it is defined as the projected area over the latitude longitude surface fig 3 3 drought severity s it indicates the degree of soil water deficit during a drought episode which is the volume of the three dimensional drought structure fig 3 4 drought centroid c in terms of the drought event it indicates the spatio temporal location longitude latitude time of the event fig 3 during the drought evolution process drought cluster centroids generate tracks as the drought migrate month by month which can reflect the spatial changes of a drought over time for a certain month the expressions of the two dimensional centroid c x k c y k of a drought cluster are as follows 1 c x k i 1 n s s m i k i x i i 1 n s s m i k i 2 c y k i 1 n s s m i k i y i i 1 n s s m i k i where n is the number of a drought cluster x i and y i respectively indicate the longitude and latitude of the ith cell center respectively and ssmi k i is the ssmi value of ith cell at k time step 5 drought migration distance md it represents the moving distance of the drought cluster centroid between two adjacent months regarding a drought event the spatio temporal migration distance is the total moving distance of drought cluster centroids between adjacent time steps over the whole drought duration the migration distance from the drought cluster centroid c x k c y k at k time step to the centroid c x k 1 c y k 1 at k 1 time step can be described as 3 m d c x k 1 c x k 2 c y k 1 c y k 2 6 drought migration orientation mo the main migration orientation of drought is determined based on the position where a drought trajectory starts and ends the initial and final positions are confirmed based on the centroids of the first and last clusters respectively fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the drought migration orientation identification the origin of the axes is the centroid of the study region there are five optional positions for the centroid of a particular cluster including center c east e north n west w and south s r min is the minimum radius from the center to the boundary r is the distance between the center and the cluster s centroid θ is the angle between the horizontal axis and the connecting line between the center and the cluster s centroid the criterion for discriminating the position of a cluster s centroid is listed in table 2 7 drought migration rotation mr it is defined as the circular direction feature of the drought tracks in space it is determined based on the coordinates x and y of the centroids the methodology is based on calculating a polygon area through the vector with the vertices represented by the coordinates x and y the calculation formula is as follows 4 m r x 1 x n y 1 y n i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i y i 1 y i generally there are two main classifications to define the rotation feature calling mostly clockwise and mostly anticlockwise when mr 0 rotation is categorized as mostly clockwise when mr 0 rotation is categorized as mostly anticlockwise when mr 0 rotation is not defined two examples of the calculation and discrimination process of drought migration rotation are shown in fig 5 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of drought characteristics a total of 169 agricultural drought events were identified based on ssmi 3 in northwestern china from 1961 to 2018 among which 124 agricultural drought events lasted for 2 months or more the statistical results of drought characteristics in different decades are shown in table 3 it can be found that the severity of drought in five serial decadal sub periods represented a trend of mitigation aggravation mitigation the number of drought events in the 1960 s was the least since the first two most serious agricultural drought events occurred in the 1960 s the annual average d a and s during this period were all the largest followed by the 1990 s fig 6 plots the temporal change trend of d a s and md in northwest china during 1961 2018 these drought variables showed fluctuating downward trend with gradients of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a respectively the four drought variables maintained at high levels in 1961 1967 and at low levels in 1972 1977 the a s and md peaked in 1962 and arrived at a minimum in 1972 3 2 dynamic process of typically individual drought event the most serious agricultural drought event that occurred from january 1961 to october 1962 was selected to reproduce the dynamic process of evolution fig 7 and fig 8 the detailed information was as follows this drought event originated in qinghai province in january 1961 the a was 0 39 106 km2 accounting for 22 3 of the study area the s was 0 57 106 month km2 from february to september drought magnitude was in the stage of fluctuating aggravation and reached the peak in july with the average a of 0 46 106 km2 and the average s of 0 67 106 month km2 the drought centers were all located in the middle of qinghai province from october to december drought magnitude showed a mitigation trend the a was mainly concentrated in the west of qinghai province average of about 17 1 of the study area the average s was 0 47 106 month km2 and the drought center migrated northwest with an average velocity of 61 53 km month from january to july 1962 this drought event was again in an aggravating stage and the drought magnitude peaked in july with the drought severity of 1 01 106 month km2 which was also the most serious state for this drought event the drought centers migrated towards northeast and further expanded to gansu province and inner mongolia autonomous region from august to october 1962 the drought event showed a weakening trend and gradually disappeared the a in october reduced to 0 06 106 km2 accounting for only 3 4 of the study area the s decreased to 0 09 106 month km2 the drought center migrated approximately 337 4 km eastward to the central gansu province to sum up this agricultural drought event in the study area occurred in january 1961 and lasted 22 months it migrated from central qinghai province towards the northeast to the central gansu province the migration path was roughly along with southwest to northeast direction and the drought event had generally experienced six processes occurrence aggravation mitigation re aggravation peak re mitigation extinction according to the records of china meteorological disaster dictionary qinghai volume and china flood and drought disaster a continuous drought event in spring and summer occurred in qinghai province in 1961 which was the second most serious drought year since 1949 this drought disaster hit about 161 thousand hm2 of crops and reduced grain yield by 34 6 million kg in particular the drought in jainca county of huangnan autonomic prefecture from march to july was very severe with crops affected by drought accounting for 72 9 of the total sown area the whole hainan tibetan autonomous prefecture suffered from drought and the disaster area of crops was about 5 04 thousand hm2 while there were 1 34 thousand hm2 of crops area were affected by drought disaster in haixi mongolian and tibetan autonomous prefecture in 1962 continuous drought events in spring and summer occurred in qinghai and gansu provinces while there were spring and summer drought events in the central and western inner mongolia autonomous region the drought records mentioned above were basically consistent with the results of the dynamic process of the most serious drought event in this study 3 3 evaluation of classified drought events 3 3 1 two month drought events during 1961 2018 a total of 169 drought events were identified of this total 28 had a duration equal to two months and 96 lasted longer than two months table 4 lists the elaboration agricultural drought characteristics information about the d equal to 2 months from 1961 to 2018 the area proportion of agricultural drought events with d 2 months was smaller only approximately accounted 4 of total study area besides 1st half and 2nd half year suffered agricultural drought was equal and both had 14 events table 4 in 1st and 2nd half year over northwest china we further obtained mean a was 0 08 106 km2 and 0 06 106 km2 respectively for the same period with respect to the mean s it was 0 16 106 month km2 and 0 12 106 month km2 respectively likewise the mean md was 46 02 km and 38 33 km during the two periods respectively compared with 2nd half year it was found that agricultural drought events that occurred in 1st half year appeared to be more severe and had faster migration velocity moreover the initiation and termination of drought events in 1st half year were in similar locations while 13 out of 14 in 2ed half year did so in other words the migration of agricultural drought events more occupied the same orientation and specific migration characteristic experienced from east to east e e from west to west w w and from south to south s s 3 3 2 within year drought events according to the start and end time of drought whether or not within the same year agricultural drought events with duration greater than 2 months can be divided into two groups within year drought event i e start and end time of drought appeared in the same year and cross year drought event namely start and end time appeared in different years in a similar way as arena et al 2006 note that spatiotemporal evolution of within year drought event and cross year drought event has significant difference previous researches reported that the change point of drought appeared in the 1980 s over northwestern china ren et al 2014 therefore the investigation period 1961 2018 was divided into two parts i e 1961 1980 hereafter referred to as 1st period and 1981 2018 hereafter referred to as 2nd period the reasonability of 1981 considered as the change point is shown in supplementary material fig s3 statistical characteristics of within year drought events in 1961 2018 are summarized in table 5 the suffered within year agricultural drought events over northwestern china has 9 and 25 events in the 1st period and 2nd period respectively generally the magnitude of within year drought events was roughly consistent during the two periods for the 1st period within year drought events mainly occupied by clockwise migration rotation on the contrary it turned to be anticlockwise migration rotation for the 2nd period note that within year drought events were mainly characterized migration in the same orientation e g e e s s and w w for the two periods fig 9 presents the relative frequency of within year drought characteristics in the 1st period and 2nd period in northwest china as indicated in fig 9a the initiation time of within year agricultural drought events mainly lay between january and august during the 1st period e g each 2 events in january february and march and each 1 event for may july and august for the termination time of within year agricultural drought events it mainly appeared in march to october and the highest frequency was 3 events in april the second was 2 events in august for the initiation time of within year agricultural drought events in 2nd period it concentrated on january to october and 7 events occurred in july and both 4 events appeared in may and august the termination time mainly condensed from march to december and the months with greater frequency were july september and october in terms of the initiation time of within year drought events it was obvious that they mostly started in the first three quarters of the year in each of the two sub periods while the termination time seems to frequently fell in the 2nd half year in addition the initial and final locations of within year agricultural drought events were both showed east west and south in the two periods and the predominant location was east figs 9c and 9d fig 10 displays the scatter points of within year agricultural drought characteristics for the pairs of d s and d a non significant linear relationships were shown seen in table 6 and the linear slope of the 2nd period was greater than that of the 1st period fig 10 it was found that the d a exhibited negative linear relationship in 1st period this interesting phenomenon may have resulted from the presence of within year drought events with long duration and weak severity in this period the significant linear relationship existed in the two cases of md s and md a in the 1st period and the slope of 1st period was higher than that of the 2nd period under the scenario of md 85 km and at the same time with the same md value the s and a of within year agricultural drought events during 2nd period were greater than that of the 1st period whereas md 85 km the situation opposed in the two periods fig 10 points out that s and a both increase with the enlargement of md but the decreasing trend instead of increasing after md reaching a certain value e g about 300 km the spatial patterns of within year agricultural drought events for the 1st period and 2nd period in northwest china are shown in figs 11 and 12 as shown in fig 11 the relatively severe agricultural drought events with long duration and great severity were primarily located in the western alxa league of inner mongolia indicating that this region was the heart of agricultural drought area in northwestern china the moderate agricultural drought events were sparsely distributed in gansu and qinghai there were 6 events showing clockwise rotation of migration in the 1st period and 4 of them were characterized by the zonal distribution from northwest to southeast in gansu these drought events presented same migration orientation in addition 3 events exhibited anticlockwise rotation of migration in the 1st period and the migration orientations were diversity including e s w s and e e from fig 12 alxa league of inner mongolia and northwestern qinghai were two important drought zones during the 2nd period where the most severe within year drought events were generally concentrated the slightly agricultural drought events were mainly distributed in the eastern part of study area the spatial patterns of within year drought characteristics in the 2nd period were generally consistent with that of the 1st period the within year agricultural drought events presented clockwise migration rotation in inner mongolia and mainly held on the migration orientation of e e for severe within year agricultural drought events in qinghai different migration orientations occurred and mainly characterized by clockwise migration rotation meanwhile it was observed that the initiation and termination location of within year drought events in other regions were also similar 3 3 3 cross year drought events table 7 summarizes statistical information on characteristics of cross year agricultural drought events there were 22 and 40 cross year agricultural drought events hit northwestern china for the 1st period and 2nd period respectively the mean d a s and md of cross year agricultural drought events for the 1st period were 11 95 months 0 27 106 km2 2 56 106 month km2 and 520 07 km respectively likewise these characteristics for the 2nd period were 10 95 month 0 24 106 km2 2 06 106 month km2 and 468 17 km respectively these phenomena indicated more severe cross year agricultural drought situation in the 1st period compared with the 2nd period in the two sub periods cross year drought events with migration rotation of clockwise and anticlockwise were balanced and same migration orientation was dominated the highest frequency of migration orientation was e e and the second was w w and s s fig 13 shows the frequency of cross year agricultural drought characteristics during the period of 1961 2018 it was found that the initiation time of cross year agricultural drought events mainly focused on 2nd half year in each of the two sub periods for the initiation time of cross year agricultural drought events the highest frequency was november 5 events for the 1st period and september 9 events for the 2nd period moreover the termination time of cross year agricultural drought events seems to mostly concentrated in the first three quarters from february to october in the two sub periods the months with slightly greater frequency for the 1st period were june april and july while they were may and july for the 2nd period the initial and final location of the two sub periods both presented as east west and south and the highest frequency orientation both were east respecting the cross year agricultural drought events fig 14 shows the correlation relationship between different drought characteristics corresponding significance tests all passed p 0 01 are listed in table 6 significant linear relationship was presented for the pairs of d s d a md s and md a the slope of d s and md s in the 1st period is more than that of 2nd period when d 9 months or md 274 km the s in the 1st period was larger than the 2nd period under the same d or md conditions on the contrary when d 9 months or md 274 km the s in the 2nd period was lower than the 1st period additionally it was observed that the a increased proportionally to the d and md with a similar slope in the two sub periods fig 15 presents the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought characteristics in the 1st period cross year agricultural drought events were generally distributed on both sides of gansu and ningxia there were 6 cross year drought events located in inner mongolia 5 events lay in shaanxi and 11 events concentrated in qinghai it was observed that central qinghai was the major drought center area due to numerous severe agricultural drought events filled here moreover secondary drought center areas were in central alxa league of inner mongolia and southern shaanxi where occurred a number of drought events with smaller magnitude meanwhile the migration orientation and rotation of agricultural drought events exhibited apparently spatial patterns for example 10 out of 11 events of drought migration orientation revealed e e in inner mongolia and shaanxi and 7 events showed anticlockwise rotation apparently among the 11 agricultural drought events in qinghai 9 events migrated in the same orientation which mainly included w w and s s and 7 events migrated with clockwise rotation characteristic fig 16 shows the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought characteristics in the 2nd period evident regularity was presented over the three climate zones for cross year agricultural drought events agricultural drought events with large magnitude hit westerly and southeast climate zones whereas agricultural drought events with small magnitude mainly focused on plateau climate zone compared with the 1st period fig 16a the agricultural drought severity had slightly weakened in the plateau climate zone while the higher agricultural drought risk was experienced in the westerly and southeast climate zones the migration rotation of cross year agricultural drought events mainly characterized by clockwise in the plateau and southeast climate zones and that was anticlockwise rotation in the westerly climate zone in eastern study area the same migration orientation of e e accounted for 95 of cross year agricultural drought events and mostly characterized by w w and s s migration orientation in the western study area which was similar to the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought events in the 1st period 4 discussion 4 1 reasons for the variation of agricultural drought in northwest china with respect to the temporal variation of drought in northwestern china results of drought duration severity area and migration distance in this study exhibited that the agricultural drought showed a downward tendency while the 1980 s was the turning point of drought similar conclusions have also been reached in other studies h j wang et al 2017 z l wang et al 2017 found that there were two evident contrasting periods about drought during 1961 2010 sustaining drought conditions existed during 1961 1986 whereas wet conditions dominated after 1986 h li et al 2022 reported a weakening drought in northwestern china based on the increasing trends of spi series moreover they also pointed out the late 1980 s was the abrupt wetting point of drought in relation to the spatial distribution of agricultural drought fig 17 displays an overview of the spatial patterns of the total number of drought events and the accumulated ssmi it could be found that the above two drought characteristic parameters present similar spatial pattern during 1961 2018 the west of inner mongolia and the central qinghai experienced comparatively high frequency 45 events and more severe 60 the smaller accumulated ssmi indicates the more severe droughts agricultural droughts over 1961 1980 in addition the junction of yushu haixi and guoluo prefecture in qinghai endured the most severe drought condition followed by alxa league during 1981 2018 the east of the study region especially qingyang city in gansu and southern zhongwei city in ningxia suffered more severe drought condition as the number of drought events 60 the accumulated ssmi 100 the above results as shown in fig 16 are in line with the findings of yang et al 2018 cai et al 2021 and li and wang 2016 remarkably it seems that the current discussion on dry and wet climate change in northwest china can explain the agricultural drought patterns in this study recently a number of researches indicated that the present climate change in northwest china has been from warm dry to warm wet shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 the change characteristics of average precipitation and temperature are relatively stable during 1961 1986 since 1987 average temperature showed an abrupt increasing trend with a change rate of 0 52 10a while the average annual precipitation also increased significantly chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in addition the variation of precipitation in northwest china showed obvious spatial differences in the last 60 years and annual precipitation presented a significant upward trend in the central and west of the study region and a downward trend in the eastern regions wei and wang 2013 wen et al 2017 while the temperature displayed a trend of consistent increasing throughout the whole northwest region and the degree of warming has gradually increased zhang et al 2022 from soil moisture perspective precipitation had positive effect on it while the influence of temperature on soil moisture was negative and precipitation made greater contributions to soil moisture variations than temperature therefore the variation of soil moisture indicated that climate change in the western regions tended to be warm wet while it tended to be warm dry in the eastern regions wang et al 2018 water balance i e evaluating the precipitation and evaporation simultaneously could reflect the variation of dryness wetness more intuitively huo et al 2013 used the humidity index to analyze the climatic changes in northwest china it found that the humidity index increased and the climate became wetter in the western regions due to the increase of precipitation and the decrease of evaporation whereas the humidity index decreased and the climate became dryer in the eastern regions because of the increased amplitude of evaporation more than that of precipitation 4 2 reasonability of spatiotemporal migration features of drought regarding to the initiation and termination location as well as the migration orientation and rotation of identified drought events it is not found similar research for the study area apparently the performance of two main migration orientation and rotation of drought events in northwest china is not stochastic which is likely to be associated with the sensitivity of precipitation to climate change and atmospheric circulation xing and wang 2017 generally the atmospheric water vapor transports and the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the northwest china is jointly dominated by the westerly wind circulation and monsoon circulation the west part of study area is mainly affected by westerly circulation and the east part is primarily influenced by monsoon circulation zhang et al 2019b the water vapor in atlantic ocean arctic ocean black sea and caspian sea is transported into northwest china following the prevailing westerly which is the important origin for supplying the precipitation peng and zhou 2017 northwest china straddles the northern edge of the east asian summer monsoon and the boundary line demonstrates noticeable inter decadal oscillation zhang et al 2021 the average northern edge moves northward in strong summer monsoon years the height field is higher in the west and lower in the east and a large area of water vapor flux convergence while the opposite performance occurs in weak summer monsoon years liu et al 2018 the summer monsoon interacts with the westerly zone and the influence of interannual variation of the westerly on the convergence divergence of wind field is the main cause of water vapor transport in northwest china the change in summer monsoon affects the westerly through the adjustment of circulation structure which then impacts the water vapor transport by the westerly overall the westerly and monsoon have different influences on the northwest inland the westerly directly affects the precipitation in northwest china the monsoon indirectly affect the precipitation by adjusting the westerly causing obvious difference in the regions of rainfall the spatial variation of the precipitation of the monsoon season as well as its concentration in time can cause a modification in the spatiotemporal distribution of the drought areas these results can partially explain the change in patterns of the initiation and termination location as well as the migration orientation and rotation of drought events 4 3 advantages and limitations the drought structure extracted from a three dimensional perspective in this study has advantages in describing the development process and dynamic evolution of drought events the geometric and physical characteristics inside and outside the drought structure can be extracted making it easy to visualize their spatio temporal distribution pattern and analyze their dynamic evolution characteristics particularly the calculation and further analysis of drought migration orientation and rotation along with outcome on drought duration severity and areas may be useful to answer the following issues on drought dynamics diaz et al 2020 what are the main places where drought frequently occurs and remains what are the predominant paths followed by drought how about the dynamic migration state of individual drought event this drought structure extraction method also can be used to visualize the dynamic spatio temporal distribution pattern and movement of drought events in the future which predicts the frequent occurrence and remains places of drought events and their predominant migration paths then the water resources administration can targetedly arrange drought resistance strategies in advance minimizing the drougth risk and losses moreover compared with the drought variables extracted from low dimensions the estimation of the return period of drought events is more accurate from spatial and temporal perspective xu et al 2015b therefore identifying drought events from a three dimensional perspective could provide some important implications for drought dynamic migration and improve the rationality of drought risk assessment there are still some limitations in this study drought index is the only considered information for identifying the spatial extent of drought drought index is calculated based on soil moisture however the human activities may cause changes in land use which also can influence the delineation of drought areas moreover a unique drought area threshold was used for the determination of the spatial extent in future studies more factors should be included to evaluate the drought condition on the land surface and it is suggested to explore the sensitivity of other area threshold values on drought cluster identification 5 conclusions in this study a method that identifies drought events from three dimensional is improved which proposes more spatial drought variables such as migration orientation and rotation the ssmi calculated based on soil moisture data is used to monitor and assess agricultural drought in northwest china during 1961 2018 then drought events determined using the modified identification method are classified to investigate their spatio temporal patterns and the characteristics of corresponding events duration severity area start and end location migration rotation et al are also extracted to reveal the dynamic migration process of drought events the main conclusions are as follows 1 a total of 169 agricultural drought events were identified based on ssmi 3 the drought duration area severity and migration distance showed fluctuating downward trend with the rate of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a from an interdecadal scale drought magnitude represented a trend of mitigation aggravation mitigation from 1960 s to 2000 s 2 the dynamic migration process of individual drought events was objectively and effectively depicted from three dimensional for the most severe drought event it occurred from january 1961 to october in 1962 the start and end location were south and east respectively the migration trajectory with mostly clockwise migration was roughly along with the southwest to northeast direction meanwhile the identified drought events were validated based on the historical drought records in the study area 3 124 agricultural drought events lasted for 2 months or more which were classified into three types namely two month drought within year drought and cross year drought events overall a more severe agricultural drought situation appeared over 1961 1980 compared with the period of 1981 2018 east to east west to west and south to south migration orientations presented the highest relative frequencies in 1961 2018 within year drought events mostly started in the first three quarters of the year and finished in the second half year the situation was reversed for the cross year drought events 4 in space the most severe drought events were generally distributed in alxa league of inner mongolia and northwest qinghai province drought events migrated with clockwise rotation characteristic were mostly concentrated in plateau and southeast climate zones and that was anticlockwise rotation in westerly climate zone east to east pathways were mainly located in the east part of study area while west to west and south to south migration orientations were distributed in the west part declaration of competing

8903,drought evolution is a complex dynamic process showing continuous characteristics in space time currently the researches on drought dynamics from multiple dimensions are limited and should be improved further therefore a three dimensional identification method was adopted to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of classified drought events namely two month drought events within year drought events and cross year drought events in northwest china during1961 2018 furthermore more spatial variables of drought event such as start and end location drought orientation and rotation were extracted to describe the dynamic migration trajectories of drought events significantly drought rotation helped to reveal the forcing mechanisms such as the influence of climate and land surface behind their spatial development the results showed that a total of 169 drought events were identified over 1961 2018 and drought variables duration area severity and migration distance represented fluctuating decreasing trend with the rate of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a the dynamic migration process of individual drought event was objectively and effectively depicted from a three dimensional perspective which was consistent with the historical drought records in study area regarding the classified events drought magnitude was more severe in 1961 1980 than that in 1981 2018 and three primary migration patterns east to east west to west and south to south were identified in northwest china within year drought events mostly started in the first three quarters and finished in the second half year whilst the situation was reversed for the cross year drought events spatially alxa league of inner mongolia and northwest qinghai province were two main drought centers additionally drought events characterized by clockwise rotation migration were mostly distributed in the plateau and southeast climate zones and that was anticlockwise rotation in the westerly climate zone noticeably the east to east pathways were mainly located in the east part of the study area while the west to west and south to south trajectories were dominated in the west part keywords three dimensional perspective drought identification dynamic process drought classification characteristic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the extreme hydro climatic events such as drought and flood frequently occurred under global climate change which brings more serious challenges to flood control and drought relief dai et al 2020 han et al 2021 drought refers to an imbalance of water supply and demand that triggered by a prolonged lack of precipitation or excessive evapotranspiration over a region for months or years wang et al 2017a it is a regional migration phenomenon characterized by significantly temporal continuity and spatial dynamics behavior causing serious damage to the water resources ecological environment and social economy l c li et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of the spatio temporal dynamic evolution of drought is crucial for early warning systems and formulating reliable resistance strategies to ensure food security recently many studies have been devoted to the drought evaluation about its temporal e g frequency period and spatial e g area severity characteristics ferijal et al 2021 wang and liu 2022 for example statistical methods such as mann kendall trend analysis kalisa et al 2020 wavelet analysis feng and su 2019 empirical orthogonal functions zhou and liu 2018 and principal component analysis had provided useful reference for the estimation of spatio temporal characteristics of drought similar studies were implemented in other areas sun et al 2018 he et al 2021 byakatonda et al 2018 these researches generally reduced drought events to a lower order subspace and analyzed the driught evolution from temporal and spatial scale separately in other word they mainly fpcus on the temporal evolution of drought in a given space domain or spatial distributions of drought in a given time domain separately zhou et al 2019 in reality drought events often show distinct heterogeneity and continuity properties at different spatio temporal scales liu et al 2021 wen et al 2020 therefore the lower dimension subspace drought characteristics analysis cannot sufficiently capture the real spatio temporal continuous evolution characteristics of drought events in order to improve spatial tracking and simulation ability of drought the spatio temporal synchronous identification and characterization of drought events have been studied in the last decades andreadis et al 2005 proposed a clustering algorithm to consider the spatial and temporal property of individual drought events as a contiguous portion and used severity area duration curves to merge the spatio temporal information into drought characterization lloyd hughes 2012 extended the clustering algorithm into three dimensional space and applied the explicit drought identification method in drought analysis across european thereafter the three dimensional framework was adopted by many later researches such as xu et al 2015a chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 feng et al 2021 luo et al 2022 and j li et al 2022 compared with the lower dimension subspace drought analysis the 3 d drought identification method could extract more drought information and elucidate the dynamic variation of drought characteristics in a space time continuous perspective which are informative in exploring the spatio temporal structure and processes of actual drought events posteriorly the trajectory information is considered into the spatio temporal dynamic propagation process of drought events which is only limited to a few studies herrera estrada et al 2017 implemented the spatial tracking of drought events based on calculating the displacement between consecutive centroids in time which can describe how drought moves in space and time diaz et al 2019 proposed an approach to build the spatial path of drought such a path can explicitly define the onset and end of each drought event over time and space the aforementioned spatio temporal information of drought particularly its barycenter location and paths can not only describe the evolution trend of drought events over time but also reflect the liquidity and aggregation of drought events in space which is necessary for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction ling et al 2022 in view of the satellite remote sensing data availability and advances in spatio temporal analysis the development of methodologies to evaluate the dynamic evolution of drought is still in progress currently drought duration severity spatial extent as well as drought migration paths onset and end location are used to describe the drought dynamics however their behavior description methods for the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought events are not systematic and should be improved therefore a novel spatial variable of drought namely drought rotation is used in this study which is usually considered as a feature when tracking objects in spaces such as cyclones chavas et al 2017 rahman et al 2018 diaz et al 2020 it can visually reflect the dynamic migration characteristics of drought events in the circumferential direction and help to understand the control elements on driving the spatial behavior of drought so far this feature has not been applied and explored much in drought research northwestern china is located in the interior of eurasia it is influenced by three climate types including westerly climate plateau climate and southeast monsoon climate which causes significant differences in climate features between annual and inter annual scales given this background the primary aims of this study are to 1 identify the spatio temporal drought characteristics from three dimentional perspective 2 reveal the dynamic evolution process of individual drought events and 3 investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of migration features of classified drought events 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area northwestern china including shanxi gansu and qinghai provinces and the ningxia hui and the western part of inner mongolia autonomous regions is selected as the study area fig 1 it is located between 89 25 111 27 e and 31 33 42 48 n with a total area of approximately 1 87 million km2 which accounts for about 19 46 of china the altitude ranges from 184 mm to 6672 mm which represents significant difference in space and is decreasing from west to east the main terrain of study area consists of mountains plateaus and basins and the geomorphological pattern show as qinghai tibet plateau gobi desert desert steppe and loess plateau from west to east in proper order jiang et al 2022 the climate in the southeastern part of study area is controlled by the east asian monsoon called southeast climate zone whereas the other parts belong to the plateau climate and westerlies climate zone z b han et al 2021 which is dominated by dry and cold in winter and wet and hot in summer the annual precipitation ranges from 50 mm to 900 mm and most rains fall between june and september which accounts for 72 of the total annual precipitation the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 800 1600 mm with significant spatial variation decreasing from north to south the average annual temperature is about 9 with lower temperatures in higher elevations and higher temperatures in lower elevations cao et al 2021 2022 the study area is located in an arid and semi arid climate zone together with complex topographies it suffers from a lack of water resources the contradiction between water supply and demand is prominent and the drought events occur frequently in recent years on the basis of the records of china meteorological disaster dictionary and china flood and drought disaster typical drought events with serious severity are shown in supplementary material table s2 2 2 data soil moisture could directly influence transpiration and root water uptake of crops and is always considered as the governing parameter of the agricultural drought process thereby the soil moisture based index is more straightforward for agricultural drought assessment cai et al 2021 soil moisture data is often obtained through in situ observation land surface models or remote sensing methods and the latter two products have been widely used during the recent decades due to the advantages of long time series and continuous spatial coverage m cao et al 2022 using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques global land data assimilation system gldas ingests satellite and ground based observational data products and generates optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes gldas contains four land surface models i e noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model also the application of soil moisture datasets from gldas has been validated all over the world showing accurate performances liu et al 2019 cammalleri et al 2017 in this study the root zone soil moisture data during 1961 2018 extracted from gldasv2 0 noah were used for agricultural drought index calculation with temporal and spatial resolutions of month and 0 25 respectively these data products can be obtained online https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas noah025 m 2 0 the validation of the accuracy of soil moisture from gldas is shown in supplementary material fig s2 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized soil moisture index in this study the standardized soil moisture index ssmi is selected to assess and monitor the agricultural drought and the calculation process is similar to the standardized precipitation index spi however the difference from the spi is that the input variable of calculation for ssmi is replaced by soil moisture data and the probability distribution function is also changed to a normal distribution y li et al 2022 the normal distribution is selected as the optimal distribution of sm series is shown in supplementary material fig s1 and table s1 the main steps of the calculation are 1 obtaining the time series of soil moisture data at a certain time scale 2 computing the probability of the cumulative soil moisture data using normal distribution 3 converting to a cumulative distribution function cdf and then the ssmi is calculated by the inverse normalization of the cdf table 1 shows the agricultural drought classification standard 2 3 2 characterisation of drought dynamics in this study drought dynamics are defined in space and time which depends on tracking the drought area in each time step the complete characterization of drought dynamics can be realized based on two phases i e spatio temporal continuous drought events identification and drought migration trajectory identification and that is composed of the four main steps 1 drought clusters identification 2 temporal connection of drought clusters 3 centroids localization and 4 centroids linkage fig 2 2 3 2 1 drought clusters identification in the spatial context the spatial continuity of the grid cells in drought is determined at each time step three month timescale ssmi is used to extract drought clusters at each time step and the ssmi value of 1 is selected as the drought threshold i e ssmi 3 1 is concerned as drought condition first the location of these cells under drought condition are explored based on the binary algorithm a numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit 1 or 0 at each month and the value of 1 and 0 is used to shown drought and non drought condition in a certain cell respectively then the binary grid is scanned using 3 3 cells and the adjacent drought cells are merged into one cluster a new drought cluster is created until the nearest neighboring cells are not in drought the above procedures are implemented at each month and a lot of drought clusters marked with different symbols would be identified specially a drought cluster threshold a should be aforehand given eliminating the occurrence of spurious long drought events because of the tenuous spatial continuity the a value is approximately 1 6 of the study area i e 47 cells in this study which is similar to that used by xu et al 2015a the reason for selecting the area threshold 1 6 of the total area is described in supplementary material fig s4 2 3 2 2 temporal connection of drought clusters the temporal connection of drought clusters between adjacent months is determined by judging their overlap area a in space the drought clusters between adjacent months are considered as belonging to the same event if their overlap area conforms to the following two criteria 1 the overlap area between two clusters accounts for at least 50 of the smaller cluster 2 the overlap area a is larger than a the former is to ensure that two drought clusters are continuous and connected in space and the latter is to assure the effectiveness of the overlap area j li et al 2020 this searching process is repeated from the second month to the last ultimately all drought events are identified as a series of drought clusters in continuous time 2 3 2 3 centroids localisation in terms of drought cluster its centroid c is abstractly considered that the drought intensity of each grid cell is concentrated at this point and the coordinates of the centroid are calculated by weighting the drought intensity value of each grid cell within the drought cluster the geographic location of drought event in month is defined by the coordinates of the centroid at each time step 2 3 2 4 centroids linkage in terms of a drought event the spatial tracking of the drought event including the migration path path length direction velocity and rotation features can be completely recorded by connecting the location information of monthly drought clusters centroids after the application of above four steps seven spatio temporal drought variables can be extracted to visually overview the dynamic propagation process of drought the procedure for calculating drought characteristics is described in the following paragraph 1 drought duration d it is the time interval from the initiation to the termination of one event in the three dimensional drought structure it is defined as the time length between the beginning and ending time of the drought space fig 3 2 drought area a it refers to the total area affected by a drought event in the three dimensional drought structure it is defined as the projected area over the latitude longitude surface fig 3 3 drought severity s it indicates the degree of soil water deficit during a drought episode which is the volume of the three dimensional drought structure fig 3 4 drought centroid c in terms of the drought event it indicates the spatio temporal location longitude latitude time of the event fig 3 during the drought evolution process drought cluster centroids generate tracks as the drought migrate month by month which can reflect the spatial changes of a drought over time for a certain month the expressions of the two dimensional centroid c x k c y k of a drought cluster are as follows 1 c x k i 1 n s s m i k i x i i 1 n s s m i k i 2 c y k i 1 n s s m i k i y i i 1 n s s m i k i where n is the number of a drought cluster x i and y i respectively indicate the longitude and latitude of the ith cell center respectively and ssmi k i is the ssmi value of ith cell at k time step 5 drought migration distance md it represents the moving distance of the drought cluster centroid between two adjacent months regarding a drought event the spatio temporal migration distance is the total moving distance of drought cluster centroids between adjacent time steps over the whole drought duration the migration distance from the drought cluster centroid c x k c y k at k time step to the centroid c x k 1 c y k 1 at k 1 time step can be described as 3 m d c x k 1 c x k 2 c y k 1 c y k 2 6 drought migration orientation mo the main migration orientation of drought is determined based on the position where a drought trajectory starts and ends the initial and final positions are confirmed based on the centroids of the first and last clusters respectively fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the drought migration orientation identification the origin of the axes is the centroid of the study region there are five optional positions for the centroid of a particular cluster including center c east e north n west w and south s r min is the minimum radius from the center to the boundary r is the distance between the center and the cluster s centroid θ is the angle between the horizontal axis and the connecting line between the center and the cluster s centroid the criterion for discriminating the position of a cluster s centroid is listed in table 2 7 drought migration rotation mr it is defined as the circular direction feature of the drought tracks in space it is determined based on the coordinates x and y of the centroids the methodology is based on calculating a polygon area through the vector with the vertices represented by the coordinates x and y the calculation formula is as follows 4 m r x 1 x n y 1 y n i 1 n 1 x i 1 x i y i 1 y i generally there are two main classifications to define the rotation feature calling mostly clockwise and mostly anticlockwise when mr 0 rotation is categorized as mostly clockwise when mr 0 rotation is categorized as mostly anticlockwise when mr 0 rotation is not defined two examples of the calculation and discrimination process of drought migration rotation are shown in fig 5 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of drought characteristics a total of 169 agricultural drought events were identified based on ssmi 3 in northwestern china from 1961 to 2018 among which 124 agricultural drought events lasted for 2 months or more the statistical results of drought characteristics in different decades are shown in table 3 it can be found that the severity of drought in five serial decadal sub periods represented a trend of mitigation aggravation mitigation the number of drought events in the 1960 s was the least since the first two most serious agricultural drought events occurred in the 1960 s the annual average d a and s during this period were all the largest followed by the 1990 s fig 6 plots the temporal change trend of d a s and md in northwest china during 1961 2018 these drought variables showed fluctuating downward trend with gradients of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a respectively the four drought variables maintained at high levels in 1961 1967 and at low levels in 1972 1977 the a s and md peaked in 1962 and arrived at a minimum in 1972 3 2 dynamic process of typically individual drought event the most serious agricultural drought event that occurred from january 1961 to october 1962 was selected to reproduce the dynamic process of evolution fig 7 and fig 8 the detailed information was as follows this drought event originated in qinghai province in january 1961 the a was 0 39 106 km2 accounting for 22 3 of the study area the s was 0 57 106 month km2 from february to september drought magnitude was in the stage of fluctuating aggravation and reached the peak in july with the average a of 0 46 106 km2 and the average s of 0 67 106 month km2 the drought centers were all located in the middle of qinghai province from october to december drought magnitude showed a mitigation trend the a was mainly concentrated in the west of qinghai province average of about 17 1 of the study area the average s was 0 47 106 month km2 and the drought center migrated northwest with an average velocity of 61 53 km month from january to july 1962 this drought event was again in an aggravating stage and the drought magnitude peaked in july with the drought severity of 1 01 106 month km2 which was also the most serious state for this drought event the drought centers migrated towards northeast and further expanded to gansu province and inner mongolia autonomous region from august to october 1962 the drought event showed a weakening trend and gradually disappeared the a in october reduced to 0 06 106 km2 accounting for only 3 4 of the study area the s decreased to 0 09 106 month km2 the drought center migrated approximately 337 4 km eastward to the central gansu province to sum up this agricultural drought event in the study area occurred in january 1961 and lasted 22 months it migrated from central qinghai province towards the northeast to the central gansu province the migration path was roughly along with southwest to northeast direction and the drought event had generally experienced six processes occurrence aggravation mitigation re aggravation peak re mitigation extinction according to the records of china meteorological disaster dictionary qinghai volume and china flood and drought disaster a continuous drought event in spring and summer occurred in qinghai province in 1961 which was the second most serious drought year since 1949 this drought disaster hit about 161 thousand hm2 of crops and reduced grain yield by 34 6 million kg in particular the drought in jainca county of huangnan autonomic prefecture from march to july was very severe with crops affected by drought accounting for 72 9 of the total sown area the whole hainan tibetan autonomous prefecture suffered from drought and the disaster area of crops was about 5 04 thousand hm2 while there were 1 34 thousand hm2 of crops area were affected by drought disaster in haixi mongolian and tibetan autonomous prefecture in 1962 continuous drought events in spring and summer occurred in qinghai and gansu provinces while there were spring and summer drought events in the central and western inner mongolia autonomous region the drought records mentioned above were basically consistent with the results of the dynamic process of the most serious drought event in this study 3 3 evaluation of classified drought events 3 3 1 two month drought events during 1961 2018 a total of 169 drought events were identified of this total 28 had a duration equal to two months and 96 lasted longer than two months table 4 lists the elaboration agricultural drought characteristics information about the d equal to 2 months from 1961 to 2018 the area proportion of agricultural drought events with d 2 months was smaller only approximately accounted 4 of total study area besides 1st half and 2nd half year suffered agricultural drought was equal and both had 14 events table 4 in 1st and 2nd half year over northwest china we further obtained mean a was 0 08 106 km2 and 0 06 106 km2 respectively for the same period with respect to the mean s it was 0 16 106 month km2 and 0 12 106 month km2 respectively likewise the mean md was 46 02 km and 38 33 km during the two periods respectively compared with 2nd half year it was found that agricultural drought events that occurred in 1st half year appeared to be more severe and had faster migration velocity moreover the initiation and termination of drought events in 1st half year were in similar locations while 13 out of 14 in 2ed half year did so in other words the migration of agricultural drought events more occupied the same orientation and specific migration characteristic experienced from east to east e e from west to west w w and from south to south s s 3 3 2 within year drought events according to the start and end time of drought whether or not within the same year agricultural drought events with duration greater than 2 months can be divided into two groups within year drought event i e start and end time of drought appeared in the same year and cross year drought event namely start and end time appeared in different years in a similar way as arena et al 2006 note that spatiotemporal evolution of within year drought event and cross year drought event has significant difference previous researches reported that the change point of drought appeared in the 1980 s over northwestern china ren et al 2014 therefore the investigation period 1961 2018 was divided into two parts i e 1961 1980 hereafter referred to as 1st period and 1981 2018 hereafter referred to as 2nd period the reasonability of 1981 considered as the change point is shown in supplementary material fig s3 statistical characteristics of within year drought events in 1961 2018 are summarized in table 5 the suffered within year agricultural drought events over northwestern china has 9 and 25 events in the 1st period and 2nd period respectively generally the magnitude of within year drought events was roughly consistent during the two periods for the 1st period within year drought events mainly occupied by clockwise migration rotation on the contrary it turned to be anticlockwise migration rotation for the 2nd period note that within year drought events were mainly characterized migration in the same orientation e g e e s s and w w for the two periods fig 9 presents the relative frequency of within year drought characteristics in the 1st period and 2nd period in northwest china as indicated in fig 9a the initiation time of within year agricultural drought events mainly lay between january and august during the 1st period e g each 2 events in january february and march and each 1 event for may july and august for the termination time of within year agricultural drought events it mainly appeared in march to october and the highest frequency was 3 events in april the second was 2 events in august for the initiation time of within year agricultural drought events in 2nd period it concentrated on january to october and 7 events occurred in july and both 4 events appeared in may and august the termination time mainly condensed from march to december and the months with greater frequency were july september and october in terms of the initiation time of within year drought events it was obvious that they mostly started in the first three quarters of the year in each of the two sub periods while the termination time seems to frequently fell in the 2nd half year in addition the initial and final locations of within year agricultural drought events were both showed east west and south in the two periods and the predominant location was east figs 9c and 9d fig 10 displays the scatter points of within year agricultural drought characteristics for the pairs of d s and d a non significant linear relationships were shown seen in table 6 and the linear slope of the 2nd period was greater than that of the 1st period fig 10 it was found that the d a exhibited negative linear relationship in 1st period this interesting phenomenon may have resulted from the presence of within year drought events with long duration and weak severity in this period the significant linear relationship existed in the two cases of md s and md a in the 1st period and the slope of 1st period was higher than that of the 2nd period under the scenario of md 85 km and at the same time with the same md value the s and a of within year agricultural drought events during 2nd period were greater than that of the 1st period whereas md 85 km the situation opposed in the two periods fig 10 points out that s and a both increase with the enlargement of md but the decreasing trend instead of increasing after md reaching a certain value e g about 300 km the spatial patterns of within year agricultural drought events for the 1st period and 2nd period in northwest china are shown in figs 11 and 12 as shown in fig 11 the relatively severe agricultural drought events with long duration and great severity were primarily located in the western alxa league of inner mongolia indicating that this region was the heart of agricultural drought area in northwestern china the moderate agricultural drought events were sparsely distributed in gansu and qinghai there were 6 events showing clockwise rotation of migration in the 1st period and 4 of them were characterized by the zonal distribution from northwest to southeast in gansu these drought events presented same migration orientation in addition 3 events exhibited anticlockwise rotation of migration in the 1st period and the migration orientations were diversity including e s w s and e e from fig 12 alxa league of inner mongolia and northwestern qinghai were two important drought zones during the 2nd period where the most severe within year drought events were generally concentrated the slightly agricultural drought events were mainly distributed in the eastern part of study area the spatial patterns of within year drought characteristics in the 2nd period were generally consistent with that of the 1st period the within year agricultural drought events presented clockwise migration rotation in inner mongolia and mainly held on the migration orientation of e e for severe within year agricultural drought events in qinghai different migration orientations occurred and mainly characterized by clockwise migration rotation meanwhile it was observed that the initiation and termination location of within year drought events in other regions were also similar 3 3 3 cross year drought events table 7 summarizes statistical information on characteristics of cross year agricultural drought events there were 22 and 40 cross year agricultural drought events hit northwestern china for the 1st period and 2nd period respectively the mean d a s and md of cross year agricultural drought events for the 1st period were 11 95 months 0 27 106 km2 2 56 106 month km2 and 520 07 km respectively likewise these characteristics for the 2nd period were 10 95 month 0 24 106 km2 2 06 106 month km2 and 468 17 km respectively these phenomena indicated more severe cross year agricultural drought situation in the 1st period compared with the 2nd period in the two sub periods cross year drought events with migration rotation of clockwise and anticlockwise were balanced and same migration orientation was dominated the highest frequency of migration orientation was e e and the second was w w and s s fig 13 shows the frequency of cross year agricultural drought characteristics during the period of 1961 2018 it was found that the initiation time of cross year agricultural drought events mainly focused on 2nd half year in each of the two sub periods for the initiation time of cross year agricultural drought events the highest frequency was november 5 events for the 1st period and september 9 events for the 2nd period moreover the termination time of cross year agricultural drought events seems to mostly concentrated in the first three quarters from february to october in the two sub periods the months with slightly greater frequency for the 1st period were june april and july while they were may and july for the 2nd period the initial and final location of the two sub periods both presented as east west and south and the highest frequency orientation both were east respecting the cross year agricultural drought events fig 14 shows the correlation relationship between different drought characteristics corresponding significance tests all passed p 0 01 are listed in table 6 significant linear relationship was presented for the pairs of d s d a md s and md a the slope of d s and md s in the 1st period is more than that of 2nd period when d 9 months or md 274 km the s in the 1st period was larger than the 2nd period under the same d or md conditions on the contrary when d 9 months or md 274 km the s in the 2nd period was lower than the 1st period additionally it was observed that the a increased proportionally to the d and md with a similar slope in the two sub periods fig 15 presents the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought characteristics in the 1st period cross year agricultural drought events were generally distributed on both sides of gansu and ningxia there were 6 cross year drought events located in inner mongolia 5 events lay in shaanxi and 11 events concentrated in qinghai it was observed that central qinghai was the major drought center area due to numerous severe agricultural drought events filled here moreover secondary drought center areas were in central alxa league of inner mongolia and southern shaanxi where occurred a number of drought events with smaller magnitude meanwhile the migration orientation and rotation of agricultural drought events exhibited apparently spatial patterns for example 10 out of 11 events of drought migration orientation revealed e e in inner mongolia and shaanxi and 7 events showed anticlockwise rotation apparently among the 11 agricultural drought events in qinghai 9 events migrated in the same orientation which mainly included w w and s s and 7 events migrated with clockwise rotation characteristic fig 16 shows the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought characteristics in the 2nd period evident regularity was presented over the three climate zones for cross year agricultural drought events agricultural drought events with large magnitude hit westerly and southeast climate zones whereas agricultural drought events with small magnitude mainly focused on plateau climate zone compared with the 1st period fig 16a the agricultural drought severity had slightly weakened in the plateau climate zone while the higher agricultural drought risk was experienced in the westerly and southeast climate zones the migration rotation of cross year agricultural drought events mainly characterized by clockwise in the plateau and southeast climate zones and that was anticlockwise rotation in the westerly climate zone in eastern study area the same migration orientation of e e accounted for 95 of cross year agricultural drought events and mostly characterized by w w and s s migration orientation in the western study area which was similar to the spatial patterns of cross year agricultural drought events in the 1st period 4 discussion 4 1 reasons for the variation of agricultural drought in northwest china with respect to the temporal variation of drought in northwestern china results of drought duration severity area and migration distance in this study exhibited that the agricultural drought showed a downward tendency while the 1980 s was the turning point of drought similar conclusions have also been reached in other studies h j wang et al 2017 z l wang et al 2017 found that there were two evident contrasting periods about drought during 1961 2010 sustaining drought conditions existed during 1961 1986 whereas wet conditions dominated after 1986 h li et al 2022 reported a weakening drought in northwestern china based on the increasing trends of spi series moreover they also pointed out the late 1980 s was the abrupt wetting point of drought in relation to the spatial distribution of agricultural drought fig 17 displays an overview of the spatial patterns of the total number of drought events and the accumulated ssmi it could be found that the above two drought characteristic parameters present similar spatial pattern during 1961 2018 the west of inner mongolia and the central qinghai experienced comparatively high frequency 45 events and more severe 60 the smaller accumulated ssmi indicates the more severe droughts agricultural droughts over 1961 1980 in addition the junction of yushu haixi and guoluo prefecture in qinghai endured the most severe drought condition followed by alxa league during 1981 2018 the east of the study region especially qingyang city in gansu and southern zhongwei city in ningxia suffered more severe drought condition as the number of drought events 60 the accumulated ssmi 100 the above results as shown in fig 16 are in line with the findings of yang et al 2018 cai et al 2021 and li and wang 2016 remarkably it seems that the current discussion on dry and wet climate change in northwest china can explain the agricultural drought patterns in this study recently a number of researches indicated that the present climate change in northwest china has been from warm dry to warm wet shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 the change characteristics of average precipitation and temperature are relatively stable during 1961 1986 since 1987 average temperature showed an abrupt increasing trend with a change rate of 0 52 10a while the average annual precipitation also increased significantly chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 in addition the variation of precipitation in northwest china showed obvious spatial differences in the last 60 years and annual precipitation presented a significant upward trend in the central and west of the study region and a downward trend in the eastern regions wei and wang 2013 wen et al 2017 while the temperature displayed a trend of consistent increasing throughout the whole northwest region and the degree of warming has gradually increased zhang et al 2022 from soil moisture perspective precipitation had positive effect on it while the influence of temperature on soil moisture was negative and precipitation made greater contributions to soil moisture variations than temperature therefore the variation of soil moisture indicated that climate change in the western regions tended to be warm wet while it tended to be warm dry in the eastern regions wang et al 2018 water balance i e evaluating the precipitation and evaporation simultaneously could reflect the variation of dryness wetness more intuitively huo et al 2013 used the humidity index to analyze the climatic changes in northwest china it found that the humidity index increased and the climate became wetter in the western regions due to the increase of precipitation and the decrease of evaporation whereas the humidity index decreased and the climate became dryer in the eastern regions because of the increased amplitude of evaporation more than that of precipitation 4 2 reasonability of spatiotemporal migration features of drought regarding to the initiation and termination location as well as the migration orientation and rotation of identified drought events it is not found similar research for the study area apparently the performance of two main migration orientation and rotation of drought events in northwest china is not stochastic which is likely to be associated with the sensitivity of precipitation to climate change and atmospheric circulation xing and wang 2017 generally the atmospheric water vapor transports and the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the northwest china is jointly dominated by the westerly wind circulation and monsoon circulation the west part of study area is mainly affected by westerly circulation and the east part is primarily influenced by monsoon circulation zhang et al 2019b the water vapor in atlantic ocean arctic ocean black sea and caspian sea is transported into northwest china following the prevailing westerly which is the important origin for supplying the precipitation peng and zhou 2017 northwest china straddles the northern edge of the east asian summer monsoon and the boundary line demonstrates noticeable inter decadal oscillation zhang et al 2021 the average northern edge moves northward in strong summer monsoon years the height field is higher in the west and lower in the east and a large area of water vapor flux convergence while the opposite performance occurs in weak summer monsoon years liu et al 2018 the summer monsoon interacts with the westerly zone and the influence of interannual variation of the westerly on the convergence divergence of wind field is the main cause of water vapor transport in northwest china the change in summer monsoon affects the westerly through the adjustment of circulation structure which then impacts the water vapor transport by the westerly overall the westerly and monsoon have different influences on the northwest inland the westerly directly affects the precipitation in northwest china the monsoon indirectly affect the precipitation by adjusting the westerly causing obvious difference in the regions of rainfall the spatial variation of the precipitation of the monsoon season as well as its concentration in time can cause a modification in the spatiotemporal distribution of the drought areas these results can partially explain the change in patterns of the initiation and termination location as well as the migration orientation and rotation of drought events 4 3 advantages and limitations the drought structure extracted from a three dimensional perspective in this study has advantages in describing the development process and dynamic evolution of drought events the geometric and physical characteristics inside and outside the drought structure can be extracted making it easy to visualize their spatio temporal distribution pattern and analyze their dynamic evolution characteristics particularly the calculation and further analysis of drought migration orientation and rotation along with outcome on drought duration severity and areas may be useful to answer the following issues on drought dynamics diaz et al 2020 what are the main places where drought frequently occurs and remains what are the predominant paths followed by drought how about the dynamic migration state of individual drought event this drought structure extraction method also can be used to visualize the dynamic spatio temporal distribution pattern and movement of drought events in the future which predicts the frequent occurrence and remains places of drought events and their predominant migration paths then the water resources administration can targetedly arrange drought resistance strategies in advance minimizing the drougth risk and losses moreover compared with the drought variables extracted from low dimensions the estimation of the return period of drought events is more accurate from spatial and temporal perspective xu et al 2015b therefore identifying drought events from a three dimensional perspective could provide some important implications for drought dynamic migration and improve the rationality of drought risk assessment there are still some limitations in this study drought index is the only considered information for identifying the spatial extent of drought drought index is calculated based on soil moisture however the human activities may cause changes in land use which also can influence the delineation of drought areas moreover a unique drought area threshold was used for the determination of the spatial extent in future studies more factors should be included to evaluate the drought condition on the land surface and it is suggested to explore the sensitivity of other area threshold values on drought cluster identification 5 conclusions in this study a method that identifies drought events from three dimensional is improved which proposes more spatial drought variables such as migration orientation and rotation the ssmi calculated based on soil moisture data is used to monitor and assess agricultural drought in northwest china during 1961 2018 then drought events determined using the modified identification method are classified to investigate their spatio temporal patterns and the characteristics of corresponding events duration severity area start and end location migration rotation et al are also extracted to reveal the dynamic migration process of drought events the main conclusions are as follows 1 a total of 169 agricultural drought events were identified based on ssmi 3 the drought duration area severity and migration distance showed fluctuating downward trend with the rate of 0 135 10a 0 006 10a 0 16 10a and 5 67 10a from an interdecadal scale drought magnitude represented a trend of mitigation aggravation mitigation from 1960 s to 2000 s 2 the dynamic migration process of individual drought events was objectively and effectively depicted from three dimensional for the most severe drought event it occurred from january 1961 to october in 1962 the start and end location were south and east respectively the migration trajectory with mostly clockwise migration was roughly along with the southwest to northeast direction meanwhile the identified drought events were validated based on the historical drought records in the study area 3 124 agricultural drought events lasted for 2 months or more which were classified into three types namely two

8904,the aquacrop simulation model originally designed for annual crops is expanded here to simulate alfalfa a perennial forage crop a new routine was added to the model to mimic the assimilate partitioning between above and below ground plant parts to account for the utilization of reserves in spring and for their storage in the fall the simulation of the transfer of assimilates requires only three extra crop parameters which makes the model also easy to calibrate to evaluate the model yield data collected in louvain la neuve belgium isparta turkey and ottawa canada for different alfalfa cultivars various years and field and irrigation management strategies were used to assess the accuracy and robustness of the simple assimilate remobilization process simulations were run for the three different environments with a common set of crop parameters which were parameterized the dispersion between the observed and simulated cumulative dry above ground biomass during the growing cycle was small r² 0 97 nrmse 11 nash sutcliffe model ef 0 97 and a systematic over or underestimation by the model was not observed willmott s index of agreement d 0 99 when evaluating the goodness of fit of the 81 individual harvest events the results were still very satisfactory although the nrmse doubled the simulations indicated that the aquacrop model adapted to perennial crops and with a novel storage remobilization routine could predict well alfalfa yields in various climates and environments with and without water and fertility stress and for three different alfalfa cultivars

share data 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l is the world s leading forage crop a perennial legume that has high nutritional value and a deep root system capable of extracting water and nutrients from the subsoil alfalfa is an ancient crop which originated in south central asia and has spread rapidly to the mediterranean basin and eventually to south and north america yuegao and cash 2009 state that production takes place in a global area of about 30 million ha since the 1990 s off which 41 in north america mainly us and canada 25 in europe 23 in south america mainly argentina 8 in asia mainly russia and china 2 in africa and 1 in oceania alfalfa is essential in the animal husbandry food chain being used as hay silage or pellets and is as such worldwide traded as a commodity faostat 2022 it can be produced under rainfed or irrigated conditions and is harvested or cut several times a year depending on climatic conditions and management harvest management has proven to significantly impact yields moot et al 2003 orloff and putnam 2007 teixeira et al 2008 asseng and hsiao 2000 have demonstrated that alfalfa water productivity is very high once the costs of symbiotic n fixation higher protein content and different partitioning to below ground organs are accounted for given the ever higher pressure on agricultural land use changing diets characterised by a higher meat consumption and climate change induced uncertainties crop growth models can be a straightforward and cost effective tool to assess crop performance di paola et al 2015 yield gaps guilpart et al 2017 and to assist in decision making at the operational tactical and strategic levels van keulen and asseng 2019 loomis and connor 2012 models have also been used to improve current and future agricultural itineraries and hence provide support for agricultural programmes or policies the initial crop simulation models focused on annual crops while modelling of crops such as perennial forage crops have lagged behind nevertheless there have been attempts at either developing specific alfalfa models or adapting existing crop models to alfalfa a review of existing alfalfa models has been presented by malik et al 2018 the dssat model hoogenboom et al 2019 has adapted its integrated csm cropgro pfm perennial forage model to simulate alfalfa biomass production in northeast spain malik et al 2018 and eastern canada jing et al 2020 the apsim model keating et al 2003 has been extensively tested for alfalfa in australia and evaluated in the argentine pampas and south eastern australia ojeda et al 2016 and china peng et al 2022 in france another major alfalfa producer strullu et al 2020 obtained biomass regrowth estimates using the stics model brisson et al 1998 in northern italy confalonieri and bechini 2004 calibrated cropsyst for 2 alfalfa meadows other widely used simulation models such as aquacrop are not capable to simulate alfalfa at present raes et al 2009 the design of the aquacrop model pursued an optimum balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 with a relatively small number of crop parameters aquacrop is capable of simulating the attainable yield of the major annual herbaceous crops and a few less common farahani et al 2009 garcía vila et al 2009 garcia vila et al 2019 geerts et al 2009 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 todorovic et al 2009 wellens et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 tsegay et al 2015 araya et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2017 garcia vila et al 2019 salman et al 2021 here we report the work aimed at simulating the productivity of alfalfa with aquacrop by adapting version 7 of the model to simulate perennial herbaceous forage crops raes et al 2022 a simple routine describes the transfer of assimilates between the above ground biomass and the below ground storage organs in the paper it was assessed if aquacrop could be adapted to simulate perennial herbaceous forage crops and that the transfer of assimilates between the above ground biomass and the below ground storage organs could be simulated with a novel subroutine to test this hypothesis the model was first parameterized and subsequently all simulations were run with a common set of crop parameters for different years alfalfa cultivars climates field and irrigation management strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 field experimental data yield biomass data of all individual harvest events of different alfalfa growing seasons were collected in louvain la neuve belgium and isparta turkey yield data for ottawa canada which also contained several biomass sampling dates between harvests was extracted from jing et al 2020 tables 1 to 4 present the coordinates climate soil type irrigation and soil fertility management cultivars and the observed yields dry matter for the three locations in chapters 1 3 of the supplementary material more detailed information is provided regarding the climatic data physical soil properties for these three sites and the irrigation schedule 2 2 aquacrop simulation processes 2 2 1 aquacrop general calculation scheme the calculation approach of aquacrop consists of the successive simulation of i the green canopy cover ii crop transpiration iii biomass production and iv crop yield all for each day of the growing cycle as previously described by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the green canopy cover cc is the fraction of the soil surface covered by the canopy for non limiting conditions the increase of cc is described by a canopy growth coefficient cgc driven by temperature cc increases from the canopy cover at germination cco to a maximum value ccx which can reach 1 if full canopy cover is reached both cco and ccx are influenced by plant density crop transpiration tri is proportional to the simulated cci at day i by using a biomass water productivity factor wp aquacrop calculates the daily above ground biomass bi from daily transpiration normalized for climate using the reference evapotranspiration etoi 1 b b i wp tr i eto i where b is the total above ground biomass produced during the growing cycle and wp is normalized for climate and co2 concentration a fraction of the simulated seasonal above ground biomass b the harvest index hi is partitioned to the harvestable organs to give the yield a single value of wp is used for the entire crop cycle for most crops however in crops where the composition of the harvestable product is rich in oil and or protein such as sunflower soybean and cotton the wp is reduced during yield formation to account for the fact that more photosynthates are required per unit of dry matter steduto et al 2009 a correction factor makes that the wp for those crops is gradually reduced during yield formation note that the calculations described above are affected by the occurrence of temperature water soil fertility and salinity stresses as described in detail in steduto et al 2009 and in raes et al 2022 2 2 2 adjustments of the simulation processes for herbaceous forage crops 2 2 2 1 transfer of assimilates between above and below ground plant parts perennial herbaceous forage crops allocate the carbon assimilated through photosynthesis bi to above leaves and stems and below ground organs crowns and roots since aquacrop does not simulate biomass partitioning among various organs variations in partitioning along the season was simulated by increasing or reducing wp as it is done for the energy rich yield products of some crops during yield formation steduto et al 2009 the above ground biomass bupper is simulated as 2 b upper f i b i f i wp tr i eto i where fi is a correction factor which is less than one during the period of assimilate storage in below ground organs and greater than one during the period of remobilization of assimilates in spring the net assimilate storage stage starts after mid season when the crop transfers an important fraction of bi to the below ground organs during the following spring which corresponds to the net remobilization stage the stored assimilates are transferred to the above ground organs to contribute to enhanced growth fig 1 in the remobilization and storage stages fi is corrected for regrowth since plants use the carbohydrate reserves for regrowth both in the spring and after each cutting undersander et al 2011 2 2 2 2 storage of assimilates below ground storage stage since perennial herbaceous forage crops transfer a considerable fraction of the assimilates below ground after mid season teixeira et al 2008 moot et al 2012 the daily biomass produced bi is reduced by a fraction fsto i eq 3 that exponentially increases from 0 at the start of the net storage stage t 0 to a fraction s of bi at the end of the season t 1 3 f sto i exp 5 t 1 exp 5 1 s when the crop is harvested during the storage stage fsto i is temporarily reduced to consider the assimilates required for the regrowth of the crop canopy this is simulated by multiplying fsto i by another adjustment factor ai eq 4 for regrowth 0 ai 1 4 a i cc i cc cut cc x cc cut where cccut is the canopy cover after harvest and cci the canopy cover at day i which increases during regrowth from cccut to the maximum canopy cover ccx at every harvest date cci cccut ai is zero and storage is halted fig 1 when cci reaches ccx at the end of regrowth ai is 1 and storage is again at maximum rate 2 2 2 3 remobilization of assimilates from below ground remobilization stage not all assimilates can be recovered from storage avice et al 1996 in aquacrop it is assumed that of the total assimilates stored below ground in the previous season bsto n 1 a fraction m is remobilized during the next season bmob n eq 5 the rest is assumed to be lost by respiration and natural self thinning or to remain stored below ground 5 b mob n m b sto n 1 furthermore it is assumed that at the start of the first year after sowing only 20 of m is remobilized above ground as many of the stored assimilates in the sowing year were required in the development and establishment of the perennial plant parts below ground crown and root system to simulate the remobilization of stored assimilates at the start of the season bi is increased with a fraction fmob i eq 6 which decreases gradually as more and more assimilates are remobilized fig 1 6 f mob i exp 5 t 1 exp 5 1 7 t b mob n b mob i b mob n where bmob i are the assimilates remobilized from the root system on day i expressed as a fraction fmob i of bi and t is the relative time in the remobilization stage which gradually decreases from 1 at the start of the season to zero at the end of the remobilization stage when the canopy reaches 90 of ccx after regrowth remobilization is no longer considered this is simulated by multiplying fmob i with an adjustment factor ci for regrowth 0 ci 1 8 c i cc x cc i 0 1 cc x if cc i 0 9 ccx at each harvest ci is 1 and remobilization starts at its maximum rate it stays that way until cc has reached 90 of its maximum ccx when maximum canopy cover is reached cc ccx ci is zero and remobilization is halted until the next harvest it is considered that remobilization and storage do not occur at the same time 2 2 2 4 length of the growing cycle in aquacrop the length of the crop growing cycle is determined by the thermal regime of the season for annual crops crop maturity is reached when the sum of the daily growing degree days gdd since planting reaches a predetermined value which is cultivar specific as a result the growing cycle will be longer in cold years and shorter in warm years for perennial crops it is the opposite the growing cycle will be shorter in cold years and longer in warm years this is simulated by determining the start for non planting years and end of the growing cycle by an air temperature criterion which is based either on the average air temperature or the sum of gdd over a number of days by appraising the air temperature data aquacrop determines the restart and end of alfalfa growth within a specified time window at the beginning onset and end of the year to avoid the generation of a restart in the early stages of spring when air temperatures might still drop sharply after an early start aquacrop offers the option to select the 2nd or 3rd occurrence of the selected criterion similarly a 2nd or 3rd occurrence for the selected criterion in the late autumn or early winter can be selected to avoid a premature ending of the growing period during a cold period before the final end of the season raes et al 2022 2 2 2 5 natural self thinning the initial plant population of perennials progressively self thins over the years this is induced by climatic factors such as killing frosts and by field management the natural self thinning results in a gradual decrease of ccx since initially the self thinning is compensated by an increase in the number of shoots per plant to occupy the vacant space the process does not decrease ccx in the first year but becomes only visible in later years when the plant population becomes smaller the process of self thinning can be calibrated in aquacrop by considering the environment climate and field management raes et al 2022 in a self thinned plant population weed infestation might become important a calculation process in aquacrop allows the simulation of canopy development and crop production in weed infested fields van gaelen et al 2016 it would be desirable to test the effects of different self thinning levels on the simulated yields the limited number of successive years of the data used here for calibration does not allow to validate the simulation of natural self thinning on yields 2 3 parametrization and calibration 2 3 1 crop parameters to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the simulation process of the transfer of assimilates a common set of crop parameters was used table 5 to simulate production of different alfalfa cultivars in three different environments and years given the limited amount of observed data indicative values for crop parameters were obtained from literature in the absence of published data values were estimated or default settings in aquacrop were used parameter values in table 5 need to be further tested in other environment and management conditions only the wp was calibrated using a limited set of the observed yield data 2 3 1 1 air temperature stress there is consensus that the tbase for alfalfa is 5 c baral et al 2022 a typical value for tupper of calibrated crops in aquacrop is 30 c it is the temperature above which crop development no longer increase with an increase in air temperature since it has only an effect when the average air temperature required to calculate gdd rises above tupper which never occurred in the study sites tupper could not be evaluated the minimum growing degrees required in a day for full crop transpiration is typically an estimated crop parameter in aquacrop since it is hard to obtain from field data by considering calibrated crops with a similar low tbase a minimum of 8 gdd per day was considered the minimum gdd per day are 5 9 for potato tbase of 2 c 10 for soybean tbase of 5 c and 9 for sugar beet tbase of 5 c since cold stress does not occur in the major part of the growing cycle an incorrect estimate of the temperature threshold for transpiration will not strongly affect the simulation of the biomass production 2 3 1 2 soil water stress in fao56 allen et al 1998 a single soil water depletion factor p is used which is 0 55 for alfalfa hay fig 2 the p factor is the fraction of available soil water that can be depleted from the root zone before transpiration is reduced below its potential in aquacrop following hsiao 1973 a distinction is made among three soil water stress levels that i reduce canopy expansion ii induce stomatal closure and iii trigger early canopy senescence fig 2 numerous studies have confirmed that leaf expansion hence the canopy is the most sensitive to soil water deficits and that stomatal conductance and hence transpiration is substantially less sensitive steduto et al 2012 for most calibrated crops in aquacrop the upper threshold of soil water depletion for canopy expansion is 0 15 0 20 of taw given that stomatal are substantial less sensitive to soil water depletion than canopy growth depletion factors of 0 15 upper and 0 55 lower for canopy expansion and 0 60 for stomatal control were selected for alfalfa fig 2 the considered depletion of 0 70 chosen for senescence is a typical value for the various crops which have been calibrated for aquacrop the shape of the water stress curve determines the magnitude of the effect of the stress on the process between the upper and lower thresholds in fao56 a linear decrease of ks is assumed once the allowed depletion p has been exceeded fig 2 in aquacrop the shape of the ks curves is convex which influences the process more strongly when the stress becomes severe and is more in line with the reduction in matric potential when the soil water content declines a recent publication trout and de jonge 2021 supports the hypothesis that a convex ks curve such as used in aquacrop represents better the plant response than a linear function 2 3 1 3 soil salinity stress the upper and lower thresholds for the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ece are the values given by ayers and westcot 1985 for alfalfa since salinity stress was not observed in the study sites the model performance could not be evaluated 2 3 1 4 development of crop canopy cover the average cgc for the calibrated crops in aquacrop is 0 01 fraction soil cover per growing degree gd 1 and ranges between 0 004 and 0 020 gd 1 a value of 0 012 gd 1 was selected for alfalfa which is slightly above the average to consider the accelerated growth after each cutting the value allowed the crop to reach full canopy cover between cuttings in absence of stress typical values for cdc of calibrated crops in aquacrop range between 0 003 gd 1 and 0 010 gd 1 a value of 0 006 gd 1 was selected for alfalfa which is within the range of the cdc of the calibrated crops 2 3 1 5 crop transpiration and biomass production with a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil water evaporation coefficient crop transpiration tr is separated from soil evaporation e in the dual crop coefficient approach of fao 56 there the basal crop coefficient kcb at mid season effective full cover for alfalfa hay is 1 15 allen et al 1998 aquacrop separates et into tr and e to avoid the confounding effect of the non productive consumptive use of water e the selected crop transpiration coefficient kctrx proposed for alfalfa in aquacrop was taken as the kcb of fao56 or 1 15 in annual crops aquacrop simulates a slow decline in canopy photosynthetic capacity following the achievement of full canopy cover steduto et al 2009 as the canopy ages slowly it undergoes a progressive though small reduction in maximum transpiration and photosynthetic rate this is simulated by applying an adjustment factor fage that decreases the crop transpiration coefficient kctr x by a constant albeit a slight fraction per day table 5 once the canopy reaches its maximum cover ccx natural senescence results in a declining crop coefficient transpiration and biomass production in the latter part of the season however as alfalfa is harvested multiple times soon after it reaches maximum cover the ageing effect does not take place and at each cut it is reset to zero and remains so as long as ccx is not reached before the next cut 2 3 1 6 rooting depth alfalfa has a very deep root system among perennial crops the tap root often reaches a depth of 1 5 2 0 m the first season 3 3 5 m by the end of the second year and ultimately it may extend to depths of 6 0 m or more in unrestricted soils weaver 1926 sun et al 2008 undersander et al 2011 however in aquacrop the maximum rooting depth of perennials such as alfalfa is simulated to reach its maximum value near the end of the first season and to remain constant in the successive years after sowing as indicated in table 5 the rooting depth increased from 0 3 m a default aquacrop value which refers to the depth from which the germinating seedling can extract water to 3 m deep at the end of the sowing year as indicated in fao56 for an open unrestricted soil in the successive years after sowing rooting depth remains at 3 m users can adjust the maximum rooting depth in the model according to their own soil conditions 2 3 1 7 canopy cover in aquacrop canopy cover cc is expressed as the fraction or percentage ground cover the initial canopy cover cco at germination is determined by the sowing or planting density it is assumed that an individual seedling at the time of its establishment covers 2 0 cm² of the soil surface and that the plant density is 2 5 million plants per hectare table 5 these values produce an initial canopy cover cco of 5 the canopy growth coefficient expressed as increase of ground cover per growing degree embedded in a logistic growth function describes the expansion of cc from cco to the maximum canopy cover ccx in the absence of stress steduto et al 2009 for optimal conditions ccx is determined by crop species and plant density the considered 95 for alfalfa ccx is the default value in aquacrop for an almost entirely covered situation by considering i the crop coefficient after cutting kclow 0 3 0 5 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 ii the crop coefficient when canopy is complete kctr x 1 15 table 5 wright 1988 and iii the adjustment in the simulations of the canopy cover cc when ccx is not yet reached raes et al 2022 it was estimated that after each cut the canopy cover was 25 cccut at the start of a non planting year an initial canopy cover of 50 was assumed guitjens 1990 2 3 1 8 calibration of wp by running simulations with the set of the common parametrized parameters table 5 wp was derived from eq 1 by considering the observed dry biomass and simulated tr table 6 to avoid the confounding effect of possible incorrectly estimated thresholds for soil water and soil fertility stress i data from ottawa were excluded and ii only data from the 100 irrigation fields in isparta and from years with limited soil water stress 2014 and 2016 in lln were considered furthermore by eliminating the data from the 1st cut the effect of cold stress on tr and the period of important remobilization of assimilates were eliminated to avoid the effect of significant storage of assimilates data of the second half of the season were also excluded finally the derived wp was normalized by considering the co2 concentration 369 41 ppm for the reference year 2000 steduto et al 2007 although data dispersion was high due to the remobilization and or storage of assimilates an average of 15 g m² was estimated as the value for wp table 6 2 3 2 length of the growing cycle the selected air temperature criterion for the onset and end of the growing cycle are specified in table 7 for determining the restart of regrowth in louvain la neuve and isparta air temperature data was appraised in a 120 days time window starting at 1 january for determining the end the time window was 90 days long finishing on 31 december since the average minimum air temperature in ottawa is below zero from november till april fig 1 3 in supplementary material the 120 days time window for the onset started at 1 april for determining the end the time window was 60 days long and finished on 31 october 2 3 3 transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts to simulate the transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts only three crop parameters are required in aquacrop i the start of the net storage stage ii the remobilization m and iii the storage s fractions fig 1 these parameters are mainly cultivar specific and can be calibrated with observed yield data however to illustrate the robustness of the simulation process a fine tuning for each of the study sites was not attempted for all 3 cultivars the following assumptions were made storage started at mid june to mid july which is 180 days before the end of the growing cycle for louvain la neuve and isparta and 100 days for ottawa where alfalfa has a shorter growing cycle 60 of the stored assimilates were remobilized in the next season m 0 60 given that high latitude cultivars have more seasonality with higher biomass partitioning below ground in late summer autumn in response to lower temperatures and shorter daylength moot et al 2012 the storage fraction s at the end of the growing cycle was chosen as 0 65 for louvain la neuve and ottawa and 0 45 for isparta the s values also reflected the differences among alfalfa cultivars according to their mediterranean or northern origin 2 3 4 soil fertility stress in ottawa no n fertilizer was applied jing et al 2020 by running simulations without soil fertility stress the maximum attainable total biomass production bmax in the 3 years of observations was about double of the observed yields reported measurements were 47 55 and 46 of simulated bmax in the three successive years in aquacrop soil fertility stress is evaluated through brel which is the relative biomass production with reference to bmax that can be achieved for a given soil fertility level in the absence of water or any other stress van gaelen et al 2014 by calibrating alfalfa with a brel of 50 aquacrop selects values for the three fertility stress coefficients affecting canopy development cc and the single coefficient affecting wp to achieve the specified brel the target crop parameters for the three coefficients affecting cc are respectively cgc ccx and a decline of cc after mid season in absence of field data allowing a fine tuning of the individual stress coefficients the default setting for the 4 stress coefficients was considered the default values corresponded to a 40 and 20 reduction respectively for ccx and cgc a 0 04 day decline of cc and a stress coefficient which gradually reduced wp from 15 g m² at the start of the season to 7 2 g m² at the end of the season when the nutrient reservoir became depleted 2 4 simulation runs all simulations were run with the common set of parameterized crop parameters table 5 simulations started in the sowing year for ottawa and lln due to the absence of data for the sowing year for isparta the first simulation was one year after sowing since the soil water content at the time of sowing was unknown simulations started with bare soil on 1 january well before sowing in louvain la neuve and ottawa given the importance of winter rains relative to the small to negligible eto it was assumed that the soil profile was at field capacity fc on that day by keeping track of the rainfall soil evaporation and deep percolation on the successive days of the simulation period aquacrop obtained the soil water content at the specified day of sowing for isparta simulations started on 1 january of the 1st year after sowing given the high eto and relative low rainfall during the year table 2 only the top 0 60 m of the soil profile was assumed to be at fc and the rest of the profile at 50 of taw at the start of the simulations apart from the sowing years simulations were run for the 2 ottawa and isparta and 3 lln years after sowing and for the 5 different irrigation strategies in isparta each simulation run stopped at the generated end of the growing cycle for the considered year fig 3 the run for the next year started on the day after the generated end of the growing cycle of the previous year the initial soil water content at the start of a run was given by the soil water content at the end of the previous run to evaluate the simulated above ground biomass dry matter four statistical indicators were used the equations are presented in chapter 4 of the supplementary material the coefficient of correlation r² the normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and the willmott s index of agreement d 3 results and discussion the generated onsets ends and lengths of the growing cycle for alfalfa for each of the study sites and simulated years are presented in table 8 the cold tress affecting crop transpiration and hence biomass production at the start and end of the growing cycle led to low biomass production at the start and end of the generated growing period where the growing degrees were generally smaller than the minimum required for full crop transpiration assessed at 8 c day in table 5 this greatly reduced the effects of possible errors in the start and end of the growing cycle for a representative simulation of the generated growing cycle fig 4 the relative biomass production eq 1 was only 5 of the total production in the first 30 days and 3 in the last 30 days of the cycle the simulations results would have been hardly affected if the noted start and end of the cycle was in fact later or earlier the simulated and observed cumulative biomass increasing at each harvest for the three study sites irrigation strategy and for all years are presented in fig 5 since cumulative biomass can compensate an over under yield estimate at one harvest by a similar under over yield estimate at the next harvest also the individual simulations for all the 81 harvest events were evaluated fig 6 the statistical evaluation is given in table 9 the statistical evaluation table 9 indicates that aquacrop simulated well the observed yield in the three different environments with a common set of parametrized crop parameters and a tentatively calibrated wp the evaluation of the cumulative dry above ground biomass fig 5 indicates that the simulated results are good to very good the indicators r² nrmse and ef indicate a very small dispersion between observed and simulated biomass the evaluation of the 81 individual harvests fig 6 still confirms the quality of the model although the nrmse moderate good shows that the dispersion is twice as large then for the cumulative biomass the high value of the d indicator confirms that there is no systematic over or underestimation by the model aquacrop differs from other crop simulation models by its water driven growth engine in which the daily biomass production bi is made proportional to the amount of water consumed as crop transpiration eq 1 through a normalized water productivity parameter wp in other alfalfa models which are carbon or solar driven growth is based on carbon assimilation by the photosynthetis and the key parameter relating biomass to intercepted radiation is the radiation use efficiency rue to complete the simulation of biomass production other models also consider the maintenance and growth respiration of the various organs and the partition of the structural biomass amongst the various plant organs stem leafs roots and storage organs although such calculation scheme is more explanatory than that of aquacrop rue models require knowledge of an extended number of variables and input parameters which are not easily available and much more familiar to scientists than to end users in contrast aquacrop requires only three extra crop parameters see section 2 3 3 to simulate the transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts in alfalfa additionally the transfer of assimilates can be easily calibrated by altering i the storage fraction s at the end of the growing cycle and or ii the remobilization fraction m in the next season and or iii the storage time notwithstanding the huge simplification of the transfer processes subroutine the results suggest that aquacrop performs as well or even better than other more complex models in the simulation of alfalfa yield table 10 the simulated green canopy cover the remobilized and stored assimilates and the observed and simulated cumulative above ground biomass during the growing cycle of alfalfa for all years irrigation managements and study sites are presented in chapter 5 of the supplementary material as an example the simulation results for the 2nd year after sowing for isparta for the 75 et irrigated treatment are presented in fig 7 as can be observed in the central plot the simulated transfer of assimilates differed from the theoretical functions fig 7 dotted lines because the transfer was affected by i cold stress which was severe at the start and end of the season ii the frequency of cuttings and iii soil water deficits the response of the transfer to stresses and frequency of cuttings allows aquacrop to simulate the negative effect of water stress and or late cuttings on the amount of stored assimilates at the end of the season when the root reserves are too low during the winter period insufficient carbohydrates can be remobilized at the start of the next season to accelerate regrowth fine tuning of the water stress parameters was not possible as sufficient field data was not available nevertheless with the parametrized set table 5 the effect of water stress on alfalfa yield was well simulated in the water stressed treatments for the 2nd year after sowing for lln and the 75 50 and 25 et irrigated treatments in isparta the nrmse remained below 15 good only for the rainfed alfalfa in isparta resulting in very severe water stress the nrmse increased to 25 moderate good and this only for the 2nd year after sowing this moderately good result might be partly linked to the fixed rooting depth at 3 m considered by aquacrop for all the years after sowing since it has been reported in the literature that the taproot still expands in the following years and it may ultimately reach a depth of 6 0 m or more in unrestricted soils weaver 1926 sun et al 2008 undersander et al 2011 it is possible that rainfed alfalfa could have drawn stored water from the winter rains from the soil layers below 3 m the restricted rooting depth in aquacrop to 3 m may therefore be the cause for the underprediction of biomass production at the beginning of the 2nd year of rainfed alfalfa fig 5 2 h and 5 2j in the supplementary materials with the common air temperature criterion for generating the onset and end of the growing cycle together with the estimated cold threshold for transpiration good to very good estimates of alfalfa yield were obtained notwithstanding that the criterion and thresholds might differ for other cultivars and climatic conditions in aquacrop wp for c3 crops ranges between 15 and 20 g m² the simulation results indicated that with a wp of 15 g m² for alfalfa very good estimates of yields were obtained however the value should be regarded as a first conservative estimate for alfalfa as it is not known with certainty that soil fertility was optimal in all sites used in this calibration if soil fertility was limiting yields then one would expect the value of wp to be above 15 g m² 4 conclusions an extension of the aquacrop model to simulate a perennial crop alfalfa is presented here the processes of assimilate storage below ground and the subsequent remobilization to supplement above ground growth were simulated in a simple way by multiplying the biomass water productivity wp with a correction factor greater than one during the remobilization stage and smaller than one during the storage stage experimental data from three different environments vastly different in climate such as canada belgium and turkey were used to calibrate the model the comparisons between measurements and the simulations indicated that aquacrop can well predict the total yield of alfalfa that can be expected in various climates and environments with and without water stress and soil fertility stress for three different alfalfa cultivars

8904,the aquacrop simulation model originally designed for annual crops is expanded here to simulate alfalfa a perennial forage crop a new routine was added to the model to mimic the assimilate partitioning between above and below ground plant parts to account for the utilization of reserves in spring and for their storage in the fall the simulation of the transfer of assimilates requires only three extra crop parameters which makes the model also easy to calibrate to evaluate the model yield data collected in louvain la neuve belgium isparta turkey and ottawa canada for different alfalfa cultivars various years and field and irrigation management strategies were used to assess the accuracy and robustness of the simple assimilate remobilization process simulations were run for the three different environments with a common set of crop parameters which were parameterized the dispersion between the observed and simulated cumulative dry above ground biomass during the growing cycle was small r² 0 97 nrmse 11 nash sutcliffe model ef 0 97 and a systematic over or underestimation by the model was not observed willmott s index of agreement d 0 99 when evaluating the goodness of fit of the 81 individual harvest events the results were still very satisfactory although the nrmse doubled the simulations indicated that the aquacrop model adapted to perennial crops and with a novel storage remobilization routine could predict well alfalfa yields in various climates and environments with and without water and fertility stress and for three different alfalfa cultivars

share data 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l is the world s leading forage crop a perennial legume that has high nutritional value and a deep root system capable of extracting water and nutrients from the subsoil alfalfa is an ancient crop which originated in south central asia and has spread rapidly to the mediterranean basin and eventually to south and north america yuegao and cash 2009 state that production takes place in a global area of about 30 million ha since the 1990 s off which 41 in north america mainly us and canada 25 in europe 23 in south america mainly argentina 8 in asia mainly russia and china 2 in africa and 1 in oceania alfalfa is essential in the animal husbandry food chain being used as hay silage or pellets and is as such worldwide traded as a commodity faostat 2022 it can be produced under rainfed or irrigated conditions and is harvested or cut several times a year depending on climatic conditions and management harvest management has proven to significantly impact yields moot et al 2003 orloff and putnam 2007 teixeira et al 2008 asseng and hsiao 2000 have demonstrated that alfalfa water productivity is very high once the costs of symbiotic n fixation higher protein content and different partitioning to below ground organs are accounted for given the ever higher pressure on agricultural land use changing diets characterised by a higher meat consumption and climate change induced uncertainties crop growth models can be a straightforward and cost effective tool to assess crop performance di paola et al 2015 yield gaps guilpart et al 2017 and to assist in decision making at the operational tactical and strategic levels van keulen and asseng 2019 loomis and connor 2012 models have also been used to improve current and future agricultural itineraries and hence provide support for agricultural programmes or policies the initial crop simulation models focused on annual crops while modelling of crops such as perennial forage crops have lagged behind nevertheless there have been attempts at either developing specific alfalfa models or adapting existing crop models to alfalfa a review of existing alfalfa models has been presented by malik et al 2018 the dssat model hoogenboom et al 2019 has adapted its integrated csm cropgro pfm perennial forage model to simulate alfalfa biomass production in northeast spain malik et al 2018 and eastern canada jing et al 2020 the apsim model keating et al 2003 has been extensively tested for alfalfa in australia and evaluated in the argentine pampas and south eastern australia ojeda et al 2016 and china peng et al 2022 in france another major alfalfa producer strullu et al 2020 obtained biomass regrowth estimates using the stics model brisson et al 1998 in northern italy confalonieri and bechini 2004 calibrated cropsyst for 2 alfalfa meadows other widely used simulation models such as aquacrop are not capable to simulate alfalfa at present raes et al 2009 the design of the aquacrop model pursued an optimum balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 with a relatively small number of crop parameters aquacrop is capable of simulating the attainable yield of the major annual herbaceous crops and a few less common farahani et al 2009 garcía vila et al 2009 garcia vila et al 2019 geerts et al 2009 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 todorovic et al 2009 wellens et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 tsegay et al 2015 araya et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2017 garcia vila et al 2019 salman et al 2021 here we report the work aimed at simulating the productivity of alfalfa with aquacrop by adapting version 7 of the model to simulate perennial herbaceous forage crops raes et al 2022 a simple routine describes the transfer of assimilates between the above ground biomass and the below ground storage organs in the paper it was assessed if aquacrop could be adapted to simulate perennial herbaceous forage crops and that the transfer of assimilates between the above ground biomass and the below ground storage organs could be simulated with a novel subroutine to test this hypothesis the model was first parameterized and subsequently all simulations were run with a common set of crop parameters for different years alfalfa cultivars climates field and irrigation management strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 field experimental data yield biomass data of all individual harvest events of different alfalfa growing seasons were collected in louvain la neuve belgium and isparta turkey yield data for ottawa canada which also contained several biomass sampling dates between harvests was extracted from jing et al 2020 tables 1 to 4 present the coordinates climate soil type irrigation and soil fertility management cultivars and the observed yields dry matter for the three locations in chapters 1 3 of the supplementary material more detailed information is provided regarding the climatic data physical soil properties for these three sites and the irrigation schedule 2 2 aquacrop simulation processes 2 2 1 aquacrop general calculation scheme the calculation approach of aquacrop consists of the successive simulation of i the green canopy cover ii crop transpiration iii biomass production and iv crop yield all for each day of the growing cycle as previously described by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the green canopy cover cc is the fraction of the soil surface covered by the canopy for non limiting conditions the increase of cc is described by a canopy growth coefficient cgc driven by temperature cc increases from the canopy cover at germination cco to a maximum value ccx which can reach 1 if full canopy cover is reached both cco and ccx are influenced by plant density crop transpiration tri is proportional to the simulated cci at day i by using a biomass water productivity factor wp aquacrop calculates the daily above ground biomass bi from daily transpiration normalized for climate using the reference evapotranspiration etoi 1 b b i wp tr i eto i where b is the total above ground biomass produced during the growing cycle and wp is normalized for climate and co2 concentration a fraction of the simulated seasonal above ground biomass b the harvest index hi is partitioned to the harvestable organs to give the yield a single value of wp is used for the entire crop cycle for most crops however in crops where the composition of the harvestable product is rich in oil and or protein such as sunflower soybean and cotton the wp is reduced during yield formation to account for the fact that more photosynthates are required per unit of dry matter steduto et al 2009 a correction factor makes that the wp for those crops is gradually reduced during yield formation note that the calculations described above are affected by the occurrence of temperature water soil fertility and salinity stresses as described in detail in steduto et al 2009 and in raes et al 2022 2 2 2 adjustments of the simulation processes for herbaceous forage crops 2 2 2 1 transfer of assimilates between above and below ground plant parts perennial herbaceous forage crops allocate the carbon assimilated through photosynthesis bi to above leaves and stems and below ground organs crowns and roots since aquacrop does not simulate biomass partitioning among various organs variations in partitioning along the season was simulated by increasing or reducing wp as it is done for the energy rich yield products of some crops during yield formation steduto et al 2009 the above ground biomass bupper is simulated as 2 b upper f i b i f i wp tr i eto i where fi is a correction factor which is less than one during the period of assimilate storage in below ground organs and greater than one during the period of remobilization of assimilates in spring the net assimilate storage stage starts after mid season when the crop transfers an important fraction of bi to the below ground organs during the following spring which corresponds to the net remobilization stage the stored assimilates are transferred to the above ground organs to contribute to enhanced growth fig 1 in the remobilization and storage stages fi is corrected for regrowth since plants use the carbohydrate reserves for regrowth both in the spring and after each cutting undersander et al 2011 2 2 2 2 storage of assimilates below ground storage stage since perennial herbaceous forage crops transfer a considerable fraction of the assimilates below ground after mid season teixeira et al 2008 moot et al 2012 the daily biomass produced bi is reduced by a fraction fsto i eq 3 that exponentially increases from 0 at the start of the net storage stage t 0 to a fraction s of bi at the end of the season t 1 3 f sto i exp 5 t 1 exp 5 1 s when the crop is harvested during the storage stage fsto i is temporarily reduced to consider the assimilates required for the regrowth of the crop canopy this is simulated by multiplying fsto i by another adjustment factor ai eq 4 for regrowth 0 ai 1 4 a i cc i cc cut cc x cc cut where cccut is the canopy cover after harvest and cci the canopy cover at day i which increases during regrowth from cccut to the maximum canopy cover ccx at every harvest date cci cccut ai is zero and storage is halted fig 1 when cci reaches ccx at the end of regrowth ai is 1 and storage is again at maximum rate 2 2 2 3 remobilization of assimilates from below ground remobilization stage not all assimilates can be recovered from storage avice et al 1996 in aquacrop it is assumed that of the total assimilates stored below ground in the previous season bsto n 1 a fraction m is remobilized during the next season bmob n eq 5 the rest is assumed to be lost by respiration and natural self thinning or to remain stored below ground 5 b mob n m b sto n 1 furthermore it is assumed that at the start of the first year after sowing only 20 of m is remobilized above ground as many of the stored assimilates in the sowing year were required in the development and establishment of the perennial plant parts below ground crown and root system to simulate the remobilization of stored assimilates at the start of the season bi is increased with a fraction fmob i eq 6 which decreases gradually as more and more assimilates are remobilized fig 1 6 f mob i exp 5 t 1 exp 5 1 7 t b mob n b mob i b mob n where bmob i are the assimilates remobilized from the root system on day i expressed as a fraction fmob i of bi and t is the relative time in the remobilization stage which gradually decreases from 1 at the start of the season to zero at the end of the remobilization stage when the canopy reaches 90 of ccx after regrowth remobilization is no longer considered this is simulated by multiplying fmob i with an adjustment factor ci for regrowth 0 ci 1 8 c i cc x cc i 0 1 cc x if cc i 0 9 ccx at each harvest ci is 1 and remobilization starts at its maximum rate it stays that way until cc has reached 90 of its maximum ccx when maximum canopy cover is reached cc ccx ci is zero and remobilization is halted until the next harvest it is considered that remobilization and storage do not occur at the same time 2 2 2 4 length of the growing cycle in aquacrop the length of the crop growing cycle is determined by the thermal regime of the season for annual crops crop maturity is reached when the sum of the daily growing degree days gdd since planting reaches a predetermined value which is cultivar specific as a result the growing cycle will be longer in cold years and shorter in warm years for perennial crops it is the opposite the growing cycle will be shorter in cold years and longer in warm years this is simulated by determining the start for non planting years and end of the growing cycle by an air temperature criterion which is based either on the average air temperature or the sum of gdd over a number of days by appraising the air temperature data aquacrop determines the restart and end of alfalfa growth within a specified time window at the beginning onset and end of the year to avoid the generation of a restart in the early stages of spring when air temperatures might still drop sharply after an early start aquacrop offers the option to select the 2nd or 3rd occurrence of the selected criterion similarly a 2nd or 3rd occurrence for the selected criterion in the late autumn or early winter can be selected to avoid a premature ending of the growing period during a cold period before the final end of the season raes et al 2022 2 2 2 5 natural self thinning the initial plant population of perennials progressively self thins over the years this is induced by climatic factors such as killing frosts and by field management the natural self thinning results in a gradual decrease of ccx since initially the self thinning is compensated by an increase in the number of shoots per plant to occupy the vacant space the process does not decrease ccx in the first year but becomes only visible in later years when the plant population becomes smaller the process of self thinning can be calibrated in aquacrop by considering the environment climate and field management raes et al 2022 in a self thinned plant population weed infestation might become important a calculation process in aquacrop allows the simulation of canopy development and crop production in weed infested fields van gaelen et al 2016 it would be desirable to test the effects of different self thinning levels on the simulated yields the limited number of successive years of the data used here for calibration does not allow to validate the simulation of natural self thinning on yields 2 3 parametrization and calibration 2 3 1 crop parameters to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the simulation process of the transfer of assimilates a common set of crop parameters was used table 5 to simulate production of different alfalfa cultivars in three different environments and years given the limited amount of observed data indicative values for crop parameters were obtained from literature in the absence of published data values were estimated or default settings in aquacrop were used parameter values in table 5 need to be further tested in other environment and management conditions only the wp was calibrated using a limited set of the observed yield data 2 3 1 1 air temperature stress there is consensus that the tbase for alfalfa is 5 c baral et al 2022 a typical value for tupper of calibrated crops in aquacrop is 30 c it is the temperature above which crop development no longer increase with an increase in air temperature since it has only an effect when the average air temperature required to calculate gdd rises above tupper which never occurred in the study sites tupper could not be evaluated the minimum growing degrees required in a day for full crop transpiration is typically an estimated crop parameter in aquacrop since it is hard to obtain from field data by considering calibrated crops with a similar low tbase a minimum of 8 gdd per day was considered the minimum gdd per day are 5 9 for potato tbase of 2 c 10 for soybean tbase of 5 c and 9 for sugar beet tbase of 5 c since cold stress does not occur in the major part of the growing cycle an incorrect estimate of the temperature threshold for transpiration will not strongly affect the simulation of the biomass production 2 3 1 2 soil water stress in fao56 allen et al 1998 a single soil water depletion factor p is used which is 0 55 for alfalfa hay fig 2 the p factor is the fraction of available soil water that can be depleted from the root zone before transpiration is reduced below its potential in aquacrop following hsiao 1973 a distinction is made among three soil water stress levels that i reduce canopy expansion ii induce stomatal closure and iii trigger early canopy senescence fig 2 numerous studies have confirmed that leaf expansion hence the canopy is the most sensitive to soil water deficits and that stomatal conductance and hence transpiration is substantially less sensitive steduto et al 2012 for most calibrated crops in aquacrop the upper threshold of soil water depletion for canopy expansion is 0 15 0 20 of taw given that stomatal are substantial less sensitive to soil water depletion than canopy growth depletion factors of 0 15 upper and 0 55 lower for canopy expansion and 0 60 for stomatal control were selected for alfalfa fig 2 the considered depletion of 0 70 chosen for senescence is a typical value for the various crops which have been calibrated for aquacrop the shape of the water stress curve determines the magnitude of the effect of the stress on the process between the upper and lower thresholds in fao56 a linear decrease of ks is assumed once the allowed depletion p has been exceeded fig 2 in aquacrop the shape of the ks curves is convex which influences the process more strongly when the stress becomes severe and is more in line with the reduction in matric potential when the soil water content declines a recent publication trout and de jonge 2021 supports the hypothesis that a convex ks curve such as used in aquacrop represents better the plant response than a linear function 2 3 1 3 soil salinity stress the upper and lower thresholds for the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract ece are the values given by ayers and westcot 1985 for alfalfa since salinity stress was not observed in the study sites the model performance could not be evaluated 2 3 1 4 development of crop canopy cover the average cgc for the calibrated crops in aquacrop is 0 01 fraction soil cover per growing degree gd 1 and ranges between 0 004 and 0 020 gd 1 a value of 0 012 gd 1 was selected for alfalfa which is slightly above the average to consider the accelerated growth after each cutting the value allowed the crop to reach full canopy cover between cuttings in absence of stress typical values for cdc of calibrated crops in aquacrop range between 0 003 gd 1 and 0 010 gd 1 a value of 0 006 gd 1 was selected for alfalfa which is within the range of the cdc of the calibrated crops 2 3 1 5 crop transpiration and biomass production with a basal crop coefficient kcb and a soil water evaporation coefficient crop transpiration tr is separated from soil evaporation e in the dual crop coefficient approach of fao 56 there the basal crop coefficient kcb at mid season effective full cover for alfalfa hay is 1 15 allen et al 1998 aquacrop separates et into tr and e to avoid the confounding effect of the non productive consumptive use of water e the selected crop transpiration coefficient kctrx proposed for alfalfa in aquacrop was taken as the kcb of fao56 or 1 15 in annual crops aquacrop simulates a slow decline in canopy photosynthetic capacity following the achievement of full canopy cover steduto et al 2009 as the canopy ages slowly it undergoes a progressive though small reduction in maximum transpiration and photosynthetic rate this is simulated by applying an adjustment factor fage that decreases the crop transpiration coefficient kctr x by a constant albeit a slight fraction per day table 5 once the canopy reaches its maximum cover ccx natural senescence results in a declining crop coefficient transpiration and biomass production in the latter part of the season however as alfalfa is harvested multiple times soon after it reaches maximum cover the ageing effect does not take place and at each cut it is reset to zero and remains so as long as ccx is not reached before the next cut 2 3 1 6 rooting depth alfalfa has a very deep root system among perennial crops the tap root often reaches a depth of 1 5 2 0 m the first season 3 3 5 m by the end of the second year and ultimately it may extend to depths of 6 0 m or more in unrestricted soils weaver 1926 sun et al 2008 undersander et al 2011 however in aquacrop the maximum rooting depth of perennials such as alfalfa is simulated to reach its maximum value near the end of the first season and to remain constant in the successive years after sowing as indicated in table 5 the rooting depth increased from 0 3 m a default aquacrop value which refers to the depth from which the germinating seedling can extract water to 3 m deep at the end of the sowing year as indicated in fao56 for an open unrestricted soil in the successive years after sowing rooting depth remains at 3 m users can adjust the maximum rooting depth in the model according to their own soil conditions 2 3 1 7 canopy cover in aquacrop canopy cover cc is expressed as the fraction or percentage ground cover the initial canopy cover cco at germination is determined by the sowing or planting density it is assumed that an individual seedling at the time of its establishment covers 2 0 cm² of the soil surface and that the plant density is 2 5 million plants per hectare table 5 these values produce an initial canopy cover cco of 5 the canopy growth coefficient expressed as increase of ground cover per growing degree embedded in a logistic growth function describes the expansion of cc from cco to the maximum canopy cover ccx in the absence of stress steduto et al 2009 for optimal conditions ccx is determined by crop species and plant density the considered 95 for alfalfa ccx is the default value in aquacrop for an almost entirely covered situation by considering i the crop coefficient after cutting kclow 0 3 0 5 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 ii the crop coefficient when canopy is complete kctr x 1 15 table 5 wright 1988 and iii the adjustment in the simulations of the canopy cover cc when ccx is not yet reached raes et al 2022 it was estimated that after each cut the canopy cover was 25 cccut at the start of a non planting year an initial canopy cover of 50 was assumed guitjens 1990 2 3 1 8 calibration of wp by running simulations with the set of the common parametrized parameters table 5 wp was derived from eq 1 by considering the observed dry biomass and simulated tr table 6 to avoid the confounding effect of possible incorrectly estimated thresholds for soil water and soil fertility stress i data from ottawa were excluded and ii only data from the 100 irrigation fields in isparta and from years with limited soil water stress 2014 and 2016 in lln were considered furthermore by eliminating the data from the 1st cut the effect of cold stress on tr and the period of important remobilization of assimilates were eliminated to avoid the effect of significant storage of assimilates data of the second half of the season were also excluded finally the derived wp was normalized by considering the co2 concentration 369 41 ppm for the reference year 2000 steduto et al 2007 although data dispersion was high due to the remobilization and or storage of assimilates an average of 15 g m² was estimated as the value for wp table 6 2 3 2 length of the growing cycle the selected air temperature criterion for the onset and end of the growing cycle are specified in table 7 for determining the restart of regrowth in louvain la neuve and isparta air temperature data was appraised in a 120 days time window starting at 1 january for determining the end the time window was 90 days long finishing on 31 december since the average minimum air temperature in ottawa is below zero from november till april fig 1 3 in supplementary material the 120 days time window for the onset started at 1 april for determining the end the time window was 60 days long and finished on 31 october 2 3 3 transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts to simulate the transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts only three crop parameters are required in aquacrop i the start of the net storage stage ii the remobilization m and iii the storage s fractions fig 1 these parameters are mainly cultivar specific and can be calibrated with observed yield data however to illustrate the robustness of the simulation process a fine tuning for each of the study sites was not attempted for all 3 cultivars the following assumptions were made storage started at mid june to mid july which is 180 days before the end of the growing cycle for louvain la neuve and isparta and 100 days for ottawa where alfalfa has a shorter growing cycle 60 of the stored assimilates were remobilized in the next season m 0 60 given that high latitude cultivars have more seasonality with higher biomass partitioning below ground in late summer autumn in response to lower temperatures and shorter daylength moot et al 2012 the storage fraction s at the end of the growing cycle was chosen as 0 65 for louvain la neuve and ottawa and 0 45 for isparta the s values also reflected the differences among alfalfa cultivars according to their mediterranean or northern origin 2 3 4 soil fertility stress in ottawa no n fertilizer was applied jing et al 2020 by running simulations without soil fertility stress the maximum attainable total biomass production bmax in the 3 years of observations was about double of the observed yields reported measurements were 47 55 and 46 of simulated bmax in the three successive years in aquacrop soil fertility stress is evaluated through brel which is the relative biomass production with reference to bmax that can be achieved for a given soil fertility level in the absence of water or any other stress van gaelen et al 2014 by calibrating alfalfa with a brel of 50 aquacrop selects values for the three fertility stress coefficients affecting canopy development cc and the single coefficient affecting wp to achieve the specified brel the target crop parameters for the three coefficients affecting cc are respectively cgc ccx and a decline of cc after mid season in absence of field data allowing a fine tuning of the individual stress coefficients the default setting for the 4 stress coefficients was considered the default values corresponded to a 40 and 20 reduction respectively for ccx and cgc a 0 04 day decline of cc and a stress coefficient which gradually reduced wp from 15 g m² at the start of the season to 7 2 g m² at the end of the season when the nutrient reservoir became depleted 2 4 simulation runs all simulations were run with the common set of parameterized crop parameters table 5 simulations started in the sowing year for ottawa and lln due to the absence of data for the sowing year for isparta the first simulation was one year after sowing since the soil water content at the time of sowing was unknown simulations started with bare soil on 1 january well before sowing in louvain la neuve and ottawa given the importance of winter rains relative to the small to negligible eto it was assumed that the soil profile was at field capacity fc on that day by keeping track of the rainfall soil evaporation and deep percolation on the successive days of the simulation period aquacrop obtained the soil water content at the specified day of sowing for isparta simulations started on 1 january of the 1st year after sowing given the high eto and relative low rainfall during the year table 2 only the top 0 60 m of the soil profile was assumed to be at fc and the rest of the profile at 50 of taw at the start of the simulations apart from the sowing years simulations were run for the 2 ottawa and isparta and 3 lln years after sowing and for the 5 different irrigation strategies in isparta each simulation run stopped at the generated end of the growing cycle for the considered year fig 3 the run for the next year started on the day after the generated end of the growing cycle of the previous year the initial soil water content at the start of a run was given by the soil water content at the end of the previous run to evaluate the simulated above ground biomass dry matter four statistical indicators were used the equations are presented in chapter 4 of the supplementary material the coefficient of correlation r² the normalized root mean square error nrmse the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and the willmott s index of agreement d 3 results and discussion the generated onsets ends and lengths of the growing cycle for alfalfa for each of the study sites and simulated years are presented in table 8 the cold tress affecting crop transpiration and hence biomass production at the start and end of the growing cycle led to low biomass production at the start and end of the generated growing period where the growing degrees were generally smaller than the minimum required for full crop transpiration assessed at 8 c day in table 5 this greatly reduced the effects of possible errors in the start and end of the growing cycle for a representative simulation of the generated growing cycle fig 4 the relative biomass production eq 1 was only 5 of the total production in the first 30 days and 3 in the last 30 days of the cycle the simulations results would have been hardly affected if the noted start and end of the cycle was in fact later or earlier the simulated and observed cumulative biomass increasing at each harvest for the three study sites irrigation strategy and for all years are presented in fig 5 since cumulative biomass can compensate an over under yield estimate at one harvest by a similar under over yield estimate at the next harvest also the individual simulations for all the 81 harvest events were evaluated fig 6 the statistical evaluation is given in table 9 the statistical evaluation table 9 indicates that aquacrop simulated well the observed yield in the three different environments with a common set of parametrized crop parameters and a tentatively calibrated wp the evaluation of the cumulative dry above ground biomass fig 5 indicates that the simulated results are good to very good the indicators r² nrmse and ef indicate a very small dispersion between observed and simulated biomass the evaluation of the 81 individual harvests fig 6 still confirms the quality of the model although the nrmse moderate good shows that the dispersion is twice as large then for the cumulative biomass the high value of the d indicator confirms that there is no systematic over or underestimation by the model aquacrop differs from other crop simulation models by its water driven growth engine in which the daily biomass production bi is made proportional to the amount of water consumed as crop transpiration eq 1 through a normalized water productivity parameter wp in other alfalfa models which are carbon or solar driven growth is based on carbon assimilation by the photosynthetis and the key parameter relating biomass to intercepted radiation is the radiation use efficiency rue to complete the simulation of biomass production other models also consider the maintenance and growth respiration of the various organs and the partition of the structural biomass amongst the various plant organs stem leafs roots and storage organs although such calculation scheme is more explanatory than that of aquacrop rue models require knowledge of an extended number of variables and input parameters which are not easily available and much more familiar to scientists than to end users in contrast aquacrop requires only three extra crop parameters see section 2 3 3 to simulate the transfer of assimilates between the above and the below ground parts in alfalfa additionally the transfer of assimilates can be easily calibrated by altering i the storage fraction s at the end of the growing cycle and or ii the remobilization fraction m in the next season and or iii the storage time notwithstanding the huge simplification of the transfer processes subroutine the results suggest that aquacrop performs as well or even better than other more complex models in the simulation of alfalfa yield table 10 the simulated green canopy cover the remobilized and stored assimilates and the observed and simulated cumulative above ground biomass during the growing cycle of alfalfa for all years irrigation managements and study sites are presented in chapter 5 of the supplementary material as an example the simulation results for the 2nd year after sowing for isparta for the 75 et irrigated treatment are presented in fig 7 as can be observed in the central plot the simulated transfer of assimilates differed from the theoretical functions fig 7 dotted lines because the transfer was affected by i cold stress which was severe at the start and end of the season ii the frequency of cuttings and iii soil water deficits the response of the transfer to stresses and frequency of cuttings allows aquacrop to simulate the negative effect of water stress and or late cuttings on the amount of stored assimilates at the end of the season when the root reserves are too low during the winter period insufficient carbohydrates can be remobilized at the start of the next season to accelerate regrowth fine tuning of the water stress parameters was not possible as sufficient field data was not available nevertheless with the parametrized set table 5 the effect of water stress on alfalfa yield was well simulated in the water stressed treatments for the 2nd year after sowing for lln and the 75 50 and 25 et irrigated treatments in isparta the nrmse remained below 15 good only for the rainfed alfalfa in isparta resulting in very severe water stress the nrmse increased to 25 moderate good and this only for the 2nd year after sowing this moderately good result might be partly linked to the fixed rooting depth at 3 m considered by aquacrop for all the years after sowing since it has been reported in the literature that the taproot still expands in the following years and it may ultimately reach a depth of 6 0 m or more in unrestricted soils weaver 1926 sun et al 2008 undersander et al 2011 it is possible that rainfed alfalfa could have drawn stored water from the winter rains from the soil layers below 3 m the restricted rooting depth in aquacrop to 3 m may therefore be the cause for the underprediction of biomass production at the beginning of the 2nd year of rainfed alfalfa fig 5 2 h and 5 2j in the supplementary materials with the common air temperature criterion for generating the onset and end of the growing cycle together with the estimated cold threshold for transpiration good to very good estimates of alfalfa yield were obtained notwithstanding that the criterion and thresholds might differ for other cultivars and climatic conditions in aquacrop wp for c3 crops ranges between 15 and 20 g m² the simulation results indicated that with a wp of 15 g m² for alfalfa very good estimates of yields were obtained however the value should be regarded as a first conservative estimate for alfalfa as it is not known with certainty that soil fertility was optimal in all sites used in this calibration if soil fertility was limiting yields then one would expect the value of wp to be above 15 g m² 4 conclusions an extension of the aquacrop model to simulate a perennial crop alfalfa is presented here the processes of assimilate storage below ground and the subsequent remobilization to supplement above ground growth were simulated in a simple way by multiplying the biomass water productivity wp with a correction factor greater than one during the remobilization stage and smaller than one during the storage stage experimental data from three different environments vastly different in climate such as canada belgium and turkey were used to calibrate the model the comparisons between measurements and the simulations indicated that aquacrop can well predict the total yield of alfalfa that can be expected in various climates and environments with and without water stress and soil fertility stress for three different alfalfa cultivars
