21050,it is well known that discrete advection schemes can induce spurious numerical mixing in numerical models in the present study an offline method is applied to several idealized lock exchange simulations and a realistic model simulation of byecs bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing numerical mixing is defined as the tracer variance dissipation rate induced by the discretization of advection schemes and the offline method is achieved through diagnosing the residual of the tracer variance balance equation in terms of model output data the offline method is demonstrated to be appropriate to estimate the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing when the model output data capture typical flow timescales in both of the lock exchange and byecs simulations the spatial distributions of numerical and explicit physical mixing of salinity correspond to the distributions of horizontal and vertical salinity gradients respectively in the lock exchange simulations explicit physical mixing depresses the magnitude of numerical mixing through reducing the horizontal salinity gradients at the heading fronts in the byecs simulations numerical mixing of salinity inside the changjiang river plume region is stronger during spring tides than neap tides keywords numerical model mixing offline method variance dissipation 1 introduction mixing is a key and irreversible process that redistributes the dissolved tracers and dissipates energy in the ocean many physical processes such as breaking internal waves submesoscale currents and molecular diffusion can induce mixing to parameterize the subgrid physical mixing induced by these physical processes in numerical models turbulent closure schemes are usually applied in the momentum and tracer transport equations li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in contrast to mixing advection is reversible when simulating the advective terms for momentum and tracers in numerical models the discretization of advection schemes would induce spurious mixing even in the absence of the explicit subgrid physical mixing gerdes et al 1991 vitousek and fringer 2011 lin and liu 2019 in the present study the spurious mixing of tracers induced by the model discretization is defined as the numerical mixing nm in coastal and estuarine model simulations the effect of numerical mixing is often significant especially in the regions with fronts or complicated topographies e g morales maqueda and holloway 2006 holleman et al 2013 ralston et al 2017 increasing the model grid resolution is a useful way to reduce the magnitude of numerical mixing riemenscheider and legg 2007 wang 2016 but it is not feasible for all cases due to more computational cost is required to set up a reasonable grid resolution in a numerical simulation numerical mixing needs to be diagnosed in addition the spatial distributions of model simulated salinity and temperature are sometimes analyzed to evaluate the performance of turbulent closure schemes in ocean models li et al 2005 warner et al 2005 however numerical mixing may induce great spurious diapycnal transport which also has great impact on the temperature and salinity distributions thus the numerical and explicit physical mixing should be diagnosed and compared when evaluating the performance of turbulent closure schemes theories and methods based on various mixing definitions such as the effective diapycnal diffusivity griffies et al 2000 and tracer variance dissipation rate james 1996 burchard and rennau 2008 have been proposed to diagnose the magnitude of numerical mixing the dissipation of tracer variance which is analogous to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy osborn and cox 1972 nash and moum 1999 is a more robust definition than diffusivity and diffusive flux to represent the strength of mixing burchard and rennau 2008 based on the definition of tracer variance dissipation rate james 1996 showed that the time change rate of the volume integrated tracer square could be used to diagnose numerical mixing inside a closed system burchard and rennau 2008 derived the tracer variance dissipation induced by advective discretization schemes and proposed an online method to calculate the difference between the advected square of the tracer and the square of the advected tracer at every time step to diagnose numerical mixing for individual grid cells this online method has been applied in numerous investigations e g rennau and burchard 2009 ralston et al 2017 kalra et al 2019 through diagnosing the residual of the tracer variance balance equation based on model output data several recent studies gave a try to apply an offline method to estimate the volume and temporally averaged numerical mixing e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 while the online method of burchard and rennau 2008 resolves numerical mixing in individual grid cells the offline method provides an alternative way for the downstream model data users to estimate the numerical mixing at domain levels without rerunning the model nowadays we can access the datasets of model outputs from the internet or from other investigators if we can estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing directly through the model output it will help us evaluate the numerical model output preliminarily before using them however in the previous studies those involved the offline method e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 they neither described clearly nor examined the accuracy of the offline method since the estimation of numerical mixing was not the main focus in their studies the model output frequency is an important factor that may influence the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method in the present study the offline method based on the tracer variance equation is clearly described and examined through comparing with the numerical mixing estimated by the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 the detailed derivation of the tracer variance balance equation and its application in the estimation of numerical mixing are described in section 2 in section 3 several idealized lock exchange simulations and a realistic simulation of byecs based on the regional ocean modeling system roms model are conducted to discuss the accuracy of the offline method as well as to study the spatial and temporal variations of the numerical and explicit physical mixing in these models section 4 presents the discussion and conclusions 2 methods 2 1 tracer variance balance equation before describing the offline method that applies the discrete tracer variance equation to estimate numerical mixing the continuous non discrete tracer variance balance equation is derived following previous studies e g burchard and rennau 2008 ralston et al 2017 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 salinity is used as an instance because it is conservative without interior sinks and sources for in compressible flow the conservation equation for salinity s can be written as 1 s t u s x k h s x y k h s y z k z s z where u is the three dimensional velocity vector and k h and k z indicate the explicit horizontal and vertical diffusivities respectively in a domain with volume v the volume averaged salinity variance can be defined as 1 v s 2 d v where s s s 0 denotes salinity anomaly and s 0 indicates the volume and time averaged salinity with the averaging time period defined as the interim period between the snapshots for calculating the time derivative term the sea surface condition for salinity is f s e p s 0 where p and e indicate the precipitation and evaporation rates per unit area respectively combining s s 0 s to eq 1 and multiplying by 2s we get the conservation equation for the salinity variance s 2 2 s 2 t u s 2 k h s 2 x i s 2 y j k z s 2 z k 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 where i j and k indicate the unit normal vectors in x y and z directions respectively the diffusivities k h and k z for subgrid processes are usually parameterized through the explicit background diffusivity or turbulent closure schemes in numerical models in coastal and estuarine regions the horizontal diffusive flux is usually much smaller than the vertical due to the larger horizontal scale compared to the vertical scale so the explicit horizontal diffusive flux is often neglected through setting the explicit horizontal diffusivity k h to be 0 in coastal and estuarine numerical models e g warner et al 2005 ralston et al 2017 wang et al 2017 maccready et al 2018 kalra et al 2019 nevertheless to make the offline diagnostic method practical for more general cases the horizontal diffusive flux of salinity variance k h s 2 x s 2 y is remained in the present study the summation of the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 2 can be written as 3 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 χ s where χ s indicates salinity variance dissipation rate when assuming steady and homogeneous turbulence osborn and cox 1972 nash and moum 1999 in the reality physical mixing pm is the only contributor to the dissipation of salinity variance the sea surface boundary condition for salinity variance can be written as e p s 0 2 taking the average of eq 2 in a domain with water volume v that covers the water from surface to bottom and combining with eq 3 we can obtain a simple equation that shows the relationship among the temporal variation of salinity variance inside the domain salinity variance fluxes at the open boundaries of the domain and mixing variance dissipation inside the domain 4 v t s 2 d v t v t e m p o r a l v a r i a t i o n 1 v u s 2 n ˆ d a a f 1 v k h s 2 x i s 2 y j n ˆ d a d f 1 v

the terms in eq 4 are abbreviated as the tv temporal variation of salinity variance term the af advective flux of salinity variance term the df diffusive flux of salinity variance term the pef variance flux due to precipitation and evaporation term and the pm physical mixing term as shown in eq 3 the physical mixing pm term can be decomposed into the horizontal and vertical components and we define the horizontal and vertical components as hm and vm respectively a k a h m 1 v 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 d v and v m 1 v 2 k z s z 2 d v according to eq 4 the temporal variation of salinity variance i e the term in the left hand side lhs depends on the salinity variance fluxes at the open boundaries the first three terms in the rhs and salinity variance dissipation due to physical mixing inside the volume the last term in the rhs in previous studies li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 the second and third terms in the rhs of eq 4 a k a the flux terms those are related to the horizontal diffusion precipitation and evaporation were not taken into account in the present study to make the offline diagnostic method practical for more general cases we remain all of the terms in eq 4 for further calculations 2 2 diagnosing numerical mixing when spatial discretization is applied in numerical models eq 4 is not conserved due to the generation of spurious numerical mixing burchard and rennau 2008 thus the residual of the salinity variance budget in eq 4 is expected to be computed with the discrete model output data to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing in a domain with volume v the domain volume v can be as small as one discrete water column of the original model grid for the water column with the horizontal coordinate i j the volume depth averaged numerical mixing can be estimated as 5 n m i j t v i j a f i j d f i j p e f i j p m i j the summation of nm i j numerical mixing and pm i j physical mixing is defined as tm i j total mixing in the present study the detailed description for offline calculations through applying eq 5 in the regional oceanic modelling system roms www myroms org model output data are shown in the appendix in a closed domain salinity variance dissipation mixing is the only sink for the entire volume averaged salinity variance so the magnitude of total mixing can be quantified through the time change rate of the entire volume averaged salinity variance as discussed in james 1996 in an open domain salinity variance fluxes at open boundaries also play significant roles through calculating the salinity variance fluxes at open boundaries the variance balance equation eq 5 is expected to be applied for the estimation of numerical mixing in the sub volumes furthermore eq 2 has the theoretical possibility to diagnose numerical mixing for the sub volumes that do not integrate over the entire water column but vertically resolve the water column in the present study we only discuss the application of eq 5 for the vertical average over the entire water column because it is more convenient and easier to be achieved based on the model output data the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing is meaningful and burchard and rennau 2008 also recommended to apply spatial and temporal averaging to the numerical tracer variance dissipation to obtain information on numerical mixing when the time interval of model output is longer than the model online calculation time step the estimated time averaged variance fluxes and explicit physical mixing based on the model output data are not as accurate as those quantified with the model online calculation time step in the present study to examine the influence of model output frequency on the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 is also applied to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing which is defined as nmbr on through deriving the tracer variance dissipation induced by advective discretization schemes burchard and rennau 2008 proposed that numerical mixing could be estimated by the difference between the advected square of the salinity a s 2 and the square of the advected salinity a s 2 divided by the time step 6 n m o n b r a s 2 a s 2 δ t where a is the advection operator and δ t is the model time step the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 has been coded into the online calculations of the roms model although the offline and online methods both refer to the numerically induced tracer variance dissipation as numerical mixing there is difference between the calculation methods burchard and rennau 2008 estimated numerical mixing through calculating the difference between the advected square of the tracer and the square of the advected tracer while the offline method in the present study estimates numerical mixing through calculating the residual of the tracer variance equation budget see eq 5 3 results 3 1 lock exchange model in this section several numerical simulations based on a lock exchange model are conducted to compare the offline method with the online method and study the influence of model output frequency on the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method the lock exchange model is two dimensional with horizontal dimension 0 x 64 km and vertical dimension 20 m z 0 temperature remains as a constant at 10 c throughout the entire domain and there is no source or sink of salinity and temperature at the boundaries the explicit background vertical viscosity is set to 5 10 4 m2 s 1 in all of the simulations initial conditions are the same at the initial stage the dense water with salinity of 30 g kg on the left is separated with the fresh water on the right fig 1 a the model calculation time step in all of the lock exchange simulation is set to be 1 s 3 1 1 relationship between numerical mixing and salinity variance dissipation to demonstrate that the salinity variance dissipation rate is an appropriate quantity to represent the magnitude of numerical mixing two sets of model experiments with different grid resolutions are conducted in both sets of the experiments the explicit background including vertical and horizontal diffusivities are set to 0 and no turbulence closure scheme is applied so explicit physical mixing of salinity is absent mpdata advection scheme based on the sign preserving properties of upstream differencing is employed smolarkiewicz and margolin 1998 therefore in these experiments when the integrated volume is chosen as the entire model domain the numerical mixing induced by the discrete mpdata advection scheme is the only sink for salinity variance the first set of model experiments are with a fixed horizontal grid resolution of δx 500 m and various vertical grid resolutions of δz 10 m 5 m 2 m and 1 m respectively the second set of experiments are with the fixed vertical grid resolution of δz 1 m and various horizontal grid resolutions of δx 4 km 2 km 1 km and 500 m respectively the time interval of instantaneous model output for offline calculation is set as 2 min which is much longer than the model online calculation time step 1 s the entire model domain is chosen for the volume analysis so the initial salinity variance s 2 is 225 g kg 2 throughout the model domain fig 1b in all cases fig 2 shows the snapshots of salinity and salinity variance at time t 7 h from the first set of experiments because there is no explicit physical mixing of salinity the system is supposed to be adiabatic without dilution however due to the existence of spurious numerical mixing apparent salinity dilution occurs after the initial time step as shown in fig 2 due to the horizontal density gradient gravity current circulations and two heading fronts are generated fig 2 and the velocities of the gravity currents are proportional to the horizontal density gradients at the heading fronts in the experiments with coarser grid spacing more dilution is induced by spurious numerical mixing to decrease the horizontal density gradients at the heading fronts as a result the speeds of the gravity currents are more slowly in the experiment with coarser resolutions than that with finer resolutions therefore as the spatial resolution increases the heading fronts propagate more rapidly fig 2 the second set of experiments with fixed vertical grid resolution and various horizontal resolutions show similar results not shown for brevity in the regions where salinity is diluted the magnitude of salinity variance s 2 becomes smaller fig 2 comparing with the initial condition s 2 225 g kg 2 fig 1 which implies that the volume averaged salinity variance decreases fig 3 according to eq 4 and eq 5 when explicit physical mixing is absent in a closed system the temporal change rate of volume averaged salinity variance only depends on the magnitude of numerical mixing as shown in fig 3 the volume averaged salinity variance decreases more slowly in the cases with finer horizontal or vertical model resolutions indicating that the magnitude of numerical mixing decreases as the model spatial resolution becomes finer when model resolution becomes fine enough the impact of the spatial resolution on the magnitude of numerical mixing is less significant for instance numerical mixing in the experiments with horizontal resolutions of δx 1 km and δx 500 m are comparable fig 3b 3 1 2 comparisons between the offline and online methods in open domains in a closed system numerical mixing is only related to the time change rate of the volume averaged salinity variance in an open system the fluxes of salinity variance at open boundaries should also be taken into account as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 to examine the offline method for numerical mixing estimation in open domains we apply eq 5 to the case with the resolution of δx 500 m δz 1 m and estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing nm off in each discrete water column of the model grid for comparison the method eq 6 proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 is also applied online to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing nmbr on to examine the feasibility of the offline method when there is explicit physical mixing another experiment with the resolution of δx 500 m δz 1 m and explicit vertical and horizontal diffusivities of k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 is conducted the temporally and column depth averaged results between time t 6 h and t 8 h under the conditions without and with explicit physical mixing are shown in fig 4 under the condition without explicit physical mixing the magnitude of numerical mixing is equal to total mixing fig 4b and c it reaches its peaks at the fronts possibly owing to the strong horizontal salinity gradient as discussed in smolarkiewicz 1983 when the first order upwind advection scheme is applied in a one dimensional advective flow 7 s t u s x 0 the magnitude of numerical mixing is 8 u δ x u 2 δ t s x 2 u δ x 1 u δ t δ x s x 2 where δx and δt indicate the model horizontal resolution and model online calculation time step respectively smolarkiewicz 1983 because the courant number u δ t δ x is smaller than 1 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to horizontal salinity gradient to evaluate the effects of the horizontal discretization on the magnitude of numerical mixing we also applied eq 8 estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing based on the model output data between time t 6 h and t 8 h the estimated volume and temporally averaged numerical mixing at fronts based on eq 8 was about 6 10 3 g kg 2 s 2 and 3 10 3 g kg 2 s 2 in the experiments without and with explicit physical mixing respectively this is close to the results shown in fig 4c and f in addition to the horizontal advection vertical advection also possibly contributes to the generation of numerical mixing in the lock exchange simulations the vertical fluctuations of isohalines at the heading fronts as shown in fig 2d imply that strong vertical velocities occur at small scales so the vertical advection across the horizontal interface is another possible reason for the strong numerical mixing at the heading fronts compared with the experiment without physical mixing fig 4a more dilution occurs in the experiment with explicit physical mixing to result in weaker vertical salinity gradients at the horizontal interface and horizontal salinity gradients at the heading fronts fig 4d the magnitude of numerical mixing also reaches its peaks at the fronts fig 4f but it is smaller than half of the numerical mixing in the experiment without explicit physical mixing fig 4c the depression of numerical mixing under the condition with explicit physical mixing is possibly related to the diffusion at the heading fronts in the experiment with explicit physical mixing k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 the explicit physical mixing leads to salinity diffusion to decease horizontal salinity gradients at fronts fig 4d as shown in eq 8 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to the horizontal salinity gradient so the existence of explicit physical mixing depresses the magnitude of numerical mixing we also did another experiment with k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 0 not shown for brevity and in that experiment numerical mixing is slightly about 10 stronger than the case with k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 this implies that both of the explicit vertical and horizontal physical mixing contributes to the salinity diffusion and depressing the numerical mixing as shown in fig 4c and f when eq 5 is applied to every discrete water column in the lock exchange model domain the estimated numerical mixing is almost consistent with that estimated by the online method 3 1 3 the influence of model output frequency when model output time interval is longer than the model online calculation time step the temporally averaged fluxes at the open boundaries and explicit physical mixing are not exactly equal to those computed by model online calculations and this leads to errors in calculating the variance balance equation eq 5 based on the model output data to study the impact of the model output frequency on the accuracy of the offline method we did experiments with the same set ups as the experiments shown in fig 4 and outputted the model data with three different time intervals of 2 min 5 min and 10 min based on the model output data with the three different output time intervals the temporally and water column depth averaged numerical mixing between time t 6 h and t 8 h is estimated through the offline method fig 5 numerical mixing nmbr on estimated by the online method is used to examine the accuracy of the offline method as shown in fig 5 as the model output time interval increases the accuracy of the offline method decreases in both of the cases without and with explicit physical mixing when the model output time interval is smaller than 5 min the magnitude of numerical mixing estimated by the offline method is consistent with nmbr on this is because 5 min is close to the typical flow timescale of the gravity current the analytical flow speed of a gravity current in a two dimensional and two layer flow is given as 9 u f 1 2 g h δ ρ ρ 0 where h indicates the water depth which is 20 m in the lock exchange model and δρ indicates the density contrast across the vertical front benjamin 1968 according to the relationship between density and salinity ρ ρ 0 1 β s where β 7 7 10 4 the density contrast across the front is about 23 kg m 3 at the initial time of the lock exchange simulations thus the typical flow speed of the gravity current in the lock exchange experiment is about 1 1 m s 1 5 min is close to the typical time scale for the gravity current passes through a model grid cell δx 500 m so the magnitude of numerical mixing quantified with the model output data with time interval smaller than 5 min is close to nmbr on 3 2 byecs experiment in this section to examine the feasibility and accuracy of the offline method in a realistic three dimensional model the offline method is applied to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing in a roms model based on realistic topography which covers the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea byecs to examine the offline method the magnitude of numerical mixing is also computed by the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 nmbr on the fundamental model set up is the same as that used in bian et al 2013 the model domain 116oe 134oe 20on 42on shown in fig 6 has a 1 12 horizontal resolution and 20 vertical levels the time step used for the three dimensional baroclinic mode is 300 s while the two dimensional barotropic mode uses a smaller time step of 30 s the mellor and yamada closure scheme is applied to calculate vertical mixing and its feasibility has been demonstrated in the coastal and estuarine model studies warner et al 2005 chen et al 2014 the explicit horizontal diffusivity is set to 0 the tidal forcing includes eight principal tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 the monthly climatological forcing at the surface is derived from coads dasilva et al 1994 the model was initialized on january 1 2000 with the temperature and salinity from the world ocean atlas 2005 and run for 2 years as spin up the hourly instantaneous data during june of the third year were outputted for estimating the magnitude of numerical mixing by the offline method to compare the magnitudes of numerical mixing induced by different advection schemes mpdata and u3h advection schemes are applied respectively as shown in fig 6 the extensions of the changjiang river plume during june are similar in both model results when the two different advection schemes are applied and they are both roughly consistent with the editorial board for marine atlas 1992 the numerical mixing of salinity mainly occurs inside the region of the changjiang river plume fig 6b and d so the plume region bounded with black dashed lines in fig 6 is further analyzed to examine the offline diagnostic method and study the spatial and temporal variations of numerical and explicit physical mixing in the byecs model there is surface freshwater forcing thus the influences of evaporation and precipitation are also taken into account in the calculations with the salinity variance balance equation eq 5 3 2 1 spring neap variations of the numerical and explicit physical mixing to study the spring neap variability we apply eq 5 to the hourly model output to obtain the volume and tidally averaged numerical and explicit physical mixing in the region bounded with black dashed lines in fig 6 for comparison numerical mixing is also estimated through the online method nmbr on the magnitudes of numerical mixing are in the same order as the explicit physical mixing in both experiments with different advection scheme fig 7 b and d it implies that the well simulated salinity distributions shown in fig 6a and c are under the influences of both numerical and explicit physical mixing as shown in fig 7 nm off and nmbr on are close to each other both of which are enhanced during spring tides and suppressed during neap tides the spring neap variation of numerical mixing is possibly related to the variation of tidal velocity in the byecs model the model time step and horizontal resolution are δt 300 s and δx 8000 m respectively according to eq 8 when the horizontal velocity is smaller than 13 m s 1 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to the magnitude of horizontal velocity as shown in fig 7 the velocity is stronger during spring tides than neap tides and smaller than 1 m s 1 thus the spring neap variability of numerical mixing is modulated by the magnitude of tidal velocity which is larger during spring than neap tides when two different advection schemes mpdata and u3h are applied the magnitudes of numerical mixing are comparable the explicit physical mixing is much stronger in the mpdata experiment although the turbulence closure schemes applied in these two experiments are the same this is because advection scheme influences the salinity transport and vertical salinity gradient the magnitude of explicit physical mixing is proportional to the vertical salinity gradient so the magnitudes of explicit physical mixing are different in these two experiments 3 2 2 horizontal distributions of the numerical and explicit physical mixing in addition to the temporal variation the spatial distributions of spring neap and depth averaged explicit physical and numerical mixing are also studied in the river plume region through applying eq 5 to every discrete water column of the original model grid as shown in fig 8 the patterns of nm off are roughly consistent with nmbr on thus the offline method is appropriate to diagnose the spatial distribution of numerical mixing in this case numerical mixing is mainly enhanced near the coast while explicit physical mixing is mainly enhanced a little far away from the coast as shown in fig 9 the regions with enhanced physical mixing are almost consistent with the regions with strong vertical salinity gradient fig 9a and c while numerical mixing is enhanced in the regions with strong lateral salinity gradients fig 9b and d the association of numerical mixing with strong horizontal salinity gradients in the simulation is consistent with the results in ralston et al 2017 in the mpdata experiment explicit physical mixing is slightly stronger than that in the u3h experiment especially near the minzhe coast fig 8a and e this is because more fresh water from changjiang is transported to the minzhe coast when mpdata advection scheme is applied which leads to stronger vertical salinity gradients in this region for mixing fig 9a and c therefore as shown in figs 8 and 9 the distributions of explicit physical and numerical mixing depend on the vertical and horizontal salinity gradients respectively 4 discussion and conclusions being similar to the results of the present study the magnitude of numerical mixing is comparable to explicit physical mixing in many numerical model simulations e g rennau and burchard 2009 ralston et al 2017 so the effects of numerical mixing can not be neglected the offline method described in the present study provides an alternative way for the downstream investigators to assess numerical numerical without re running the models the offline method is based on calculating the residual of the tracer variance balance equation in a closed domain the variance dissipation mixing is the only sink term for the volume averaged tracer variance so the magnitude of total mixing can be estimated through the time change rate of the volume averaged salinity variance in an open domain the tracer variance fluxes at open boundaries also play important roles through computing the tracer variance fluxes at open boundaries the tracer variance balance equation can be applied for the assessment of numerical mixing in sub volumes our model simulations show that the accuracy of the offline method is affected by model output frequency however when the model output data capture the typical flow timescales it is demonstrated to be appropriate to apply the offline method to estimate the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing for instance it is appropriate to apply the offline method to estimate the tidally averaged numerical mixing based on the hourly coastal and estuarine model output data because they capture the typical tidal timescales e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 the tracer variance equation is theoretically robust for any conservative tracers so the offline method is expected to be applied in other numerical models beyond roms nevertheless the estimation of fluxes at the open boundaries should be handled carefully especially in the unstructured grid models and its influence on the accuracy of the offline method needs further studies in future based on the offline method the temporal and spatial variations of numerical and explicit physical mixing in the lock exchange and byecs simulations is studied in both of the lock exchange and byecs models the spatial distributions of numerical and explicit physical mixing of salinity are proportional to the horizontal and vertical salinity gradients respectively in the lock exchange simulations because explicit physical mixing reduces the horizontal tracer gradients at the heading fronts the magnitude of numerical mixing is smaller in the case with explicit physical mixing than that without explicit physical mixing in the byecs simulations the magnitude of numerical mixing inside the changjiang river plume is stronger during spring tides than neap tides due to stronger tidal

21050,it is well known that discrete advection schemes can induce spurious numerical mixing in numerical models in the present study an offline method is applied to several idealized lock exchange simulations and a realistic model simulation of byecs bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing numerical mixing is defined as the tracer variance dissipation rate induced by the discretization of advection schemes and the offline method is achieved through diagnosing the residual of the tracer variance balance equation in terms of model output data the offline method is demonstrated to be appropriate to estimate the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing when the model output data capture typical flow timescales in both of the lock exchange and byecs simulations the spatial distributions of numerical and explicit physical mixing of salinity correspond to the distributions of horizontal and vertical salinity gradients respectively in the lock exchange simulations explicit physical mixing depresses the magnitude of numerical mixing through reducing the horizontal salinity gradients at the heading fronts in the byecs simulations numerical mixing of salinity inside the changjiang river plume region is stronger during spring tides than neap tides keywords numerical model mixing offline method variance dissipation 1 introduction mixing is a key and irreversible process that redistributes the dissolved tracers and dissipates energy in the ocean many physical processes such as breaking internal waves submesoscale currents and molecular diffusion can induce mixing to parameterize the subgrid physical mixing induced by these physical processes in numerical models turbulent closure schemes are usually applied in the momentum and tracer transport equations li et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in contrast to mixing advection is reversible when simulating the advective terms for momentum and tracers in numerical models the discretization of advection schemes would induce spurious mixing even in the absence of the explicit subgrid physical mixing gerdes et al 1991 vitousek and fringer 2011 lin and liu 2019 in the present study the spurious mixing of tracers induced by the model discretization is defined as the numerical mixing nm in coastal and estuarine model simulations the effect of numerical mixing is often significant especially in the regions with fronts or complicated topographies e g morales maqueda and holloway 2006 holleman et al 2013 ralston et al 2017 increasing the model grid resolution is a useful way to reduce the magnitude of numerical mixing riemenscheider and legg 2007 wang 2016 but it is not feasible for all cases due to more computational cost is required to set up a reasonable grid resolution in a numerical simulation numerical mixing needs to be diagnosed in addition the spatial distributions of model simulated salinity and temperature are sometimes analyzed to evaluate the performance of turbulent closure schemes in ocean models li et al 2005 warner et al 2005 however numerical mixing may induce great spurious diapycnal transport which also has great impact on the temperature and salinity distributions thus the numerical and explicit physical mixing should be diagnosed and compared when evaluating the performance of turbulent closure schemes theories and methods based on various mixing definitions such as the effective diapycnal diffusivity griffies et al 2000 and tracer variance dissipation rate james 1996 burchard and rennau 2008 have been proposed to diagnose the magnitude of numerical mixing the dissipation of tracer variance which is analogous to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy osborn and cox 1972 nash and moum 1999 is a more robust definition than diffusivity and diffusive flux to represent the strength of mixing burchard and rennau 2008 based on the definition of tracer variance dissipation rate james 1996 showed that the time change rate of the volume integrated tracer square could be used to diagnose numerical mixing inside a closed system burchard and rennau 2008 derived the tracer variance dissipation induced by advective discretization schemes and proposed an online method to calculate the difference between the advected square of the tracer and the square of the advected tracer at every time step to diagnose numerical mixing for individual grid cells this online method has been applied in numerous investigations e g rennau and burchard 2009 ralston et al 2017 kalra et al 2019 through diagnosing the residual of the tracer variance balance equation based on model output data several recent studies gave a try to apply an offline method to estimate the volume and temporally averaged numerical mixing e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 while the online method of burchard and rennau 2008 resolves numerical mixing in individual grid cells the offline method provides an alternative way for the downstream model data users to estimate the numerical mixing at domain levels without rerunning the model nowadays we can access the datasets of model outputs from the internet or from other investigators if we can estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing directly through the model output it will help us evaluate the numerical model output preliminarily before using them however in the previous studies those involved the offline method e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 they neither described clearly nor examined the accuracy of the offline method since the estimation of numerical mixing was not the main focus in their studies the model output frequency is an important factor that may influence the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method in the present study the offline method based on the tracer variance equation is clearly described and examined through comparing with the numerical mixing estimated by the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 the detailed derivation of the tracer variance balance equation and its application in the estimation of numerical mixing are described in section 2 in section 3 several idealized lock exchange simulations and a realistic simulation of byecs based on the regional ocean modeling system roms model are conducted to discuss the accuracy of the offline method as well as to study the spatial and temporal variations of the numerical and explicit physical mixing in these models section 4 presents the discussion and conclusions 2 methods 2 1 tracer variance balance equation before describing the offline method that applies the discrete tracer variance equation to estimate numerical mixing the continuous non discrete tracer variance balance equation is derived following previous studies e g burchard and rennau 2008 ralston et al 2017 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 salinity is used as an instance because it is conservative without interior sinks and sources for in compressible flow the conservation equation for salinity s can be written as 1 s t u s x k h s x y k h s y z k z s z where u is the three dimensional velocity vector and k h and k z indicate the explicit horizontal and vertical diffusivities respectively in a domain with volume v the volume averaged salinity variance can be defined as 1 v s 2 d v where s s s 0 denotes salinity anomaly and s 0 indicates the volume and time averaged salinity with the averaging time period defined as the interim period between the snapshots for calculating the time derivative term the sea surface condition for salinity is f s e p s 0 where p and e indicate the precipitation and evaporation rates per unit area respectively combining s s 0 s to eq 1 and multiplying by 2s we get the conservation equation for the salinity variance s 2 2 s 2 t u s 2 k h s 2 x i s 2 y j k z s 2 z k 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 where i j and k indicate the unit normal vectors in x y and z directions respectively the diffusivities k h and k z for subgrid processes are usually parameterized through the explicit background diffusivity or turbulent closure schemes in numerical models in coastal and estuarine regions the horizontal diffusive flux is usually much smaller than the vertical due to the larger horizontal scale compared to the vertical scale so the explicit horizontal diffusive flux is often neglected through setting the explicit horizontal diffusivity k h to be 0 in coastal and estuarine numerical models e g warner et al 2005 ralston et al 2017 wang et al 2017 maccready et al 2018 kalra et al 2019 nevertheless to make the offline diagnostic method practical for more general cases the horizontal diffusive flux of salinity variance k h s 2 x s 2 y is remained in the present study the summation of the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 2 can be written as 3 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 2 k z s z 2 χ s where χ s indicates salinity variance dissipation rate when assuming steady and homogeneous turbulence osborn and cox 1972 nash and moum 1999 in the reality physical mixing pm is the only contributor to the dissipation of salinity variance the sea surface boundary condition for salinity variance can be written as e p s 0 2 taking the average of eq 2 in a domain with water volume v that covers the water from surface to bottom and combining with eq 3 we can obtain a simple equation that shows the relationship among the temporal variation of salinity variance inside the domain salinity variance fluxes at the open boundaries of the domain and mixing variance dissipation inside the domain 4 v t s 2 d v t v t e m p o r a l v a r i a t i o n 1 v u s 2 n ˆ d a a f 1 v k h s 2 x i s 2 y j n ˆ d a d f 1 v

the terms in eq 4 are abbreviated as the tv temporal variation of salinity variance term the af advective flux of salinity variance term the df diffusive flux of salinity variance term the pef variance flux due to precipitation and evaporation term and the pm physical mixing term as shown in eq 3 the physical mixing pm term can be decomposed into the horizontal and vertical components and we define the horizontal and vertical components as hm and vm respectively a k a h m 1 v 2 k h s x 2 s y 2 d v and v m 1 v 2 k z s z 2 d v according to eq 4 the temporal variation of salinity variance i e the term in the left hand side lhs depends on the salinity variance fluxes at the open boundaries the first three terms in the rhs and salinity variance dissipation due to physical mixing inside the volume the last term in the rhs in previous studies li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 the second and third terms in the rhs of eq 4 a k a the flux terms those are related to the horizontal diffusion precipitation and evaporation were not taken into account in the present study to make the offline diagnostic method practical for more general cases we remain all of the terms in eq 4 for further calculations 2 2 diagnosing numerical mixing when spatial discretization is applied in numerical models eq 4 is not conserved due to the generation of spurious numerical mixing burchard and rennau 2008 thus the residual of the salinity variance budget in eq 4 is expected to be computed with the discrete model output data to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing in a domain with volume v the domain volume v can be as small as one discrete water column of the original model grid for the water column with the horizontal coordinate i j the volume depth averaged numerical mixing can be estimated as 5 n m i j t v i j a f i j d f i j p e f i j p m i j the summation of nm i j numerical mixing and pm i j physical mixing is defined as tm i j total mixing in the present study the detailed description for offline calculations through applying eq 5 in the regional oceanic modelling system roms www myroms org model output data are shown in the appendix in a closed domain salinity variance dissipation mixing is the only sink for the entire volume averaged salinity variance so the magnitude of total mixing can be quantified through the time change rate of the entire volume averaged salinity variance as discussed in james 1996 in an open domain salinity variance fluxes at open boundaries also play significant roles through calculating the salinity variance fluxes at open boundaries the variance balance equation eq 5 is expected to be applied for the estimation of numerical mixing in the sub volumes furthermore eq 2 has the theoretical possibility to diagnose numerical mixing for the sub volumes that do not integrate over the entire water column but vertically resolve the water column in the present study we only discuss the application of eq 5 for the vertical average over the entire water column because it is more convenient and easier to be achieved based on the model output data the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing is meaningful and burchard and rennau 2008 also recommended to apply spatial and temporal averaging to the numerical tracer variance dissipation to obtain information on numerical mixing when the time interval of model output is longer than the model online calculation time step the estimated time averaged variance fluxes and explicit physical mixing based on the model output data are not as accurate as those quantified with the model online calculation time step in the present study to examine the influence of model output frequency on the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 is also applied to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing which is defined as nmbr on through deriving the tracer variance dissipation induced by advective discretization schemes burchard and rennau 2008 proposed that numerical mixing could be estimated by the difference between the advected square of the salinity a s 2 and the square of the advected salinity a s 2 divided by the time step 6 n m o n b r a s 2 a s 2 δ t where a is the advection operator and δ t is the model time step the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 has been coded into the online calculations of the roms model although the offline and online methods both refer to the numerically induced tracer variance dissipation as numerical mixing there is difference between the calculation methods burchard and rennau 2008 estimated numerical mixing through calculating the difference between the advected square of the tracer and the square of the advected tracer while the offline method in the present study estimates numerical mixing through calculating the residual of the tracer variance equation budget see eq 5 3 results 3 1 lock exchange model in this section several numerical simulations based on a lock exchange model are conducted to compare the offline method with the online method and study the influence of model output frequency on the accuracy of the numerical mixing estimated by the offline method the lock exchange model is two dimensional with horizontal dimension 0 x 64 km and vertical dimension 20 m z 0 temperature remains as a constant at 10 c throughout the entire domain and there is no source or sink of salinity and temperature at the boundaries the explicit background vertical viscosity is set to 5 10 4 m2 s 1 in all of the simulations initial conditions are the same at the initial stage the dense water with salinity of 30 g kg on the left is separated with the fresh water on the right fig 1 a the model calculation time step in all of the lock exchange simulation is set to be 1 s 3 1 1 relationship between numerical mixing and salinity variance dissipation to demonstrate that the salinity variance dissipation rate is an appropriate quantity to represent the magnitude of numerical mixing two sets of model experiments with different grid resolutions are conducted in both sets of the experiments the explicit background including vertical and horizontal diffusivities are set to 0 and no turbulence closure scheme is applied so explicit physical mixing of salinity is absent mpdata advection scheme based on the sign preserving properties of upstream differencing is employed smolarkiewicz and margolin 1998 therefore in these experiments when the integrated volume is chosen as the entire model domain the numerical mixing induced by the discrete mpdata advection scheme is the only sink for salinity variance the first set of model experiments are with a fixed horizontal grid resolution of δx 500 m and various vertical grid resolutions of δz 10 m 5 m 2 m and 1 m respectively the second set of experiments are with the fixed vertical grid resolution of δz 1 m and various horizontal grid resolutions of δx 4 km 2 km 1 km and 500 m respectively the time interval of instantaneous model output for offline calculation is set as 2 min which is much longer than the model online calculation time step 1 s the entire model domain is chosen for the volume analysis so the initial salinity variance s 2 is 225 g kg 2 throughout the model domain fig 1b in all cases fig 2 shows the snapshots of salinity and salinity variance at time t 7 h from the first set of experiments because there is no explicit physical mixing of salinity the system is supposed to be adiabatic without dilution however due to the existence of spurious numerical mixing apparent salinity dilution occurs after the initial time step as shown in fig 2 due to the horizontal density gradient gravity current circulations and two heading fronts are generated fig 2 and the velocities of the gravity currents are proportional to the horizontal density gradients at the heading fronts in the experiments with coarser grid spacing more dilution is induced by spurious numerical mixing to decrease the horizontal density gradients at the heading fronts as a result the speeds of the gravity currents are more slowly in the experiment with coarser resolutions than that with finer resolutions therefore as the spatial resolution increases the heading fronts propagate more rapidly fig 2 the second set of experiments with fixed vertical grid resolution and various horizontal resolutions show similar results not shown for brevity in the regions where salinity is diluted the magnitude of salinity variance s 2 becomes smaller fig 2 comparing with the initial condition s 2 225 g kg 2 fig 1 which implies that the volume averaged salinity variance decreases fig 3 according to eq 4 and eq 5 when explicit physical mixing is absent in a closed system the temporal change rate of volume averaged salinity variance only depends on the magnitude of numerical mixing as shown in fig 3 the volume averaged salinity variance decreases more slowly in the cases with finer horizontal or vertical model resolutions indicating that the magnitude of numerical mixing decreases as the model spatial resolution becomes finer when model resolution becomes fine enough the impact of the spatial resolution on the magnitude of numerical mixing is less significant for instance numerical mixing in the experiments with horizontal resolutions of δx 1 km and δx 500 m are comparable fig 3b 3 1 2 comparisons between the offline and online methods in open domains in a closed system numerical mixing is only related to the time change rate of the volume averaged salinity variance in an open system the fluxes of salinity variance at open boundaries should also be taken into account as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 to examine the offline method for numerical mixing estimation in open domains we apply eq 5 to the case with the resolution of δx 500 m δz 1 m and estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing nm off in each discrete water column of the model grid for comparison the method eq 6 proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 is also applied online to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing nmbr on to examine the feasibility of the offline method when there is explicit physical mixing another experiment with the resolution of δx 500 m δz 1 m and explicit vertical and horizontal diffusivities of k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 is conducted the temporally and column depth averaged results between time t 6 h and t 8 h under the conditions without and with explicit physical mixing are shown in fig 4 under the condition without explicit physical mixing the magnitude of numerical mixing is equal to total mixing fig 4b and c it reaches its peaks at the fronts possibly owing to the strong horizontal salinity gradient as discussed in smolarkiewicz 1983 when the first order upwind advection scheme is applied in a one dimensional advective flow 7 s t u s x 0 the magnitude of numerical mixing is 8 u δ x u 2 δ t s x 2 u δ x 1 u δ t δ x s x 2 where δx and δt indicate the model horizontal resolution and model online calculation time step respectively smolarkiewicz 1983 because the courant number u δ t δ x is smaller than 1 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to horizontal salinity gradient to evaluate the effects of the horizontal discretization on the magnitude of numerical mixing we also applied eq 8 estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing based on the model output data between time t 6 h and t 8 h the estimated volume and temporally averaged numerical mixing at fronts based on eq 8 was about 6 10 3 g kg 2 s 2 and 3 10 3 g kg 2 s 2 in the experiments without and with explicit physical mixing respectively this is close to the results shown in fig 4c and f in addition to the horizontal advection vertical advection also possibly contributes to the generation of numerical mixing in the lock exchange simulations the vertical fluctuations of isohalines at the heading fronts as shown in fig 2d imply that strong vertical velocities occur at small scales so the vertical advection across the horizontal interface is another possible reason for the strong numerical mixing at the heading fronts compared with the experiment without physical mixing fig 4a more dilution occurs in the experiment with explicit physical mixing to result in weaker vertical salinity gradients at the horizontal interface and horizontal salinity gradients at the heading fronts fig 4d the magnitude of numerical mixing also reaches its peaks at the fronts fig 4f but it is smaller than half of the numerical mixing in the experiment without explicit physical mixing fig 4c the depression of numerical mixing under the condition with explicit physical mixing is possibly related to the diffusion at the heading fronts in the experiment with explicit physical mixing k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 the explicit physical mixing leads to salinity diffusion to decease horizontal salinity gradients at fronts fig 4d as shown in eq 8 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to the horizontal salinity gradient so the existence of explicit physical mixing depresses the magnitude of numerical mixing we also did another experiment with k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 0 not shown for brevity and in that experiment numerical mixing is slightly about 10 stronger than the case with k z 1 10 3 m2 s 1 and k h 10 m2 s 1 this implies that both of the explicit vertical and horizontal physical mixing contributes to the salinity diffusion and depressing the numerical mixing as shown in fig 4c and f when eq 5 is applied to every discrete water column in the lock exchange model domain the estimated numerical mixing is almost consistent with that estimated by the online method 3 1 3 the influence of model output frequency when model output time interval is longer than the model online calculation time step the temporally averaged fluxes at the open boundaries and explicit physical mixing are not exactly equal to those computed by model online calculations and this leads to errors in calculating the variance balance equation eq 5 based on the model output data to study the impact of the model output frequency on the accuracy of the offline method we did experiments with the same set ups as the experiments shown in fig 4 and outputted the model data with three different time intervals of 2 min 5 min and 10 min based on the model output data with the three different output time intervals the temporally and water column depth averaged numerical mixing between time t 6 h and t 8 h is estimated through the offline method fig 5 numerical mixing nmbr on estimated by the online method is used to examine the accuracy of the offline method as shown in fig 5 as the model output time interval increases the accuracy of the offline method decreases in both of the cases without and with explicit physical mixing when the model output time interval is smaller than 5 min the magnitude of numerical mixing estimated by the offline method is consistent with nmbr on this is because 5 min is close to the typical flow timescale of the gravity current the analytical flow speed of a gravity current in a two dimensional and two layer flow is given as 9 u f 1 2 g h δ ρ ρ 0 where h indicates the water depth which is 20 m in the lock exchange model and δρ indicates the density contrast across the vertical front benjamin 1968 according to the relationship between density and salinity ρ ρ 0 1 β s where β 7 7 10 4 the density contrast across the front is about 23 kg m 3 at the initial time of the lock exchange simulations thus the typical flow speed of the gravity current in the lock exchange experiment is about 1 1 m s 1 5 min is close to the typical time scale for the gravity current passes through a model grid cell δx 500 m so the magnitude of numerical mixing quantified with the model output data with time interval smaller than 5 min is close to nmbr on 3 2 byecs experiment in this section to examine the feasibility and accuracy of the offline method in a realistic three dimensional model the offline method is applied to estimate the magnitude of numerical mixing in a roms model based on realistic topography which covers the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea byecs to examine the offline method the magnitude of numerical mixing is also computed by the online method proposed by burchard and rennau 2008 nmbr on the fundamental model set up is the same as that used in bian et al 2013 the model domain 116oe 134oe 20on 42on shown in fig 6 has a 1 12 horizontal resolution and 20 vertical levels the time step used for the three dimensional baroclinic mode is 300 s while the two dimensional barotropic mode uses a smaller time step of 30 s the mellor and yamada closure scheme is applied to calculate vertical mixing and its feasibility has been demonstrated in the coastal and estuarine model studies warner et al 2005 chen et al 2014 the explicit horizontal diffusivity is set to 0 the tidal forcing includes eight principal tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 the monthly climatological forcing at the surface is derived from coads dasilva et al 1994 the model was initialized on january 1 2000 with the temperature and salinity from the world ocean atlas 2005 and run for 2 years as spin up the hourly instantaneous data during june of the third year were outputted for estimating the magnitude of numerical mixing by the offline method to compare the magnitudes of numerical mixing induced by different advection schemes mpdata and u3h advection schemes are applied respectively as shown in fig 6 the extensions of the changjiang river plume during june are similar in both model results when the two different advection schemes are applied and they are both roughly consistent with the editorial board for marine atlas 1992 the numerical mixing of salinity mainly occurs inside the region of the changjiang river plume fig 6b and d so the plume region bounded with black dashed lines in fig 6 is further analyzed to examine the offline diagnostic method and study the spatial and temporal variations of numerical and explicit physical mixing in the byecs model there is surface freshwater forcing thus the influences of evaporation and precipitation are also taken into account in the calculations with the salinity variance balance equation eq 5 3 2 1 spring neap variations of the numerical and explicit physical mixing to study the spring neap variability we apply eq 5 to the hourly model output to obtain the volume and tidally averaged numerical and explicit physical mixing in the region bounded with black dashed lines in fig 6 for comparison numerical mixing is also estimated through the online method nmbr on the magnitudes of numerical mixing are in the same order as the explicit physical mixing in both experiments with different advection scheme fig 7 b and d it implies that the well simulated salinity distributions shown in fig 6a and c are under the influences of both numerical and explicit physical mixing as shown in fig 7 nm off and nmbr on are close to each other both of which are enhanced during spring tides and suppressed during neap tides the spring neap variation of numerical mixing is possibly related to the variation of tidal velocity in the byecs model the model time step and horizontal resolution are δt 300 s and δx 8000 m respectively according to eq 8 when the horizontal velocity is smaller than 13 m s 1 the magnitude of numerical mixing is proportional to the magnitude of horizontal velocity as shown in fig 7 the velocity is stronger during spring tides than neap tides and smaller than 1 m s 1 thus the spring neap variability of numerical mixing is modulated by the magnitude of tidal velocity which is larger during spring than neap tides when two different advection schemes mpdata and u3h are applied the magnitudes of numerical mixing are comparable the explicit physical mixing is much stronger in the mpdata experiment although the turbulence closure schemes applied in these two experiments are the same this is because advection scheme influences the salinity transport and vertical salinity gradient the magnitude of explicit physical mixing is proportional to the vertical salinity gradient so the magnitudes of explicit physical mixing are different in these two experiments 3 2 2 horizontal distributions of the numerical and explicit physical mixing in addition to the temporal variation the spatial distributions of spring neap and depth averaged explicit physical and numerical mixing are also studied in the river plume region through applying eq 5 to every discrete water column of the original model grid as shown in fig 8 the patterns of nm off are roughly consistent with nmbr on thus the offline method is appropriate to diagnose the spatial distribution of numerical mixing in this case numerical mixing is mainly enhanced near the coast while explicit physical mixing is mainly enhanced a little far away from the coast as shown in fig 9 the regions with enhanced physical mixing are almost consistent with the regions with strong vertical salinity gradient fig 9a and c while numerical mixing is enhanced in the regions with strong lateral salinity gradients fig 9b and d the association of numerical mixing with strong horizontal salinity gradients in the simulation is consistent with the results in ralston et al 2017 in the mpdata experiment explicit physical mixing is slightly stronger than that in the u3h experiment especially near the minzhe coast fig 8a and e this is because more fresh water from changjiang is transported to the minzhe coast when mpdata advection scheme is applied which leads to stronger vertical salinity gradients in this region for mixing fig 9a and c therefore as shown in figs 8 and 9 the distributions of explicit physical and numerical mixing depend on the vertical and horizontal salinity gradients respectively 4 discussion and conclusions being similar to the results of the present study the magnitude of numerical mixing is comparable to explicit physical mixing in many numerical model simulations e g rennau and burchard 2009 ralston et al 2017 so the effects of numerical mixing can not be neglected the offline method described in the present study provides an alternative way for the downstream investigators to assess numerical numerical without re running the models the offline method is based on calculating the residual of the tracer variance balance equation in a closed domain the variance dissipation mixing is the only sink term for the volume averaged tracer variance so the magnitude of total mixing can be estimated through the time change rate of the volume averaged salinity variance in an open domain the tracer variance fluxes at open boundaries also play important roles through computing the tracer variance fluxes at open boundaries the tracer variance balance equation can be applied for the assessment of numerical mixing in sub volumes our model simulations show that the accuracy of the offline method is affected by model output frequency however when the model output data capture the typical flow timescales it is demonstrated to be appropriate to apply the offline method to estimate the volume or depth and temporally averaged numerical mixing for instance it is appropriate to apply the offline method to estimate the tidally averaged numerical mixing based on the hourly coastal and estuarine model output data because they capture the typical tidal timescales e g li et al 2018 maccready et al 2018 wang and geyer 2018 the tracer variance equation is theoretically robust for any conservative tracers so the offline method is expected to be applied in other numerical models beyond roms nevertheless the estimation of fluxes at the open boundaries should be handled carefully especially in the unstructured grid models and its influence on the accuracy of the offline method needs further studies in future based on the offline method the temporal and spatial variations of numerical and explicit physical mixing in the lock exchange and byecs simulations is studied in both of the lock exchange and byecs models the spatial distributions of numerical and explicit physical mixing of salinity are proportional to the horizontal and vertical salinity gradients respectively in the lock exchange simulations because explicit physical mixing reduces the horizontal tracer gradients at the heading fronts the magnitude of numerical mixing is smaller in the case with explicit physical mixing than that without explicit physical mixing in the byecs simulations the magnitude of numerical mixing inside the changjiang river plume is stronger during spring tides than neap tides due to stronger tidal velocities during spring tides credit authorship contribution statement tao wang conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing zexun wei methodology reviewing and editing wensheng jiang

21051,in the present paper hydrodynamic behavior and bottom wetted surfaces of two stepped planing hull are investigated by conducting towing tank tests to this accomplishment hydrodynamic resistance reattachment length trim angle and bottom wetted surfaces are determined under different geometric variables of the two transverse steps and planing hull speeds qualitative investigation is also conducted on the forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces based on the obtained experimental data lower hydrodynamic resistance is achieved by decreasing the aft step height at fr 2 12 while greater aft step height is resulted to lower total resistance under fr 2 12 reattachment length after the aft step is increased by an enhancement in aft step height and the longitudinal position of the aft step from transom moreover aftbody wetted area after the aft step and total wetted areas are decreased by increasing the aft step height and decreasing the position of the aft step from transom also an algorithm is suggested to calculate the forebody and aftbody wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls keywords experimental investigation two stepped planing hull wetted surface hydrodynamic characteristics 1 introduction high lift to drag ratio and more longitudinally stability are the results of using transverse steps at the bottom of high speed planing hulls doctors 1985 savitsky and morabito 2010 performance of stepped planing hulls is directly related to their bottom wetted surfaces which are dependent on the location of the steps the height of the step number of steps froude number etc najafi et al 2020 so deep knowledge of the bottom wetted surfaces of the stepped planing hulls plays an impressive role in improving the hydrodynamical performance of these vessels up to now different towing tanks tests doctors 1985 savitsky and morabito 2010 najafi et al 2018 2019 2020 clement and pope 1961 gassman and kartinen 1994 white and beaver 2010 taunton et al 2010 2011 lee et al 2014 seo et al 2016 de marco et al 2017 cucinotta et al 2017 najafi et al 2019a b numerical investigations najafi et al 2019a b lotfi et al 2015 kazemi et al 2019 najafi and nowruzi 2019 and mathematical studies svahn 2009 loni et al 2013 are conducted on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the stepped planing hulls for example in 1961 clement and pope clement and pope 1961 presented some graphs of resistance and trim angle of stepless and stepped prismatic planing hulls by using empirical formulas after that in 1994 gassman and kartinen gassman and kartinen 1994 experimentally investigated the effects of the step location and the longitudinal center of gravity location on the performance of stepped planing hulls after the investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of the one step planing hulls by scholars in 2010 savitsky and morabito savitsky and morabito 2010 experimentally investigated the bottom wetted surface of simple prismatic one step planing hull in the same year and to produce a database for hydrodynamics of one step and two steps planing hulls white and beaver white and beaver 2010 conducted a series of towing tests on the one step and two steps planing hulls at one hull velocity and trim angle they indicated the lower resistance of stepped planing hulls compared to traditional hulls some experimental tests on two stepped planing hull are also conducted at calm water and in waves by taunton et al 2010 and taunton et al 2011 respectively they showed lower resistance of stepped hulls compared to stepless hull also they showed insignificant effects of the steps on the dynamic trim angle for generating more detail on the resistance of two steps planing hulls in 2014 le et al lee et al 2014 performed a series of towing tests to investigate the effect of step height and its position on the total resistance of two stepped planing hulls they found the minimum resistance for the smallest step height forward and the largest step height aft hydrodynamic resistance and sea keeping ability of a planing vessel using wave piercing and spray rails are experimentally studied by seo et al 2016 during these years in addition to experimental research in the context of the stepped planing hulls numerical studies have been conducted in 2017 cfd analysis and experimental investigation on the flow pattern and hydrodynamic behavior of one step planing craft are performed by de marco et al de marco et al 2017 cucinotta et al 2017 performed some experimental tests to show the positive impression of artificial air cavity on resistance reduction of planing hulls recently in 2019 hydrodynamic characteristics and bottom wetted area of one step planing hull is experimentally studied by najafi et al 2019a b based on the literature review the focus of experimental and numerical studies has been on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the stepped planing hulls such as their resistance sinkage and trim angles moreover only a little research can be found on the bottom wetted areas of the stepped planing hulls which are also for one stepped planing hulls savitsky and morabito 2010 najafi et al 2019a b therefore the lack of investigation on the detail of bottom wetted areas of the two stepped planing hulls at various geometric characteristics of the step is evident so in the present study and continues of our previous experimental work in ref najafi et al 2019a b i e on one step planing hull the major objective is to investigate the hydrodynamic parameters and bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls at different geometrical characteristics of the steps firstly the results of total resistance of two stepped fridsma planning hulls are given then reattachment lengths of separated flow and wetted areas are presented under different deadrise angles aft step heights longitudinal position of the aft step from transoms and froude numbers the remainder of the current paper is structured as follows experimental setup of two stepped planing hulls is given in section 2 results of hydrodynamic parameters and bottom wetted areas are presented and discussed in section 3 section 4 is also given for conclusions 2 experimental setup in the present work the same as our previous study in ref najafi et al 2019a b all towing tests are conducted based on the ittc guidelines 25th ittc 2008 ittc recommended procedures and guidelines testing and extrapolation methods high speed marine vehicles 2008 in the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran length width water depth maximum carriage speed and maximum capacity of the force gauge of nimala towing tank are 392 m 6 m 4 m 19 m s and 600 n respectively calm water with ambient temperature 293 15 k density of 1002 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity 1 19e 6 m2 s we considered dynamic and geometric similarities criteria to select the dimensions of fridsma planing hulls to select the dimensions of hull model maximum froude number and blockage factor are intended to this accomplishment froude number is utilized in dynamic similarity as follows 1 f r m f r s v m 2 m 1 3 v s 2 s 1 3 s m λ 3 1 3 v s v m 2 v m 1 λ v s

where the geometrical scale factor is λ 8 per the sectional area of towing tank is achieved 0 0065 which is significantly lower than 0 1 therefore the impression of towing tank walls on the model is insignificant according to these criteria the main geometrical characteristics of full scale and model of stepless hulls and considered two stepped planning crafts are tabulated in table 1 in table 1 the height of the forward step i e hs1 is measured from the keel while the height of the aft step i e hs2 is measured from the forward step as stated in our previous study najafi et al 2019a b for facility in construction of models with different step heights at various longitudinal distances of step from transom hulls model are fabricated by connecting three separate parts i e forebody module aftbody module and connecting block please see fig 1 details about the material and fabrication error of these parts are available in ref najafi et al 2019a b schematic of considered fridsma models and two different positions of the forward step and aft step are illustrated in fig 2 experimental results of one step planing hulls under different physical and geometrical conditions may be found in our previous study in ref najafi et al 2019a b and in continues the lab test results of two stepped planing hulls are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance measured experimental results of the non dimensional form of total resistance rt δ are presented in table 2 fig 3 shows the diagram of total resistance under different deadrise angles aft step heights and longitudinal positions of the aft step from transom based on table 2 and fig 3 the total resistance is increased by enhancing the hull velocity displacement phase transition phase semi planing and planing phase are three conventional phases in motion of the planing hulls during the lab test and according to the trend of increasing the resistance by an increase in the fr number these three phases can be separated from each other for the considered stepped planing hulls see ref marshall 2002 for details for fr 2 12 tested stepped hulls have the displacement phase while for 2 12 fr 4 24 speed of stepped hulls within the hump region which is known as semi planing condition once fr exceeds 4 24 stepped hulls shift to the planing phase moreover increasing the aft step height cause greater total resistance at fr 2 12 while for fr 2 12 the lower total resistance is achieved for greater aft step height moreover the variation of the longitudinal position of the aft step from transom has an irregular effect on the total resistance as we expected from our previous experimental works in ref najafi et al 2019 2020 the total resistance is increased by enhancing the deadrise angle especially from β 20 to β 30 in the case of the lower aft step height and smaller longitudinal position of the aft step from transom proposing phenomenon at fr 6 36 is delayed i e more longitudinally stability is obtained especially at the β 15 3 2 reattachment length trim angle and wetted areas fig 4 shows the schematic of bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hull along with defined parameters according to fig 4 ls1 and ls2 are the longitudinal distance of the forward step and aft step from transom the parameter of lk and lc are lengths of forebody wetted keel and wetted chine respectively centerline reattachment length of the separated flow from the forward step and aft step are shown by xcl 1 and xcl 2 respectively moreover x1 4 1 and x1 4 2 are in respective the reattachment length of separated flow from forward step and aft step on the line of ¼ hull beam forebody wetted area is shown by s w f o r e while aftbody wetted areas after the forward step and aft step are presented by s w a f t 1 and s w a f t 2 respectively it s notable that the pattern of three triangular shape regions of the wetted areas is dependent on the height of the steps step distance from transom hull deadrise angle velocity and etc in this section the bottom wetted areas are calculated via analysis of the lab tests underwater images i e camera resolution was 720 1280 with frame rate of 30 fps using solidworks package total trim angle τ t t a and non dimensional measured lengths of forebody wetted keel l k 1 3 wetted chine l c 1 3 forward step x c l 1 1 3 and aft step x c l 2 1 3 reattachment lengths are tabulated in table 3 based on table 3 total trim angle is increased by an enhancement in the height of the step while total trim angle is decreased by increasing the longitudinal position of aft step from transom also total trim angle is increased by increasing the deadrise angle moreover experimental results of non dimensional forebody wetted areas s w f o r e 2 3 forward step wetted areas s w a f t 1 2 3 aft step wetted areas s w a f t 2 2 3 and total wetted areas s w t o t a l 2 3 are presented in table 4 despite total resistance which is reported for all hull velocity reattachment lengths and wetted areas are only measured for v 4 m s which is corresponding to the planing condition to better comparison between the test cases experimental results of forebody wetted keel wetted chine and forward step and aft step reattachment lengths are presented in fig 5 moreover fig 6 shows the forebody wetted areas forward step wetted areas and aft step wetted areas at different test cases as may be seen in table 3 and fig 5 l k 1 3 is decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity and deadrise angle while the variation of longitudinal position of the aft step from transom ls2 and heights of aft step hs2 has an insignificant effect on the l k 1 3 significantly decrease in l c 1 3 is detected by increasing the hull velocity however we didn t find any regular trend variation on l c 1 3 by changing the value of ls2 hs2 and β parameter of x c l 1 1 3 is decreased by reducing the hull velocity and increasing the hs2 it s also notable that for test cases 4 to 11 separated flow from forebody is fully passed the forward step also parameter of x c l 2 1 3 is increased by an enhancement in hull velocity hs2 ls2 however the variation of β has an irregular effect on the value of x c l 2 1 3 based on table 4 and fig 6 by increasing the hull velocity forebody wetted area s w f o r e 2 3 is decreased there is no regular trend between the variation of ls2 and hs2 with the value of forward step wetted areas s w f o r e 2 3 moreover the value of s w a f t 1 2 3 is only affected i e decreased by increasing the hull velocity aft step wetted areas s w a f t 2 2 3 and total wetted areas s w t o t a l 2 3 are decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity increasing the heights of aft step and decreasing the aft step from transom cause to reduce s w a f t 2 2 3 and s w t o t a l 2 3 moreover deadrise angle has an irregular effect on the value of s w a f t 2 2 3 and s w t o t a l 2 3 3 3 morphology and formulation of wetted surfaces fig 7 shows underwater images of forebody and aftbody wetted areas on the bottom of two stepped planing hulls at different step heights i e cases a b and c and cases d e and f various longitudinal positions of the aft step from transom i e cases a d cases b e and cases c f under two different fr as may be seen in fig 7 in cases a b and c three wetted areas i e forebody wetted area and aftbody wetted areas after the forward step and aft step are visible however in other cases i e d e and f due to the complete passage of separated flow from the forward step only two wetted surfaces at the forebody and at the aftbody after the aft step is detectable moreover spray sheets at the forebody and on lateral sides of the aftbody is also visible now based on the obtained experimental data we formulate the bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls i e by formulating the equivalent height of the step for one step planing hulls based on the study of savitsky and morabito savitsky and morabito 2010 to this accomplishment two stepped planing hull is considered as two one step planing hulls and we found the equivalent height for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 the formulation of the equivalent height is the exponential relation between six parameters of the deadrise angle β hull velocity v total trim angle τ length between the two steps i e l ls1 ls2 forward step height hs1 and aft step height hs2 as follows 2 h e q h s 1 a h s 2 b v c β d l e τ f based on the obtained experimental data and by placing them in eq 2 we have system of equations for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 for example see the system of equations in form of matrixes for h e q 1 in eq 3 3 2 3 2 99 2 07 3 4 5 99 1 5 2 3 2 99 2 3 3 4 5 99 1 44 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 99 2 3 2 99 2 3

o n r e f 2 by solving the system of equations equivalent height for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 are calculated as follows 4 h e q 1 h s 1 1 1071 h s 2 0 6279 v 0 1328 β 0 5129 l 0 2078 τ 1 7096 5 h e q 2 h s 1 0 2476 h s 2 1 5062 v 0 1698 β 0 2863 l 0 2078 τ 0 8491 now based on these equivalent heights an algorithm is suggested in fig 8 to evaluate the wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls as may be seen in fig 8 in the last step and according to the calculated parameters wetted areas can be calculated via formulations which are presented in appendix 2 under different geometrical form of the wetted areas to ensure the accuracy and performance of the suggested algorithm all obtained lab data and two new experimental tests are evaluated with the output of the suggested algorithm for this purpose the output of reattachment lengths from suggested algorithm compared to experiment is shown in table 5 moreover output of forward and aft steps wetted area from the suggested algorithm compared to experiment are presented in table 6 based on tables 5 and 6 an acceptable accordance is achieved between the results of suggested algorithm compared to experimental data 4 conclusion appropriate knowledge of hydrodynamic characteristics of two stepped planing hull is necessary to improve the design of these vessels for this purpose in the current paper total resistance trim angle reattachment length of the separated flow and wetted surfaces of two stepped planing crafts are investigated at three different aft step heights two positions of the aft step from transom three deadrise angles and various hull velocities among the most important experimental findings in this paper are the following 1 at fr 2 12 i e stepped hulls are in the displacement phase the higher total resistance is achieved by an enhancement of the aft step height however at fr 2 12 i e for 2 12 fr 4 24 the stepped hulls are in the semi planing condition lower total resistance is obtained by increasing the aft step height based on the lab tests it is found that proposing phenomenon at fr 6 36 especially at the β 15 is delayed in the test cases corresponding to lower aft step height and smaller longitudinal position of the aft step from transom however more experimental tests are needed to generalize this claim 2 length of forebody wetted keel is increased by decreasing the hull velocity and deadrise angle therefore it should be concluded that by increasing the fr the length of forebody wetted keel is decreased to the point that after fr 4 24 two stepped hulls are shifted to the planing phase the length of the wetted chine is enhanced by decreasing the hull velocity moreover changing the value of ls2 and hs2 haven t any regular effect on lengths of forebody wetted keel and wetted chine 3 based on the obtained experimental results total trim angle is increased by an enhancement in the height of the step and deadrise angle however lower total trim angle is achieved at greater longitudinal position of aft step from transom 4 reattachment length after the forward step is increased by enhancing the hull velocity and decreasing the hs2 also reattachment length after the aft step is increased by an enhancement in hull velocity hs2 and ls2 5 forebody wetted area is decreased by increasing the hull velocity effect of the variation of ls2 and hs2 on the value of forward step wetted areas is irregular aft step and total wetted areas are increased by reducing the hull velocity increasing the heights of aft step hs2 and decreasing the aft step from transom ls2 hull cause to diminish of aft step and total wetted areas finally based on the obtained experimental data we formulated the equivalent step height of the forward and aft steps then an algorithm is suggested to determine the forebody and aftbody wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls the current study merits future investigations study on the wetted surfaces of multi steps i e more than two steps planing crafts at various geometrical parameters of the steps can be considered as future works credit authorship contribution statement amin najafi and hashem

21051,in the present paper hydrodynamic behavior and bottom wetted surfaces of two stepped planing hull are investigated by conducting towing tank tests to this accomplishment hydrodynamic resistance reattachment length trim angle and bottom wetted surfaces are determined under different geometric variables of the two transverse steps and planing hull speeds qualitative investigation is also conducted on the forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces based on the obtained experimental data lower hydrodynamic resistance is achieved by decreasing the aft step height at fr 2 12 while greater aft step height is resulted to lower total resistance under fr 2 12 reattachment length after the aft step is increased by an enhancement in aft step height and the longitudinal position of the aft step from transom moreover aftbody wetted area after the aft step and total wetted areas are decreased by increasing the aft step height and decreasing the position of the aft step from transom also an algorithm is suggested to calculate the forebody and aftbody wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls keywords experimental investigation two stepped planing hull wetted surface hydrodynamic characteristics 1 introduction high lift to drag ratio and more longitudinally stability are the results of using transverse steps at the bottom of high speed planing hulls doctors 1985 savitsky and morabito 2010 performance of stepped planing hulls is directly related to their bottom wetted surfaces which are dependent on the location of the steps the height of the step number of steps froude number etc najafi et al 2020 so deep knowledge of the bottom wetted surfaces of the stepped planing hulls plays an impressive role in improving the hydrodynamical performance of these vessels up to now different towing tanks tests doctors 1985 savitsky and morabito 2010 najafi et al 2018 2019 2020 clement and pope 1961 gassman and kartinen 1994 white and beaver 2010 taunton et al 2010 2011 lee et al 2014 seo et al 2016 de marco et al 2017 cucinotta et al 2017 najafi et al 2019a b numerical investigations najafi et al 2019a b lotfi et al 2015 kazemi et al 2019 najafi and nowruzi 2019 and mathematical studies svahn 2009 loni et al 2013 are conducted on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the stepped planing hulls for example in 1961 clement and pope clement and pope 1961 presented some graphs of resistance and trim angle of stepless and stepped prismatic planing hulls by using empirical formulas after that in 1994 gassman and kartinen gassman and kartinen 1994 experimentally investigated the effects of the step location and the longitudinal center of gravity location on the performance of stepped planing hulls after the investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of the one step planing hulls by scholars in 2010 savitsky and morabito savitsky and morabito 2010 experimentally investigated the bottom wetted surface of simple prismatic one step planing hull in the same year and to produce a database for hydrodynamics of one step and two steps planing hulls white and beaver white and beaver 2010 conducted a series of towing tests on the one step and two steps planing hulls at one hull velocity and trim angle they indicated the lower resistance of stepped planing hulls compared to traditional hulls some experimental tests on two stepped planing hull are also conducted at calm water and in waves by taunton et al 2010 and taunton et al 2011 respectively they showed lower resistance of stepped hulls compared to stepless hull also they showed insignificant effects of the steps on the dynamic trim angle for generating more detail on the resistance of two steps planing hulls in 2014 le et al lee et al 2014 performed a series of towing tests to investigate the effect of step height and its position on the total resistance of two stepped planing hulls they found the minimum resistance for the smallest step height forward and the largest step height aft hydrodynamic resistance and sea keeping ability of a planing vessel using wave piercing and spray rails are experimentally studied by seo et al 2016 during these years in addition to experimental research in the context of the stepped planing hulls numerical studies have been conducted in 2017 cfd analysis and experimental investigation on the flow pattern and hydrodynamic behavior of one step planing craft are performed by de marco et al de marco et al 2017 cucinotta et al 2017 performed some experimental tests to show the positive impression of artificial air cavity on resistance reduction of planing hulls recently in 2019 hydrodynamic characteristics and bottom wetted area of one step planing hull is experimentally studied by najafi et al 2019a b based on the literature review the focus of experimental and numerical studies has been on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the stepped planing hulls such as their resistance sinkage and trim angles moreover only a little research can be found on the bottom wetted areas of the stepped planing hulls which are also for one stepped planing hulls savitsky and morabito 2010 najafi et al 2019a b therefore the lack of investigation on the detail of bottom wetted areas of the two stepped planing hulls at various geometric characteristics of the step is evident so in the present study and continues of our previous experimental work in ref najafi et al 2019a b i e on one step planing hull the major objective is to investigate the hydrodynamic parameters and bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls at different geometrical characteristics of the steps firstly the results of total resistance of two stepped fridsma planning hulls are given then reattachment lengths of separated flow and wetted areas are presented under different deadrise angles aft step heights longitudinal position of the aft step from transoms and froude numbers the remainder of the current paper is structured as follows experimental setup of two stepped planing hulls is given in section 2 results of hydrodynamic parameters and bottom wetted areas are presented and discussed in section 3 section 4 is also given for conclusions 2 experimental setup in the present work the same as our previous study in ref najafi et al 2019a b all towing tests are conducted based on the ittc guidelines 25th ittc 2008 ittc recommended procedures and guidelines testing and extrapolation methods high speed marine vehicles 2008 in the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran length width water depth maximum carriage speed and maximum capacity of the force gauge of nimala towing tank are 392 m 6 m 4 m 19 m s and 600 n respectively calm water with ambient temperature 293 15 k density of 1002 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity 1 19e 6 m2 s we considered dynamic and geometric similarities criteria to select the dimensions of fridsma planing hulls to select the dimensions of hull model maximum froude number and blockage factor are intended to this accomplishment froude number is utilized in dynamic similarity as follows 1 f r m f r s v m 2 m 1 3 v s 2 s 1 3 s m λ 3 1 3 v s v m 2 v m 1 λ v s f o r minimum v e l o c i t y λ 8 v s 6 64 v m 2 35 f r b m 1 06 f o r maximum v e l o c i t y λ 8 v s 39 84 v m 14 09 f r b m 6 36 the blockage factor as the maximum cross sectional area of the model where the geometrical scale factor is λ 8 per the sectional area of towing tank is achieved 0 0065 which is significantly lower than 0 1 therefore the impression of towing tank walls on the model is insignificant according to these criteria the main geometrical characteristics of full scale and model of stepless hulls and considered two stepped planning crafts are tabulated in table 1 in table 1 the height of the forward step i e hs1 is measured from the keel while the height of the aft step i e hs2 is measured from the forward step as stated in our previous study najafi et al 2019a b for facility in construction of models with different step heights at various longitudinal distances of step from transom hulls model are fabricated by connecting three separate parts i e forebody module aftbody module and connecting block please see fig 1 details about the material and fabrication error of these parts are available in ref najafi et al 2019a b schematic of considered fridsma models and two different positions of the forward step and aft step are illustrated in fig 2 experimental results of one step planing hulls under different physical and geometrical conditions may be found in our previous study in ref najafi et al 2019a b and in continues the lab test results of two stepped planing hulls are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance measured experimental results of the non dimensional form of total resistance rt δ are presented in table 2 fig 3 shows the diagram of total resistance under different deadrise angles aft step heights and longitudinal positions of the aft step from transom based on table 2 and fig 3 the total resistance is increased by enhancing the hull velocity displacement phase transition phase semi planing and planing phase are three conventional phases in motion of the planing hulls during the lab test and according to the trend of increasing the resistance by an increase in the fr number these three phases can be separated from each other for the considered stepped planing hulls see ref marshall 2002 for details for fr 2 12 tested stepped hulls have the displacement phase while for 2 12 fr 4 24 speed of stepped hulls within the hump region which is known as semi planing condition once fr exceeds 4 24 stepped hulls shift to the planing phase moreover increasing the aft step height cause greater total resistance at fr 2 12 while for fr 2 12 the lower total resistance is achieved for greater aft step height moreover the variation of the longitudinal position of the aft step from transom has an irregular effect on the total resistance as we expected from our previous experimental works in ref najafi et al 2019 2020 the total resistance is increased by enhancing the deadrise angle especially from β 20 to β 30 in the case of the lower aft step height and smaller longitudinal position of the aft step from transom proposing phenomenon at fr 6 36 is delayed i e more longitudinally stability is obtained especially at the β 15 3 2 reattachment length trim angle and wetted areas fig 4 shows the schematic of bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hull along with defined parameters according to fig 4 ls1 and ls2 are the longitudinal distance of the forward step and aft step from transom the parameter of lk and lc are lengths of forebody wetted keel and wetted chine respectively centerline reattachment length of the separated flow from the forward step and aft step are shown by xcl 1 and xcl 2 respectively moreover x1 4 1 and x1 4 2 are in respective the reattachment length of separated flow from forward step and aft step on the line of ¼ hull beam forebody wetted area is shown by s w f o r e while aftbody wetted areas after the forward step and aft step are presented by s w a f t 1 and s w a f t 2 respectively it s notable that the pattern of three triangular shape regions of the wetted areas is dependent on the height of the steps step distance from transom hull deadrise angle velocity and etc in this section the bottom wetted areas are calculated via analysis of the lab tests underwater images i e camera resolution was 720 1280 with frame rate of 30 fps using solidworks package total trim angle τ t t a and non dimensional measured lengths of forebody wetted keel l k 1 3 wetted chine l c 1 3 forward step x c l 1 1 3 and aft step x c l 2 1 3 reattachment lengths are tabulated in table 3 based on table 3 total trim angle is increased by an enhancement in the height of the step while total trim angle is decreased by increasing the longitudinal position of aft step from transom also total trim angle is increased by increasing the deadrise angle moreover experimental results of non dimensional forebody wetted areas s w f o r e 2 3 forward step wetted areas s w a f t 1 2 3 aft step wetted areas s w a f t 2 2 3 and total wetted areas s w t o t a l 2 3 are presented in table 4 despite total resistance which is reported for all hull velocity reattachment lengths and wetted areas are only measured for v 4 m s which is corresponding to the planing condition to better comparison between the test cases experimental results of forebody wetted keel wetted chine and forward step and aft step reattachment lengths are presented in fig 5 moreover fig 6 shows the forebody wetted areas forward step wetted areas and aft step wetted areas at different test cases as may be seen in table 3 and fig 5 l k 1 3 is decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity and deadrise angle while the variation of longitudinal position of the aft step from transom ls2 and heights of aft step hs2 has an insignificant effect on the l k 1 3 significantly decrease in l c 1 3 is detected by increasing the hull velocity however we didn t find any regular trend variation on l c 1 3 by changing the value of ls2 hs2 and β parameter of x c l 1 1 3 is decreased by reducing the hull velocity and increasing the hs2 it s also notable that for test cases 4 to 11 separated flow from forebody is fully passed the forward step also parameter of x c l 2 1 3 is increased by an enhancement in hull velocity hs2 ls2 however the variation of β has an irregular effect on the value of x c l 2 1 3 based on table 4 and fig 6 by increasing the hull velocity forebody wetted area s w f o r e 2 3 is decreased there is no regular trend between the variation of ls2 and hs2 with the value of forward step wetted areas s w f o r e 2 3 moreover the value of s w a f t 1 2 3 is only affected i e decreased by increasing the hull velocity aft step wetted areas s w a f t 2 2 3 and total wetted areas s w t o t a l 2 3 are decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity increasing the heights of aft step and decreasing the aft step from transom cause to reduce s w a f t 2 2 3 and s w t o t a l 2 3 moreover deadrise angle has an irregular effect on the value of s w a f t 2 2 3 and s w t o t a l 2 3 3 3 morphology and formulation of wetted surfaces fig 7 shows underwater images of forebody and aftbody wetted areas on the bottom of two stepped planing hulls at different step heights i e cases a b and c and cases d e and f various longitudinal positions of the aft step from transom i e cases a d cases b e and cases c f under two different fr as may be seen in fig 7 in cases a b and c three wetted areas i e forebody wetted area and aftbody wetted areas after the forward step and aft step are visible however in other cases i e d e and f due to the complete passage of separated flow from the forward step only two wetted surfaces at the forebody and at the aftbody after the aft step is detectable moreover spray sheets at the forebody and on lateral sides of the aftbody is also visible now based on the obtained experimental data we formulate the bottom wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls i e by formulating the equivalent height of the step for one step planing hulls based on the study of savitsky and morabito savitsky and morabito 2010 to this accomplishment two stepped planing hull is considered as two one step planing hulls and we found the equivalent height for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 the formulation of the equivalent height is the exponential relation between six parameters of the deadrise angle β hull velocity v total trim angle τ length between the two steps i e l ls1 ls2 forward step height hs1 and aft step height hs2 as follows 2 h e q h s 1 a h s 2 b v c β d l e τ f based on the obtained experimental data and by placing them in eq 2 we have system of equations for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 for example see the system of equations in form of matrixes for h e q 1 in eq 3 3 2 3 2 99 2 07 3 4 5 99 1 5 2 3 2 99 2 3 3 4 5 99 1 44 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 99 2 3 2 99 2 3 2 99 2 48 2 07 2 3 2 07 3 4 2 7 2 7 2 99 5 99 5 99 5 99 6 21 1 1 1 37 1 04 1 46 k n o w n m a t r i x a b c d e f u n k n o w n m a t r i x 2 74 2 83 2 11 2 65 2 93 2 44 c a l c u l a t e d b a s e d o n r e f 2 by solving the system of equations equivalent height for forward step h e q 1 and aft step h e q 2 are calculated as follows 4 h e q 1 h s 1 1 1071 h s 2 0 6279 v 0 1328 β 0 5129 l 0 2078 τ 1 7096 5 h e q 2 h s 1 0 2476 h s 2 1 5062 v 0 1698 β 0 2863 l 0 2078 τ 0 8491 now based on these equivalent heights an algorithm is suggested in fig 8 to evaluate the wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls as may be seen in fig 8 in the last step and according to the calculated parameters wetted areas can be calculated via formulations which are presented in appendix 2 under different geometrical form of the wetted areas to ensure the accuracy and performance of the suggested algorithm all obtained lab data and two new experimental tests are evaluated with the output of the suggested algorithm for this purpose the output of reattachment lengths from suggested algorithm compared to experiment is shown in table 5 moreover output of forward and aft steps wetted area from the suggested algorithm compared to experiment are presented in table 6 based on tables 5 and 6 an acceptable accordance is achieved between the results of suggested algorithm compared to experimental data 4 conclusion appropriate knowledge of hydrodynamic characteristics of two stepped planing hull is necessary to improve the design of these vessels for this purpose in the current paper total resistance trim angle reattachment length of the separated flow and wetted surfaces of two stepped planing crafts are investigated at three different aft step heights two positions of the aft step from transom three deadrise angles and various hull velocities among the most important experimental findings in this paper are the following 1 at fr 2 12 i e stepped hulls are in the displacement phase the higher total resistance is achieved by an enhancement of the aft step height however at fr 2 12 i e for 2 12 fr 4 24 the stepped hulls are in the semi planing condition lower total resistance is obtained by increasing the aft step height based on the lab tests it is found that proposing phenomenon at fr 6 36 especially at the β 15 is delayed in the test cases corresponding to lower aft step height and smaller longitudinal position of the aft step from transom however more experimental tests are needed to generalize this claim 2 length of forebody wetted keel is increased by decreasing the hull velocity and deadrise angle therefore it should be concluded that by increasing the fr the length of forebody wetted keel is decreased to the point that after fr 4 24 two stepped hulls are shifted to the planing phase the length of the wetted chine is enhanced by decreasing the hull velocity moreover changing the value of ls2 and hs2 haven t any regular effect on lengths of forebody wetted keel and wetted chine 3 based on the obtained experimental results total trim angle is increased by an enhancement in the height of the step and deadrise angle however lower total trim angle is achieved at greater longitudinal position of aft step from transom 4 reattachment length after the forward step is increased by enhancing the hull velocity and decreasing the hs2 also reattachment length after the aft step is increased by an enhancement in hull velocity hs2 and ls2 5 forebody wetted area is decreased by increasing the hull velocity effect of the variation of ls2 and hs2 on the value of forward step wetted areas is irregular aft step and total wetted areas are increased by reducing the hull velocity increasing the heights of aft step hs2 and decreasing the aft step from transom ls2 hull cause to diminish of aft step and total wetted areas finally based on the obtained experimental data we formulated the equivalent step height of the forward and aft steps then an algorithm is suggested to determine the forebody and aftbody wetted areas of two stepped planing hulls the current study merits future investigations study on the wetted surfaces of multi steps i e more than two steps planing crafts at various geometrical parameters of the steps can be considered as future works credit authorship contribution statement amin najafi and hashem

21052,in this paper the influence of the damping matrix and mud discharge on the recoil response of deepwater drilling riser after emergency disconnection is studied based on our published study mathematically the deepwater drilling riser is discretized into a mass spring damping system with three degrees of freedom dof the governing equation is solved by the principal coordinates analysis method method a and the complex modal analysis method method b respectively firstly the mathematical expression of the frictional resistance acting on the riser during mud discharge is obtained by curve fitting then the detailed solving process and the difference of the results calculated by the two solving methods are shown the influence of the non diagonal elements in the damping matrix on the recoil response is studied in addition the effect of the frictional resistance of mud discharge on the recoil characteristics is assessed finally conclusions are drawn based on the analysis keywords deepwater drilling riser emergency disconnection recoil response solving methods mud discharge 1 introduction the recoil response of drilling riser after emergency disconnection is an important engineering problem relating to the safety of deepwater drilling operations in deepwater drilling the top tensioner is used to keep the riser in a tensioning state resisting the mechanical deformation caused by sea wave and current normally the over pull tension force is imposed on the connection section of the lower marine riser package lmrp and the blowout preventers bops to ensure the riser mechanical behavior meets relevant standards api rp 16q 2017 therefore the riser will generate axial elongation with axial elastic potential energy and stiffness wang ang gao 2019 for example the riser will have an elongation of 1 58m 5 2 ft when a length of 1889 76m 6200 ft riser has 1000 kips over pull force at the lmrp puccio and nuttall 2017 when the water depth exceeds 3048 00m 10000 ft the total elongation of the riser will be more than 3 05m 10 ft ma et al 2013 when the marine environment is too harsh or equipment malfunction occurs emergency disconnection operation should be implemented to disconnect the lmrp from the bops gao and wang 2016 under this circumstance the elastic potential energy will be released instantly and the riser will move upward like a spring which is called recoil response in addition the whole weight and the inertia force acting on the riser during the recoil response will increase if the riser annulus is closed by the lmrp after emergency disconnection moreover the lowest natural frequency of the riser filled with drilling mud may fall into the wave frequency range when the recoil response is complete which would result in serious suspension dynamic response in fact there is no sufficient time to circulate the drilling mud when the emergency disconnection occurs therefore the drilling mud stored in the riser annulus will be discharged from the lmrp under the action of gravity and frictional resistance meanwhile the top of the riser will be refilled with seawater due to the significance of riser safety in deepwater drilling a great deal of scholars have studied the recoil response to reveal the mechanical characteristics and seek corresponding controlling solutions the reasonable drilling riser configuration stahl et al 2004 and weak links of disconnected riser brynestad 2012 have been determined based on the recoil analysis meanwhile some theoretical analysis approaches have been proposed to figure out the variables affecting the velocity and displacement of the lmrp during the recoil process puccio and nuttall 2017 su et al 2018 methodology of time domain analysis has also been put forward based on the irregular wave method and the monte carlo technique grytoyr et al 2009 2010 2011 besides some software tools including deepriser lang et al 2009 riflex grønevik 2013 ansys zhang 2014 zhang et al 2013 and ansys aqwa wang and wang 2018 have been used to carry out the recoil analysis to describe the disconnection procedure and the main influence factors in addition field applications have been conducted to verify the correctness of the established models ma et al 2013 and provide guidance for riser design young et al 1992a 1992b hock and young 1993 stahl and hock 2000 since the top tensioner takes a significant role in the recoil response many scholars have studied the stiffness of the top tensioner and the variation of the tension force the nonlinear parallel spring damper scalar elements pestana et al 2016 have been used to study the response of the top tension system haziri and dyngvold 2011 during emergency disconnection based on the direct acting tensioner dat zhang et al 2013 accordingly some controlling measures have been proposed tian 2013 zhang 2015 he et al 2016 furthermore simulations of mud discharge and seawater refilling li et al 2015 2016 have also been carried out to study the influence of different mud discharge models on the recoil characteristics meng et al 2018 although some progress has been made in the research of riser recoil response the detailed solving process has not been reported until now therefore the mechanical model and solutions for recoil analysis are presented based on our previous study wang and gao 2019 2020 the main innovation point of this paper is to show two analysis approaches solving the governing equation particularly the influence of the non diagonal elements in the damping matrix and mud discharge on the recoil response is studied 2 mechanical model the mechanical model boundary conditions initial conditions and external load analysis can be referred to our published papers wang and gao 2019 2020 which are omitted here for simplicity as a summary the matrix form of the governing equation can be written as 1 m x c x kx f t it should be point out that some assumptions have been adopted for simplification of the mathematical derivation process the anti recoil control system and the coupling vibration effect of the internal fluid column and the riser are not considered in the model 3 analysis methods according to the vibration mechanics the eq 1 under the principal coordinates after coordinate transformation can be written as 2 m p η c p η k p η p t where m p φ t m φ is the principal mass matrix k p φ t k φ is the principal stiffness matrix c p φ t c φ φ is the modal matrix p t φ t f t generally m p and k p are diagonal matrixes after coordinate transformation if the following equation caughey and o kelly 1965 is satisfied c p is also a diagonal matrix 3 m 1 c m 1 k m 1 k m 1 c however for a damped system with multi degrees of freedom eq 3 is not easily satisfied which means that eq 2 is still coupled under the principal coordinates η so the following of this paper focuses on the solving methods when the non diagonal elements in c p are considered or neglected 3 1 principal coordinates analysis method a if the non diagonal elements in c p are ignored eq 2 has been decoupled then the i th equation can be written as 4 m p i η i c p i η i k p i η i p i t i 1 2 3 that is 5 η i 2 ζ i ω i η i ω i 2 η i 1 m p i p i t i 1 2 3 where ζ i c p i 2 m p i ω i ω i is the natural frequency of the system in free vibration since eq 2 has been decoupled the solution ni zhenhua 1988 for eq 5 can be obtained according to the vibration theory which is 6 η i t e ζ i ω i t η i 0 c o s ω d i t η i 0 ζ i ω i η i 0 ω d i s i n ω d i t 1 m p i ω d i 0 t p i τ e ζ i ω i t τ s i n ω d i t τ d τ i 1 2 3 where ω d i ω i 1 ζ i 2 is the natural frequency of the system in damped vibration therefore the recoil response of the system can be calculated by 7 x φ η 3 2 complex modal analysis method b if the non diagonal elements in c p cannot be neglected the principal coordinates analysis method described above is no longer applicable in this case the displacement and velocity should be regarded as independent variables under this circumstance the whole riser is discretized into a system with three degrees of freedom which means n 3 when the equation is solved by the complex modal analysis method the 3 s order ordinary differential equations in eq 1 is regarded as a set of six first order ordinary differential equations it has becomes a decoupled 2n degrees system for the matrix eigenvalue problem of a general damped system we can assume that 8 x ϕ e λ t where ϕ is the constant sequence vector λ is the undetermined constants if substituting eq 8 into eq 1 one obtains 9 λ 2 m λ c k ϕ 0 the necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonzero solution of eq 9 is 10 λ 2 m λ c k 0 eq 10 is the characteristic equation of a general damped system which is a set of 2n order equations of λ so 2n eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 2 n and 2n eigenvectors ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 n can be obtained after solving eq 10 after derivation the response of a general damped system can be written as ni 1988 11 x t i 1 2 n e λ i t a i ϕ i ϕ i t m x 0 λ i x 0 c x 0 i 1 2 n 1 a i ϕ i ϕ i t 0 t f τ e λ i t τ d τ where a i λ i ϕ i ϕ i t o m m c λ i ϕ i ϕ i 4 model application 4 1 calculation data taking an emergency disconnection of a drilling riser in 10 000 ft of water depth as example the riser is configured in a floating drilling vessel and the parameters of the drilling riser system configuration are shown in table 1 the data of the floating drilling vessel the marine environment and the configuration of the dat system are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively according to the parameters presented in table 1 and 2 and table 3 the whole mass of the riser the top displacement excitation of the drilling vessel and the stiffness of the dat can be calculated based on the methods published in our previous papers wang and gao 2019 2020 4 2 frictional resistance analysis of mud discharge generally the mud discharge velocity is necessary when calculates the frictional resistance however the frictional resistance is needed while calculating the mud discharge velocity in this paper an initial timestep is given firstly and the mud is discharged only under the gravity during this given initial timestep at the end of the timestep the velocity acceleration and length of the mud column will be figured out then the frictional resistance can be obtained according to the results mentioned above thus the mud discharge process can be analyzed until the length of mud column is zero based on this procedure the calculated frictional resistance acting on the drilling riser during mud discharge is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the whole mud discharge process can be divided into two phases when the mud column begins to discharge the first phase it has the maximum column length the mud velocity increases gradually which results in increase of the frictional resistance in this example the maximum velocity is 27 2 m s occurring at 8 2s when the frictional resistance reaches the maximum value 7 99 mn the discharge turns to the second phase during this phase the discharge velocity and the mud column length decrease gradually which leads to decrease of the frictional resistance in this example the whole mud discharge process lasts for 171 8s since the total frictional force on the riser is irregular it cannot be described by general mathematical expression so curve fitting is adopted to calculate the analytical expressions of the frictional resistance acting on the three mass blocks the summation of series is selected to fit the frictional resistance actually many mathematical functions such as polynomial and sine functions can be used to fit the curve considering the top displacement excitation of the system and the convenience of integral operation sine functions is selected to fit the curve it should be pointed out that both the calculation accuracy and the amount of computation will increase with the series after analysis the sum of eight orders of sine series can be used to fit the frictional resistance with sufficient precision which is 12 f i t j 1 8 a j sin b j t c j i 1 2 3 the fitted curve and corresponding fitting coefficients on each mass block are also presented in fig 1 4 3 comparison of the two methods the influence of the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix on the r recoil response is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the riser recoil response is severe in a short period about 20s after emergency disconnection then the vibration becomes mild the reason for this is that the elastic potential energy stored in the riser will be released acutely with the separation of the lmrp and bops as time goes on the whole energy decreases slowly and the vibration tends to be stable gradually due to the damping effect the maximum clearance between the lmrp and the bops calculated by the two methods are 4 53m method b and 4 54m method a respectively the final equilibrium positions of the lmrp are close to each other however the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix has a significant influence on the initial phase of the recoil response when the non diagonal terms are considered the moment when the recoil response reaching stability is later than that they are neglected in this example the moment when the recoil response researches stable is 7 2s and 17 5s calculated by method a and by method b respectively the detailed calculation process of these two approaches are shown in appendix a and appendix b due to the influence of the non diagonal terms on the recoil characteristics we suggest that it should be considered in the recoil analysis 4 4 influence of the drilling mud discharge the mud discharge has an important influence on the riser recoil response which is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the equilibrium displacement of the lmrp calculated by the two methods is the same when the mud discharge is completed however the influence of mud discharge on the recoil response mainly reflects in the following two aspects one aspect is that the lmrp reaches its equilibrium state earlier when neglecting the frictional resistance of mud discharge in this example the moment of the lmrp researching stably is 6s and 17 5s the second aspect is that the lmrp will be pulled up to a higher distance in the initial phase of the recoil response when the mud discharge is neglected in this example the maximum distance of lmrp and bops is 5 32m and 4 54m under these two circumstances the reason for this is that the stored elastic potential energy will be partly consumed by the frictional resistance during the recoil response if the mud discharge is considered therefore the lmrp will have a smaller safety margin avoiding collision with the bops if the mud discharge effect is considered from this point of view we suggest that the frictional resistance of mud discharge should be taken into account when the recoil response analysis is carried out 5 conclusions in this paper the influence of the damping matrix and mud discharge on the recoil response of deepwater drilling riser after emergency disconnection is studied the time varying clearance between the lmrp and the bops calculated by the two methods has been figured out through analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix has a significant influence on the initial phase of the recoil response when the non diagonal terms are considered the moment when the recoil response reaching stability is later than that they are neglected 2 the equilibrium displacement of the lmrp calculated by the two methods is the same when the mud discharge is completed however the lmrp reaches its equilibrium state earlier when neglecting the frictional resistance of mud discharge in addition the lmrp will be pulled up to a higher distance in the initial phase of the recoil response when the mud discharge is neglected credit authorship contribution statement

method if the damping effect is neglected the differential equation of the vibration system can be written as a 1 m x kx 0 the eigenmatrix of eq a 1 can be written as a 2 b k ω 2 m if the natural frequency of the system is ω one obtains a 3 k ω 2 m 0 that is a 4 k 1 k 2 ω 2 m 1 k 2 0 k 2 2 k 2 ω 2 m 2 k 2 0 k 2 k 2 ω 2 m 3 0 so the natural frequency ω i i 1 2 3 can be obtained after solving eq

k 2 ω 2 m 1 k 1 k 2 ω 2 m 1 2 k 2 ω 2 m 2 k 2 2 if substituting ω i i 1 2 3 into a d j b the principal modes φ can be figured out then normalized modal matrix can be obtained after substituting the calculation data in table 1 into eq a 1 to eq a 5 which is φ 0 3926 2 6439 3 9800 0 7339 1 7330 6 2648 1 1 1 it is easy to verify that both the mass matrix and stiffness matrix are diagonal matrixes however the damping matrix is still a non diagonal matrix which is m p φ t m φ 2 1532 e 5 0 0 0 9 3881 e 5 0 0 0 4 0096 e 6 k p φ t k φ 1 9081 e 6 0 0 0 8 5443 e 7 0 0 0 9 7005 e 8 c p φ t c φ 1 2162

substituting eq a 8 into m x c x kx 0 one obtains ψ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 0 where ψ m 1 λ 2 c 1 c 2 λ k 1 k 2 c 2 λ k 2 0 c 2 λ k 2 m 2 λ 2 c 2 c 3 λ 2 k 2 c 3 λ k 2 0 c 3 λ k 2 m 3 λ 2 c 3 λ k 2 if we let the det of ψ is zero the 6 eigenvalues can be obtained which are λ 1 2 15 389 e 2 1005 i λ 3 4 9 9359 e 1 9243 i λ 5 6 2 9794 e 1 6657 i then the normalized eigenvectors can be obtained if substituting λ i i 1 2 3 4 5 6 into eq a 11 into a d j ψ which is ϕ 1 2 1 2986 e 0 4079 i 1 7684 e 0 4137 i e 0 i t ϕ 3 4 1 1091 e 0 2993 i 1 1539 e 2 9820 i e 0 i t ϕ 5 6 1 0112 e 0 0971 i 0 5305 e 3 0994 i e 0 i t considering eq 12 one obtains 0 t f i τ e λ i t τ d τ j 1 8 0 t a j sin b j t c j e λ i t τ d τ j 1 8 a j λ i γ i a j b j λ i 2 δ i 1 b j 2 λ i 2 i 1 2 3 where γ i sin c j e λ i t s i n b j t c j δ i cos c j e λ i t c o s b j t c j thus the riser recoil response can be figured out through substituting eq a 11 eq a 12 eq a 13 and eq a 14 into eq 11 appendix b this appendix presents the recoil

7 based on eq a 4 the natural frequency of undamped free vibration ω i can be obtained which is b 2 ω 2 9769 9 5400 15 5542 since ζ i c p i 2 m p i ω i the damping ratio of each mode can be calculated which is b 3 ξ 0 0949 0 3484 0 5007 because ω d i ω i 1 ζ i 2 the natural frequency of the damped vibration can be figured out which is b 4 ω d 2 9635 8 9425 13 4636 the initial conditions in the

the riser mechanical behavior meets relevant standards api rp 16q 2017 therefore the riser will generate axial elongation with axial elastic potential energy and stiffness wang ang gao 2019 for example the riser will have an elongation of 1 58m 5 2 ft when a length of 1889 76m 6200 ft riser has 1000 kips over pull force at the lmrp puccio and nuttall 2017 when the water depth exceeds 3048 00m 10000 ft the total elongation of the riser will be more than 3 05m 10 ft ma et al 2013 when the marine environment is too harsh or equipment malfunction occurs emergency disconnection operation should be implemented to disconnect the lmrp from the bops gao and wang 2016 under this circumstance the elastic potential energy will be released instantly and the riser will move upward like a spring which is called recoil response in addition the whole weight and the inertia force acting on the riser during the recoil response will increase if the riser annulus is closed by the lmrp after emergency disconnection moreover the lowest natural frequency of the riser filled with drilling mud may fall into the wave frequency range when the recoil response is complete which would result in serious suspension dynamic response in fact there is no sufficient time to circulate the drilling mud when the emergency disconnection occurs therefore the drilling mud stored in the riser annulus will be discharged from the lmrp under the action of gravity and frictional resistance meanwhile the top of the riser will be refilled with seawater due to the significance of riser safety in deepwater drilling a great deal of scholars have studied the recoil response to reveal the mechanical characteristics and seek corresponding controlling solutions the reasonable drilling riser configuration stahl et al 2004 and weak links of disconnected riser brynestad 2012 have been determined based on the recoil analysis meanwhile some theoretical analysis approaches have been proposed to figure out the variables affecting the velocity and displacement of the lmrp during the recoil process puccio and nuttall 2017 su et al 2018 methodology of time domain analysis has also been put forward based on the irregular wave method and the monte carlo technique grytoyr et al 2009 2010 2011 besides some software tools including deepriser lang et al 2009 riflex grønevik 2013 ansys zhang 2014 zhang et al 2013 and ansys aqwa wang and wang 2018 have been used to carry out the recoil analysis to describe the disconnection procedure and the main influence factors in addition field applications have been conducted to verify the correctness of the established models ma et al 2013 and provide guidance for riser design young et al 1992a 1992b hock and young 1993 stahl and hock 2000 since the top tensioner takes a significant role in the recoil response many scholars have studied the stiffness of the top tensioner and the variation of the tension force the nonlinear parallel spring damper scalar elements pestana et al 2016 have been used to study the response of the top tension system haziri and dyngvold 2011 during emergency disconnection based on the direct acting tensioner dat zhang et al 2013 accordingly some controlling measures have been proposed tian 2013 zhang 2015 he et al 2016 furthermore simulations of mud discharge and seawater refilling li et al 2015 2016 have also been carried out to study the influence of different mud discharge models on the recoil characteristics meng et al 2018 although some progress has been made in the research of riser recoil response the detailed solving process has not been reported until now therefore the mechanical model and solutions for recoil analysis are presented based on our previous study wang and gao 2019 2020 the main innovation point of this paper is to show two analysis approaches solving the governing equation particularly the influence of the non diagonal elements in the damping matrix and mud discharge on the recoil response is studied 2 mechanical model the mechanical model boundary conditions initial conditions and external load analysis can be referred to our published papers wang and gao 2019 2020 which are omitted here for simplicity as a summary the matrix form of the governing equation can be written as 1 m x c x kx f t it should be point out that some assumptions have been adopted for simplification of the mathematical derivation process the anti recoil control system and the coupling vibration effect of the internal fluid column and the riser are not considered in the model 3 analysis methods according to the vibration mechanics the eq 1 under the principal coordinates after coordinate transformation can be written as 2 m p η c p η k p η p t where m p φ t m φ is the principal mass matrix k p φ t k φ is the principal stiffness matrix c p φ t c φ φ is the modal matrix p t φ t f t generally m p and k p are diagonal matrixes after coordinate transformation if the following equation caughey and o kelly 1965 is satisfied c p is also a diagonal matrix 3 m 1 c m 1 k m 1 k m 1 c however for a damped system with multi degrees of freedom eq 3 is not easily satisfied which means that eq 2 is still coupled under the principal coordinates η so the following of this paper focuses on the solving methods when the non diagonal elements in c p are considered or neglected 3 1 principal coordinates analysis method a if the non diagonal elements in c p are ignored eq 2 has been decoupled then the i th equation can be written as 4 m p i η i c p i η i k p i η i p i t i 1 2 3 that is 5 η i 2 ζ i ω i η i ω i 2 η i 1 m p i p i t i 1 2 3 where ζ i c p i 2 m p i ω i ω i is the natural frequency of the system in free vibration since eq 2 has been decoupled the solution ni zhenhua 1988 for eq 5 can be obtained according to the vibration theory which is 6 η i t e ζ i ω i t η i 0 c o s ω d i t η i 0 ζ i ω i η i 0 ω d i s i n ω d i t 1 m p i ω d i 0 t p i τ e ζ i ω i t τ s i n ω d i t τ d τ i 1 2 3 where ω d i ω i 1 ζ i 2 is the natural frequency of the system in damped vibration therefore the recoil response of the system can be calculated by 7 x φ η 3 2 complex modal analysis method b if the non diagonal elements in c p cannot be neglected the principal coordinates analysis method described above is no longer applicable in this case the displacement and velocity should be regarded as independent variables under this circumstance the whole riser is discretized into a system with three degrees of freedom which means n 3 when the equation is solved by the complex modal analysis method the 3 s order ordinary differential equations in eq 1 is regarded as a set of six first order ordinary differential equations it has becomes a decoupled 2n degrees system for the matrix eigenvalue problem of a general damped system we can assume that 8 x ϕ e λ t where ϕ is the constant sequence vector λ is the undetermined constants if substituting eq 8 into eq 1 one obtains 9 λ 2 m λ c k ϕ 0 the necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonzero solution of eq 9 is 10 λ 2 m λ c k 0 eq 10 is the characteristic equation of a general damped system which is a set of 2n order equations of λ so 2n eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 2 n and 2n eigenvectors ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 n can be obtained after solving eq 10 after derivation the response of a general damped system can be written as ni 1988 11 x t i 1 2 n e λ i t a i ϕ i ϕ i t m x 0 λ i x 0 c x 0 i 1 2 n 1 a i ϕ i ϕ i t 0 t f τ e λ i t τ d τ where a i λ i ϕ i ϕ i t o m m c λ i ϕ i ϕ i 4 model application 4 1 calculation data taking an emergency disconnection of a drilling riser in 10 000 ft of water depth as example the riser is configured in a floating drilling vessel and the parameters of the drilling riser system configuration are shown in table 1 the data of the floating drilling vessel the marine environment and the configuration of the dat system are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively according to the parameters presented in table 1 and 2 and table 3 the whole mass of the riser the top displacement excitation of the drilling vessel and the stiffness of the dat can be calculated based on the methods published in our previous papers wang and gao 2019 2020 4 2 frictional resistance analysis of mud discharge generally the mud discharge velocity is necessary when calculates the frictional resistance however the frictional resistance is needed while calculating the mud discharge velocity in this paper an initial timestep is given firstly and the mud is discharged only under the gravity during this given initial timestep at the end of the timestep the velocity acceleration and length of the mud column will be figured out then the frictional resistance can be obtained according to the results mentioned above thus the mud discharge process can be analyzed until the length of mud column is zero based on this procedure the calculated frictional resistance acting on the drilling riser during mud discharge is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the whole mud discharge process can be divided into two phases when the mud column begins to discharge the first phase it has the maximum column length the mud velocity increases gradually which results in increase of the frictional resistance in this example the maximum velocity is 27 2 m s occurring at 8 2s when the frictional resistance reaches the maximum value 7 99 mn the discharge turns to the second phase during this phase the discharge velocity and the mud column length decrease gradually which leads to decrease of the frictional resistance in this example the whole mud discharge process lasts for 171 8s since the total frictional force on the riser is irregular it cannot be described by general mathematical expression so curve fitting is adopted to calculate the analytical expressions of the frictional resistance acting on the three mass blocks the summation of series is selected to fit the frictional resistance actually many mathematical functions such as polynomial and sine functions can be used to fit the curve considering the top displacement excitation of the system and the convenience of integral operation sine functions is selected to fit the curve it should be pointed out that both the calculation accuracy and the amount of computation will increase with the series after analysis the sum of eight orders of sine series can be used to fit the frictional resistance with sufficient precision which is 12 f i t j 1 8 a j sin b j t c j i 1 2 3 the fitted curve and corresponding fitting coefficients on each mass block are also presented in fig 1 4 3 comparison of the two methods the influence of the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix on the r recoil response is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the riser recoil response is severe in a short period about 20s after emergency disconnection then the vibration becomes mild the reason for this is that the elastic potential energy stored in the riser will be released acutely with the separation of the lmrp and bops as time goes on the whole energy decreases slowly and the vibration tends to be stable gradually due to the damping effect the maximum clearance between the lmrp and the bops calculated by the two methods are 4 53m method b and 4 54m method a respectively the final equilibrium positions of the lmrp are close to each other however the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix has a significant influence on the initial phase of the recoil response when the non diagonal terms are considered the moment when the recoil response reaching stability is later than that they are neglected in this example the moment when the recoil response researches stable is 7 2s and 17 5s calculated by method a and by method b respectively the detailed calculation process of these two approaches are shown in appendix a and appendix b due to the influence of the non diagonal terms on the recoil characteristics we suggest that it should be considered in the recoil analysis 4 4 influence of the drilling mud discharge the mud discharge has an important influence on the riser recoil response which is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the equilibrium displacement of the lmrp calculated by the two methods is the same when the mud discharge is completed however the influence of mud discharge on the recoil response mainly reflects in the following two aspects one aspect is that the lmrp reaches its equilibrium state earlier when neglecting the frictional resistance of mud discharge in this example the moment of the lmrp researching stably is 6s and 17 5s the second aspect is that the lmrp will be pulled up to a higher distance in the initial phase of the recoil response when the mud discharge is neglected in this example the maximum distance of lmrp and bops is 5 32m and 4 54m under these two circumstances the reason for this is that the stored elastic potential energy will be partly consumed by the frictional resistance during the recoil response if the mud discharge is considered therefore the lmrp will have a smaller safety margin avoiding collision with the bops if the mud discharge effect is considered from this point of view we suggest that the frictional resistance of mud discharge should be taken into account when the recoil response analysis is carried out 5 conclusions in this paper the influence of the damping matrix and mud discharge on the recoil response of deepwater drilling riser after emergency disconnection is studied the time varying clearance between the lmrp and the bops calculated by the two methods has been figured out through analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the non diagonal terms in the damping matrix has a significant influence on the initial phase of the recoil response when the non diagonal terms are considered the moment when the recoil response reaching stability is later than that they are neglected 2 the equilibrium displacement of the lmrp calculated by the two methods is the same when the mud discharge is completed however the lmrp reaches its equilibrium state earlier when neglecting the frictional resistance of mud discharge in addition the lmrp will be pulled up to a higher distance in the initial phase of the recoil response when the mud discharge is neglected credit authorship contribution statement

method if the damping effect is neglected the differential equation of the vibration system can be written as a 1 m x kx 0 the eigenmatrix of eq a 1 can be written as a 2 b k ω 2 m if the natural

k 2 ω 2 m 1 k 1 k 2 ω 2 m 1 2 k 2 ω 2 m 2 k 2 2 if substituting ω i i 1 2 3 into a d j b the principal modes φ can be figured out then normalized modal matrix can be obtained after substituting the

substituting eq a 8 into m x c x kx 0 one obtains ψ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 0 where ψ m 1 λ 2 c 1 c 2 λ k 1 k 2 c 2 λ k 2 0 c 2 λ k 2 m 2 λ 2 c 2 c 3 λ 2 k 2 c 3 λ k 2 0 c 3 λ k 2 m 3 λ 2 c 3 λ k 2 if we let the

i i 1 2 3 4 5 6 into eq a 11 into a d j ψ which is ϕ 1 2 1 2986 e 0 4079 i 1 7684 e 0 4137 i e 0 i t ϕ 3 4 1 1091 e 0 2993 i 1 1539 e 2 9820 i e 0 i t ϕ 5 6 1 0112 e 0 0971 i 0 5305 e 3 0994 i e 0 i t

21053,an evaluation of the stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields of a waterjet propelled ship was studied by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method model and full scale simulations of the unsteady multiphase flow were carried out both in the bare hull and the self propulsion conditions the reliability of grid arrangement and numerical methods was confirmed by the uncertainty analysis of the flow fields the results indicated that the existence of stabilizer fins altered the turbulent boundary layer distribution around the hull and such disturbance extended to the capture areas of the waterjet s ingested flow the discrepancy of the outer waterjet ow and the inner waterjet iw axial velocity distributions resulted in the difference of velocity non uniformity in the pump inflow plane and it also caused a relatively larger decrease in the duct efficiency of the ow with respect to the scale effect of the flow fields a relatively thinner boundary layer thickness and a higher non uniformity of the internal flow were observed due to a higher turbulence in the full scale simulation it was noted that the model scale computations underestimated the momentum velocity coefficients at station 1a while they overestimated the duct efficiency in all cases with or without the stabilizer fins keywords stabilizer fin waterjet propulsion scale effect flow disturbance 1 introduction waterjets are widely used in high speed marine vehicles due to a high propulsive efficiency and a good cavitation margin recently it has been applied to large scale ships with an increasing waterjet s propulsive power molland et al 2017 it is of great concern to keep the stability of the ships in winds or waves and thus several types of anti rolling devices are utilized either alone or in combination fin stabilizer is one of the most effective tools to damp the roll motion of ships and has superior performance at high speed as larger lift down forces are produced sun et al 2018 therefore it is increasingly common to see one or two pairs of stabilizer fins utilized in high speed waterjet propelled ships theoretical and experimental studies of stabilizer fins have been extensively performed in previous researches the lift characteristics of the stabilizer fins were studied using cfd method and an active proportional integral derivative pid control algorithm was proposed to reduce the roll motions of a frigate type warship by surendran et al 2007 sun et al 2018 designed a new lift feedback control system and a new fin axis mechanism for ship stabilizer fin the adaptive control strategy reduced the nonlinear error of feedback and improved anti rolling effect effectively the working mechanism and mode were proposed and an active fins were developed for roll stabilization of ships at zero speed by wang et al 2009 additionally song et al 2020 carried out the hydrofoil profile optimization to improve the anti rolling efficiency for zero low velocity fin stabilizers it is seen that the study on the stabilizer fins concentrates on the prediction of roll damping effect lift mechanism and design of active control systems since the flow fields around the hull are inevitably interfered in the presence of the fins it is meaningful but rarely evaluated on the dynamics of stabilizer fins on the ships with waterjet propulsion the control volume approach was proposed by the international towing tank conference ittc for waterjet propelled vehicles ittc 1996 the self propulsion model tests in towing tank are usually carried out in partial similarity conditions equal froude numbers fr are satisfied with a disparity in reynolds numbers re compared with the model test re 106 107 the turbulence flow around the ship exhibiting a wider range of spatial and temporal scales at full scale as the reynolds number is in the range of 108 109 pereira et al 2017 the specialist committee on scaling of wake field of 26th ittc ittc 2011a reviewed the existing scaling methods and the applicability of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for the prediction of full scale wake with the current advances in cfd techniques and increasing computational power available the numerical simulations of full scale wakes using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans is feasible and acceptable as an indirect method to gain insight into the flow physics extensive investigations on scale effect of ship wake have been carried out with full scale wakes simulated numerically and experimentally wang et al 2010 2015 castro et al 2011 kleinwachter et al 2017 jasak et al 2019 the viscous wake field and resistance prediction of a full scale kvlcc2m were carried out numerically by wang et al 2010 and their numerical strategy was proved applicable for other slow full ship types wang et al 2015 found that the reciprocal of mean axial wake fraction of propeller disc exhibits a near linear dependence on reynolds number in logarithmic scale for a single screw ship particle imaging velocimetry piv was used to determine a full scale wake flow for a better propeller design for the first time kleinwachter et al 2017 and the satisfying systematic deviations and low measurement inaccuracies confirmed that piv was a suitable measurement technique for full scale wake field investigations compared with the sea trial data of the general cargo carrier regal jasak et al 2019 demonstrated the possibility of using high fidelity numerical methods to calculate the full scale flow characteristics to complicate matters further the flow fields of the waterjet propelled ships consist of external and internal flow fields as parts of the flow enters the ducting channel of the waterjet with flush intake as concluded in the ittc reports ittc 2011b ingested boundary layer thickness was relatively thinner for full scale than that in model scale tests or simulations similar to the wake scale effect on propeller ships this phenomenon can be interpreted as the scale effect on the flow fields for waterjet propelled ships scale effect on the external flow fields makes a difference in the prediction of the momentum velocity coefficient which was crucial to evaluating the waterjet hull interaction gong et al 2019a on the other hand internal flow field of waterjet influences the ducting losses and pump characteristics e g cavitation vibration and propulsive performance but there is only few literature reporting on the scale effect on the internal flow fields in the waterjet hull system additionally a more thorough full scale investigation of the flow fields is helpful in verifying the dependence the stabilizer fin s influence on the geometrical scale with respect to the computations of waterjet propelled ships delaney et al 2009 performed rans computations to analyze the waterjet pump performance for two joint high speed sealift jhss hull forms with four waterjets both in model and full scale the comparison of the axial velocity distributions in the capture area station 1a see fig 1 showed a good agreement between the model scale flow fields and the laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurements they found that higher reynolds number full scale flow produced a significantly thinner boundary layer thickness at station 1a and the inlet efficiency increased from model to full scale the difference of the predicted delivered pump power between the full scale rans simulation and experimental results was negligible yang et al 2014 analyzed the fluctuating noise source of the full scale waterjet propelled trimaran using cfx solver eslamdoost et al 2014 developed a fast and robust potential flow method pressure jump method to replace the real impeller this method accurately predicted the inlet velocity ratio nozzle velocity ratio gross thrust and thrust deduction duerr and von ellenrieder 2015 simulated the internal flow features of the r v athena fitted with watetjet system in full scale the rans simulations were steady single phase and the ship was held in fixed sinkage and trim they concluded that the pump inflow at a new ship speed could be approximated by scaling the mean flow component of the wake by the relative change in pump flow rate gong et al 2017 measured the velocity distribution at the capture area of the waterjet using the particle image velocimetry piv technique in towing tank and they compared the main features of the wake and the boundary layer thickness between the piv measurements and rans simulations in their recent study gong et al 2019b a good correspondence was observed for the momentum energy velocity coefficients and it was demonstrated that the numerical model was reliable in simulating the flow fields in model scale based on the literature review though the wake scale effect on propeller ships have been extensively studied it has not been reported systematically on the external and internal flow fields of waterjet propelled ships also there is a dearth of study on the stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields of waterjet propelled ships and its scale dependence in the present study a four waterjet propelled ship with two sets of stabilizer fins is studied with considering the free surface effect the viscous flow fields of bare hull and self propulsion cases with and without stabilizer fins in model and full scales are solved numerically by rans methods model scale simulations are used to verify the grid generation and calculation method and verification and validation v v is carried out by comparing with the piv measured results in model test full scale calculations are presented and compared to analyze the scale effect on the external and internal flow fields a comparison of the flow fields between the inner waterjet iw and outer waterjet ow is also performed 2 numerical model 2 1 geometry a medium speed mono hull ship with two sets of controllable stabilizer fins is chosen for the numerical study the airfoil profile of the stabilizer fins changes gradually from top to bottom and the main parameter ranges are listed in table 1 four flush type waterjets are selected for the propulsion system and a deep v hull form with a transom stern was adopted in the ship design fig 2 the bare hull simulations are divided into two categories bh and bhf which denote the bare hull cases without and with stabilizer fins cases similarly sp and spf are used to denote the self propulsion cases without and with stabilizer fins respectively it should be noted that the stabilizer fins are fixed in the optimum anti rolling angle at current speed fr 0 4 in the present study model test has been carried out for a 6 67 m long 1 16 scale model of the ship in towing tank the main parameters of full scale geometry are presented in table 1 2 2 governing equations and turbulence model the governing equations for the turbulent flow around a waterjet hull system comprise the conservation of mass continuity equation and momentum rans for an incompressible newtonian fluid wang 2004 the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is selected for all model and full scale simulations as recommended in ittc 2011a the computations are carried out in double precision mode the governing equations and the transport equations of turbulence model are discretized using the finite volume method with a second order upwind scheme while pressure velocity coupling is facilitated through the simple algorithm the transient terms are discretized using a second order implicit time discretization numerical simulations are realized by using the unsteady rans flow solver star ccm 13 02 2 3 grid system and boundary conditions half of the ship hull is used for bare hull simulations to save computational resource and thus only two of the waterjets are included for self propulsion simulations with respect to the computational coordinate system a cartesian earth fixed coordinates o xyz are used and defined as follows fig 3 the original o is on the symmetry plane y 0 of the ship at the intersection of the keel line and midship section in the longitudinal direction the positive directions of the x y z axis are the direction from the bow to the stern mid ship to the port side and bottom of the ship to its deck respectively the dimensions of the computational domain along the three directions are 2 5l pp x 3 5l pp 0 0 y 1 8l pp and 2 0l pp z 1 0l pp the boundary conditions of the computational domain are set as follows a symmetry boundary condition of y 0 is adopted the inlet is the velocity inlet as well the top sides and bottom gong et al 2018 which simulate infinite far field boundary conditions the outlet is the pressure outlet the mid ship section is the symmetry plane and the hull stabilizer fins channels and nozzles are non slip surfaces the cartesian cut cell method is used to generate the unstructured computational grids with a boundary layer that consisted of a prism layer mesh and a trimmed mesh to avoid exaggerated numerical dissipations several refinement volumes are set in the computational domain three refinement volumes are used around the hull in a gradually manner with the isotropic sizes of 3 l pp 1 5 l pp and 0 75 l pp respectively another three refinement volumes are applied in the gas liquid interface areas with finer sizes 0 375 l pp 0 187 l pp and 0 094 l pp in the z direction to capture the free surface accurately the regions near the stern inlet duct nozzle and trailing flow are also refined a large number of cells are required to generate the grid inside the waterjet unit for self propulsion simulations ten prism layers are computed and meshed near the surfaces with a total thickness equals to the estimated turbulence boundary layer with a stretching ratio of 1 2 the number of prism layers are the same both in model and full scale simulations while the relative total thickness alters according to the theory of flat plate boundary layer white 1998 fig 4 shows the computational grids near the stern and inside the inner waterjet iw the mesh distribution and topology around the hull are kept in consistency in all bare hull and self propulsion simulations for full scale simulations it is worth noting that the grid topology generation size and distribution were kept exactly the same with the model scale but with a higher resolution of the hull boundary layer and free surface finally the model scale y is maintained in the range of 30 60 while the full scale y value is around 300 as employed in the previous studies castro et al 2011 wang et al 2015 2016 with wall functions used in the near wall surface additionally the hull roughness sand grain 0 05 mm is taken into account in full scale simulations schultz 2007 finally for model scale simulations the three grid system fine medium and coarse grids g1 g3 used for bare hull simulations bh and bhf which includes 2 5 m 14 4 m cells with a grid refinement ratio close to 1 4 with 3 3 m 18 0 m cells for self propulsion simulations sp and spf meanwhile it consists of 3 1 m 18 7 m cells in bare hull simulations and 3 8 m 20 7 m cells in self propulsion simulations in full scale 2 4 simulation design the multiphase air water three dimensional flows including free surface effects established to evaluate the influence of the stabilizer fins on the flow fields the volume of fluid vof model is utilized to capture the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 two virtual disk vd models are used to simulate the effect of the pump with the body force method in waterjet driven situations star ccm 2017 the tangential component of the body force is excluded to eliminate the swirling effect of the nozzle and thus forming the parallel jet stream the self propulsion points spp are achieved when the net thrust of waterjet was equal to the hull resistance in full scale simulations while an experimental extra towing force or rope force is considered and used as a correction of the frictional resistance components in model scale simulations eslamdoost et al 2014 detailed data reduction and analysis could be checked in ittc recommended procedures ittc 2011b it was argued in eslamdoost et al 2018 that the resistance increment of waterjet propelled ships was caused by a global effect sinkage and trim and a local effect waterjet unit similarly it is also applicable to the analysis of the dynamics caused by the stabilizer fins according to the results of resistance tests the differences of the measured dynamic sinkage and trim between bh and bhf cases are small therefore in this study the initial sinkage and trim of the hull are set and fixed to the measured values to compute the dynamic equilibrium position to study the local effect of stabilizer fins and thus excludes the influence of global effect also as adopted in the model test we assume that the scale effect on the dynamic sinkage and trim is negligible between model and full scale ships we select a froude number fr of 0 4 as the target working condition which corresponds to the cruising speed 24 kn of the full scale ship the reynolds numbers re equals to 1 9 107 for the model scale cases and 1 2 109 for the full scale cases the courant friedrichs levy number satisfies cfl 1 the following criteria are used to determine whether a simulation has converged pressure equation convergence is reached when the residual imbalance of the poisson equation dropped by six orders of magnitude and all other variables are assumed converged when the residuals dropped to 10 5 and additional iterations produce no visible change for the resistance coefficients and flow fields 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis of numerical results in order to investigate the reliability of the grid topology and numerical method the uncertainty analysis of the total resistance coefficient c tm c tm r tm 0 5 ρs wm v 0m 2 r tm denotes the total model resistance in table 2 as well as the axial velocity distribution at station 1a were carried out station 1a locates one inlet diameter upstream from the waterjet inlet tangency point the experimental data was collected in the model test in towing tank including piv test gong et al 2019b and three grid systems were adopted for all four categories of numerical models richardson extrapolation xing and stern 2010 was employed in the verification and validation v v process of the viscous flow fields the definitions and proceeding procedures of the grid convergence ratio r g distance metric to the asymptotic range p g numerical simulation uncertainty u sn validation uncertainty u v and comparison error e were stated in the previous work takai et al 2011 meanwhile a detailed procedure to deal with the v v of flow fields based on the l2 norm was described in gong et al 2019b the uncertainty parameters were listed in subsequent table 3 table 4 and table 5 in these tables d denotes experimental data and s denotes the simulation value respectively as observed in the comparison of numerical cfd in table 2 and experimental efd in table 2 results the numerical simulations underestimated the total resistance coefficients for bhf and bh cases in model scale g1 g3 denote the fine medium and coarse grids respectively the relative errors of c tm were within 3 for all grid systems and the added resistance coefficient of the stabilizer fins were close to 0 25 10 3 for fr 0 4 as shown in table 3 the grid convergence ratios r g all exhibited monotonic convergence as they were less than one and solutions of bhf and bh were validated at the level of 4 23 and 4 98 as the error e was within u v the non dimensional axial velocity v x v 0 was analyzed in bhf simulations both in model and full scale velocity data were derived from the velocity contours at station 1a and five positions along the horizontal direction were selected which corresponded to y l pp 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 respectively as showed in tables 4 and 5 the monotonic convergence for bhf grids both in model and full scale simulations were also achieved as r g were less than one at five stations table 4 revealed that e u v was satisfied in five stations for the averaged values based on the l2 norm which validated the wake fields in model scale simulations bhf ms the validation process of full scale cases bhf fs cannot be completed due to the absence of experimental data relatively larger uncertainties were observed for full scale simulations in table 5 implying that the full scale cases were more sensitive to the grid resolution however all solutions showed good convergence behaviour r g 1 and the accuracy of the flow fields were guaranteed in summary the uncertainty analysis of the resistance coefficients and velocity distributions denoted an acceptable reliability and accuracy of present grid arrangement and numerical methods 3 2 analysis of bare hull simulations the waterjets were not presented here and the inlet ducts were covered in the simulations of bare hull cases to verify the influence of stabilizer fins in the wake the vortex structures around the hull was reconstructed based on q criterion wu 2013 in fig 5 also the axial velocity v x and turbulence kinetic energy tke in station 1a were analyzed at model and full scale reynolds numbers the variables were presented in non dimensional form the y and z locations were non dimensionalized based on hull length l pp the axial velocity v x using ship speed v 0 and tke using v 0 2 the full scale results were mirrored to form a direct comparison between model and full scale flow fields in the following figs 5 and 7 two groups of tip vortices induced by the forward and afterward stabilizer fins were clearly observed in bhf cases as showed in fig 5 the affected area of stabilizer fins was extended to the capture area in the waterjet hull system resulted in the obvious change of the mean velocity distributions at station 1a fig 6 to be more specific the forward fins caused the velocity variation near y l pp 0 032 dashed circle a fig 6 b and the afterward fins contributed to the low speed near the bilge dashed circle b fig 6 b consistent flow disturbance of stabilizer fins were observed for both model and full scale simulations due to the scale effect of the external flow fields the total boundary layer thickness of model scale simulations was slightly thicker than that in the full scale simulations see fig 6 which was consistent with the summary of ittc reports ittc 2011b the total thickness difference is even clearer in bhf cases as showed in fig 7 the axial velocity increased fast with a larger gradient in the full scale wake both in cases with and without the stabilizer fins the turbulence characteristic in station 1a was further discussed using turbulence kinetic energy tke the difference of tke distributions between model and full scale reynolds number in bh cases was not so apparent fig 8 a however what stood out in fig 8 b was that higher tke values were located in the affected areas of stabilizer fins in bhf cases which was related to the stronger turbulence fluctuations in a word though the local effect of the waterjets were not considered in bare hull condition the forward and afterward stabilizer fins affected the axial velocity distributions and turbulence characteristic at station 1a the boundary layer distribution law was altered due to the flow disturbance around the hull and the scale effect of the flow fields was prominent both in bh and bhf simulations 3 3 analysis of self propulsion simulations the ingested flow characteristics determines the inflow conditions of the waterjet pump which affected the propulsive efficiency cavitation and radiation noise performance of the waterjet also the free surface effect should be concerned as it influences the outflow features from the nozzle and alters the wake as observed in fig 9 the accelerated flow injected into the air and then interacted with the transom wake strong interference happened between the jet streams and the tailing flow compared to the model test results fig 9 c the numerical free surface morphology in model and full scale reflected the travelling process of the jet in the air but it was difficult to capture the jet diffusion and splash due to the limitation of grid resolutions as the entire flow fields were solved in rans calculations streamlines were tracked upstream from the waterjet pumps to produce the realistic geometric shape of the capture areas fig 10 showed ingested flow streamlines for the self propulsion simulations with and without the stabilizer fins spf and sp in model scale from a bottom view the stabilizer fins disturbed the boundary layer distribution near the hull and the flow characteristics were changed in the subsequent wake the main difference of the streamlines concentrated on the ingested flow of outer waterjet ow while it can be neglected for the inner waterjet iw as the flow pattern was nearly the same for the spf and sp simulations the ingested flow of ow contained part of the swirling flow induced by the stabilizer fins and thus there were several streamlines distributed near the fin tips see fig 10 b c the flow was getting closer to the hull and the streamtube height decreased when approaching the ship stern the width of the ingested flow at station 1a for ow was smaller in spf than that in sp w 2 w 2 while no obvious difference was observed for iw w 1 w 1 additionally it should be noted that the ingested flow was slightly off center from the central axis outboard for ow the capture areas at station 1a represented the portion of the upstream flow that was ingested into each of the waterjets fig 11 compared the geometric shapes between sp and spf model scale simulations the geometric shapes of capture areas were confirmed by intersecting the back tracked streamlines and the station 1a plane and represented as the dotted lines which enveloped all the crosspoints it was seen that the capture areas of iw were close to the same semi ellipse both in sp and spf cases while it became narrower and taller for ow in spf case the normalized mean axial velocity v x v 0 distribution in capture areas of the self propulsion simulations was illustrated in fig 12 the momentum velocity coefficient c m was defined to quantitatively describe the influence of the hull on the ingested flow as follows 1 c m 1 v 0 a 1 v x 2 d a a 1 v x d a where a1 is the capture area in accordance with the bare hull simulations the disturbance of the stabilizer fins caused a relatively thicker boundary layer thickness at station 1a in all the self propulsion simulations it denoted stronger negative effect of the stabilizer fins on the waterjet propulsive performance as smaller c m values were observed in table 6 on the other hand as seen in fig 12 the ingested flow consisted of more high velocity components in high reynolds number full scale simulations and thus obtained larger c m values which meant the model scale computations underestimated the momentum velocity coefficients in station 1a station 3 was defined as the outlet of the duct which was also the inflow plane of the pump the normalized mean axial velocity distributions v x v 0 at station 3 for the sp and spf cases were compared in fig 13 in conjunction with the flow characteristics of station 1a more significant flow differences existed in the inflow plane of ow than iw between sp and spf cases a symmetric distribution was observed for iw fig 13 a b while an asymmetric law for ow fig 13 c d as pointed out before the asymmetric distributions were related to the locations of capture areas which were leaning to the outboard of the ship more high speed regions e g v x v 0 0 8 existed in the lower half disk which were related to the high speed ingested flow distributed in the lower capture area in spf cases we compared the detailed values in three radii corresponding to r r 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 in fig 14 r denotes the radius of the inflow plane in general the velocity distribution in the lower half disk 270 θ 360 and 0 θ 90 is obviously greater than that of the upper half disk 90 θ 270 and this internal flow features were reported in previous studies delaney et al 2009 duerr and ellenrieder 2015 the averaged differences for iw were 0 45 0 31 and 1 13 pertaining to the three radii while they reached 6 04 3 05 and 1 01 for ow respectively the turbulent inflow field affected the normal operation of the waterjet pump and also caused unsteady vibration and noise in the pump here the non uniformity coefficient ξ is defined to evaluate the axial velocity uniformity of the pump inflow smaller ξ means higher uniformity of the velocity fields the definition of non uniformity coefficient is as follows 2 ξ 1 q a 3 v x v x d a where q denotes the flow rate and a3 denotes the area of the pump inflow plane what is clear from table 6 is the non uniformity of outer waterjet was apparently higher than that of inner waterjet for both model and full scale simulations the non uniformity increased by 0 3 and 0 4 when considering the stabilizer fin s influence in the model and full scale simulations respectively compared to the model scale results the flow field non uniformity in full scale simulations was larger with was related to the stronger turbulence in higher reynolds number the duct efficiency η d is another important factor to consider which influences the overall efficiency of the waterjet it is a physical quantity that measures the degree of energy utilization of the inlet duct to the incoming flow and defined as the ratio of the total energy of the duct outlet station 3 to the total energy of the inflow plane station 1a specific definitions are as follows 3 η d e 3 e 1 a 4 e 1 2 ρ v x 2 a v x v 0 2 c p v x d a 5 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ v x 2 where e 3 and e 1a denote the total energy at station 3 and station 1a and p and p 0 denote the pressure and relative pressure respectively in general the calculated pump efficiency of model scale simulations was slightly larger 0 6 0 75 than that in the full scale simulations see table 6 the duct efficiency differences of iw and ow were negligible 0 2 both in the model and full scale sp simulations the smooth design of the duct enabled the duct efficiency to reach or exceed 90 without the stabilizer fins in conjunction with the external and internal flow field distributions η d values of ow in spf cases had an obvious decrease 1 26 in model scale and 1 44 in full scale due to the influence of the stabilizer fins 4 conclusion in this paper the viscous flow fields of a four waterjet propelled ship were studied numerically by rans methods the evaluation of stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields and the flow disturbance characteristics were carried out at model and full scale reynolds numbers the scale effect of the flow fields whether considering the influence of the stabilizer fins or not were analyzed both for the bare hull and self propulsion simulations solutions of the resistance coefficients were validated at the uncertainty level of 5 and the flow field uncertainty at station 1a was within 20 for model scale simulations relatively larger numerical uncertainties were observed in the full scale simulations but all solutions showed good convergence behaviour and guaranteed the reliability of present grid arrangement and numerical methods two tip vortices induced by the stabilizer fins were observed both in the model and full scale simulations they convected downstream to the station 1a and altered the ingested flow of outer waterjet ow the capture area of ow was narrower and taller than that of iw and the axial velocity differences in the capture area and pump inflow plane resulted in a higher non uniformity coefficient and lower duct efficiency simultaneously with respect to the scale effect of the flow fields in the waterjet propulsion the turbulent boundary layer thickness was thinner in full scale simulations and the model scale simulation underestimated the momentum velocity coefficient c m by 1 1 5 additionally model scale simulations obtained lower non uniformity of the internal flow and overestimated the duct efficiency by 0 6 0 75 the over predicted values were larger for ow in the simulations with the stabilizer fins above conclusions have certain reference value for the correction of crucial parameters in the hydrodynamic performance prediction of full scale ships with waterjet propulsion also it illustrates that the dynamics of stabilizer fins on propulsion performance should be considered and minimized though the anti rolling performance is a primary consideration

21053,an evaluation of the stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields of a waterjet propelled ship was studied by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method model and full scale simulations of the unsteady multiphase flow were carried out both in the bare hull and the self propulsion conditions the reliability of grid arrangement and numerical methods was confirmed by the uncertainty analysis of the flow fields the results indicated that the existence of stabilizer fins altered the turbulent boundary layer distribution around the hull and such disturbance extended to the capture areas of the waterjet s ingested flow the discrepancy of the outer waterjet ow and the inner waterjet iw axial velocity distributions resulted in the difference of velocity non uniformity in the pump inflow plane and it also caused a relatively larger decrease in the duct efficiency of the ow with respect to the scale effect of the flow fields a relatively thinner boundary layer thickness and a higher non uniformity of the internal flow were observed due to a higher turbulence in the full scale simulation it was noted that the model scale computations underestimated the momentum velocity coefficients at station 1a while they overestimated the duct efficiency in all cases with or without the stabilizer fins keywords stabilizer fin waterjet propulsion scale effect flow disturbance 1 introduction waterjets are widely used in high speed marine vehicles due to a high propulsive efficiency and a good cavitation margin recently it has been applied to large scale ships with an increasing waterjet s propulsive power molland et al 2017 it is of great concern to keep the stability of the ships in winds or waves and thus several types of anti rolling devices are utilized either alone or in combination fin stabilizer is one of the most effective tools to damp the roll motion of ships and has superior performance at high speed as larger lift down forces are produced sun et al 2018 therefore it is increasingly common to see one or two pairs of stabilizer fins utilized in high speed waterjet propelled ships theoretical and experimental studies of stabilizer fins have been extensively performed in previous researches the lift characteristics of the stabilizer fins were studied using cfd method and an active proportional integral derivative pid control algorithm was proposed to reduce the roll motions of a frigate type warship by surendran et al 2007 sun et al 2018 designed a new lift feedback control system and a new fin axis mechanism for ship stabilizer fin the adaptive control strategy reduced the nonlinear error of feedback and improved anti rolling effect effectively the working mechanism and mode were proposed and an active fins were developed for roll stabilization of ships at zero speed by wang et al 2009 additionally song et al 2020 carried out the hydrofoil profile optimization to improve the anti rolling efficiency for zero low velocity fin stabilizers it is seen that the study on the stabilizer fins concentrates on the prediction of roll damping effect lift mechanism and design of active control systems since the flow fields around the hull are inevitably interfered in the presence of the fins it is meaningful but rarely evaluated on the dynamics of stabilizer fins on the ships with waterjet propulsion the control volume approach was proposed by the international towing tank conference ittc for waterjet propelled vehicles ittc 1996 the self propulsion model tests in towing tank are usually carried out in partial similarity conditions equal froude numbers fr are satisfied with a disparity in reynolds numbers re compared with the model test re 106 107 the turbulence flow around the ship exhibiting a wider range of spatial and temporal scales at full scale as the reynolds number is in the range of 108 109 pereira et al 2017 the specialist committee on scaling of wake field of 26th ittc ittc 2011a reviewed the existing scaling methods and the applicability of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for the prediction of full scale wake with the current advances in cfd techniques and increasing computational power available the numerical simulations of full scale wakes using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans is feasible and acceptable as an indirect method to gain insight into the flow physics extensive investigations on scale effect of ship wake have been carried out with full scale wakes simulated numerically and experimentally wang et al 2010 2015 castro et al 2011 kleinwachter et al 2017 jasak et al 2019 the viscous wake field and resistance prediction of a full scale kvlcc2m were carried out numerically by wang et al 2010 and their numerical strategy was proved applicable for other slow full ship types wang et al 2015 found that the reciprocal of mean axial wake fraction of propeller disc exhibits a near linear dependence on reynolds number in logarithmic scale for a single screw ship particle imaging velocimetry piv was used to determine a full scale wake flow for a better propeller design for the first time kleinwachter et al 2017 and the satisfying systematic deviations and low measurement inaccuracies confirmed that piv was a suitable measurement technique for full scale wake field investigations compared with the sea trial data of the general cargo carrier regal jasak et al 2019 demonstrated the possibility of using high fidelity numerical methods to calculate the full scale flow characteristics to complicate matters further the flow fields of the waterjet propelled ships consist of external and internal flow fields as parts of the flow enters the ducting channel of the waterjet with flush intake as concluded in the ittc reports ittc 2011b ingested boundary layer thickness was relatively thinner for full scale than that in model scale tests or simulations similar to the wake scale effect on propeller ships this phenomenon can be interpreted as the scale effect on the flow fields for waterjet propelled ships scale effect on the external flow fields makes a difference in the prediction of the momentum velocity coefficient which was crucial to evaluating the waterjet hull interaction gong et al 2019a on the other hand internal flow field of waterjet influences the ducting losses and pump characteristics e g cavitation vibration and propulsive performance but there is only few literature reporting on the scale effect on the internal flow fields in the waterjet hull system additionally a more thorough full scale investigation of the flow fields is helpful in verifying the dependence the stabilizer fin s influence on the geometrical scale with respect to the computations of waterjet propelled ships delaney et al 2009 performed rans computations to analyze the waterjet pump performance for two joint high speed sealift jhss hull forms with four waterjets both in model and full scale the comparison of the axial velocity distributions in the capture area station 1a see fig 1 showed a good agreement between the model scale flow fields and the laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurements they found that higher reynolds number full scale flow produced a significantly thinner boundary layer thickness at station 1a and the inlet efficiency increased from model to full scale the difference of the predicted delivered pump power between the full scale rans simulation and experimental results was negligible yang et al 2014 analyzed the fluctuating noise source of the full scale waterjet propelled trimaran using cfx solver eslamdoost et al 2014 developed a fast and robust potential flow method pressure jump method to replace the real impeller this method accurately predicted the inlet velocity ratio nozzle velocity ratio gross thrust and thrust deduction duerr and von ellenrieder 2015 simulated the internal flow features of the r v athena fitted with watetjet system in full scale the rans simulations were steady single phase and the ship was held in fixed sinkage and trim they concluded that the pump inflow at a new ship speed could be approximated by scaling the mean flow component of the wake by the relative change in pump flow rate gong et al 2017 measured the velocity distribution at the capture area of the waterjet using the particle image velocimetry piv technique in towing tank and they compared the main features of the wake and the boundary layer thickness between the piv measurements and rans simulations in their recent study gong et al 2019b a good correspondence was observed for the momentum energy velocity coefficients and it was demonstrated that the numerical model was reliable in simulating the flow fields in model scale based on the literature review though the wake scale effect on propeller ships have been extensively studied it has not been reported systematically on the external and internal flow fields of waterjet propelled ships also there is a dearth of study on the stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields of waterjet propelled ships and its scale dependence in the present study a four waterjet propelled ship with two sets of stabilizer fins is studied with considering the free surface effect the viscous flow fields of bare hull and self propulsion cases with and without stabilizer fins in model and full scales are solved numerically by rans methods model scale simulations are used to verify the grid generation and calculation method and verification and validation v v is carried out by comparing with the piv measured results in model test full scale calculations are presented and compared to analyze the scale effect on the external and internal flow fields a comparison of the flow fields between the inner waterjet iw and outer waterjet ow is also performed 2 numerical model 2 1 geometry a medium speed mono hull ship with two sets of controllable stabilizer fins is chosen for the numerical study the airfoil profile of the stabilizer fins changes gradually from top to bottom and the main parameter ranges are listed in table 1 four flush type waterjets are selected for the propulsion system and a deep v hull form with a transom stern was adopted in the ship design fig 2 the bare hull simulations are divided into two categories bh and bhf which denote the bare hull cases without and with stabilizer fins cases similarly sp and spf are used to denote the self propulsion cases without and with stabilizer fins respectively it should be noted that the stabilizer fins are fixed in the optimum anti rolling angle at current speed fr 0 4 in the present study model test has been carried out for a 6 67 m long 1 16 scale model of the ship in towing tank the main parameters of full scale geometry are presented in table 1 2 2 governing equations and turbulence model the governing equations for the turbulent flow around a waterjet hull system comprise the conservation of mass continuity equation and momentum rans for an incompressible newtonian fluid wang 2004 the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is selected for all model and full scale simulations as recommended in ittc 2011a the computations are carried out in double precision mode the governing equations and the transport equations of turbulence model are discretized using the finite volume method with a second order upwind scheme while pressure velocity coupling is facilitated through the simple algorithm the transient terms are discretized using a second order implicit time discretization numerical simulations are realized by using the unsteady rans flow solver star ccm 13 02 2 3 grid system and boundary conditions half of the ship hull is used for bare hull simulations to save computational resource and thus only two of the waterjets are included for self propulsion simulations with respect to the computational coordinate system a cartesian earth fixed coordinates o xyz are used and defined as follows fig 3 the original o is on the symmetry plane y 0 of the ship at the intersection of the keel line and midship section in the longitudinal direction the positive directions of the x y z axis are the direction from the bow to the stern mid ship to the port side and bottom of the ship to its deck respectively the dimensions of the computational domain along the three directions are 2 5l pp x 3 5l pp 0 0 y 1 8l pp and 2 0l pp z 1 0l pp the boundary conditions of the computational domain are set as follows a symmetry boundary condition of y 0 is adopted the inlet is the velocity inlet as well the top sides and bottom gong et al 2018 which simulate infinite far field boundary conditions the outlet is the pressure outlet the mid ship section is the symmetry plane and the hull stabilizer fins channels and nozzles are non slip surfaces the cartesian cut cell method is used to generate the unstructured computational grids with a boundary layer that consisted of a prism layer mesh and a trimmed mesh to avoid exaggerated numerical dissipations several refinement volumes are set in the computational domain three refinement volumes are used around the hull in a gradually manner with the isotropic sizes of 3 l pp 1 5 l pp and 0 75 l pp respectively another three refinement volumes are applied in the gas liquid interface areas with finer sizes 0 375 l pp 0 187 l pp and 0 094 l pp in the z direction to capture the free surface accurately the regions near the stern inlet duct nozzle and trailing flow are also refined a large number of cells are required to generate the grid inside the waterjet unit for self propulsion simulations ten prism layers are computed and meshed near the surfaces with a total thickness equals to the estimated turbulence boundary layer with a stretching ratio of 1 2 the number of prism layers are the same both in model and full scale simulations while the relative total thickness alters according to the theory of flat plate boundary layer white 1998 fig 4 shows the computational grids near the stern and inside the inner waterjet iw the mesh distribution and topology around the hull are kept in consistency in all bare hull and self propulsion simulations for full scale simulations it is worth noting that the grid topology generation size and distribution were kept exactly the same with the model scale but with a higher resolution of the hull boundary layer and free surface finally the model scale y is maintained in the range of 30 60 while the full scale y value is around 300 as employed in the previous studies castro et al 2011 wang et al 2015 2016 with wall functions used in the near wall surface additionally the hull roughness sand grain 0 05 mm is taken into account in full scale simulations schultz 2007 finally for model scale simulations the three grid system fine medium and coarse grids g1 g3 used for bare hull simulations bh and bhf which includes 2 5 m 14 4 m cells with a grid refinement ratio close to 1 4 with 3 3 m 18 0 m cells for self propulsion simulations sp and spf meanwhile it consists of 3 1 m 18 7 m cells in bare hull simulations and 3 8 m 20 7 m cells in self propulsion simulations in full scale 2 4 simulation design the multiphase air water three dimensional flows including free surface effects established to evaluate the influence of the stabilizer fins on the flow fields the volume of fluid vof model is utilized to capture the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 two virtual disk vd models are used to simulate the effect of the pump with the body force method in waterjet driven situations star ccm 2017 the tangential component of the body force is excluded to eliminate the swirling effect of the nozzle and thus forming the parallel jet stream the self propulsion points spp are achieved when the net thrust of waterjet was equal to the hull resistance in full scale simulations while an experimental extra towing force or rope force is considered and used as a correction of the frictional resistance components in model scale simulations eslamdoost et al 2014 detailed data reduction and analysis could be checked in ittc recommended procedures ittc 2011b it was argued in eslamdoost et al 2018 that the resistance increment of waterjet propelled ships was caused by a global effect sinkage and trim and a local effect waterjet unit similarly it is also applicable to the analysis of the dynamics caused by the stabilizer fins according to the results of resistance tests the differences of the measured dynamic sinkage and trim between bh and bhf cases are small therefore in this study the initial sinkage and trim of the hull are set and fixed to the measured values to compute the dynamic equilibrium position to study the local effect of stabilizer fins and thus excludes the influence of global effect also as adopted in the model test we assume that the scale effect on the dynamic sinkage and trim is negligible between model and full scale ships we select a froude number fr of 0 4 as the target working condition which corresponds to the cruising speed 24 kn of the full scale ship the reynolds numbers re equals to 1 9 107 for the model scale cases and 1 2 109 for the full scale cases the courant friedrichs levy number satisfies cfl 1 the following criteria are used to determine whether a simulation has converged pressure equation convergence is reached when the residual imbalance of the poisson equation dropped by six orders of magnitude and all other variables are assumed converged when the residuals dropped to 10 5 and additional iterations produce no visible change for the resistance coefficients and flow fields 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis of numerical results in order to investigate the

well as the axial velocity distribution at station 1a were carried out station 1a locates one inlet diameter upstream from the waterjet inlet tangency point the experimental data was collected in the model test in towing tank including piv test gong et al 2019b and three grid systems were adopted for all four categories of numerical models richardson extrapolation xing and stern 2010 was employed in the verification and validation v v process of the viscous flow fields the definitions and proceeding procedures of the grid convergence ratio r g distance metric to the asymptotic range p g numerical simulation uncertainty u sn validation uncertainty u v and comparison error e were stated in the previous work takai et al 2011 meanwhile a detailed procedure to deal with the v v of flow fields based on the l2 norm was described in gong et al 2019b the uncertainty parameters were listed in subsequent table 3 table 4 and table 5 in these tables d denotes experimental data and s denotes the simulation value respectively as observed in the comparison of numerical cfd in table 2 and experimental efd in table 2 results the numerical simulations underestimated the total resistance coefficients for bhf and bh cases in model scale g1 g3 denote the fine medium and coarse grids respectively the relative errors of c tm were within 3 for all grid systems and the added resistance coefficient of the stabilizer fins were close to 0 25 10 3 for fr 0 4 as shown in table 3 the grid convergence ratios r g all exhibited monotonic convergence as they were less than one and solutions of bhf and bh were validated at the level of 4 23 and 4 98 as the error e was within u v the non dimensional axial velocity v x v 0 was analyzed in bhf simulations both in model and full scale velocity data were derived from the velocity contours at station 1a and five positions along the horizontal direction were selected which corresponded to y l pp 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 respectively as showed in tables 4 and 5 the monotonic convergence for bhf grids both in model and full scale simulations were also achieved as r g were less than one at five stations table 4 revealed that e u v was satisfied in five stations for the averaged values based on the l2 norm which validated the wake fields in model scale simulations bhf ms the validation process of full scale cases bhf fs cannot be completed due to the absence of experimental data relatively larger uncertainties were observed for full scale simulations in table 5 implying that the full scale cases were more sensitive to the grid resolution however all solutions showed good convergence behaviour r g 1 and the accuracy of the flow fields were guaranteed in summary the uncertainty analysis of the resistance coefficients and velocity distributions denoted an acceptable reliability and accuracy of present grid arrangement and numerical methods 3 2 analysis of bare hull simulations the waterjets were not presented here and the inlet ducts were covered in the simulations of bare hull cases to verify the influence of stabilizer fins in the wake the vortex structures around the hull was reconstructed based on q criterion wu 2013 in fig 5 also the axial velocity v x and turbulence kinetic energy tke in station 1a were analyzed at model and full scale reynolds numbers the variables were presented in non dimensional form the y and z locations were non dimensionalized based on hull length l pp the axial velocity v x using ship speed v 0 and tke using v 0 2 the full scale results were mirrored to form a direct comparison between model and full scale flow fields in the following figs 5 and 7 two groups of tip vortices induced by the forward and afterward stabilizer fins were clearly observed in bhf cases as showed in fig 5 the affected area of stabilizer fins was extended to the capture area in the waterjet hull system resulted in the obvious change of the mean velocity distributions at station 1a fig 6 to be more specific the forward fins caused the velocity variation near y l pp 0 032 dashed circle a fig 6 b and the afterward fins contributed to the low speed near the bilge dashed circle b fig 6 b consistent flow disturbance of stabilizer fins were observed for both model and full scale simulations due to the scale effect of the external flow fields the total boundary layer thickness of model scale simulations was slightly thicker than that in the full scale simulations see fig 6 which was consistent with the summary of ittc reports ittc 2011b the total thickness difference is even clearer in bhf cases as showed in fig 7 the axial velocity increased fast with a larger gradient in the full scale wake both in cases with and without the stabilizer fins the turbulence characteristic in station 1a was further discussed using turbulence kinetic energy tke the difference of tke distributions between model and full scale reynolds number in bh cases was not so apparent fig 8 a however what stood out in fig 8 b was that higher tke values were located in the affected areas of stabilizer fins in bhf cases which was related to the stronger turbulence fluctuations in a word though the local effect of the waterjets were not considered in bare hull condition the forward and afterward stabilizer fins affected the axial velocity distributions and turbulence characteristic at station 1a the boundary layer distribution law was altered due to the flow disturbance around the hull and the scale effect of the flow fields was prominent both in bh and bhf simulations 3 3 analysis of self propulsion simulations the ingested flow characteristics determines the inflow conditions of the waterjet pump which affected the propulsive efficiency cavitation and radiation noise performance of the waterjet also the free surface effect should be concerned as it influences the outflow features from the nozzle and alters the wake as observed in fig 9 the accelerated flow injected into the air and then interacted with the transom wake strong interference happened between the jet streams and the tailing flow compared to the model test results fig 9 c the numerical free surface morphology in model and full scale reflected the travelling process of the jet in the air but it was difficult to capture the jet diffusion and splash due to the limitation of grid resolutions as the entire flow fields were solved in rans calculations streamlines were tracked upstream from the waterjet pumps to produce the realistic geometric shape of the capture areas fig 10 showed ingested flow streamlines for the self propulsion simulations with and without the stabilizer fins spf and sp in model scale from a bottom view the stabilizer fins disturbed the boundary layer distribution near the hull and the flow characteristics were changed in the subsequent wake the main difference of the streamlines concentrated on the ingested flow of outer waterjet ow while it can be neglected for the inner waterjet iw as the flow pattern was nearly the same for the spf and sp simulations the ingested flow of ow contained part of the swirling flow induced by the stabilizer fins and thus there were several streamlines distributed near the fin tips see fig 10 b c the flow was getting closer to the hull and the streamtube height decreased when approaching the ship stern the width of the ingested flow at station 1a for ow was smaller in spf than that in sp w 2 w 2 while no obvious difference was observed for iw w 1 w 1 additionally it should be noted that the ingested flow was slightly off center from the central axis outboard for ow the capture areas at station 1a represented the portion of the upstream flow that was ingested into each of the waterjets fig 11 compared the geometric shapes between sp and spf model scale simulations the geometric shapes of capture areas were confirmed by intersecting the back tracked streamlines and the station 1a plane and represented as the dotted lines which enveloped all the crosspoints it was seen that the capture areas of iw were close to the same semi ellipse both in sp and spf cases while it became narrower and taller for ow in spf case the normalized mean axial velocity v x v 0 distribution in capture areas of the self propulsion simulations was illustrated in fig 12 the momentum velocity coefficient c m was defined to quantitatively describe the influence of the hull on the ingested flow as follows 1 c m 1 v 0 a 1 v x 2 d a a 1 v x d a where a1 is the capture area in accordance with the bare hull simulations the disturbance of the stabilizer fins caused a relatively thicker boundary layer thickness at station 1a in all the self propulsion simulations it denoted stronger negative effect of the stabilizer fins on the waterjet propulsive performance as smaller c m values were observed in table 6 on the other hand as seen in fig 12 the ingested flow consisted of more high velocity components in high reynolds number full scale simulations and thus obtained larger c m values which meant the model scale computations underestimated the momentum velocity coefficients in station 1a station 3 was defined as the outlet of the duct which was also the inflow plane of the pump the normalized mean axial velocity distributions v x v 0 at station 3 for the sp and spf cases were compared in fig 13 in conjunction with the flow characteristics of station 1a more significant flow differences existed in the inflow plane of ow than iw between sp and spf cases a symmetric distribution was observed for iw fig 13 a b while an asymmetric law for ow fig 13 c d as pointed out before the asymmetric distributions were related to the locations of capture areas which were leaning to the outboard of the ship more high speed regions e g v x v 0 0 8 existed in the lower half disk which were related to the high speed ingested flow distributed in the lower capture area in spf cases we compared the detailed values in three radii corresponding to r r 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 in fig 14 r denotes the radius of the inflow plane in general the velocity distribution in the lower half disk 270 θ 360 and 0 θ 90 is obviously greater than that of the upper half disk 90 θ 270 and this internal flow features were reported in previous studies delaney et al 2009 duerr and ellenrieder 2015 the averaged differences for iw were 0 45 0 31 and 1 13 pertaining to the three radii while they reached 6 04 3 05 and 1 01 for ow respectively the turbulent inflow field affected the normal operation of the waterjet pump and also caused unsteady vibration and noise in the pump here the non uniformity coefficient ξ is defined to evaluate the axial velocity uniformity of the pump inflow smaller ξ means higher uniformity of the velocity fields the definition of non uniformity coefficient is as follows 2 ξ 1 q a 3 v x v x d a where q denotes the flow rate and a3 denotes the area of the pump inflow plane what is clear from table 6 is the non uniformity of outer waterjet was apparently higher than that of inner waterjet for both model and full scale simulations the non uniformity increased by 0 3 and 0 4 when considering the stabilizer fin s influence in the model and full scale simulations respectively compared to the model scale results the flow field non uniformity in full scale simulations was larger with was related to the stronger turbulence in higher reynolds number the duct efficiency η d is another important factor to consider which influences the overall efficiency of the waterjet it is a physical quantity that measures the degree of energy utilization of the inlet duct to the incoming flow and defined as the ratio of the total energy of the duct outlet station 3 to the total energy of the inflow plane station 1a specific definitions are as follows 3 η d e 3 e 1 a 4 e 1 2 ρ v x 2 a v x v 0 2 c p v x d a 5 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ v x 2 where e 3 and e 1a denote the total energy at station 3 and station 1a and p and p 0 denote the pressure and relative pressure respectively in general the calculated pump efficiency of model scale simulations was slightly larger 0 6 0 75 than that in the full scale simulations see table 6 the duct efficiency differences of iw and ow were negligible 0 2 both in the model and full scale sp simulations the smooth design of the duct enabled the duct efficiency to reach or exceed 90 without the stabilizer fins in conjunction with the external and internal flow field distributions η d values of ow in spf cases had an obvious decrease 1 26 in model scale and 1 44 in full scale due to the influence of the stabilizer fins 4 conclusion in this paper the viscous flow fields of a four waterjet propelled ship were studied numerically by rans methods the evaluation of stabilizer fin s influence on the flow fields and the flow disturbance characteristics were carried out at model and full scale reynolds numbers the scale effect of the flow fields whether considering the influence of the stabilizer fins or not were analyzed both for the bare hull and self propulsion simulations solutions of the resistance coefficients were validated at the uncertainty level of 5 and the flow field uncertainty at station 1a was within 20 for model scale simulations relatively larger numerical uncertainties were observed in the full scale simulations but all solutions showed good convergence behaviour and guaranteed the reliability of present grid arrangement and numerical methods two tip vortices induced by the stabilizer fins were observed both in the model and full scale simulations they convected downstream to the station 1a and altered the ingested flow of outer waterjet ow the capture area of ow was narrower and taller than that of iw and the axial velocity differences in the capture area and pump inflow plane resulted in a higher non uniformity coefficient and lower duct efficiency simultaneously with respect to the scale effect of the flow fields in the waterjet propulsion the turbulent boundary layer thickness was thinner in full scale simulations and the model scale simulation underestimated the momentum velocity coefficient c m by 1 1 5 additionally model scale simulations obtained lower non uniformity of the internal flow and overestimated the duct efficiency by 0 6 0 75 the over predicted values were larger for ow in the simulations with the stabilizer fins above conclusions have certain reference value for the correction of crucial parameters in the hydrodynamic performance prediction of full scale ships with waterjet propulsion also it illustrates that the dynamics of stabilizer fins on propulsion performance should be considered and minimized though the anti rolling performance is a primary consideration

21054,the load of cavitation collapse is one of the main input loads to the structure subjected to underwater explosion the cavitation effects near different boundaries are of particular importance in understanding the load mechanisms and designing the protective structures in present study a numerical model that couples a runge kutta discontinuous galerkin method a finite element method and an isentropic one fluid cavitation model is developed to study the cavitation effects induced by underwater explosion near different boundaries the boundaries of a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are investigated in detail after validating the coupled numerical model by a case of 1d cavitating flow in an open tube an experiment of a water backed plate subjected to water blast and an experiment of underwater explosion near a circular plate the evolutions of the cavitation region the pressure profile near the structure and the responses of the structure are comprehensively discussed the results are beneficial for guiding the design of the protective structures keywords fluid structure interaction underwater explosion cavitation shock wave 1 introduction the damage effects such as the shell rupture the equipment failure and casualties induced by underwater explosion is one of the main threats to the modern naval vessels it attracts more and more attention from researchers and naval industries to reveal the underwater load mechanism and prevent or mitigate the damage effects to improve the survivability of the warships sommerfeld and müller 1988 apazidis 2016 eliasson and chavez 2020 ghoshal and mitra 2016 2020 avachat and zhou 2017 espinosa et al 2019 plastering shock mitigation coatings which is a kind of sandwich structures with the energy absorbing cores made of cellular or composite materials onto the wet face of the ship hull is one of the effective protective approaches to reduce the load transmitted to the whole ships from the source protecting the ship shell the equipment and the crew yin et al 2020 chen et al 2009 abrate 2018 the loads to the structures include the main shock wave the cavitation collapse the bubble pulse and jet when the shock mitigation coatings with relatively low impedances are inserted between the steel and water with relatively high impedances the load will be dramatically changed by the fluid structure interactions especially for the load of the cavitation collapse therefore the investigations on the effects of the shock mitigation coatings on the input load due to fluid structure interactions are of great importance to reveal the protective mechanisms the studies on the interactions between the underwater blast induced cavitation and different boundaries have been performed for decades kennard 1943 bleich and sandler 1970 schiffer et al 2012 jin et al 2015 mcmeeking et al 2008 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 kennard 1943 described theoretically the cavitation in a bilinear elastic liquid he found that when the pressure drops below the cavitation limit cavitation initiates and the boundary of the cavitated region either advances as a breaking front moving with supersonic velocity or remains stationary as a free surface or recedes toward the cavitated region as a closing front moving with subsonic velocity based on the bilinear elastic liquid model the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between the water blast and a rigid plate floating at the surface bleich and sandler 1970 a rigid plate supported by a linear spring schiffer et al 2012 a thick elastic plate jin et al 2015 or a sandwich structure mcmeeking et al 2008 yin et al 2016 were analytically investigated in one dimensional in detail experimental studies were also performed in a transparent underwater shock simulator to validate the model schiffer and tagarielli 2012 the initiation growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles are highly dependent on the response of the structures generally the cavitation initiates at a finite distance from the wet face of the structures and expands towards two opposite directions the cavitated fluid adjacent to the wet face will generate a reconstitution wave closing front and radiate pressure wave to load the structure again if the cavitation front could not propagate towards the wet face anymore for multi dimensional complex shock wave induced cavitation numerical simulations with high resolutions should be considered typical cavitation model includes the one fluid cavitation model and the two fluid cavitation model the two fluid model assumes that the gas phase and the liquid phase coexist in the fluid domain and are controlled by its own set of differential equations therefore the number of partial differential equations to be solved is doubled in contrast to the single phase flow saurel and lemetayer 2001 this approach is extensively applied to the simulations of the compressible multi medium flows goncalves and charrière 2014 kapila et al 2001 saurel et al 2009 yeom 2015 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 since this approach explicitly deals with the exchange of the mass the momentum and the energy as transfer terms the two fluid cavitation model can relatively easily consider the physical details at the cavitating interface such as mass energy exchange thermal transfer and surface tension however some quantities such as exchange rates and the viscous friction between the two phases have to be known a priori senocak and shyy 2002 such quantities are usually very difficult to be obtained whether experimentally or otherwise on the contrary the one fluid model assumes that the mixture of two fluids behaves as one the main focus of the model is the simulation of the macroscopic dynamic behavior of the cavitating flow therefore similar to the single phase flow only one set of differential equations is needed to solve the fluid domain the most difficult part of this approach is to define a proper equation of state for the mixture to close the system ventikos and tzabiras 2000 schmidt et al 1999 which is usually supposed to be homogeneous and barotropic since the flow parameters obtained are in an averaged sense it is difficult for the one fluid model to determine the detailed physics quantities related to phase transition however it has an advantage of dealing with the dynamic creation and collapse of cavitation the most commonly used model for the cavitating flow in underwater explosion is the cut off model due to its simple and convenient implementation the cut off model is extensively applied in different fluid numerical solvers such as the cavitating acoustic finite element method felippa and deruntz 1984 and the cavitating acoustic spectral element method sprague and geers 2003 xiao et al 2017 which are based on solving the acoustic fluid equations as well as the finite difference method the finite volume method the finite element method and the discontinuous galerkin method which are based on solving the eulerian equations hsiao and chahine 2015 hu et al 2013 jin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however there are physical and mathematical flaws implementing the cut off model the hyperbolic property of the governing equations cannot be maintained and the acoustic speed in the cavitation region is zero therefore the cavitation region and the collapsing pressure are difficult to be predicted accurately when the cut off model is used in order to improve the performance of the prediction plenty of researchers investigate the modeling and application of the different equations of state of one fluid model the typical models include the vacuum model the schmidt model schmidt et al 1999 the modified schmidt model xie et al 2006 pishevar and amirifar 2010 and the isentropic one fluid model liu et al 2004 ge et al 2020 zhu et al 2012 et al for the two fluid model based on the different assumptions made on the local thermodynamic equilibrium and the slip condition between phases the 7 equation model can be reduced to 4 equation model goncalves and charrière 2014 5 equation model kapila et al 2001 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 and 6 equation model saurel et al 2009 yeom 2015 extensive studies on the cavitation induced by underwater explosion are performed by researchers however the comprehensive studies on the blast induced cavitation effects near different boundaries are still limited in present study a numerical approach which combines a compressible fluid code with an isentropic one fluid model and a finite element structure code is established in section 2 after validating the numerical scheme in section 3 a few cases which consists of an explosion bubble water and various boundaries including a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are used to study the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between underwater blast and the boundaries in section 4 the evolutions of the cavitation region the pressure profile near the structure and the responses of the structure are discussed in detail the results are beneficial for guiding the design of the protection structures finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 the numerical approach to study the cavitation effects due to the interaction between underwater blast and various boundaries an eulerian compressible fluid model and a lagrangian structure model are established the eulerian compressible fluid model is used to consider the shock wave the cavitation and the explosion bubble the lagrangian structure model is used to consider the motion and deformation of different structures including rigid structures steel plates rubber coated plates and foam coated plates 2 1 eulerian

rkdg method cockburn and shu 1998 with the flux term replaced by the hll flux toro 2009 and the generalized slope limiter of van leer van leer 1974 carried out in the local characteristic directions is employed over a fixed rectangular mesh to discretize the eulerian system eq 1 for the lagrangian structures after the structures are meshed by elements eq 9 are solved using a lagrangian finite element fe method which is based upon the implementation of an explicit integration rule together with the use of lumped element mass matrices abaqus explicit 2012 a modified ghost fluid method liu et al 2003 based numerical technique is used to treat the gas water interface and water structure interface which consists of two main steps 1 capture the moving interface 2 predict and extrapolate the interface status the level set technique osher and sethian 1988 is employed to capture the moving interfaces the interface status is predicted by defining and solving the multi medium riemann problems the convection equation is used to extrapolate the interface status the fluid and structure are coupled at every time step with the time step size being the minimum of the stable time for the fluid and solid calculations the work by jin et al 2017 presents more details on the spatial and temporal discretization of eulerian fluid equations and lagrangian structural equations as well as corresponding interface treatments 3 validations of the numerical approach 3 1 1d cavitating flow in an open tube in this case the 1d cavitating flow in an open tube is simulated liu et al 2004 this is a riemann problem of two water streams moving in the opposite direction with the same initial velocity magnitude of 100 m s from the center of a tube when this flow starts the pressure at the center of tube reduces rapidly to the saturated pressure the cavitation occurs and the flow becomes two phases due to phase change the initial pressure of the two water streams is set to be 1 105 pa the computational domain is 0 1 m which is discretized by 400 uniform meshes the two streams initially meet at x 0 5 m the profiles of density velocity and pressure at t 0 2 ms resolved by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model and analytical method are presented in fig 1 for comparison the analytical results can be obtained by solving a riemann problem of double rarefaction waves connected to a vacuum at the center toro 2009 the initial value riemann problem should give rise to two rarefactions moving to the left and right respectively the cavitation occurs at the center it is observed that the calculations by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model and analytical results are in good agreement the flow structures are well captured by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model 3 2 a water backed plate subjected to water blast in this case a water backed plate subjected to water blast is simulated the cavitation appears in front of the plate after the shock wave impacts the plate the cavitation evolutions are compared with the experimental results conducted by schiffer and tagarielli 2012 using a transparent shock tube the density and the measured wave speed of the water are 1000 kg m3 and 1053 m s respectively the case is assumed to be one dimensional the computational domain is 4 m 2 m with the plate located at the origin of coordinates the mesh size is 0 5 mm the mass per unit area of the plate is 111 1 kg m2 the water blast is an exponential decaying wave with a peak pressure of 15 1 mpa and a decay constant of 0 096 ms the comparisons of the cavitation evolutions between calculations by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model and experimental results are given in fig 2 it is observed that the calculations of both the breaking front and the closing front cavitation collapse by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model are in good agreement with the experimental results the small error may come from the observation error and the insufficient assumption of the plane wave 3 3 underwater explosion near a circular plate in this case underwater explosion near a circular plate is simulated the results are compared with the experimental results by slater and rude 2000 the underwater explosion tests are conducted on medium scale flat plate targets in a pond the circular plates are made of a516 mild steel with a diameter of 3 m and a thickness of 13 mm a steel drum with a thickness of 25 mm a diameter of 1 m and a depth of 30 5 cm is welded to the plate to provide a central air backed boundary condition the plates is positioned on the bottom of the pond and supported on a steel plate concrete backed foundation and secured in place by four adjustable turnbuckles 250 g c4 explosive is exploded at a distance of 0 91 m 1r m r m is the theoretical maximum bubble radius or 1 37 m 1 5r m above the plate at 5 49 m depth fig 3 a shows a basic set up in the experiment for more details refer to the paper by slater and rude 2000 fig 3 b presents the computational model of the case the model is assumed axisymmetric the computational domains of the fluid part are 0 1 5 m 0 2 m 2 3 m which are divided into 300 500 mesh cells for the standoff distance of 1 0r m and 0 1 5 m 0 2 m 2 8 m which are divided into 300 600 mesh cells for the standoff distance of 1 5r m respectively in accordance with the experimental results comparisons for the pressure histories and the structural responses are conducted for the standoff distance of 1 0r m and 1 5r m respectively the initial state of underwater explosion simulations is usually defined at the moment when a high pressure gas bubble is formed after the completion of the detonation process the initial gas bubble has the same volume and internal energy as the original explosive in water the explosive gas is modeled by the jwl eos with c4 parameters dobratz 1972 ρ 0g 1600 kg m3 a g 573 19 109 pa b g 14 639 109 pa r 1 4 6 r 2 1 4 ω 0 32 e 0g 8 6 109 j m3 the initial pressure density and radius of the explosion bubble are 1 09 1010 pa 1600 kg m3 and 33 4 mm respectively the initial pressure or static pressure p st of the water is set to be 1 5 105 pa the non reflecting boundary condition is applied to the fluid boundaries to increase the efficiency and accuracy the present code uses a spherical symmetry code with very fine meshes to calculate the fluid response before the shock wave arrives at the structure after that the fluid responses are mapped to the axial symmetry code which includes both the structure and the fluid using this strategy will significantly increase the size of the bubble when the axial symmetry code works and improve the accuracy and efficiency otherwise directly calculations in the axial symmetry code will have to increase the mesh density around the bubble dramatically since the initial size of the bubble is very small the radius r p and the thickness h p of the plates is set to be 1 5 m and 13 mm respectively the plate is separated into an air backed part and a water backed part by a fixed point which is located at r r f 0 5 m the plate is meshed using 150 uniform 2 node linear axisymmetric thin or thick shell type sax1 elements abaqus explicit 2012 the steel has a density of 7800 kg m a poisson ratio of 0 3 an elastic modulus of 210 gpa a yield stress of 260 mpa and a tangent modulus of

the material constants with c 40 s 1 and p 5 a constant pressure load which is equal to the atmosphere pressure p atm 1 0 105 pa is applied to the part of the back face of the plate within the radius of the drum to simulate the air backed boundary condition while the water backed boundary condition is applied to the rest of the back face of the plate since the fluid pressure behind the plate is much lower the fluid is assumed to be an acoustic medium ghoshal and mitra 2012 the pressure load for this part varies as a function of the velocity v s r p at a position r r p the pressure boundary

m the cavitation region is marked in blue the process of the formation evolution and collapse of the local cavitation can be observed in the figures it should be noted that the cavitation near the explosion bubble is due to the numerical dissipations which have limited effects on the cavitation near the structures the main shock wave impacts on the various plates and reflects t 0 16 ms in figs 9 12 the reflected pressure wave is a shock wave for the case of the rigid plate and the steel plate since the impedance of the rubber is close to that of the water and the impedance of the foam is far less than that of the water the reflected pressure wave is not prominent for the case of the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with the air backed condition a rarefaction wave is generated due to the deformation and the motion of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate cavitation occurs behind the reflected wave front since the finite radius of the plate the shock wave diffracts around the drum t 0 20 ms in figs 9 12 a low pressure region cavitation appears at the surface of the rigid plate t 0 24 ms in fig 9 the shape of the cavitation region is changed by the interaction between the diffracted wave and the cavitation region for the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate in figs 10 12 as shown in fig 9 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave the cavitation expands towards the plate center and the direction away from the structure t 0 28 ms t 0 32 ms a large cavitation region is formed at t 0 48 ms after t 0 64 ms the whole cavitation region splits into a cavitation region near the structure and a cavitation region away from the structure the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses from the sides to the center of the plate t 0 72 ms t 0 88 ms t 0 104 ms at t 1 07 ms the cavitation near the structure collapses completely inducing a shock wave with a peak pressure more than 30 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around the cavitation occurs behind the wave front the induced cavitation region at t 1 28 ms is similar to the previous one at t 0 48 ms the cavitation will collapse and generate for several times as before which can be seen in the figure of the wet face pressure in section 4 3 during the calculations the explosion bubble gradually expands pushing the water away from the bubble as shown in fig 10 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure t 0 32 ms t 0 4 ms the cavitation region splits into a cavitation region near the structure and a cavitation region away from the structure t 0 48 ms the cavitation region near the structure gradually collapses from all around to the center of the plate t 0 56 ms t 0 64 ms t 0 88 ms t 1 04 ms at t 1 12 ms the cavitation collapses completely radiating shock wave which cavitates the water again the cavitation expands behind the wave front t 1 16 ms t 1 2 ms t 1 28 ms since the motion of the plate the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses generating a pressure layer the size of the pressure layer increases at t 1 6 ms and t 2 0 ms the cavitation near the structure disappears a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure as shown in fig 11 as the propagation of the reflected wave and diffracted wave cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure t 0 24 ms t 0 32 ms a pressure layer is generated at the wet face separating the cavitation region and the structure at t 0 336 ms cavitation appears at the center of the plate again and spreads to all around the cavitation region away from the structure collapses gradually t 0 36 ms at t 0 40 ms the part of cavitation near the center of the structure collapses at t 0 48 ms the cavitation away from the structure collapses completely radiating a shock wave with a peak pressure more than 3 mpa when the shock wave converges at the center and reflects the cavitation appears behind the wave front expanding the cavitation region near the structure t 0 56 ms t 0 64 ms after that the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses t 0 72 ms t 0 96 ms at t 1 08 ms the cavitation almost collapses completely and the pressure near the collapse center reaches 10 mpa at t 1 12 ms the shock wave induced by the cavitation collapse propagates to all around a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure t 1 2 ms as shown in fig 12 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave the cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure a pressure layer is generated at the wet face separating the cavitation region and the structure t 0 24 ms the width of the pressure layer increases and the cavitation expands to maximum size and collapses gradually t 0 28 ms t 0 32 ms t 0 4 ms t 0 52 ms at t 0 56 ms the cavitation near the center collapses at t 0 64 ms the cavitation collapses completely at a position away from the structure and a high pressure load is generated which reaches 10 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around t 0 68 ms similar the case of the rigid plate due to the diffraction of the shock wave cavitation appears again at t 0 72 ms the shock wave converges at the center and reflects cavitation appears behind the wave front t 0 8 ms after that the cavitation collapses gradually t 0 96 ms t 1 2 ms a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure t 1 6 ms 4 3 wet face pressure histories of various boundaries fig 13 shows the calculations of wet face pressure histories by the rkdg fe isencav at a position r d 0 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm where r d measures the distance between the monitoring point and the center of the plate for the case of the rigid plate the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m the shock wave reaches the center of the plates interacts with the plates and reflects during the spreading of the reflected wave the peak pressure presents a decaying trend as shown in fig 13 a cavitation collapses at the center of the plate at t 1 08 ms the peak of collapse pressure reaches up to 20 3 mpa since the local feature of the load of the cavitation collapse the amount of the energy release is small during the spreading the load of the cavitation collapse decays dramatically the process can also be seen in fig 9 at r d 50 mm a pressure wave with a peak pressure of 3 9 mpa appears in the pressure profile however the load at r d 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm is insignificant after that the load due to the cavitation collapse appears periodically with the load intensity decreasing the process has been illustrated in fig 9 since the air backed condition the wet face pressure exhibits a sudden decrease for the case of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate as shown in fig 13 b at t 0 49 ms a pressure increase appears at the center of the plate however with the local characteristics the collapse pressure wave presents a rapid decay during its spreading to all around the pressure increase at r d 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm is insignificant after t 0 94 ms the pressure increases gradually due to the cavitation collapse near the center at t 1 08 ms the pressure reaches up to 6 8 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around and cavitates the center of the plate again after t 1 2 ms a continuous pressure loading can be observed in the pressure profile as shown in fig 13 c and d the radiated pressure induced by the cavitation collapse appears at the center of the plate with a relatively low peak pressure and a relatively flat pressure profile at t 0 15 ms and at t 0 13 ms respectively the cavitation continues appearing and collapsing a long term load of the cavitation collapse with a flat pressure profile appears in fig 13 c t 1 06 ms 2 39 ms and fig 13 d t 1 26 ms 3 19 ms the peak pressure for this cavitation collapse are 11 mpa and 1 2 mpa for the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate respectively 4 4 responses of the structures for different boundaries fig 14 presents the pressure velocity and displacement histories of the center of the steel plate for the case of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m the pressure velocity and displacement histories are put in the same figure to reveal the cause of the load of the cavitation collapse as shown in fig 14 a when the main shock wave reaches the steel plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 12 8 m s since the reaction force provided by the clamped boundary of the plate the velocity of the plate center presents highly oscillatory profile at t 0 48 ms the velocity of the plate center changes and the cavitation collapses at the plate center after t 0 67 ms the velocity of the whole plate is nearly harmonized and the displacement of the plate center increases gradually at t 0 93 ms the collapse of the local cavitation gives rise to the change of the velocity of the plate center although the oscillation of the velocity of the plate appears again after t 0 93 ms 2 5 ms the whole velocity profile presents a descending trend with a small amplitude of the oscillation at t 1 2 ms cavitation collapses at the center of the plate again generating a local high pressure the resilience force is the dominant factor during this stage the velocity of the plate decreases continuously during t 1 2 ms 2 57 ms the load of the cavitation collapse presents a long term pressure profile at the wet face the displacement of the plate achieves its maximum of 12 0 mm at t 1 75 ms and decreases gradually afterwards the displacement rises again due to the vibration of the plate after t 3 4 ms as presented in fig 14 b when the main shock wave reaches the rubber coated plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 14 0 m s during t 0 12 ms t 0 33 ms the velocity of the structure decreases with the formation of the load of the cavitation collapse during t 0 33 ms t 0 60 ms the cavitation occurs at the wet face again and oscillations appear in the velocity profile during t 0 60 ms t 0 73 ms the velocity decreases from 19 2 m s with the load of the cavitation collapse rebuilding at the wet face after t 0 73 ms the velocity rebounds to 25 6 m s and decreases gradually after that a long term pressure load due to the cavitation collapse appears in the pressure profile with an oscillating velocity of the structure the center of the plate achieves its maximum displacement of 13 6 mm at t 1 79 ms and bounces back gradually afterwards after t 3 50 ms the displacement increases again as given in fig 14 c when the main shock wave reaches the foam coated plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 25 9 m s subsequently the velocity decreases to about 7 5 m s and oscillates around this velocity the wet face pressure oscillates around 0 8 mpa which is close to the stress plateau of the foam 0 68 mpa during the oscillation t 0 75 ms t 1 15 ms the fluid near the wet face may cavitate due to the abrupt velocity increase during t 1 33 ms t 3 2 ms since the effects of the resilience force of the structure the velocity begins to decrease with the load at the wet face sustained after t 3 2 ms the velocity increases and oscillates due to the elastic effects of the foam the center of the plate achieves its maximum displacement of 21 0 mm at t 2 1 ms and bounces back gradually afterwards after the impact of the main shock wave the core compression increases during t 0 24 ms t 1 25 ms the core compression changes little the structure primarily remains the bulk motion the process leads to the compatibility of deformation of the whole structure after t 1 00 ms the remained energy compresses the foam the core compression increases and achieves its maximum of 12 5 mm at t 2 5 ms fig 15 presents the calculated equivalent plastic strain peeq contours of the foam at t 4 ms to further illustrate the damage range of the foam the damage is mainly concentrated in the center of the foam the part of the foam near the water suffers more severe damage than the part of the foam near the plate the comparisons of the velocity and displacement responses of the center of the steel plate among the bare plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m are shown in fig 16 since the shock wave speeds in the rubber and foam are less than that in the water the velocity and the displacement for the bare plate begin to rise earliest followed by the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate as shown in fig 16 a the velocity of the steel plate presents an increase stage a harmonized stage and a decrease stage during the increase stage the velocity increases rapidly the velocity for the case of the bare plate increases with the highest rate followed by the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate during the harmonized stage the velocity of the plate center adjusts itself to the whole plate the velocity for the case of the bare plate has the severest oscillations during the decrease stage the velocity decreases gradually with small oscillations as shown in fig 16 b the maximum displacement are 13 0 mm for the coated plate 11 9 mm for the bare plate and 9 7 mm for the foam coated plate since the foam decreases the impulse transmitted to the steel plate and absorbs the energy of the load the maximum displacement is the smallest for the foam coated plate the rubber stores the energy primarily by the elastic way although the load of the main shock wave can be reduced the rubber coated plate can induce more significant cavitation load than the bare plate therefore the maximum displacements for the case of the bare plate and the rubber coated plate have little difference 5 conclusions the cavitation effects induced by the interaction between underwater blast and various boundaries are studied by a coupled numerical model rkdg fe isencav where the rkdg is used to solve the eulerian fluid equations the fe is used to solve lagrangian structural equations and the cavitation is modeled by an isentropic one fluid cavitation model the coupled numerical model is validated by a case of 1d cavitating flow in an open tube an experiment of a water backed plate subjected to water blast and an experiment of underwater explosion near a circular plate the cavitation effects near a boundary of a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are investigated in detail the following conclusions can be obtained 1 since the diffraction effects of the shock wave near a finite length boundary the banded cavitation region is generated in the early stage a pressure layer separating the structure and the cavitation region is usually formed for the case of the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate while the attached cavitation is easier to occur for the case of the rigid plate and the steel plate in the early stage of the impact 2 the characteristics of the cavitation pressure profiles if the curve presents a relatively slow rising trend the collapse center of the cavitation usually locates around the center of the plate and the shock wave converges gradually at the axis of the symmetry if the curve presents a sharp rise and fall the cavitation collapses at the center of the plate if the curve presents a long term pressure load it is usually the cavitation collapse load due to the deceleration of the plate 3 the characteristics of the velocity profiles of the plate the velocity increases rapidly after the shock wave impact on the plate followed by the transient oscillation trend decrease trend and vibration trend during the transient oscillation the short term local cavitation collapse with high pressure loads may occur during the decrease trend the long term load presents at the wet face 4 the cavitation load generated during the bounce back stage of the structure is similar to stress plateau the magnitude of the cavitation collapse load is close to the stress plateau of the foam the maximum displacement is the smallest for the foam coated plate since the foam decreases the impulse transmitted to the steel plate and absorbs the energy of the load although the load of the main shock wave can be reduced the rubber coated plate can induce more significant cavitation load than the bare plate therefore the maximum displacements for the case of the bare plate and rubber coated plate have little difference these observations obtained by numerical simulations may be beneficial in understanding the mechanism of the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between the underwater blast and various boundaries and have potentials in improving the design of the protection structures against underwater blast loads however the present investigations are quite general a more detailed study for the potential protection structures i e foam coated plates such as influences of standoff distances core strengths and length scales on the effects of the cavitation may be further considered as an extension of this work to give the design

21054,the load of cavitation collapse is one of the main input loads to the structure subjected to underwater explosion the cavitation effects near different boundaries are of particular importance in understanding the load mechanisms and designing the protective structures in present study a numerical model that couples a runge kutta discontinuous galerkin method a finite element method and an isentropic one fluid cavitation model is developed to study the cavitation effects induced by underwater explosion near different boundaries the boundaries of a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are investigated in detail after validating the coupled numerical model by a case of 1d cavitating flow in an open tube an experiment of a water backed plate subjected to water blast and an experiment of underwater explosion near a circular plate the evolutions of the cavitation region the pressure profile near the structure and the responses of the structure are comprehensively discussed the results are beneficial for guiding the design of the protective structures keywords fluid structure interaction underwater explosion cavitation shock wave 1 introduction the damage effects such as the shell rupture the equipment failure and casualties induced by underwater explosion is one of the main threats to the modern naval vessels it attracts more and more attention from researchers and naval industries to reveal the underwater load mechanism and prevent or mitigate the damage effects to improve the survivability of the warships sommerfeld and müller 1988 apazidis 2016 eliasson and chavez 2020 ghoshal and mitra 2016 2020 avachat and zhou 2017 espinosa et al 2019 plastering shock mitigation coatings which is a kind of sandwich structures with the energy absorbing cores made of cellular or composite materials onto the wet face of the ship hull is one of the effective protective approaches to reduce the load transmitted to the whole ships from the source protecting the ship shell the equipment and the crew yin et al 2020 chen et al 2009 abrate 2018 the loads to the structures include the main shock wave the cavitation collapse the bubble pulse and jet when the shock mitigation coatings with relatively low impedances are inserted between the steel and water with relatively high impedances the load will be dramatically changed by the fluid structure interactions especially for the load of the cavitation collapse therefore the investigations on the effects of the shock mitigation coatings on the input load due to fluid structure interactions are of great importance to reveal the protective mechanisms the studies on the interactions between the underwater blast induced cavitation and different boundaries have been performed for decades kennard 1943 bleich and sandler 1970 schiffer et al 2012 jin et al 2015 mcmeeking et al 2008 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 kennard 1943 described theoretically the cavitation in a bilinear elastic liquid he found that when the pressure drops below the cavitation limit cavitation initiates and the boundary of the cavitated region either advances as a breaking front moving with supersonic velocity or remains stationary as a free surface or recedes toward the cavitated region as a closing front moving with subsonic velocity based on the bilinear elastic liquid model the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between the water blast and a rigid plate floating at the surface bleich and sandler 1970 a rigid plate supported by a linear spring schiffer et al 2012 a thick elastic plate jin et al 2015 or a sandwich structure mcmeeking et al 2008 yin et al 2016 were analytically investigated in one dimensional in detail experimental studies were also performed in a transparent underwater shock simulator to validate the model schiffer and tagarielli 2012 the initiation growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles are highly dependent on the response of the structures generally the cavitation initiates at a finite distance from the wet face of the structures and expands towards two opposite directions the cavitated fluid adjacent to the wet face will generate a reconstitution wave closing front and radiate pressure wave to load the structure again if the cavitation front could not propagate towards the wet face anymore for multi dimensional complex shock wave induced cavitation numerical simulations with high resolutions should be considered typical cavitation model includes the one fluid cavitation model and the two fluid cavitation model the two fluid model assumes that the gas phase and the liquid phase coexist in the fluid domain and are controlled by its own set of differential equations therefore the number of partial differential equations to be solved is doubled in contrast to the single phase flow saurel and lemetayer 2001 this approach is extensively applied to the simulations of the compressible multi medium flows goncalves and charrière 2014 kapila et al 2001 saurel et al 2009 yeom 2015 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 since this approach explicitly deals with the exchange of the mass the momentum and the energy as transfer terms the two fluid cavitation model can relatively easily consider the physical details at the cavitating interface such as mass energy exchange thermal transfer and surface tension however some quantities such as exchange rates and the viscous friction between the two phases have to be known a priori senocak and shyy 2002 such quantities are usually very difficult to be obtained whether experimentally or otherwise on the contrary the one fluid model assumes that the mixture of two fluids behaves as one the main focus of the model is the simulation of the macroscopic dynamic behavior of the cavitating flow therefore similar to the single phase flow only one set of differential equations is needed to solve the fluid domain the most difficult part of this approach is to define a proper equation of state for the mixture to close the system ventikos and tzabiras 2000 schmidt et al 1999 which is usually supposed to be homogeneous and barotropic since the flow parameters obtained are in an averaged sense it is difficult for the one fluid model to determine the detailed physics quantities related to phase transition however it has an advantage of dealing with the dynamic creation and collapse of cavitation the most commonly used model for the cavitating flow in underwater explosion is the cut off model due to its simple and convenient implementation the cut off model is extensively applied in different fluid numerical solvers such as the cavitating acoustic finite element method felippa and deruntz 1984 and the cavitating acoustic spectral element method sprague and geers 2003 xiao et al 2017 which are based on solving the acoustic fluid equations as well as the finite difference method the finite volume method the finite element method and the discontinuous galerkin method which are based on solving the eulerian equations hsiao and chahine 2015 hu et al 2013 jin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however there are physical and mathematical flaws implementing the cut off model the hyperbolic property of the governing equations cannot be maintained and the acoustic speed in the cavitation region is zero therefore the cavitation region and the collapsing pressure are difficult to be predicted accurately when the cut off model is used in order to improve the performance of the prediction plenty of researchers investigate the modeling and application of the different equations of state of one fluid model the typical models include the vacuum model the schmidt model schmidt et al 1999 the modified schmidt model xie et al 2006 pishevar and amirifar 2010 and the isentropic one fluid model liu et al 2004 ge et al 2020 zhu et al 2012 et al for the two fluid model based on the different assumptions made on the local thermodynamic equilibrium and the slip condition between phases the 7 equation model can be reduced to 4 equation model goncalves and charrière 2014 5 equation model kapila et al 2001 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 and 6 equation model saurel et al 2009 yeom 2015 extensive studies on the cavitation induced by underwater explosion are performed by researchers however the comprehensive studies on the blast induced cavitation effects near different boundaries are still limited in present study a numerical approach which combines a compressible fluid code with an isentropic one fluid model and a finite element structure code is established in section 2 after validating the numerical scheme in section 3 a few cases which consists of an explosion bubble water and various boundaries including a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are used to study the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between underwater blast and the boundaries in section 4 the evolutions of the cavitation region the pressure profile near the structure and the responses of the structure are discussed in detail the results are beneficial for guiding the design of the protection structures finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 the numerical approach to study the cavitation effects due to the interaction between underwater blast and various boundaries an eulerian compressible fluid model and a lagrangian structure model are established the eulerian compressible fluid model is used to consider the shock wave the cavitation and the explosion bubble the lagrangian structure model is used to consider the motion and deformation of different structures including rigid structures steel plates rubber coated plates and foam coated plates 2 1 eulerian

al 2003 based numerical technique is used to treat the gas water interface and water structure interface which consists of two main steps 1 capture the moving interface 2 predict and extrapolate the interface status the level set technique osher and sethian 1988 is employed to capture the moving interfaces the interface status is predicted by defining and solving the multi medium riemann problems the convection equation is used to extrapolate the interface status the fluid and structure are coupled at every time step with the time step size being the minimum of the stable time for the fluid and solid calculations the work by jin et al 2017 presents more details on the spatial and temporal discretization of eulerian fluid equations and lagrangian structural equations as well as corresponding interface treatments 3 validations of the numerical approach 3 1 1d cavitating flow in an open tube in this case the 1d cavitating flow in an open tube is simulated liu et al 2004 this is a riemann problem of two water streams moving in the opposite direction with the same initial velocity magnitude of 100 m s from the center of a tube when this flow starts the pressure at the center of tube reduces rapidly to the saturated pressure the cavitation occurs and the flow becomes two phases due to phase change the initial pressure of the two water streams is set to be 1 105 pa the computational domain is 0 1 m which is discretized by 400 uniform meshes the two streams initially meet at x 0 5 m the profiles of density velocity and pressure at t 0 2 ms resolved by the rkdg

connected to a vacuum at the center toro 2009 the initial value riemann problem should give rise to two rarefactions moving to the left and right respectively the cavitation occurs at the center it is observed that the calculations by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model and analytical results are in good agreement the flow structures are well captured by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model 3 2 a water backed plate subjected to water blast in this case a water backed plate subjected to water blast is simulated the cavitation appears in front of the plate after the shock

front and the closing front cavitation collapse by the rkdg method with isentropic cavitation model are in good agreement with the experimental results the small error may come from the observation error and the insufficient assumption of the plane wave 3 3 underwater explosion near a circular plate in this case underwater explosion near a circular plate is simulated the results are compared with the experimental results by slater and rude 2000 the underwater explosion tests are conducted on medium scale flat plate targets in a pond the circular plates are made of a516 mild steel with a

calculate the fluid response before the shock wave arrives at the structure after that the fluid responses are mapped to the axial symmetry code which includes both the structure and the fluid using this strategy will significantly increase the size of the bubble when the axial symmetry code works and improve the accuracy and efficiency otherwise directly calculations in the axial symmetry code

of the drum to simulate the air backed boundary condition while the water backed boundary condition is applied to the rest of the back face of the plate since the fluid pressure behind the plate is much lower the fluid is assumed to be an acoustic medium ghoshal and mitra 2012 the pressure load for this part varies as a function of the velocity v s r p at a position r r p the pressure boundary

pa from the inside of the drum to balance the hydrostatic pressure the drum thickness is h d 0 1 m the stand off distance is set to be 0 2 m 1 14r m due to the limited length of the paper only one

m the cavitation region is marked in blue the process of the formation evolution and collapse of the local cavitation can be observed in the figures it should be noted that the cavitation near the explosion bubble is due to the numerical dissipations which have limited effects on the cavitation near the structures the main shock wave impacts on the various plates and reflects t 0 16 ms in figs 9 12 the reflected pressure wave is a shock wave for the case of the rigid plate and the steel plate since the impedance of the rubber is close to that of the water and the impedance of the foam is far less than that of the water the reflected pressure wave is not prominent for the case of the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with the air backed condition a rarefaction wave is generated due to the deformation and the motion of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate cavitation occurs behind the reflected wave front since the finite radius of the plate the shock wave diffracts around the drum t 0 20 ms in figs 9 12 a low pressure region cavitation appears at the surface of the rigid plate t 0 24 ms in fig 9 the shape of the cavitation region is changed by the interaction between the diffracted wave and the cavitation region for the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate in figs 10 12 as shown in fig 9 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave the cavitation expands towards the plate center and the direction away from the structure t 0 28 ms t 0 32 ms a large cavitation region is formed at t 0 48 ms after t 0 64 ms the whole cavitation region splits into a cavitation region near the structure and a cavitation region away from the structure the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses from the sides to the center of the plate t 0 72 ms t 0 88 ms t 0 104 ms at t 1 07 ms the cavitation near the structure collapses completely inducing a shock wave with a peak pressure more than 30 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around the cavitation occurs behind the wave front the induced cavitation region at t 1 28 ms is similar to the previous one at t 0 48 ms the cavitation will collapse and generate for several times as before which can be seen in the figure of the wet face pressure in section 4 3 during the calculations the explosion bubble gradually expands pushing the water away from the bubble as shown in fig 10 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure t 0 32 ms t 0 4 ms the cavitation region splits into a cavitation region near the structure and a cavitation region away from the structure t 0 48 ms the cavitation region near the structure gradually collapses from all around to the center of the plate t 0 56 ms t 0 64 ms t 0 88 ms t 1 04 ms at t 1 12 ms the cavitation collapses completely radiating shock wave which cavitates the water again the cavitation expands behind the wave front t 1 16 ms t 1 2 ms t 1 28 ms since the motion of the plate the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses generating a pressure layer the size of the pressure layer increases at t 1 6 ms and t 2 0 ms the cavitation near the structure disappears a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure as shown in fig 11 as the propagation of the reflected wave and diffracted wave cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure t 0 24 ms t 0 32 ms a pressure layer is generated at the wet face separating the cavitation region and the structure at t 0 336 ms cavitation appears at the center of the plate again and spreads to all around the cavitation region away from the structure collapses gradually t 0 36 ms at t 0 40 ms the part of cavitation near the center of the structure collapses at t 0 48 ms the cavitation away from the structure collapses completely radiating a shock wave with a peak pressure more than 3 mpa when the shock wave converges at the center and reflects the cavitation appears behind the wave front expanding the cavitation region near the structure t 0 56 ms t 0 64 ms after that the cavitation near the structure gradually collapses t 0 72 ms t 0 96 ms at t 1 08 ms the cavitation almost collapses completely and the pressure near the collapse center reaches 10 mpa at t 1 12 ms the shock wave induced by the cavitation collapse propagates to all around a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure t 1 2 ms as shown in fig 12 as the propagation of the reflected wave and the diffracted wave the cavitation expands towards the direction away from the structure a pressure layer is generated at the wet face separating the cavitation region and the structure t 0 24 ms the width of the pressure layer increases and the cavitation expands to maximum size and collapses gradually t 0 28 ms t 0 32 ms t 0 4 ms t 0 52 ms at t 0 56 ms the cavitation near the center collapses at t 0 64 ms the cavitation collapses completely at a position away from the structure and a high pressure load is generated which reaches 10 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around t 0 68 ms similar the case of the rigid plate due to the diffraction of the shock wave cavitation appears again at t 0 72 ms the shock wave converges at the center and reflects cavitation appears behind the wave front t 0 8 ms after that the cavitation collapses gradually t 0 96 ms t 1 2 ms a continuous pressure loading appears at the wet face of the structure t 1 6 ms 4 3 wet face pressure histories of various boundaries fig 13 shows the calculations of wet face pressure histories by the rkdg fe isencav at a position r d 0 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm where r d measures the distance between the monitoring point and the center of the plate for the case of the rigid plate the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m the shock wave reaches the center of the plates interacts with the plates and reflects during the spreading of the reflected wave the peak pressure presents a decaying trend as shown in fig 13 a cavitation collapses at the center of the plate at t 1 08 ms the peak of collapse pressure reaches up to 20 3 mpa since the local feature of the load of the cavitation collapse the amount of the energy release is small during the spreading the load of the cavitation collapse decays dramatically the process can also be seen in fig 9 at r d 50 mm a pressure wave with a peak pressure of 3 9 mpa appears in the pressure profile however the load at r d 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm is insignificant after that the load due to the cavitation collapse appears periodically with the load intensity decreasing the process has been illustrated in fig 9 since the air backed condition the wet face pressure exhibits a sudden decrease for the case of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate as shown in fig 13 b at t 0 49 ms a pressure increase appears at the center of the plate however with the local characteristics the collapse pressure wave presents a rapid decay during its spreading to all around the pressure increase at r d 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm is insignificant after t 0 94 ms the pressure increases gradually due to the cavitation collapse near the center at t 1 08 ms the pressure reaches up to 6 8 mpa the shock wave propagates to all around and cavitates the center of the plate again after t 1 2 ms a continuous pressure loading can be observed in the pressure profile as shown in fig 13 c and d the radiated pressure induced by the cavitation collapse appears at the center of the plate with a relatively low peak pressure and a relatively flat pressure profile at t 0 15 ms and at t 0 13 ms respectively the cavitation continues appearing and collapsing a long term load of the cavitation collapse with a flat pressure profile appears in fig 13 c t 1 06 ms 2 39 ms and fig 13 d t 1 26 ms 3 19 ms the peak pressure for this cavitation collapse are 11 mpa and 1 2 mpa for the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate respectively 4 4 responses of the structures for different boundaries fig 14 presents the pressure velocity and displacement histories of the center of the steel plate for the case of the steel plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m the pressure velocity and displacement histories are put in the same figure to reveal the cause of the load of the cavitation collapse as shown in fig 14 a when the main shock wave reaches the steel plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 12 8 m s since the reaction force provided by the clamped boundary of the plate the velocity of the plate center presents highly oscillatory profile at t 0 48 ms the velocity of the plate center changes and the cavitation collapses at the plate center after t 0 67 ms the velocity of the whole plate is nearly harmonized and the displacement of the plate center increases gradually at t 0 93 ms the collapse of the local cavitation gives rise to the change of the velocity of the plate center although the oscillation of the velocity of the plate appears again after t 0 93 ms 2 5 ms the whole velocity profile presents a descending trend with a small amplitude of the oscillation at t 1 2 ms cavitation collapses at the center of the plate again generating a local high pressure the resilience force is the dominant factor during this stage the velocity of the plate decreases continuously during t 1 2 ms 2 57 ms the load of the cavitation collapse presents a long term pressure profile at the wet face the displacement of the plate achieves its maximum of 12 0 mm at t 1 75 ms and decreases gradually afterwards the displacement rises again due to the vibration of the plate after t 3 4 ms as presented in fig 14 b when the main shock wave reaches the rubber coated plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 14 0 m s during t 0 12 ms t 0 33 ms the velocity of the structure decreases with the formation of the load of the cavitation collapse during t 0 33 ms t 0 60 ms the cavitation occurs at the wet face again and oscillations appear in the velocity profile during t 0 60 ms t 0 73 ms the velocity decreases from 19 2 m s with the load of the cavitation collapse rebuilding at the wet face after t 0 73 ms the velocity rebounds to 25 6 m s and decreases gradually after that a long term pressure load due to the cavitation collapse appears in the pressure profile with an oscillating velocity of the structure the center of the plate achieves its maximum displacement of 13 6 mm at t 1 79 ms and bounces back gradually afterwards after t 3 50 ms the displacement increases again as given in fig 14 c when the main shock wave reaches the foam coated plate the velocity of the structure rapidly rises up to 25 9 m s subsequently the velocity decreases to about 7 5 m s and oscillates around this velocity the wet face pressure oscillates around 0 8 mpa which is close to the stress plateau of the foam 0 68 mpa during the oscillation t 0 75 ms t 1 15 ms the fluid near the wet face may cavitate due to the abrupt velocity increase during t 1 33 ms t 3 2 ms since the effects of the resilience force of the structure the velocity begins to decrease with the load at the wet face sustained after t 3 2 ms the velocity increases and oscillates due to the elastic effects of the foam the center of the plate achieves its maximum displacement of 21 0 mm at t 2 1 ms and bounces back gradually afterwards after the impact of the main shock wave the core compression increases during t 0 24 ms t 1 25 ms the core compression changes little the structure primarily remains the bulk motion the process leads to the compatibility of deformation of the whole structure after t 1 00 ms the remained energy compresses the foam the core compression increases and achieves its maximum of 12 5 mm at t 2 5 ms fig 15 presents the calculated equivalent plastic strain peeq contours of the foam at t 4 ms to further illustrate the damage range of the foam the damage is mainly concentrated in the center of the foam the part of the foam near the water suffers more severe damage than the part of the foam near the plate the comparisons of the velocity and displacement responses of the center of the steel plate among the bare plate the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate with a standoff distance of 1 14r m are shown in fig 16 since the shock wave speeds in the rubber and foam are less than that in the water the velocity and the displacement for the bare plate begin to rise earliest followed by the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate as shown in fig 16 a the velocity of the steel plate presents an increase stage a harmonized stage and a decrease stage during the increase stage the velocity increases rapidly the velocity for the case of the bare plate increases with the highest rate followed by the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate during the harmonized stage the velocity of the plate center adjusts itself to the whole plate the velocity for the case of the bare plate has the severest oscillations during the decrease stage the velocity decreases gradually with small oscillations as shown in fig 16 b the maximum displacement are 13 0 mm for the coated plate 11 9 mm for the bare plate and 9 7 mm for the foam coated plate since the foam decreases the impulse transmitted to the steel plate and absorbs the energy of the load the maximum displacement is the smallest for the foam coated plate the rubber stores the energy primarily by the elastic way although the load of the main shock wave can be reduced the rubber coated plate can induce more significant cavitation load than the bare plate therefore the maximum displacements for the case of the bare plate and the rubber coated plate have little difference 5 conclusions the cavitation effects induced by the interaction between underwater blast and various boundaries are studied by a coupled numerical model rkdg fe isencav where the rkdg is used to solve the eulerian fluid equations the fe is used to solve lagrangian structural equations and the cavitation is modeled by an isentropic one fluid cavitation model the coupled numerical model is validated by a case of 1d cavitating flow in an open tube an experiment of a water backed plate subjected to water blast and an experiment of underwater explosion near a circular plate the cavitation effects near a boundary of a rigid plate a steel plate a rubber coated plate and a foam coated plate are investigated in detail the following conclusions can be obtained 1 since the diffraction effects of the shock wave near a finite length boundary the banded cavitation region is generated in the early stage a pressure layer separating the structure and the cavitation region is usually formed for the case of the rubber coated plate and the foam coated plate while the attached cavitation is easier to occur for the case of the rigid plate and the steel plate in the early stage of the impact 2 the characteristics of the cavitation pressure profiles if the curve presents a relatively slow rising trend the collapse center of the cavitation usually locates around the center of the plate and the shock wave converges gradually at the axis of the symmetry if the curve presents a sharp rise and fall the cavitation collapses at the center of the plate if the curve presents a long term pressure load it is usually the cavitation collapse load due to the deceleration of the plate 3 the characteristics of the velocity profiles of the plate the velocity increases rapidly after the shock wave impact on the plate followed by the transient oscillation trend decrease trend and vibration trend during the transient oscillation the short term local cavitation collapse with high pressure loads may occur during the decrease trend the long term load presents at the wet face 4 the cavitation load generated during the bounce back stage of the structure is similar to stress plateau the magnitude of the cavitation collapse load is close to the stress plateau of the foam the maximum displacement is the smallest for the foam coated plate since the foam decreases the impulse transmitted to the steel plate and absorbs the energy of the load although the load of the main shock wave can be reduced the rubber coated plate can induce more significant cavitation load than the bare plate therefore the maximum displacements for the case of the bare plate and rubber coated plate have little difference these observations obtained by numerical simulations may be beneficial in understanding the mechanism of the cavitation effects induced by the interactions between the underwater blast and various boundaries and have potentials in improving the design of the protection structures against underwater blast loads however the present investigations are quite general a more detailed study for the potential protection structures i e foam coated plates such as influences of standoff distances core strengths and length scales on the effects of the cavitation may be further considered as an extension of this work to give the design
