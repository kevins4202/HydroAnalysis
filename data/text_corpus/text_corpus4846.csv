24230,state space geolocation models feature coupled process movement and observation data likelihood models to reconstruct fish movement trajectories using electronic tag data development of the data likelihood model is therefore a key step in adapting a state space geolocation model for use with different fish species geographical regions or types of electronic data here we adapt a discrete hidden markov model for the geolocation of pacific spiny dogfish squalus suckleyi n 154 in the north pacific ocean by developing a data likelihood model based on microwave telemetry x tag pop up satellite archival tag psat data the data likelihood model consists of light based longitude light based latitude sea surface temperature sst temperature depth profile tdp and maximum daily depth pacific spiny dogfish tend to occupy coastal waters where small scale local currents and freshwater inputs make sst and tdp variables difficult to map to address this issue we introduce an empirical method for parameterizing sst and tdp likelihoods by calculating root mean square difference between psat temperature and depth values recorded at known locations day of tag deployment and tag pop up and mapped values at those locations for sst observations n 85 the difference between measured and mapped values did not vary seasonally or monthly and the overall root mean square error rmse used to parameterize the sst likelihood was 0 9 c likelihood values for sst at known locations were higher for likelihoods parameterized with the empirical value compared to variance specification methods from previous studies for tdp measured values differed from mapped values n 89 by depth season and month therefore rmse values used to parameterize the tdp likelihood were calculated for each depth bin n 27 and month rmse values were low 1 c for all depths during the winter but increased for depths 100 m during the summer months our work provides an example of adapting state space geolocation models for specific applications it demonstrates the value of large numbers of tagged animals for parameterizing the data likelihood model in coastal waters as well as flexible data likelihood models with component likelihoods that can be switched on or off depending on geolocation quality keywords fish geolocation hidden markov model pop up satellite archival tags pacific spiny dogfish data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of fish movement patterns is a key component of fisheries management and stock assessment goethel et al 2011 lowerre barbieri et al 2019 obtaining detailed information on fish movement over large scales in space and time is challenging but the development of electronic archival tags and analysis tools such as state space geolocation models in recent years has greatly improved researchers abilities to obtain insights into important behaviors such as migration and foraging for highly mobile fish species costa et al 2012 state space models reconstruct movement paths of fish tagged with electronic archival tags by coupling a movement model which describes the way the tagged animal is expected to move through the study area to a data likelihood model that links the data collected by the tag to specific locations in the study area in a probabilistic way benefits of state space models include the ability to accommodate messy data accounting for measurement error in the model allowing multiple movement states e g foraging vs migrating and providing uncertainty in location estimates state space model approaches can be linear such as a kalman filter nielsen et al 2006 lam et al 2008 or non linear such as a particle filter andersen et al 2007 or a hidden markov model hmm pedersen et al 2008 hmms are relatively simple discrete state space geolocation models and thus their use has rapidly increased in recent years the hmm approach to geolocation was developed for atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 and features a study area that is divided into discrete grid cells with an isotropic diffusion random walk movement model it is ideal for non linear applications such as nearshore study areas as no probability is assigned to land it allows for inclusion of multiple movement states and can be readily adapted for use with different fish species and study areas to adapt the hmm for specific applications it is necessary to choose a model grid size obtain a value of diffusion for the movement model and develop a data likelihood model that is tailored to the behavior of the fish the type of electronic tag and the available geolocation data maps for the study area we adapted the hmm for the geolocation of pacific spiny dogfish squalus suckleyi hereafter termed dogfish in the north pacific ocean the dogfish is one of the most common shark species in the coastal waters of the north pacific ocean and is distributed throughout the nearshore waters of the u s canada russia and japan fig 1 this species is often bycaught in major fisheries such as those for pacific halibut and walleye pollock tribuzio et al 2020 and has been subjected off and on to directed fishing king et al 2017 dogfish stocks in alaskan waters are assessed and the catch of the species is managed as part of a complex of all shark species within the gulf of alaska goa and bering sea aleutian islands bsai fishery management plan areas as a whole the shark stock assessments are data limited but dogfish are the most data rich within the complex life history data and fishery independent survey indices inform the assessment however information on habitat associations and seasonal and annual movement within and between management jurisdictions is limited previous research on dogfish movement using conventional tags has provided some evidence of seasonal movement between u s and canada taylor 2008 and some large scale movements across the northeast pacific to japan and russia mcfarlane and king 2003 taylor 2008 however detailed information on movement patterns is difficult to obtain using only information about release and recovery positions to learn more about dogfish movement patterns relative to fisheries management areas in the north pacific ocean we initiated a pop up satellite archival tag psat study in 2009 and used the hmm to reconstruct movement paths of tagged dogfish based on psat light depth and temperature data we customized the hmm for our application by developing and parameterizing a data likelihood model that accounts for dogfish behavior psat data type and the environmental characteristics of our study area the data likelihood model for pacific spiny dogfish is based on light based latitude and longitude sea surface temperature sst temperature depth profiles tdp and maximum daily depth although the parameterization of the light based latitude light based longitude and maximum depth likelihoods is straight forward parameterizing the sst and tdp likelihoods is more challenging because dogfish tend to occupy near shore waters where the influence of small scale coastal currents and freshwater run off can reduce accuracy of the mapped values in the study area we addressed this challenge by leveraging the large number of tagged dogfish in this study to develop a new method for parameterizing data likelihoods for sst and tdp based on empirical differences between psat data and mapped data at known release and pop up locations our work provides an example of customizing a data likelihood model for a specific application and adapting the model for situations where errors in study area mapped data may be high in addition this work can be viewed as a continuation of efforts to explore the sensitivity of state space geolocation models to choices about fixed parameters and likelihood methods which are needed to ensure robustness and confidence in geolocation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 psat data during 2009 2013 173 microwave telemetry columbia maryland x tags were deployed on dogfish in the goa fig 1 tags were deployed during directed research cruises and opportunistically on the alaska fisheries science center s annual groundfish longline survey e g malecha et al 2019 the psats were attached with a method adapted from carlson et al 2014 where a hole was drilled through the anterior dorsal fin spine below but near the point where the spine extrudes from the skin a piece of 300 lb test monofilament line was looped through the hole pulled tight and clamped the tag was attached to the monofilament line with a loose loop which allowed the tag to swing freely the monofilament line was covered with silicone tubing 1 8 inner diameter 1 4 outer diameter to prevent it from snagging and keep the clamps from irritating the skin of the dogfish the psats weigh 46 g in air with a diameter of 3 3 cm and a length of 12 2 cm the tags recorded depth temperature and light and were programmed to release pop up from the fish after 6 12 months after the tags popped up they transmitted daily light based latitude and longitude estimates and time series of depth and temperature records if tags released from the fish prior to the pop up date data transmission was triggered by a constant depth when the tag floats at the surface measurement intervals for the depth and temperature time series varied depending on the length of tag deployment and ranged from 15 min to one hour information on measurement resolution also accompanied each depth 0 34 m 5 4 m and temperature 0 16 c 0 23 c observation physically recovered psats provided depth and temperature records every 2 min latitude and longitude estimates were derived from light levels at dusk and dawn by the tag manufacturer using a proprietary algorithm the estimates were available as both raw daily and smoothed multiple day average locations the location estimates were accompanied by the depth at which dawn and dusk values were obtained because light based latitude and longitude estimates can produce estimated locations that are far beyond the possible range of movements of the fish in a given time period we used only raw values and filtered the position estimates manually to remove obviously spurious values daily difference greater than 2 longitude and 4 latitude prior to running the geolocation model the filter is larger for latitude compared to longitude because latitude estimates are much less precise filtering of extreme values was necessary because spurious estimates that fall outside the study area would negate relevant information from other data sources such as depth and temperature at that time step see overall likelihood calculation section below latitude and longitude estimates were treated separately for pre processing and in the model as longitude is more robust than latitude during equinox and when measurements are obtained from deeper waters seitz et al 2006 temperature and depth records were processed to obtain a data set of concurrent depth and temperature values microwave telemetry tags use an algorithm for the compressed data i e those data that are transmitted in which any changes in depth or temperature that are too great to be measured accurately are flagged as delta limited for our analyses we discarded these values which typically comprised 2 of the transmitted data points for periods of time where depth and temperature measurements were offset slightly e g 15 min depth and temperature records were linearly interpolated using the command na approx from r package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 with a maximum record gap of 1 time interval 2 2 geolocation model to reconstruct the movement paths of dogfish in the north pacific ocean we adapted a hmm developed for the geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 the hmm is a bayesian state space geolocation model based on the division of the study area into discrete grid cells each grid cell ultimately contains the probability that the tagged fish occupied the grid cell at each time step first beginning at the tag release location a forward filter is implemented that alternately applies an update from the movement model followed by an update from the data likelihood model at each time step fig 2 the movement model is a random walk represented in the model as a two dimensional diffusion kernel that is convolved with the prior after the movement model update the prior is then multiplied elementwise by the data likelihood model values at that time step to obtain the joint probability of the observed tag data and grid cell value the sum of the joint probability density is referred to as lambda and this quantity is used to assess the performance of the model and to estimate diffusion the joint probability density is normalized by lambda to become the posterior and then becomes the prior for the next time step once the recovery location is reached backward smoothing is performed to update the probabilities with knowledge of the recapture location in addition to the initial description of the model provided by pedersen et al 2008 additional details for all of these steps are available in thygesen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2011 le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 braun et al 2018a and nielsen et al 2019 development of the data likelihood model is one of the most important steps in the process of adapting the hmm for a new application e g species or geographic region data likelihood models specify the way that data collected by the psat are linked to known spatial distributions i e maps of geolocation variables in the gridded study area the data likelihood models take into account fish behavior e g preference of demersal vs pelagic habitat the type and quality of tag data and environmental gradients of geolocation variables in the study area in order to link data recorded by the psat to grid cells in the study area at each time step specification of the distribution of geolocation variables usually assumed to be gaussian within each grid cell is needed deciding how to parameterize grid cell variance is a critical component of the data likelihood model that can affect model performance nielsen et al 2019 and researchers have parameterized variance in different ways one common approach is to assign variance values in each cell by calculating the standard deviation of adjacent grid cells le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 braun et al 2018a when the resolution of the mapped geolocation variable is higher than the model grid cell resolution it is also possible to assign variance by calculating the standard deviation of small scale grid cells aggregated to form the larger model grid cells nielsen et al 2019 other researchers use a constant value for all grid cells in the study area that is based on auxiliary data prior research uncertainty values that accompany the data set or the value that provides the best model performance pedersen et al 2011 biais et al 2017 alternatively variance may be estimated by the model woillez et al 2016 in addition to development of a data likelihood model adapting the hmm for different applications e g species or geographic regions involves 1 deciding whether to estimate diffusion in the model or use a pre determined value and 2 choosing the optimal grid size movement states e g foraging vs migrating can be specified prior to model estimation based on auxiliary analyses of the data set or information from previous research for which different values of diffusion may be used in this manuscript however we focus on the development and parameterization of the data likelihood as the key step in adapting the hmm for our specific application 2 3 data likelihood model for dogfish dogfish can be found throughout the water column when they occupy shallow waters psats collect information on light intensity which provides information on latitude e g day length and longitude e g time of local noon light based geolocation is the primary means of geolocation for pelagic fish musyl et al 2001 schaefer and fuller 2016 when dogfish spend time near the sea surface the temperatures recorded by the psat can be matched to satellite imagery of sea surface temperature sst in the study area nielsen et al 2006 lam et al 2008 when dogfish occupy deeper waters temperature depth profiles tdps recorded by the psats can be matched to mapped tdps in the study area skomal et al 2009 braun et al 2018b because dogfish can be anywhere in the water column in contrast to demersal fishes which are assumed to be on or near the sea floor at least once a time step the maximum depth recorded by the tag each day is used to rule out geographic areas with shallower depths therefore the data likelihood model for spiny dogfish is composed of light based longitude and latitude sst tdps and maximum depth fig 3 2 3 1 light based longitude and latitude we treat longitude fig 3a and latitude fig 3b as separate likelihoods to allow for inclusion of only longitude values when latitude values are spurious e g when the fish occupies deeper waters or during equinox periods the likelihood value for light based longitude or latitude is the probability of observing the longitude or latitude obtained from the psat given normal probability density function pdf centered on the study area grid cell 1 l l i g h t n x μ σ where x is the longitude or latitude estimated by the psat μ is the longitude or latitude of the grid cell and σ is the standard deviation of longitude or latitude obtained from previous geolocation studies we specified a standard deviation of 1 5 for longitude and 3 5 for latitude based on values used for other temperate shark species biais et al 2017 doherty et al 2017 2 3 2 maximum depth a bathymetric map is used to calculate the maximum depth likelihood fig 3c as well as to assign a probability of zero to land during the estimation process we use the srtm30 global 1 km digital elevation model dem version 11 bathymetry data set which provides bathymetry information on a 0 008 grid the maximum depth likelihood is obtained from a normal cumulative distribution function cdf of the mean depth and estimated depth variance within each grid cell pedersen et al 2008 the likelihood value is the cdf quantile represented by the tag depth normalized by a cdf truncated at a depth of zero and modified to accommodate positive depth values 2 l m a x d e p t h 1 ϕ x μ σ 1 ϕ μ σ 1 where φ is a gaussian cumulative distribution function x is the maximum observed depth during the time step interval from the psat μ is the mean depth value for the grid cell always positive and σ is the standard deviation of the bathymetry in the grid cell the standard deviation for each grid cell was derived from all depths used to aggregate the fine scale resolution bathymetry map 1 km resolution to the 20 km resolution model grid nielsen et al 2019 2 3 3 sst to calculate the sst likelihood we use the multi scale ultra high resolution sea surface temperature mur sst which provides daily sst and error estimates on a 0 01 grid jpl mur measures project 2010 to link tag temperature at the surface to the sst map we first define how the x tag measured sst for x tag data sst must be defined from the time series depth and temperature records the mur sst data set provides information about the foundation sst which reflects the base temperature of the top water layer at night or when strong winds mix the surface waters under those conditions differences between sst and deeper waters e g up to the first 10 m are small relative to tag measurement resolution donlon et al 2007 kawai and wada 2007 we conducted a preliminary analysis to determine whether the mean median or maximum temperature obtained at depths less than 10 m was closest to known sst values at known locations because the maximum temperature performed the best we define sst measured by the psat as the maximum temperature of all measurements obtained when the depth plus tag depth measurement resolution maximum 5 4 m was less than 11 m each day this effectively limits the temperature records that can be matched to sst to the two shallowest depth bins 0 5 39 m and 5 4 10 7 m at the highest levels of depth uncertainty this is similar to the definition of sst used by woillez et al 2016 for geolocation of a pelagic fish the sst likelihood value in each grid cell fig 3d is obtained by integrating a normal pdf of sst values in the grid cell between the upper and lower values of tag measurement tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 3 l s s t t 1 t 2 n x μ σ d x where x is the maximum temperature measured by the fish at depths shallower than 11 m including depth measurement uncertainty during the time interval t1 and t2 are the lower and upper limits of uncertainty in tag temperature measurement μ is the value of sst in each grid cell from the mur sst data set and σ represents the standard deviation of sst values within the grid cell sigma can be derived using different methods nielsen et al 2020 here we introduce a new method for determining σ by calculating an empirical value based on the difference between sst measured by the tag and sst provided by the mur sst data set at known locations see calculation of empirical variance section below 2 3 4 tdp to calculate tdp likelihoods we use estimated temperatures from the hycom global oceanographic model wallcraft et al 2009 which provides daily temperatures for 40 depth bins on a 0 08 grid to link temperature values measured by the psat at different depths to the hycom map we calculated the average psat temperature for each depth bin and compared those values to the corresponding depth bins for the hycom model for the likelihood calculations we linked psat data to a subset of 27 of the 40 depth bins provided by the hycom model to account for depth measurement uncertainty of up to 5 4 m in the psat data for example for the first 30 m the hycom model provides estimates at 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 15 20 25 and 30 m but the depth bins used for the first 30 m of the likelihood were 0 6 10 20 and 30 m the tdp likelihood is calculated for each depth bin separately and then combined to obtain the likelihood for all depths at each time step fig 3e we do not reconstruct temperature depth profile curves as is done with other tdp likelihoods braun et al 2018a braun et al 2018b because dogfish move rapidly from shallow to deep waters and measurements at intermediate depths were frequently delta limited by the x tags and thus discarded likelihood values for each depth bin are calculated in the same manner as sst likelihood values eq 2 where a normal pdf with a mean of the hycom temperature in the grid cell and an empirical value for standard deviation see calculation of empirical variance section below are integrated between the upper and lower values of the mean tag temperature in the depth bin tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 after likelihoods for all depth bins are calculated likelihoods for all depth bins in each grid cell are multiplied braun et al 2018a to obtain the overall likelihood in each grid cell for that time step 4 l t d p l t d p d e p t h 1 l t d p d e p t h 2 l t d p d e p t h n where depth 1 is the likelihood for first depth bin depth 2 is the likelihood for the second depth bin and n is the number of depth bins for which temperature was recorded by the psat 2 3 5 overall likelihood calculation all individual likelihoods longitude latitude sst tdp and maximum depth are created using the same grid size likelihood data available as geographic coordinates were first aggregated to 0 2 then projected to meters robinson with a meridian at 145 the 20 20 km grid size used in this study was chosen based on the size of the study area the relatively coarse spatial scale of variation in likelihood components and the movement speed of spiny dogfish it is a typical grid size for pelagic fish geolocation studies pedersen et al 2011 braun et al 2018b then for each time step one day all likelihoods are combined by cell wise multiplication to obtain the overall likelihood for that time step fig 3f 5 l total l long itude l lati tude l sst l tdp l max depth if a variable e g sst is not available for that time step all grid cells in the study area are given a value of 1 for that likelihood 2 4 calculation of empirical variance we parameterized the sst and tdp likelihoods by comparing observed psat depth and temperature data at known locations to values from sst and tdp maps at those locations for each release and pop up location we examined all available psat records and recorded sst and tdp values up to 3 days after release and 3 days prior to pop up only pop up locations from psats that released on schedule were used for this analysis because tags that detached from the fish prior to the scheduled pop up date drifted on the water surface for several days before transmission to the argos satellite network was initiated we calculated the difference between values measured by the psat and mapped values using the values closest to the day of release or pop up in all calculations assuming the location observations would be more accurate on day 0 compared to day 3 we assigned ad hoc weights to each psat observation based on our confidence that the recorded tag values corresponded to the location of the tagged fish at that time observations on days 0 1 2 and 3 after release or before pop up were assigned weights of 0 5 0 3 0 15 and 0 05 respectively observations from fish released in the same location on the same day were averaged to provide a data set with unique combinations of location and day for tdp comparisons we supplemented tag data with two auxiliary sources of temperature depth profile information first sea bird scientific bellevue wa sbe 39 temperature depth recorders tdrs were deployed on the afsc longline survey near release locations for fish tagged on that survey fig 1 these recorders provided tdp information for the full range of depths near release locations k siwicke noaa afsc unpublished data second we obtained detailed 30 min temperature measurements at depths of 20 30 60 100 150 200 and 250 m with sea bird scientific conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensors from the gak1 mooring university of alaska college of fisheries and ocean sciences data available at http research cfos uaf edu gak1 located at 59 845 n 149 4667 w fig 1 the mean temperature for each depth and day was obtained from the gak1 records and monthly averages of daily differences between gak1 measurements and hycom values were added to the tdp data set we checked for difference between measured and mapped sst and tdp values by season winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and month using kruskal wallis test for non parametric analysis of variance zar 1999 for the tdp value we combined depth observations into three larger depth bins for statistical analyses 0 50 m 51 100 m and 100 m we plotted difference between measured and mapped values by distance from shore we then calculated the root mean square error rmse between mapped sst and tdp values and observed tag measurements weighting each observation by the number of days from the known location for use in the sst and tdp likelihoods 6 r m s e i 1 n o b s i m a p i 2 w i i 1 n w i where obs is the observed temperature from psat tdr or gak1 measurements map is the mapped temperature value from mur sst or hycom at the known location and w is the weight corresponding to the number of days between observation and time of release or pop up if no temporal variation was observed one value of rmse was calculated per depth for use in the model if temporal variation was observed rmse was calculated for each time period and depth and rmse values were interpolated with the interp loess command from the r package tgp gramacy 2007 to compare the empirical sst rmse value to offshore values rmse was also calculated for observations 50 km offshore 3 results 3 1 psat data of the 173 psats deployed 79 psats popped up on the scheduled date and thus provided precise pop up locations another 73 psats detached from the fish prior to the pop up date eight tags were physically recovered and provided detailed data most pop up locations were scattered along the pacific coast from california to the aleutian islands ten were 700 2000 km offshore in the north pacific ocean and one pop up location was in russian waters fig 1 an example of a dogfish data set fig 4 features periods of rapid change between near surface waters and depths to more than 400 m periods of time spent exclusively at shallow depths and periods of time spent at intermediate depths with few visits to surface waters 3 2 calculation of empirical variance for the sst likelihood the number of unique observations locations and times was 85 no temporal variance in the difference between measured and mapped sst values was observed by season kruskal wallis p 0 2463 or month kruskal wallis p 0 2379 therefore a single value of rmse 0 9 was calculated to parameterize the sst variance in the model the difference between measured and mapped sst values decreased with distance from shore however fig 5 where the rmse from locations 50 km from shore n 22 dropped to 0 5 for the tdp likelihood the number of unique observations locations and times was 89 the sample size was slightly higher than the sst sample size because sometimes tdp values were available only for depths greater than 10 m and thus sst values could not be calculated in contrast to sst the difference between measured and mapped tdp values varied both seasonally kruskal wallis p 2 6 exp 04 for depths 0 50 m p 1 401 exp 06 for depths 50 100 m and p 1 374 exp 04 for depths 100 m and monthly kruskal wallis p 1 74 exp 10 for depths 0 50 m p 6 35 exp 09 for depths 50 100 m and p 6 47 exp 05 for depths 100 m fig 6 therefore rmse was calculated for each depth bin n 27 and month of the year rmse values were low 1 c at all depths during the winter but rmse values almost doubled in shallower waters during the summer months fig 7 in contrast to sst the difference between measured and mapped values did not decrease appreciably with distance from shore fig 8 4 discussion in this paper we develop a more flexible application of the hmm which allows for smooth integration and evaluation of accessory data due to the large number of tags available we were able to develop methods for parameterizing the data likelihood model and quantify uncertainty between tag measurement and map data the hmm demonstration is supported by data minimizing proxies and assumptions and is likely to result in an improved estimate of daily locations and overall movement of each tagged animal 4 1 data likelihood model we developed a data likelihood model for the hmm that is tailored to the behavior of our tagged fish the type of data provided by the psats used and the physical characteristics of our study area the inclusion of multiple geolocation variables in the data likelihood model is helpful for working with psat data where many gaps may exist due to incomplete signal transmission and when the behavior of the animal reduces the number of geolocation variables for substantial time periods for example dogfish can occupy deep waters or inhabit regions with seasonally limited light for long periods of time during which the tdp and maximum depth likelihoods are the only source of geolocation information available expanding the data likelihood model to include known locations from acoustic telemetry or smart position and temperature transmitting spot tags can be easily accomplished by assigning positive likelihood values to grid cells within an acoustic receiver s detection distance or position error radius of the spot tag further expanding the utility of the hmm tool though the data likelihood model is conceptually simple there are many decisions that need to be made to parameterize it for example the semi pelagic behavior of dogfish means that bathymetry is treated differently than demersal fish for the maximum depth likelihood nielsen et al 2019 in addition the tendency for dogfish to conduct rapid dives to deep waters and return to shallower waters combined with the challenges of x tag compression algorithms for measuring temperature at depth accurately during periods of rapid changes means that the temperature depth likelihood for our model may differ slightly from models designed to use binned tdp data from other tag types e g the wildlife computers pdt product therefore although likelihood models may seem similar conceptually there are often important differences in the details that researchers should be aware of before they apply a data likelihood model to their own data however open source software such as hmmoce braun et al 2018a is transparent flexible and can be readily adapted for specific applications haase et al 2021 hoffmayer et al 2021 4 2 empirical parameterization of sst and tdp likelihoods our research expands recent efforts to explore the implications of different methods for grid cell variance specification nielsen et al 2019 the choice of variance parameterization method depends on the characteristics of the study area such as gradient strength the resolution and accuracy of available geolocation variable maps in the study area and the availability of auxiliary data in the study area each method has pros and cons for example estimation of gaussian parameters such as variance in the model can lead to errors that affect model performance in state space models auger méthé et al 2016 here we present a method for parameterizing variance in situations where map error is high based on empirical comparison of values measured by the tag to mapped values at known locations the intent of the empirical variance is to estimate the probability distribution of values that could occur within each model grid cell in effect the empirical variance estimate accounts for both map error and the spatial scale of variation in the geolocation variable the resulting variance values are customized for the study because they integrate the behavior of the animal the type and quality of data provided by the psat and the accuracy of the geolocation map for example our empirical variance 0 9 c for sst is nearly twice as high as the typical value that accompanies the mur sst data set approximately 0 5 c this value reflects both the difficulty in mapping sst in nearshore conditions and our definition of sst as the maximum temperature at depths including tag resolution less than 11 m thus we simultaneously validated our sst definition for tags that provide only time series data as opposed to tags that specifically record the temperature when the tag is at the surface and the difference between that sst measurement and mapped values because the variance at locations 50 km offshore was similar to the typical value provided by the data set it is likely that the larger variance value is due primarily to map error in nearshore waters therefore researchers with offshore study areas would likely not need to bother with empirical estimation of variance for the sst likelihood however some caution is needed in the comparison of nearshore and offshore variance due to low sample sizes for observations 50 km from shore in contrast to sst our empirical variance estimate for the tdp likelihood varied strongly by month and did not decrease with distance from shore this indicates that it is a characteristic of the hycom data set that should be considered for all future studies that utilize this geolocation variable in our situation the tdp likelihood is most needed in the winter when spiny dogfish may spend months in deeper waters and therefore the higher variance during the summer months should not cause problems for geolocation accuracy the tdp provides similar geolocation information to the sst which is frequently available during the summer months when the hycom model error is high it is worth noting that other temperature depth profile maps such as regional ocean monitoring system roms model maps may be available in different study areas we acknowledge that without independent location information for the tagged fish accuracy and precision of the geolocation model is unknown ideally a comparison of hmm daily estimated locations with auxiliary data such as spot tags which can provide satellite position estimates when the tagged animal is at the surface is used to confirm improvements to model performance braun et al 2018a gatti et al 2021 given our lack of auxiliary location data additional research with simulated data sets could be beneficial for further understanding the effects of data likelihood model specification methods on performance simulations were not attempted in this study because tdp values assigned to simulated locations based on mapped tdp values would likely result in misleading estimates of accuracy and precision given the high map error observed gatti et al 2021 therefore future research that features double tagging with tags that can provide independent location information such as spot or acoustic tags would likely be the most valuable approach for assessing model performance in addition to comparing different variance specification methods future research could address the effect of including different combination of data likelihood model components for example because tdp map error was smaller for waters 100 m year round model performance could be improved if only tdp bins 100 m are used in addition model performance could be improved if the 0 and 6 m tdp depth bins were removed as these bins have the highest map error during the summer and are also included in the sst likelihood performance could also be higher if the tdp likelihood is not included in the model when sst data are available in addition a general investigation into assigning weights to each likelihood based on its potential quality could be a valuable contribution for data likelihood model development future research could also address the potential effect of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in map errors 5 conclusions applications of the hmm geolocation model are growing worldwide yet research on the effects of different parameterization methods on model performance is needed to ensure that models are adapted properly for different study conditions our data likelihood model for dogfish in the north pacific ocean is specifically customized for microwave x tag psats the behavior of the tagged fish and study area characteristics it provides an example of data likelihood model customization that should be

24230,state space geolocation models feature coupled process movement and observation data likelihood models to reconstruct fish movement trajectories using electronic tag data development of the data likelihood model is therefore a key step in adapting a state space geolocation model for use with different fish species geographical regions or types of electronic data here we adapt a discrete hidden markov model for the geolocation of pacific spiny dogfish squalus suckleyi n 154 in the north pacific ocean by developing a data likelihood model based on microwave telemetry x tag pop up satellite archival tag psat data the data likelihood model consists of light based longitude light based latitude sea surface temperature sst temperature depth profile tdp and maximum daily depth pacific spiny dogfish tend to occupy coastal waters where small scale local currents and freshwater inputs make sst and tdp variables difficult to map to address this issue we introduce an empirical method for parameterizing sst and tdp likelihoods by calculating root mean square difference between psat temperature and depth values recorded at known locations day of tag deployment and tag pop up and mapped values at those locations for sst observations n 85 the difference between measured and mapped values did not vary seasonally or monthly and the overall root mean square error rmse used to parameterize the sst likelihood was 0 9 c likelihood values for sst at known locations were higher for likelihoods parameterized with the empirical value compared to variance specification methods from previous studies for tdp measured values differed from mapped values n 89 by depth season and month therefore rmse values used to parameterize the tdp likelihood were calculated for each depth bin n 27 and month rmse values were low 1 c for all depths during the winter but increased for depths 100 m during the summer months our work provides an example of adapting state space geolocation models for specific applications it demonstrates the value of large numbers of tagged animals for parameterizing the data likelihood model in coastal waters as well as flexible data likelihood models with component likelihoods that can be switched on or off depending on geolocation quality keywords fish geolocation hidden markov model pop up satellite archival tags pacific spiny dogfish data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of fish movement patterns is a key component of fisheries management and stock assessment goethel et al 2011 lowerre barbieri et al 2019 obtaining detailed information on fish movement over large scales in space and time is challenging but the development of electronic archival tags and analysis tools such as state space geolocation models in recent years has greatly improved researchers abilities to obtain insights into important behaviors such as migration and foraging for highly mobile fish species costa et al 2012 state space models reconstruct movement paths of fish tagged with electronic archival tags by coupling a movement model which describes the way the tagged animal is expected to move through the study area to a data likelihood model that links the data collected by the tag to specific locations in the study area in a probabilistic way benefits of state space models include the ability to accommodate messy data accounting for measurement error in the model allowing multiple movement states e g foraging vs migrating and providing uncertainty in location estimates state space model approaches can be linear such as a kalman filter nielsen et al 2006 lam et al 2008 or non linear such as a particle filter andersen et al 2007 or a hidden markov model hmm pedersen et al 2008 hmms are relatively simple discrete state space geolocation models and thus their use has rapidly increased in recent years the hmm approach to geolocation was developed for atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 and features a study area that is divided into discrete grid cells with an isotropic diffusion random walk movement model it is ideal for non linear applications such as nearshore study areas as no probability is assigned to land it allows for inclusion of multiple movement states and can be readily adapted for use with different fish species and study areas to adapt the hmm for specific applications it is necessary to choose a model grid size obtain a value of diffusion for the movement model and develop a data likelihood model that is tailored to the behavior of the fish the type of electronic tag and the available geolocation data maps for the study area we adapted the hmm for the geolocation of pacific spiny dogfish squalus suckleyi hereafter termed dogfish in the north pacific ocean the dogfish is one of the most common shark species in the coastal waters of the north pacific ocean and is distributed throughout the nearshore waters of the u s canada russia and japan fig 1 this species is often bycaught in major fisheries such as those for pacific halibut and walleye pollock tribuzio et al 2020 and has been subjected off and on to directed fishing king et al 2017 dogfish stocks in alaskan waters are assessed and the catch of the species is managed as part of a complex of all shark species within the gulf of alaska goa and bering sea aleutian islands bsai fishery management plan areas as a whole the shark stock assessments are data limited but dogfish are the most data rich within the complex life history data and fishery independent survey indices inform the assessment however information on habitat associations and seasonal and annual movement within and between management jurisdictions is limited previous research on dogfish movement using conventional tags has provided some evidence of seasonal movement between u s and canada taylor 2008 and some large scale movements across the northeast pacific to japan and russia mcfarlane and king 2003 taylor 2008 however detailed information on movement patterns is difficult to obtain using only information about release and recovery positions to learn more about dogfish movement patterns relative to fisheries management areas in the north pacific ocean we initiated a pop up satellite archival tag psat study in 2009 and used the hmm to reconstruct movement paths of tagged dogfish based on psat light depth and temperature data we customized the hmm for our application by developing and parameterizing a data likelihood model that accounts for dogfish behavior psat data type and the environmental characteristics of our study area the data likelihood model for pacific spiny dogfish is based on light based latitude and longitude sea surface temperature sst temperature depth profiles tdp and maximum daily depth although the parameterization of the light based latitude light based longitude and maximum depth likelihoods is straight forward parameterizing the sst and tdp likelihoods is more challenging because dogfish tend to occupy near shore waters where the influence of small scale coastal currents and freshwater run off can reduce accuracy of the mapped values in the study area we addressed this challenge by leveraging the large number of tagged dogfish in this study to develop a new method for parameterizing data likelihoods for sst and tdp based on empirical differences between psat data and mapped data at known release and pop up locations our work provides an example of customizing a data likelihood model for a specific application and adapting the model for situations where errors in study area mapped data may be high in addition this work can be viewed as a continuation of efforts to explore the sensitivity of state space geolocation models to choices about fixed parameters and likelihood methods which are needed to ensure robustness and confidence in geolocation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 psat data during 2009 2013 173 microwave telemetry columbia maryland x tags were deployed on dogfish in the goa fig 1 tags were deployed during directed research cruises and opportunistically on the alaska fisheries science center s annual groundfish longline survey e g malecha et al 2019 the psats were attached with a method adapted from carlson et al 2014 where a hole was drilled through the anterior dorsal fin spine below but near the point where the spine extrudes from the skin a piece of 300 lb test monofilament line was looped through the hole pulled tight and clamped the tag was attached to the monofilament line with a loose loop which allowed the tag to swing freely the monofilament line was covered with silicone tubing 1 8 inner diameter 1 4 outer diameter to prevent it from snagging and keep the clamps from irritating the skin of the dogfish the psats weigh 46 g in air with a diameter of 3 3 cm and a length of 12 2 cm the tags recorded depth temperature and light and were programmed to release pop up from the fish after 6 12 months after the tags popped up they transmitted daily light based latitude and longitude estimates and time series of depth and temperature records if tags released from the fish prior to the pop up date data transmission was triggered by a constant depth when the tag floats at the surface measurement intervals for the depth and temperature time series varied depending on the length of tag deployment and ranged from 15 min to one hour information on measurement resolution also accompanied each depth 0 34 m 5 4 m and temperature 0 16 c 0 23 c observation physically recovered psats provided depth and temperature records every 2 min latitude and longitude estimates were derived from light levels at dusk and dawn by the tag manufacturer using a proprietary algorithm the estimates were available as both raw daily and smoothed multiple day average locations the location estimates were accompanied by the depth at which dawn and dusk values were obtained because light based latitude and longitude estimates can produce estimated locations that are far beyond the possible range of movements of the fish in a given time period we used only raw values and filtered the position estimates manually to remove obviously spurious values daily difference greater than 2 longitude and 4 latitude prior to running the geolocation model the filter is larger for latitude compared to longitude because latitude estimates are much less precise filtering of extreme values was necessary because spurious estimates that fall outside the study area would negate relevant information from other data sources such as depth and temperature at that time step see overall likelihood calculation section below latitude and longitude estimates were treated separately for pre processing and in the model as longitude is more robust than latitude during equinox and when measurements are obtained from deeper waters seitz et al 2006 temperature and depth records were processed to obtain a data set of concurrent depth and temperature values microwave telemetry tags use an algorithm for the compressed data i e those data that are transmitted in which any changes in depth or temperature that are too great to be measured accurately are flagged as delta limited for our analyses we discarded these values which typically comprised 2 of the transmitted data points for periods of time where depth and temperature measurements were offset slightly e g 15 min depth and temperature records were linearly interpolated using the command na approx from r package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 with a maximum record gap of 1 time interval 2 2 geolocation model to reconstruct the movement paths of dogfish in the north pacific ocean we adapted a hmm developed for the geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 the hmm is a bayesian state space geolocation model based on the division of the study area into discrete grid cells each grid cell ultimately contains the probability that the tagged fish occupied the grid cell at each time step first beginning at the tag release location a forward filter is implemented that alternately applies an update from the movement model followed by an update from the data likelihood model at each time step fig 2 the movement model is a random walk represented in the model as a two dimensional diffusion kernel that is convolved with the prior after the movement model update the prior is then multiplied elementwise by the data likelihood model values at that time step to obtain the joint probability of the observed tag data and grid cell value the sum of the joint probability density is referred to as lambda and this quantity is used to assess the performance of the model and to estimate diffusion the joint probability density is normalized by lambda to become the posterior and then becomes the prior for the next time step once the recovery location is reached backward smoothing is performed to update the probabilities with knowledge of the recapture location in addition to the initial description of the model provided by pedersen et al 2008 additional details for all of these steps are available in thygesen et al 2009 pedersen et al 2011 le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 braun et al 2018a and nielsen et al 2019 development of the data likelihood model is one of the most important steps in the process of adapting the hmm for a new application e g species or geographic region data likelihood models specify the way that data collected by the psat are linked to known spatial distributions i e maps of geolocation variables in the gridded study area the data likelihood models take into account fish behavior e g preference of demersal vs pelagic habitat the type and quality of tag data and environmental gradients of geolocation variables in the study area in order to link data recorded by the psat to grid cells in the study area at each time step specification of the distribution of geolocation variables usually assumed to be gaussian within each grid cell is needed deciding how to parameterize grid cell variance is a critical component of the data likelihood model that can affect model performance nielsen et al 2019 and researchers have parameterized variance in different ways one common approach is to assign variance values in each cell by calculating the standard deviation of adjacent grid cells le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 braun et al 2018a when the resolution of the mapped geolocation variable is higher than the model grid cell resolution it is also possible to assign variance by calculating the standard deviation of small scale grid cells aggregated to form the larger model grid cells nielsen et al 2019 other researchers use a constant value for all grid cells in the study area that is based on auxiliary data prior research uncertainty values that accompany the data set or the value that provides the best model performance pedersen et al 2011 biais et al 2017 alternatively variance may be estimated by the model woillez et al 2016 in addition to development of a data likelihood model adapting the hmm for different applications e g species or geographic regions involves 1 deciding whether to estimate diffusion in the model or use a pre determined value and 2 choosing the optimal grid size movement states e g foraging vs migrating can be specified prior to model estimation based on auxiliary analyses of the data set or information from previous research for which different values of diffusion may be used in this manuscript however we focus on the development and parameterization of the data likelihood as the key step in adapting the hmm for our specific application 2 3 data likelihood model for dogfish dogfish can be found throughout the water column when they occupy shallow waters psats collect information on light intensity which provides information on latitude e g day length and longitude e g time of local noon light based geolocation is the primary means of geolocation for pelagic fish musyl et al 2001 schaefer and fuller 2016 when dogfish spend time near the sea surface the temperatures recorded by the psat can be matched to satellite imagery of sea surface temperature sst in the study area nielsen et al 2006 lam et al 2008 when dogfish occupy deeper waters temperature depth profiles tdps recorded by the psats can be matched to mapped tdps in the study area skomal et al 2009 braun et al 2018b because dogfish can be anywhere in the water column in contrast to demersal fishes which are assumed to be on or near the sea floor at least once a time step the maximum depth recorded by the tag each day is used to rule out geographic areas with shallower depths therefore the data likelihood model for spiny dogfish is composed of light based longitude and latitude sst tdps and maximum depth fig 3 2 3 1 light based longitude and latitude we treat longitude fig 3a and latitude fig 3b as separate likelihoods to allow for inclusion of only longitude values when latitude values are spurious e g when the fish occupies deeper waters or during equinox periods the likelihood value for light based longitude or latitude is the probability of observing the longitude or latitude obtained from the psat given normal probability density function pdf centered on the study area grid cell 1 l l i g h t n x μ σ where x is the longitude or latitude estimated by the psat μ is the longitude or latitude of the grid cell and σ is the standard deviation of longitude or latitude obtained from previous geolocation studies we specified a standard deviation of 1 5 for longitude and 3 5 for latitude based on values used for other temperate shark species biais et al 2017 doherty et al 2017 2 3 2 maximum depth a bathymetric map is used to calculate the maximum depth likelihood fig 3c as well as to assign a probability of zero to land during the estimation process we use the srtm30 global 1 km digital elevation model dem version 11 bathymetry data set which provides bathymetry information on a 0 008 grid the maximum depth likelihood is obtained from a normal cumulative distribution function cdf of the mean depth and estimated depth variance within each grid cell pedersen et al 2008 the likelihood value is the cdf quantile represented by the tag depth normalized by a cdf truncated at a depth of zero and modified to accommodate positive depth values 2 l m a x d e p t h 1 ϕ x μ σ 1 ϕ μ σ 1 where φ is a gaussian cumulative distribution function x is the maximum observed depth during the time step interval from the psat μ is the mean depth value for the grid cell always positive and σ is the standard deviation of the bathymetry in the grid cell the standard deviation for each grid cell was derived from all depths used to aggregate the fine scale resolution bathymetry map 1 km resolution to the 20 km resolution model grid nielsen et al 2019 2 3 3 sst to calculate the sst likelihood we use the multi scale ultra high resolution sea surface temperature mur sst which provides daily sst and error estimates on a 0 01 grid jpl mur measures project 2010 to link tag temperature at the surface to the sst map we first define how the x tag measured sst for x tag data sst must be defined from the time series depth and temperature records the mur sst data set provides information about the foundation sst which reflects the base temperature of the top water layer at night or when strong winds mix the surface waters under those conditions differences between sst and deeper waters e g up to the first 10 m are small relative to tag measurement resolution donlon et al 2007 kawai and wada 2007 we conducted a preliminary analysis to determine whether the mean median or maximum temperature obtained at depths less than 10 m was closest to known sst values at known locations because the maximum temperature performed the best we define sst measured by the psat as the maximum temperature of all measurements obtained when the depth plus tag depth measurement resolution maximum 5 4 m was less than 11 m each day this effectively limits the temperature records that can be matched to sst to the two shallowest depth bins 0 5 39 m and 5 4 10 7 m at the highest levels of depth uncertainty this is similar to the definition of sst used by woillez et al 2016 for geolocation of a pelagic fish the sst likelihood value in each grid cell fig 3d is obtained by integrating a normal pdf of sst values in the grid cell between the upper and lower values of tag measurement tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 3 l s s t t 1 t 2 n x μ σ d x where x is the maximum temperature measured by the fish at depths shallower than 11 m including depth measurement uncertainty during the time interval t1 and t2 are the lower and upper limits of uncertainty in tag temperature measurement μ is the value of sst in each grid cell from the mur sst data set and σ represents the standard deviation of sst values within the grid cell sigma can be derived using different methods nielsen et al 2020 here we introduce a new method for determining σ by calculating an empirical value based on the difference between sst measured by the tag and sst provided by the mur sst data set at known locations see calculation of empirical variance section below 2 3 4 tdp to calculate tdp likelihoods we use estimated temperatures from the hycom global oceanographic model wallcraft et al 2009 which provides daily temperatures for 40 depth bins on a 0 08 grid to link temperature values measured by the psat at different depths to the hycom map we calculated the average psat temperature for each depth bin and compared those values to the corresponding depth bins for the hycom model for the likelihood calculations we linked psat data to a subset of 27 of the 40 depth bins provided by the hycom model to account for depth measurement uncertainty of up to 5 4 m in the psat data for example for the first 30 m the hycom model provides estimates at 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 15 20 25 and 30 m but the depth bins used for the first 30 m of the likelihood were 0 6 10 20 and 30 m the tdp likelihood is calculated for each depth bin separately and then combined to obtain the likelihood for all depths at each time step fig 3e we do not reconstruct temperature depth profile curves as is done with other tdp likelihoods braun et al 2018a braun et al 2018b because dogfish move rapidly from shallow to deep waters and measurements at intermediate depths were frequently delta limited by the x tags and thus discarded likelihood values for each depth bin are calculated in the same manner as sst likelihood values eq 2 where a normal pdf with a mean of the hycom temperature in the grid cell and an empirical value for standard deviation see calculation of empirical variance section below are integrated between the upper and lower values of the mean tag temperature in the depth bin tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 after likelihoods for all depth bins are calculated likelihoods for all depth bins in each grid cell are multiplied braun et al 2018a to obtain the overall likelihood in each grid cell for that time step 4 l t d p l t d p d e p t h 1 l t d p d e p t h 2 l t d p d e p t h n where depth 1 is the likelihood for first depth bin depth 2 is the likelihood for the second depth bin and n is the number of depth bins for which temperature was recorded by the psat 2 3 5 overall likelihood calculation all individual likelihoods longitude latitude sst tdp and maximum depth are created using the same grid size likelihood data available as geographic coordinates were first aggregated to 0 2 then projected to meters robinson with a meridian at 145 the 20 20 km grid size used in this study was chosen based on the size of the study area the relatively coarse spatial scale of variation in likelihood components and the movement speed of spiny dogfish it is a typical grid size for pelagic fish geolocation studies pedersen et al 2011 braun et al 2018b then for each time step one day all likelihoods are combined by cell wise multiplication to obtain the overall likelihood for that time step fig 3f 5 l total l long itude l lati tude l sst l tdp l max depth if a variable e g sst is not available for that time step all grid cells in the study area are given a value of 1 for that likelihood 2 4 calculation of empirical variance we parameterized the sst and tdp likelihoods by comparing observed psat depth and temperature data at known locations to values from sst and tdp maps at those locations for each release and pop up location we examined all available psat records and recorded sst and tdp values up to 3 days after release and 3 days prior to pop up only pop up locations from psats that released on schedule were used for this analysis because tags that detached from the fish prior to the scheduled pop up date drifted on the water surface for several days before transmission to the argos satellite network was initiated we calculated the difference between values measured by the psat and mapped values using the values closest to the day of release or pop up in all calculations assuming the location observations would be more accurate on day 0 compared to day 3 we assigned ad hoc weights to each psat observation based on our confidence that the recorded tag values corresponded to the location of the tagged fish at that time observations on days 0 1 2 and 3 after release or before pop up were assigned weights of 0 5 0 3 0 15 and 0 05 respectively observations from fish released in the same location on the same day were averaged to provide a data set with unique combinations of location and day for tdp comparisons we supplemented tag data with two auxiliary sources of temperature depth profile information first sea bird scientific bellevue wa sbe 39 temperature depth recorders tdrs were deployed on the afsc longline survey near release locations for fish tagged on that survey fig 1 these recorders provided tdp information for the full range of depths near release locations k siwicke noaa afsc unpublished data second we obtained detailed 30 min temperature measurements at depths of 20 30 60 100 150 200 and 250 m with sea bird scientific conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensors from the gak1 mooring university of alaska college of fisheries and ocean sciences data available at http research cfos uaf edu gak1 located at 59 845 n 149 4667 w fig 1 the mean temperature for each depth and day was obtained from the gak1 records and monthly averages of daily differences between gak1 measurements and hycom values were added to the tdp data set we checked for difference between measured and mapped sst and tdp values by season winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and month using kruskal wallis test for non parametric analysis of variance zar 1999 for the tdp value we combined depth observations into three larger depth bins for statistical analyses 0 50 m 51 100 m and 100 m we plotted difference between measured and mapped values by distance from shore we then calculated the root mean square error rmse between mapped sst and tdp values and observed tag measurements weighting each observation by the number of days from the known location for use in the sst and tdp likelihoods 6 r m s e i 1 n o b s i m a p i 2 w i i 1 n w i where obs is the observed temperature from psat tdr or gak1 measurements map is the mapped temperature value from mur sst or hycom at the known location and w is the weight corresponding to the number of days between observation and time of release or pop up if no temporal variation was observed one value of rmse was calculated per depth for use in the model if temporal variation was observed rmse was calculated for each time period and depth and rmse values were interpolated with the interp loess command from the r package tgp gramacy 2007 to compare the empirical sst rmse value to offshore values rmse was also calculated for observations 50 km offshore 3 results 3 1 psat data of the 173 psats deployed 79 psats popped up on the scheduled date and thus provided precise pop up locations another 73 psats detached from the fish prior to the pop up date eight tags were physically recovered and provided detailed data most pop up locations were scattered along the pacific coast from california to the aleutian islands ten were 700 2000 km offshore in the north pacific ocean and one pop up location was in russian waters fig 1 an example of a dogfish data set fig 4 features periods of rapid change between near surface waters and depths to more than 400 m periods of time spent exclusively at shallow depths and periods of time spent at intermediate depths with few visits to surface waters 3 2 calculation of empirical variance for the sst likelihood the number of unique observations locations and times was 85 no temporal variance in the difference between measured and mapped sst values was observed by season kruskal wallis p 0 2463 or month kruskal wallis p 0 2379 therefore a single value of rmse 0 9 was calculated to parameterize the sst variance in the model the difference between measured and mapped sst values decreased with distance from shore however fig 5 where the rmse from locations 50 km from shore n 22 dropped to 0 5 for the tdp likelihood the number of unique observations locations and times was 89 the sample size was slightly higher than the sst sample size because sometimes tdp values were available only for depths greater than 10 m and thus sst values could not be calculated in contrast to sst the difference between measured and mapped tdp values varied both seasonally kruskal wallis p 2 6 exp 04 for depths 0 50 m p 1 401 exp 06 for depths 50 100 m and p 1 374 exp 04 for depths 100 m and monthly kruskal wallis p 1 74 exp 10 for depths 0 50 m p 6 35 exp 09 for depths 50 100 m and p 6 47 exp 05 for depths 100 m fig 6 therefore rmse was calculated for each depth bin n 27 and month of the year rmse values were low 1 c at all depths during the winter but rmse values almost doubled in shallower waters during the summer months fig 7 in contrast to sst the difference between measured and mapped values did not decrease appreciably with distance from shore fig 8 4 discussion in this paper we develop a more flexible application of the hmm which allows for smooth integration and evaluation of accessory data due to the large number of tags available we were able to develop methods for parameterizing the data likelihood model and quantify uncertainty between tag measurement and map data the hmm demonstration is supported by data minimizing proxies and assumptions and is likely to result in an improved estimate of daily locations and overall movement of each tagged animal 4 1 data likelihood model we developed a data likelihood model for the hmm that is tailored to the behavior of our tagged fish the type of data provided by the psats used and the physical characteristics of our study area the inclusion of multiple geolocation variables in the data likelihood model is helpful for working with psat data where many gaps may exist due to incomplete signal transmission and when the behavior of the animal reduces the number of geolocation variables for substantial time periods for example dogfish can occupy deep waters or inhabit regions with seasonally limited light for long periods of time during which the tdp and maximum depth likelihoods are the only source of geolocation information available expanding the data likelihood model to include known locations from acoustic telemetry or smart position and temperature transmitting spot tags can be easily accomplished by assigning positive likelihood values to grid cells within an acoustic receiver s detection distance or position error radius of the spot tag further expanding the utility of the hmm tool though the data likelihood model is conceptually simple there are many decisions that need to be made to parameterize it for example the semi pelagic behavior of dogfish means that bathymetry is treated differently than demersal fish for the maximum depth likelihood nielsen et al 2019 in addition the tendency for dogfish to conduct rapid dives to deep waters and return to shallower waters combined with the challenges of x tag compression algorithms for measuring temperature at depth accurately during periods of rapid changes means that the temperature depth likelihood for our model may differ slightly from models designed to use binned tdp data from other tag types e g the wildlife computers pdt product therefore although likelihood models may seem similar conceptually there are often important differences in the details that researchers should be aware of before they apply a data likelihood model to their own data however open source software such as hmmoce braun et al 2018a is transparent flexible and can be readily adapted for specific applications haase et al 2021 hoffmayer et al 2021 4 2 empirical parameterization of sst and tdp likelihoods our research expands recent efforts to explore the implications of different methods for grid cell variance specification nielsen et al 2019 the choice of variance parameterization method depends on the characteristics of the study area such as gradient strength the resolution and accuracy of available geolocation variable maps in the study area and the availability of auxiliary data in the study area each method has pros and cons for example estimation of gaussian parameters such as variance in the model can lead to errors that affect model performance in state space models auger méthé et al 2016 here we present a method for parameterizing variance in situations where map error is high based on empirical comparison of values measured by the tag to mapped values at known locations the intent of the empirical variance is to estimate the probability distribution of values that could occur within each model grid cell in effect the empirical variance estimate accounts for both map error and the spatial scale of variation in the geolocation variable the resulting variance values are customized for the study because they integrate the behavior of the animal the type and quality of data provided by the psat and the accuracy of the geolocation map for example our empirical variance 0 9 c for sst is nearly twice as high as the typical value that accompanies the mur sst data set approximately 0 5 c this value reflects both the difficulty in mapping sst in nearshore conditions and our definition of sst as the maximum temperature at depths including tag resolution less than 11 m thus we simultaneously validated our sst definition for tags that provide only time series data as opposed to tags that specifically record the temperature when the tag is at the surface and the difference between that sst measurement and mapped values because the variance at locations 50 km offshore was similar to the typical value provided by the data set it is likely that the larger variance value is due primarily to map error in nearshore waters therefore researchers with offshore study areas would likely not need to bother with empirical estimation of variance for the sst likelihood however some caution is needed in the comparison of nearshore and offshore variance due to low sample sizes for observations 50 km from shore in contrast to sst our empirical variance estimate for the tdp likelihood varied strongly by month and did not decrease with distance from shore this indicates that it is a characteristic of the hycom data set that should be considered for all future studies that utilize this geolocation variable in our situation the tdp likelihood is most needed in the winter when spiny dogfish may spend months in deeper waters and therefore the higher variance during the summer months should not cause problems for geolocation accuracy the tdp provides similar geolocation information to the sst which is frequently available during the summer months when the hycom model error is high it is worth noting that other temperature depth profile maps such as regional ocean monitoring system roms model maps may be available in different study areas we acknowledge that without independent location information for the tagged fish accuracy and precision of the geolocation model is unknown ideally a comparison of hmm daily estimated locations with auxiliary data such as spot tags which can provide satellite position estimates when the tagged animal is at the surface is used to confirm improvements to model performance braun et al 2018a gatti et al 2021 given our lack of auxiliary location data additional research with simulated data sets could be beneficial for further understanding the effects of data likelihood model specification methods on performance simulations were not attempted in this study because tdp values assigned to simulated locations based on mapped tdp values would likely result in misleading estimates of accuracy and precision given the high map error observed gatti et al 2021 therefore future research that features double tagging with tags that can provide independent location information such as spot or acoustic tags would likely be the most valuable approach for assessing model performance in addition to comparing different variance specification methods future research could address the effect of including different combination of data likelihood model components for example because tdp map error was smaller for waters 100 m year round model performance could be improved if only tdp bins 100 m are used in addition model performance could be improved if the 0 and 6 m tdp depth bins were removed as these bins have the highest map error during the summer and are also included in the sst likelihood performance could also be higher if the tdp likelihood is not included in the model when sst data are available in addition a general investigation into assigning weights to each likelihood based on its potential quality could be a valuable contribution for data likelihood model development future research could also address the potential effect of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in map errors 5 conclusions applications of the hmm geolocation model are growing worldwide yet research on the effects of different parameterization methods on model performance is needed to ensure that models are adapted properly for different study conditions our data likelihood model for dogfish in the north pacific ocean is specifically customized for microwave x tag psats the behavior of the tagged fish and study area characteristics it provides an example of data likelihood model customization that should be considered when applying the model to new species or new study areas the information on sst and tdp variance provided by this study will be helpful for other movement studies of mesopelagic species

24231,the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et characterizes the role of vegetation in surface atmosphere interactions affecting ecosystem productivity and the global carbon and water balances therefore isolating and identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of t et and its response to the individual and interactive effects of climatic factors will help us better understand the carbon and water cycle characteristics of ecosystems the arid region of central asia has always been in the restricted area of carbon water cycle observations due to scarce station observations harsh climatic conditions and severe anthropogenic disturbances using a specific arid ecosystem model aem this study explored the temporal and spatial dynamic patterns of t et of different plant functional types pfts in drylands of central asia based on multi climate scenarios and separated and quantified the independent and interactive effects of different environmental factors the result indicated that precipitation dominated the areas of 86 et evapotranspiration 77 t transpiration and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively the effect of temperature on the ratio of t et was negative and slight and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian the results also indicated that general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation t et in the future we may need to pay more attention to the indirect effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on t et caused by future warming keywords the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration arid ecosystem model climate change central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands cover over 40 of the global landmass safriel et al al 2006 plays an indispensable role in the global carbon water cycle zhu et al 2020 evapotranspiration et dominated the eco hydrological process that links the carbon water cycle and energy budget niu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the process is composed of biotic factors from plant transpiration t during the photosynthesis and abiotic factors derived from direct evaporation e of various surfaces such as soil and canopy chang et al 2018 gao et al 2022 generally transpiration is the effective water dissipation due to the improvement of vegetation carbon sequestration and evaporation plays an important role in regulating the local climate of the ecosystem and maintaining soil water balance cao et al 2022 the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et were defined to characterize the contribution rate of vegetation transpiration to ecosystem evapotranspiration isolating and identifying t et and its response to the individual effect combined effect and interactive effect of different controlled factors will deepen our understanding in the evolution mechanism of carbon and water cycles in dryland ecosystems chang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 however the variations of t rate and et partitioning and the associated controlling factors remain unclear although a large number of studies have explored the response characteristics of t et to different environmental factors chang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 gao et al 2022 no unified conclusion has been reached so far especially in arid and semi arid ecosystems climate change co2 fertilization grassland grazing and other environmental factors are known to affect t et in ways that are inherently nonlinear and difficult to simulate chang et al 2018 due to dynamic land use extreme climate change lioubimtseva et al 2005 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 harsh ecological environment zhang et al 2013 sparse observation sites li et al 2015 isolating and quantifying t et spatiotemporal features have realistic limitations in drylands a global meta analysis of in situ studies indicated that plant transpiration and soil evaporation were largely equivalent but significant regional or species differences in drylands during long term experiments sun et al 2019 this conclusion is different from some global scale studies including but not limited to arid regions who found that t dominated the et change pattern during the hydrological cycle coenders gerrits et al 2014 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 good et al al 2015 zhou et al 2016 for individual controlled factors for example some studies have found that desert shrubs in central asia ecosystems were controlled by rainfall zhu et al 2019 but in the high latitude kazakhstan steppe where precipitation is also scarce vegetation is more strongly affected by temperature zhang et al 2017 the control effect of climate factors is often limited by the physiological constraints of vegetation itself identifying different control factors of different vegetation can specifically alleviate the unanticipated environmental stress caused by future climate change however the complex effects of control factors on vegetation are more coupled and interactive studies have found that the interactive effects between climate factors and co2 tend to be additive rather than synergistic or impedance zhou et al 2019 this conclusion is mainly based on global grassland samples and it is still controversial to be applicable in arid areas represented by sparse shrubs for example some studies have found that the interactive effects of co2 enrichment and climate change on carbon dynamics in typical drylands of northwest china have shown synergistic promotion li et al 2013 or even a negative resistance in central asia deserts zhang et al 2017 whether this relationship is a unified response characteristic of arid regions to the complex carbon hydrological cycle needs further verification ecological models have significant advantages in mechanism interpretation scenario design evaluation and prediction etc but most ecological models are thought to largely underestimate t et lian et al 2018 as chang et al 2018 argues the t et ratio produced by land surface models were generally 20 smaller than the measured results despite uncertainties involved in the various field observation this large discrepancy among independent studies may be attributed to lack of sufficient measurements uncertainty in forcing data inconsistent spatial and temporal resolutions calibrated model parameters and deficiencies in model structures due to prolonged water stress in arid and semi arid ecosystems a large number of vegetation have formed physiological and ecological characteristics such as high root shoot ratio and vertical root water absorption of vegetation that are completely different from those in humid areas zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 an accurate description of vegetation structure is a prerequisite for quantifying t et pattern in this study we take central asia as the study area with more than 80 of the world s temperate deserts extreme climate changes and intensive anthropogenic disturbances and use the arid ecosystem model as a research tool aem specially optimized and developed for the special physiological structure of arid vegetation zhang et al 2013 by designing a variety of simulated scenarios the purpose is to study 1 the temporal and spatial variation pattern of t et in arid regions represented by central asia 2 the relative contributions of individual combined and interactive effects of different environmental factors to the variation of t et 3 to identify t et change hotspots providing leading suggestions for arid regions to cope with extreme climate changes in the future 2 data and methods 2 1 study area central asia 34 3 55 4 n 46 5 96 4 e is located in the hinterland of eurasia with arid climate scarce and uneven distribution of precipitation and own more than 80 of the temperate deserts in the world forming an interdependent ecosystem pattern of mountain oasis desert we define five central asian countries kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan and china s xinjiang as study areas zhang et al 2017 the region has strong geographic heterogeneity complex climatic conditions dynamic land use change characteristics and extensive water stressed vegetation communities which are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and human disturbance li et al 2015 hu et al 2014 divided central asia into four climatic sub regions fig 1 including the semi arid steppe region in northern kazakhstan northern kazakhstan the arid desert shrub region in the central region central asia deserts the forest meadow regions in the tianshan mountains tianshan mountains dominated by evergreen coniferous forests and alpine meadows and extremely dry and sparse vegetation areas in southern xinjiang southern xinjiang different climatic zones have unique climatic landscape characteristics due to differences in precipitation and temperature the northern kazakhstan is mainly dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry and the representative plant functional types are grassland and farmland the central region has little precipitation and a dry climate and the representative vegetation types are desert shrubs the tianshan mountains are rich in precipitation and the climate in the low mountain zone is suitable for the development of species rich vegetation types such as wet and cold forest and alpine meadow the extreme arid regions in southern xinjiang have high annual average temperature extremely low annual precipitation and violent evapotranspiration the vegetation in this region is mainly desert sparse drought tolerant shrubs such as haloxylon ammonica and tamarix 2 2 data description 2 2 1 model driving data the meteorological data required by the aem model include daily maximum minimum and average temperature total daily precipitation daily shortwave radiation and daily relative humidity meteorological stations in central asia are sparse and mostly distributed in oases and it is difficult to obtain high precision spatial climate data through traditional spatial interpolation methods to this end this study intends to use the global classic high resolution daily scale reanalysis climate data to drive the model cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis comes from the national center for environmental prediction in the united states http rda ucar edu pub cfsr html and has been widely used in regional climate change research including central asia its accuracy has been fully verified and achieved good results hu et al 2014 zhu et al 2022 geographical basic data sets include soil attribute data spatial distribution of soil clay silt and sand content soil ph soil bulk density etc groundwater depth distribution data co2 concentration data http co2now org global annual mean concentration data from the mauna loa observatory in the united states and treated as most modeling studies assuming well mixed co2 concentrations in a given year throughout the central asian study area and no spatial differences the spatial distribution map of plant functional types pfts is the most important and basic data for ecological simulation research ecosystem models usually use pfts as the most basic simulation unit so the spatial accuracy of pfts data directly affects the simulation accuracy of the ecological model for regional carbon and water cycles the spatial distribution maps of pfts used in this study were all parametrically verified based on the aem model due to the complexity of remote sensing monitoring of vegetation in desert areas we first identified forests including needleleaf forest enf and broadleaf forest bdf grasslands grs croplands mainly irrigated farmland crp and large patches of non vegetated areas water bodies glaciers and moving sand dunes using european space agency data http due esrin esa int page globcover php since visual interpretation cannot distinguish the pfts in the sparse vegetation area karakum desert in turkmenistan and kyzylkum desert in uzbekistan and cannot provide information on the distribution of phreatophytic shrub e g tamarix ps and non phreatophytic shrub e g haloxylon ammonica nps the vegetation map of central asia with a spatial resolution of 1 2 5 million can make up for these deficiencies rachkovskaya 1995 the information on the distribution of pfts in xinjiang comes from the more detailed and accurate 1 1 million chinese vegetation map of vegetation community classification and distribution zhang et al 2007 due to different sources of meteorological data sets and basic map data they have different resolutions all model driven data were bilinearly resampled to a unified resolution 40 km 40 km to match the coarse resolution of the cfsr climate data for each 40 km 40 km grid the averaged topographic and soil values are calculated and the relative coverages or fractions of each pft are recorded the ecosystem dynamics of each pft are simulated independently their results are multiplied by their fractional maps to derive an area weighted result for the whole study area table 1 2 2 2 model validation data model validation is a necessary process to check the matching degree of model parameter settings the accuracy of simulation results and whether the model structure is reasonable in the previous study we used a large amount of measured data to compare and verify the npp et vegetation carbon zhang et al 2013 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 and soil carbon li et al 2015 simulated by aem and the performance in forests croplands phreatophytic shrubland non phreatophytic shrubland indicated that aem has significant advantages in carbon water cycle simulation in arid areas at the same time by investigating a large number of literature data and measured data the ability of different pfts to respond to different gradient environmental factors precipitation temperature and co2 was evaluated and calibrated zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 the results all show that the aem model can effectively capture the carbon and water cycle dynamics of vegetation in arid regions and the ability of vegetation to respond to climate change is highly consistent with the actual response pattern zhu et al 2020 in this study the newly acquired site flux data juhuatai station and fukang station were used to further validate the model s ability to simulate the et of arid vegetation among them the fukang station is dominated by desert shrubs 43 27 n 87 09 e observation time is 2004 while the juhua station is dominated by middle meadows 44 17 n 87 55 e observation time is 2017 2019 the time step of all observation data is hourly data and the daily scale data required for model validation is generated after quality control processing such as missing value interpolation and outlier elimination since the original data observed by the ec system are original records of high frequency turbulence at 10 hz these high frequency signals are converted into mean values variances and covariances the original data needs to be checked and preprocessed mainly including ①conversion of the sensor output electronic signal to represent micrometeorological variables ② check the abnormal sign of the sensor signal and check the physical threshold of the original signal ③remove wild points to eliminate the abnormality of the original signal due to electronic noise generally data with a variance greater than 4 6 times 4 6σ are removed from the time series ④ calculate the time lag of the h2o co2 ch4 signals relative to the ultrasonic anemometer and perform time lag compensation ⑤ some necessary parameters in the given flux calculation process in the flux calculation process several important corrections are also included mainly ①spectral correction frequency loss correction ②coordinate rotation correction tilt correction ③gas density correction webb pearman leuning wpl correction finally use eddypro software to perform the above processing and correction on the raw data and calculate the half hour scale flux data we then performed quality control on the acquired half hour scale flux data quality control qc is the basis of final flux data product quality assurance qa mainly include ①data label elimination ② abnormal data elimination etc in addition to the quality control of the observed data of eddy related fluxes it is necessary to further evaluate the reliability of the observed data of eddy related fluxes the energy closure degree of the two sites is greater than 80 chen et al 2015 li et al 2021 the energy closure error mainly comes from the spatial sampling error and the neglect of the soil thermal energy storage above the soil heat flux plate but generally meet the needs of flux observation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model description we use the aem model a process model specially designed for the special physiological and ecological structure of vegetation in temperate deserts to analyze the hydrological cycle characteristics of the ecosystems in the arid region of central asia the aem model operates on a daily scale and the main modules include photosynthesis energy balance hydrological cycle and soil biochemical modules zhang et al 2013 among them the water cycle is driven by absorbed solar radiation and photosynthesis is driven by photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the tree canopy in the aem the water cycle is driven by absorbed solar radiation srad and photosynthesis is driven by canopy absorbed photosynthetic active radiation par the canopy is divided into sunlit and shaded fractions in which photosynthesis and evapotranspiration et were estimated independently a fraction of srad is intercepted by canopy the rest srad energy is absorbed by the soil surface likewise a fraction of daily precipitation is intercepted by the canopy throughfall and irrigated water enter the soil and move downward during this process driven by the solar radiation absorbed by the canopy and soil surface water leaves the ecosystem through a series of energy exchange processes snow sublimation evaporation and transpiration the energy exchanges and potential evapotranspiration rate are estimated using the penman monteith approach wigmosta et al 1994 the actual transpiration rate is determined by two factors the water demanded by the plants to support potential transpiration and the maximum water uptake capacity of the root system under the current soil moisture condition water movement through the groundwater soil root canopy atmosphere continuum is driven by the gradient of water potential between the different water compartments finally a portion of the input water will leave the ecosystem as either surface runoff or drainage flow the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis of the sunlit and shaded canopies in an ecosystem or forest stand are added to derive the ecosystem stand level primary productivity and canopy evapotranspiration then the canopy evapotranspiration and the soil evaporation are added to derive the ecosystem stand level evapotranspiration if a unit study area i e a grid pixel is composed by multiple ecosystem type then the ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration of each ecosystem are integrated by area weighted linear combination to derive the ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration of the unit study area because the processes of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration are modelled at leaf to canopy levels and then scaled up to ecosystem and regional levels the nonlinear responses of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to climate changes from various pfts could be conserved and integrated by our simulation et calculation can be divided into the following parts et t r e plant s plant e soil s ground t r is canopy transpiration e plant and e soil are precipitation intercepted by vegetation and evaporation from soil surface respectively s plant and s ground are the snow sublimation of the vegetation canopy and the soil surface respectively the transpiration t r of the vegetation canopy can be calculated from two parts the sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves t r t r sunlit la i sunlit t r shaded la i shaded among them t r sunlit t r shaded are the transpiration of sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves respectively la i sunlit la i shaded are the lai of sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves respectively the transpiration of shaded and sunlit leaves of vegetation is calculated by penman monteith equation wigmosta et al 1994 t r j s l p r n j ρ c p vpd r a slp γ 1 r s j r a λ v slp pa c is the slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature curve r n j is the net radiation energy absorbed by the sunlit or shaded leaf j indicates the sunlit leaf or shaded leaf ρ g m3 is the air density cp j g c is the specific heat of air at constant pressure vpd vapor pressure deficit ra s m is the aerodynamic resistance to vapor transport γ pa c is the psychrometric constant r s j s m is the sunlit or shaded canopy resistance to vapor transport λ v j kg is the latent heat of vaporization of water e soil is also calculated according to penman monteith the specific calculated method of e plant s plant s ground is detailed in zhang et al 2013 which also detailed the distribution of energy between the sunlit canopy the shady canopy and the soil surface and details of the daily balance of leaf interception and snow ponds 2 3 2 factorial experiments in this study simulation experiments of different scenarios were designed to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of different environmental factors to t et and factor analysis was used to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of multiple environmental factors a total of 5 experimental scenarios were designed for factor analysis ① s o v e r a l l simulates real scenarios that is t or et dynamics under climate change and the interaction of multiple climate factors ② s c o 2 f e r t simulates a scenario in which only co2 concentrations change while other climate factors remain constant maintaining equilibrium ③ s p r e c i p t a t i o n simulates scenarios in which only precipitation changes and other climate factors and co2 remain unchanged ④ s t e m p e r a t u r e simulates a scenario in which only temperature changes maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature and other climate factors as well as co2 remain unchanged ⑤ s c l i m a t e climate change operates at the actual state while co2 remains unchanged at the initial state of 1980 the variations in t et and t et from 1980 to 2020 were calculated by comparing the average values from 2000 to 2020 and from 1980 to 1999 the specific formula is as follows overal l effect va

where var refers to t et and t et and c o 2 f e r t c l i m a t e indicates the dynamic interaction between climate and co2 change it was calculated by comparing the average values from 2000 to 2020 and from 1980 to 1999 of overal l effect climat e effect and c o 2 fer t effect the front part of the suffix of var indicates the period of time e g 1980 1999 and the latter part denotes the specific experimental scenario table 2 for all simulations carbon water cycle processes were initialized using the same strategy consisting of two steps at the first step the aem model was run for 3000 years using co2 concentration in 1980 and the equilibrium climate constituted by the mean climate from 1980 to 1989 to allow all carbon water processes approach equilibrium states at the second step the model was further run for 10 years using co2 concentration in 1980 and the detrended climate data during 1980 to 1989 to eliminate possible biases of carbon water processes li et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 then the aem model was run for the period from 1980 to 2020 with temporally variant or invariant climate and co2 concentration data table 2 when single element simulation is performed the aem model was run with the temporally variant element and the other elements remain unchanged driven by equilibrium climate which was generated using the average climate data in the generation of equilibrium climate trends of climate variables were removed while their day to day variations were remained 3 results and analysis 3 1 aem validation due to the optimized root system architecture and root water absorption method the aem model has significant advantages in simulating the water cycle of vegetation in arid regions using the newly acquired flux data of juhuatai the site is a typical weedy meadow and the constructive species are mainly geranium sp potentilla sp poa sp and codonopsis clematidea schrenk c b clarke and fukang stations the ecosystem is a typical temperate desert in areas with shallow water tables 1 5 m natural vegetation is usually dominated by tamarix ramosissima in areas with deep water tables haloxylon ammodendron typically dominates shrub communities to compare and verify the simulation results it is found that the correlation r square between the aem simulated et results and the measured data is 0 82 y 0 66x 0 47 p 0 05 and 0 90 y 1 32x 0 05 p 0 05 the five day moving average simulated values matched well with the measured values however it was also found that the aem simulated et values were overestimated during the peak growth season doy 175 to doy 233 which may be related to the overestimation of the cfsr reanalysis precipitation data input to the model in arid regions fig 2 b doy 1 to doy 90 affected by equipment failure no valid data was detected 3 2 spatiotemporal pattern of t et et t and precipitation in central asia ecosystems from 1980 to 2020 central asia ecosystems experienced a significant climate change and the precipitation showed a significant downward trend 1 94 mm a fig 3 except for the tianshan mountains and altay mountains with an increasing precipitation pattern 1 5 mm a 77 of central asia showed decreased precipitation mainly concentrated in southern xinjiang of china 10 mm a and northern kazakhstan steppe 5 mm a fig 4 d the precipitation during the decade from 1998 to 2008 was only 80 of the multi year average and the la niña phenomenon may be the main reason for the decrease in precipitation in central asia during this period li et al 2015 in the past four decades the temperature in central asia has been generally rise 0 2 c 10a higher than the global warming rate of 0 18 10a https www climate gov the increase in temperature and the decrease in precipitation further aggravated the living conditions of vegetation in central asia ecosystems under the influence of the coupling effect of climate change and co2 the et and t and the ratio of t et in the central asian ecosystem showed a significant interannual variation trend during 1980 to 2020 et and t showed a significantly declining trend in central asia ecosystems variation rates were 0 92 mm a and 0 69 mm a p 0 01 respectively the areas with more severe decline are the southern xinjiang region of china and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan affected by warming and decreasing precipitation evaporation is intense in these areas and vegetation transpiration and photosynthesis are significantly limited although t et remained relatively stable on the whole the annual value ranged from 0 42 to 0 55 and change rate 0 001 p 0 01 however from the spatial change map we find that the increase in t et in areas with abundant precipitation such as tianshan mountainous areas change rate usually 5 10 3 covers the declining trend of extreme desert areas in southern xinjiang 7 10 3 and the two major desert areas kara kum desert and kyzyl kum desert 3 10 3 7 10 3 in southern central asia figs 3 and 4 show that precipitation is the decisive factor for the variation of t et and t et in the central asian ecosystem r square is 0 60 0 59 and 0 46 p 0 01 respectively and the effect of precipitation on biotic factors t was greater than that on abiotic factors e r square 0 41 p 0 01 according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region the main vegetation type is non phreatophytic shrub and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan the main vegetation type is grassland and it is traditional pastoral area are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian 3 3 separating and quantifying the impact of different environmental factors on t et although the study found that precipitation is the dominant factor affecting vegetation in central asia figs 3 4 the relative contributions and specific magnitudes of precipitation and other factors to the variations of ecosystems et t and t et were still unclear therefore we designed five scenarios table 2 used six formulas to decompose and quantify the individual effects of precipitation temperature and co2 enrichment and analyzed the interactive effects between climate change and co2 the results show that the coupling effect of different factors overall effect has a negative effect on t 17 95 mm a in which climate change 18 35 mm a and its important component precipitation 21 96 mm a contribute most of it the individual effects of temperature changes on t presents a positive promotion but not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in t due to reduced precipitation accounting for only 19 of the precipitation effect the effect of co2 enrichment on t is almost negligible probably because desert vegetation is insensitive to co2 in the context of severe drought stress zhang et al 2017 moreover we found that the positive effect of temperature changes on t and et is reversed when it affects t et showing a negative effect affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative 0 31 mm a in addition although et contains the abiotic component e the overall pattern is similar to t with an overall decrease of 20 mm a over the past four decades in general according to the influence degree of environmental factors on variables t et and t et the order is precipitation individual factor climate change coupling effect temperature individual effect co2 individual effect interactive effect c o 2 f e r t c l i m a t e in order to further accurately identify the impact of different environmental factors on different pfts the study refined the response pattern of t et and the ratio of t et in major pfts in central asia ecosystems fig 6 indicated that the importance of precipitation effect varies significantly across different pfts ps and bdf are most affected by precipitation on the one hand ps and bdf have experienced a significant decrease in precipitation 93 mm and 125 mm respectively during the past decades and the decline rate is much higher than that of other vegetation types on the other hand the representative vegetation of ps tamarix is mainly distributed in the desert edge of the arid and water deficient southern xinjiang fig 1 in addition the bdf is located in the valley and its living conditions are worse than the upper mountain forest areas where enf is located from fig 6 we can see that although crp also experienced a large drop in precipitation 67 mm its t et t et rose against the trend this is because the managed crops are affected by human management and their water and fertilizer conditions are sufficient less restricted by natural conditions the influence of temperature effect on various vegetation types is relatively intuitive with the increase of temperature the t and et of various vegetation generally increase but because the increase of t is smaller than that of et which caused a negative feedback of t et on warming it is generally believed that the effect of co2 enrichment will significantly promote vegetation photosynthesis and reduces transpiration at the leaf ecosystem scale ueyama et al 2020 however we found that the effect of co2 enrichment on vegetation t in arid areas is mainly in forest ps and crp drought stressed vegetation is insensitive to co2 response possibly because more photosynthates are allocated to roots resulting in leaf area declination or even leaf abscission and dormancy in extreme cases naumburg et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 the effect of co2 on crp and ps is small and even has some promotion fig 6a this may be because farmland is not limited by precipitation and the vegetation leaf area shows an increasing trend at high co2 concentration although the stomatal conductance decreases the ecosystem overall t did not decrease significantly furthermore we identified the spatial patterns of the dominant climatic controls on t et and the ratio of t et dynamic pixel by pixel over central asia fig 7 on the spatial scale precipitation is still the main controlling factor of the central asian ecosystem mainly distributed in the extremely arid region in southern xinjiang of china and the sparse shrub desert region in the western part of central asia accounting for 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et of the total area of the study area respectively the temperature controlled areas are mainly distributed in the alpine tianshan mountains the altay mountains and the high latitude northern kazakhstan grasslands the common feature of these areas is that temperature is a stress factor that limits the development of ecosystems accounting for 12 et 14 t and 14 the ratio of t et of the study area it is generally believed that the co2 enrichment effect will increase the photosynthesis of vegetation reduce the stomatal conductance thereby reduce the vegetation transpiration and improve the water use efficiency of the vegetation and the co2 enrichment effect will show more sensitive characteristics when the precipitation decreases however this improvement in response efficiency is based on the fact that drought stress does not endanger the physiological structure of the vegetation itself severe drought will cause the vegetation to allocate more photosynthetic products to the underground part resulting in a decrease in the leaf area of the vegetation this would cause the co2 enrichment effect at the ecosystem scale to be offset by the reduction in photosynthesis due to the decrease in vegetation leaf area from the spatial pattern we can also see that the effect of co2 enrichment on the et of central asian ecosystems is not significant compared to that of temperature and precipitation and is only sporadically distributed in mountainous areas with relatively good hydrothermal conditions mainly bdf and enf and the northern steppe region of kazakhstan since the effect of co2 enrichment on t or et was not significant the interactive effect between co2 and climate change c o 2 f e r t c l i m a t e often co appeared in areas with more significant climate change or more sensitive to co2 response 4 discussion 4 1 the characteristics of dry land t et and its comparison with previous studies the t et 0 42 0 54 of the arid region of central asia simulated by the aem model is generally smaller than the global observation mean estimated by the isotope based method 0 64 0 13 good et al 2015 higher than the simulation results 0 41 0 11 by multi models of cmip5 coupled model inter comparison project 5 lian et al 2018 this is because the overall t et in arid regions is smaller than that of vegetation in non arid regions in addition to the results of lian et al 2018 which are generally considered to be underestimated wei et al 2017 comparing the results in other arid area lu et al 2017 used the isotope technique method to measure the value 0 46 in hyper arid southern california in usa which is similar to the result of this study slightly higher than that 0 41 of guo et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 using the isotope technique method in arid tibetan plateau china and semiarid northeastern china the simulated values of t et for different vegetation types in this study were comparable to those of previous studies table 2 for example we found that the t et of different forest types obtained by different methods was not consistent range from 0 50 to 0 79 ren et al 2019 and the t et values 0 42 0 57 of enf in the tianshan mountains of central asia in this study is close to this range and is comparable to zhou et al 2016 calculated enf t et 0 56 by using 17 site data however the lower limit of bdf 0 24 0 68 is slightly lower than this range mainly because the bdf in central asia is dominated by populus euphratica forests which tend to live in extremely arid desert areas chen and luo 2013 compared to enf in upper mountain forest areas where the background precipitation was higher and temperature was lower its physiological characteristics are more inclined to the desert shrubs with weak transpiration and strong evaporation central asian desert shrubs are divided into two types phreatophytic shrub e g tamarix ps and non phreatophytic shrub e g haloxylon ammonica nps the t et value 0 42 of non phreatophytic shrub was comparable to the field measurement values of cavanaugh et al 2011 at the creosote site lucky hills site in usa 0 37 0 44 or fang et al 2019 in yan an china 0 41 0 42 respectively nps is generally smaller than that of ps 0 49 this is because ps can rely on the developed root system to absorb groundwater to supplement themselves while utilizing external precipitation thereby promoting the growth of vegetation similarly we found that the mean t et of forests 0 51 and farmland ecosystems 0 54 with relatively good water and heat conditions was significantly larger than that of grasslands 0 49 under arid background which also indicates that precipitation can often greatly improve vegetation growth in arid environment increase vegetation transpiration and then increase the t et value 4 2 the distribution characteristics of main control factors and its influence on t et it is difficult to separate and quantify the main controlling factors of t et and the relative contributions between different factors based on site or remote sensing methods based on model controlled experiments this study not only analyzed the spatial response pattern of each pfts t et to different environmental factors but also quantified the relative contributions of different factors although it is generally believed that temperature and precipitation are the main control variables of t et in temperate desert ecosystems our results show that precipitation occupies an absolute dominant position among the factors affecting t et in arid regions accounting for 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et of the total area of the study area respectively fig 7 only farmland ecosystems were affected by human management irrigation etc and their t et changes were not sensitive to precipitation responses we found that precipitation was positively correlated with t et and t et overall r square is 0 60 0 59 and 0 46 p 0 01 respectively for example due to the topographic effect a large amount of precipitation is formed on the northwest windward slope of the tianshan mountains which will maintain the growth of forests represented by enf thereby increasing the evapotranspiration of the ecosystem this is also the main reason for the increase of t and et on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains fig 4a 4b this is also consistent with niu et al 2019 s finding that in the context of drought an increase in precipitation would cause t et to increase by promoting vegetation growth previous studies have shown that temperature often alters the t et ratio by altering the stomatal conductance of vegetation zhu et al 2015 warming modulates the vapor pressure deficit inside and outside the leaf which in turn alters vegetation transpiration and evapotranspiration rates niu et al 2019 central asia has experienced a significant temperature increase over the past four decades which generally promotes vegetation transpiration as well as soil evaporation fig 5 however the increase in vegetation photosynthetic rate and transpiration caused by temperature increase is offset by the water shortage e increase caused by temperature increase resulting in t et being insensitive to the temperature effect and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation fig 5 in addition some studies suggest that the response of semi arid ecosystems to temperature changes is often regulated by precipitation mueller et al 2016 therefore although the arid regions of central asia will continue to warm at a rate exceeding the global average in the future the temperature increase may not have a direct and significant impact on the t et of arid region ecosystems it is generally believed that the increase of co2 concentration will reduce the stomatal conductance at the leaf scale but at the same time it will increase the transpiration area at the ecosystem scale co2 enrichment effect leads to an increase in lai which partially compensates for the decrease in stomatal conductance due to the increase in co2 concentration stoy et al 2019 our study found that elevated co2 generally increased ecosystem transpiration rates fig 5 but different vegetation types had different response characteristics fig 6 ps can provide groundwater replenishment due to the developed underground root system and crp due to artificial management irrigation etc resulting in the effect of co2 enrichment on lai which increases transpiration larger than the reduction of leaf scale transpiration rate other vegetation types under drought stress tend to transfer a large number of photosynthetic products to the underground root system reduce the leaf area above ground or use dormancy to alleviate the water loss caused by transpiration naumburg et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 we not only quantified the individual effects of different factors but also assessed the interactive effect between co2 and climate change using factorial analysis it is generally believed that elevated co2 will increase vegetation photosynthesis and reduce vegetation transpiration thereby improving water use efficiency however when the coupled effects of climate change and co2 are superimposed and analyzed there are often large uncertainties this study found that the interactive effect reduced et and t and promoted t et by designing a multi scenario experiment this finding is supported by previous modeling studies that found the interactive effect between climate change and co2 negatively influenced et zhu et al 2020 we also found that the vegetation response under extreme drought conditions is not sensitive to co2 while climate change generally has a negative effect and dominates the interactive effect with co2 which indicates that the co2 enrichment effect is not enough to offset the negative effects of climate change 4 3 the implications and model uncertainty the ratio of t to et characterizes how the ecosystem water vapor flux is allocated between physical and biological processes kool et al 2014 li et al 2020 ren et al 2019 we find that precipitation dominates the areas of 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively although some studies have shown that the correlation between precipitation and t et has greater uncertainty for example some studies have found that precipitation shows a positive effect li et al 2015 or shows a negative effect or no obvious response gu et al 2018 li et al 2019 this study found that precipitation is the positive factor that dominates t et changes in the arid regions of central asia especially in the extreme arid regions of southern xinjiang and the central and western regions fig 7 this finding is relatively consistent with previous studies that precipitation not only dominated the change pattern of vegetation npp zhang et al 2017 but also played a decisive role in et zhu et al 2020 based on cmip5 data it is shown that under different climate scenarios in the future the precipitation in southern xinjiang mainly shrubs such as haloxylon ammonium and tamarix will decrease significantly which will further aggravate the water stress of regional vegetation and t et may further decrease in the arid steppe region of northern kazakhstan the future precipitation will increase 3 9 mm 10a zhang et al 2017 which will alleviate the current drought stress pattern promote vegetation growth and increase t et we also found that the effect of temperature on vegetation t et is small fig 5 and 7 so the general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation t et in the future we may need to pay more attention to the effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on t et caused by future warming in addition aem may underestimate the temperature effect to a certain extent fig 5 although the aem model considers the direct effect of temperature on photosynthesis it does not consider the effect of vpd changes caused by increasing temperature on stomatal conductance some studies have found that vpd can better explain and illustrate the change pattern of vegetation productivity than precipitation konings et al 2017 model methods tend to underestimate large scale regional t et patterns chang et al 2018 because model methods often overlook or have cognitive defects of water vapor diffusion from the rising falling evaporating surface in the soil to the soil surface the aem model firstly considers the structural characteristics of the vegetation canopy in arid regions in order to better simulate the energy distribution of the vegetation canopy in arid regions second the differences in carbon water and energy cycles between deep rooted vegetation such as tamarix etc unique to central asia rain fed shallow rooted vegetation such as haloxylon ammonium haloxylon ammonium etc and zonal vegetation with vertical root system distribution that can fully utilize the water in the suspended soil layer to grow in detail are distinguished in central asia third combined with the soil water potential and the hydrodynamic conductance of plants the one dimensional richards equation was used to simulate the transport of water in the continuum of groundwater soil unsaturated zone root zone hairy root lateral root tap root stem leaf atmosphere moving process by characterizing the unique groundwater distribution in temperate deserts such as the soil suspension moisture layer we can consider the compensation mechanism for plants to utilize water in different soil layers under extreme water shortages leib et al 2006 this leads to the relative reliability of the simulation results table 3 nevertheless some uncertainties inevitably exist in this study for example we analyzed the impact of climate change effects on ecosystem t et but ignoring changes in land use and land cover will lead to uncertainties in the assessment of carbon and water cycles in arid regions for example previous study han et al 2012 found that in the 1990s after the disintegration of the soviet union the phenomenon of farmland abandonment occurred from time to time and about 22 of the farmland was abandoned although the farmland accounted for a small area in central asia the net change in cropland area was smaller and recovered in the 2000s but this uncertainty also requires attention after the 2000s the natural land use change was small 5 in central asia chen et al 2014 and the uncertainty caused by the effects of land use change was minimized in addition due to the fact that central asia is located in the hinterland of eurasia climate station sites are very scarce we use the well performing cfsr reanalysis meteorological data in central asia as the driving data for the model this dataset has been used by numerous studies li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 and achieved good results however some studies have also found that the precipitation data of this dataset is overestimated to a certain extent in the arid regions of central asia hu et al 2014 because majority of the croplands in central asia located in plains which generally had an arid semiarid climate background we assumed the croplands in our study area were irrigated this assumption however may lead to overestimated photosynthesis and underestimated drought effects on those rainfed crops in the study area furthermore the aem model does not consider the impact of different irrigation methods drip irrigation flood irrigation etc on the farmland ecosystem on the one hand the aem model s main advantage is to depict the structural characteristics of desert vegetation which has certain limitations on the farmland ecosystem on the other hand farmland is not the main vegetation type in central asia which will not have a significant impact on our results since we assume that there is no water shortage in irrigated farmland its et responds more to temperature than to precipitation under the background of high co2 concentration the crop leaf area shows an increasing trend fig 6 additional in previous studies li et al 2013 zhang and ren 2017 fang et al 2019 we found that temperature and precipitation are key to the carbon water cycle of central asian ecosystems although the relative humidity and shortwave radiation were among the climate drivers in the s overall and s climate simulation their effects were not analyzed because previous studies and our preliminary research indicated that the interannual changes in relative humidity and shortwave radiation were small and had relatively weak influences on the dynamics of et and carbon stock in the study area 5 conclusion in this study the individual and interactive effect of multi environmental factor climate change and co2 etc on the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration over central asia ecosystems were calculated using the aem model based on climate scenarios and factor analysis we found the aem model performed well for different plant functional types in typical drylands in central asia we also evaluated spatiotemporal pattern of the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration in central asia the result indicated that precipitation dominated the areas of 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively the effect of temperature on the ratio of t et was negative and slight and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian the results also indicated that general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation

24231,the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et characterizes the role of vegetation in surface atmosphere interactions affecting ecosystem productivity and the global carbon and water balances therefore isolating and identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of t et and its response to the individual and interactive effects of climatic factors will help us better understand the carbon and water cycle characteristics of ecosystems the arid region of central asia has always been in the restricted area of carbon water cycle observations due to scarce station observations harsh climatic conditions and severe anthropogenic disturbances using a specific arid ecosystem model aem this study explored the temporal and spatial dynamic patterns of t et of different plant functional types pfts in drylands of central asia based on multi climate scenarios and separated and quantified the independent and interactive effects of different environmental factors the result indicated that precipitation dominated the areas of 86 et evapotranspiration 77 t transpiration and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively the effect of temperature on the ratio of t et was negative and slight and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian the results also indicated that general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation t et in the future we may need to pay more attention to the indirect effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on t et caused by future warming keywords the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration arid ecosystem model climate change central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands cover over 40 of the global landmass safriel et al al 2006 plays an indispensable role in the global carbon water cycle zhu et al 2020 evapotranspiration et dominated the eco hydrological process that links the carbon water cycle and energy budget niu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the process is composed of biotic factors from plant transpiration t during the photosynthesis and abiotic factors derived from direct evaporation e of various surfaces such as soil and canopy chang et al 2018 gao et al 2022 generally transpiration is the effective water dissipation due to the improvement of vegetation carbon sequestration and evaporation plays an important role in regulating the local climate of the ecosystem and maintaining soil water balance cao et al 2022 the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et were defined to characterize the contribution rate of vegetation transpiration to ecosystem evapotranspiration isolating and identifying t et and its response to the individual effect combined effect and interactive effect of different controlled factors will deepen our understanding in the evolution mechanism of carbon and water cycles in dryland ecosystems chang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 however the variations of t rate and et partitioning and the associated controlling factors remain unclear although a large number of studies have explored the response characteristics of t et to different environmental factors chang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 gao et al 2022 no unified conclusion has been reached so far especially in arid and semi arid ecosystems climate change co2 fertilization grassland grazing and other environmental factors are known to affect t et in ways that are inherently nonlinear and difficult to simulate chang et al 2018 due to dynamic land use extreme climate change lioubimtseva et al 2005 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 harsh ecological environment zhang et al 2013 sparse observation sites li et al 2015 isolating and quantifying t et spatiotemporal features have realistic limitations in drylands a global meta analysis of in situ studies indicated that plant transpiration and soil evaporation were largely equivalent but significant regional or species differences in drylands during long term experiments sun et al 2019 this conclusion is different from some global scale studies including but not limited to arid regions who found that t dominated the et change pattern during the hydrological cycle coenders gerrits et al 2014 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 good et al al 2015 zhou et al 2016 for individual controlled factors for example some studies have found that desert shrubs in central asia ecosystems were controlled by rainfall zhu et al 2019 but in the high latitude kazakhstan steppe where precipitation is also scarce vegetation is more strongly affected by temperature zhang et al 2017 the control effect of climate factors is often limited by the physiological constraints of vegetation itself identifying different control factors of different vegetation can specifically alleviate the unanticipated environmental stress caused by future climate change however the complex effects of control factors on vegetation are more coupled and interactive studies have found that the interactive effects between climate factors and co2 tend to be additive rather than synergistic or impedance zhou et al 2019 this conclusion is mainly based on global grassland samples and it is still controversial to be applicable in arid areas represented by sparse shrubs for example some studies have found that the interactive effects of co2 enrichment and climate change on carbon dynamics in typical drylands of northwest china have shown synergistic promotion li et al 2013 or even a negative resistance in central asia deserts zhang et al 2017 whether this relationship is a unified response characteristic of arid regions to the complex carbon hydrological cycle needs further verification ecological models have significant advantages in mechanism interpretation scenario design evaluation and prediction etc but most ecological models are thought to largely underestimate t et lian et al 2018 as chang et al 2018 argues the t et ratio produced by land surface models were generally 20 smaller than the measured results despite uncertainties involved in the various field observation this large discrepancy among independent studies may be attributed to lack of sufficient measurements uncertainty in forcing data inconsistent spatial and temporal resolutions calibrated model parameters and deficiencies in model structures due to prolonged water stress in arid and semi arid ecosystems a large number of vegetation have formed physiological and ecological characteristics such as high root shoot ratio and vertical root water absorption of vegetation that are completely different from those in humid areas zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 an accurate description of vegetation structure is a prerequisite for quantifying t et pattern in this study we take central asia as the study area with more than 80 of the world s temperate deserts extreme climate changes and intensive anthropogenic disturbances and use the arid ecosystem model as a research tool aem specially optimized and developed for the special physiological structure of arid vegetation zhang et al 2013 by designing a variety of simulated scenarios the purpose is to study 1 the temporal and spatial variation pattern of t et in arid regions represented by central asia 2 the relative contributions of individual combined and interactive effects of different environmental factors to the variation of t et 3 to identify t et change hotspots providing leading suggestions for arid regions to cope with extreme climate changes in the future 2 data and methods 2 1 study area central asia 34 3 55 4 n 46 5 96 4 e is located in the hinterland of eurasia with arid climate scarce and uneven distribution of precipitation and own more than 80 of the temperate deserts in the world forming an interdependent ecosystem pattern of mountain oasis desert we define five central asian countries kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan and china s xinjiang as study areas zhang et al 2017 the region has strong geographic heterogeneity complex climatic conditions dynamic land use change characteristics and extensive water stressed vegetation communities which are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and human disturbance li et al 2015 hu et al 2014 divided central asia into four climatic sub regions fig 1 including the semi arid steppe region in northern kazakhstan northern kazakhstan the arid desert shrub region in the central region central asia deserts the forest meadow regions in the tianshan mountains tianshan mountains dominated by evergreen coniferous forests and alpine meadows and extremely dry and sparse vegetation areas in southern xinjiang southern xinjiang different climatic zones have unique climatic landscape characteristics due to differences in precipitation and temperature the northern kazakhstan is mainly dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry and the representative plant functional types are grassland and farmland the central region has little precipitation and a dry climate and the representative vegetation types are desert shrubs the tianshan mountains are rich in precipitation and the climate in the low mountain zone is suitable for the development of species rich vegetation types such as wet and cold forest and alpine meadow the extreme arid regions in southern xinjiang have high annual average temperature extremely low annual precipitation and violent evapotranspiration the vegetation in this region is mainly desert sparse drought tolerant shrubs such as haloxylon ammonica and tamarix 2 2 data description 2 2 1 model driving data the meteorological data required by the aem model include daily maximum minimum and average temperature total daily precipitation daily shortwave radiation and daily relative humidity meteorological stations in central asia are sparse and mostly distributed in oases and it is difficult to obtain high precision spatial climate data through traditional spatial interpolation methods to this end this study intends to use the global classic high resolution daily scale reanalysis climate data to drive the model cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis comes from the national center for environmental prediction in the united states http rda ucar edu pub cfsr html and has been widely used in regional climate change research including central asia its accuracy has been fully verified and achieved good results hu et al 2014 zhu et al 2022 geographical basic data sets include soil attribute data spatial distribution of soil clay silt and sand content soil ph soil bulk density etc groundwater depth distribution data co2 concentration data http co2now org global annual mean concentration data from the mauna loa observatory in the united states and treated as most modeling studies assuming well mixed co2 concentrations in a given year throughout the central asian study area and no spatial differences the spatial distribution map of plant functional types pfts is the most important and basic data for ecological simulation research ecosystem models usually use pfts as the most basic simulation unit so the spatial accuracy of pfts data directly affects the simulation accuracy of the ecological model for regional carbon and water cycles the spatial distribution maps of pfts used in this study were all parametrically verified based on the aem model due to the complexity of remote sensing monitoring of vegetation in desert areas we first identified forests including needleleaf forest enf and broadleaf forest bdf grasslands grs croplands mainly irrigated farmland crp and large patches of non vegetated areas water bodies glaciers and moving sand dunes using european space agency data http due esrin esa int page globcover php since visual interpretation cannot distinguish the pfts in the sparse vegetation area karakum desert in turkmenistan and kyzylkum desert in uzbekistan and cannot provide information on the distribution of phreatophytic shrub e g tamarix ps and non phreatophytic shrub e g haloxylon ammonica nps the vegetation map of central asia with a spatial resolution of 1 2 5 million can make up for these deficiencies rachkovskaya 1995 the information on the distribution of pfts in xinjiang comes from the more detailed and accurate 1 1 million chinese vegetation map of vegetation community classification and distribution zhang et al 2007 due to different sources of meteorological data sets and basic map data they have different resolutions all model driven data were bilinearly resampled to a unified resolution 40 km 40 km to match the coarse resolution of the cfsr climate data for each 40 km 40 km grid the averaged topographic and soil values are calculated and the relative coverages or fractions of each pft are recorded the ecosystem dynamics of each pft are simulated independently their results are multiplied by their fractional maps to derive an area weighted result for the whole study area table 1 2 2 2 model validation data model validation is a necessary process to check the matching degree of model parameter settings the accuracy of simulation results and whether the model structure is reasonable in the previous study we used a large amount of measured data to compare and verify the npp et vegetation carbon zhang et al 2013 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 and soil carbon li et al 2015 simulated by aem and the performance in forests croplands phreatophytic shrubland non phreatophytic shrubland indicated that aem has significant advantages in carbon water cycle simulation in arid areas at the same time by investigating a large number of literature data and measured data the ability of different pfts to respond to different gradient environmental factors precipitation temperature and co2 was evaluated and calibrated zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 the results all show that the aem model can effectively capture the carbon and water cycle dynamics of vegetation in arid regions and the ability of vegetation to respond to climate change is highly consistent with the actual response pattern zhu et al 2020 in this study the newly acquired site flux data juhuatai station and fukang station were used to further validate the model s ability to simulate the et of arid vegetation among them the fukang station is dominated by desert shrubs 43 27 n 87 09 e observation time is 2004 while the juhua station is dominated by middle meadows 44 17 n 87 55 e observation time is 2017 2019 the time step of all observation data is hourly data and the daily scale data required for model validation is generated after quality control processing such as missing value interpolation and outlier elimination since the original data observed by the ec system are original records of high frequency turbulence at 10 hz these high frequency signals are converted into mean values variances and covariances the original data needs to be checked and preprocessed mainly including ①conversion of the sensor output electronic signal to represent micrometeorological variables ② check the abnormal sign of the sensor signal and check the physical threshold of the original signal ③remove wild points to eliminate the abnormality of the original signal due to electronic noise generally data with a variance greater than 4 6 times 4 6σ are removed from the time series ④ calculate the time lag of the h2o co2 ch4 signals relative to the ultrasonic anemometer and perform time lag compensation ⑤ some necessary parameters in the given flux calculation process in the flux calculation process several important corrections are also included mainly ①spectral correction frequency loss correction ②coordinate rotation correction tilt correction ③gas density correction webb pearman leuning wpl correction finally use eddypro software to perform the above processing and correction on the raw data and calculate the half hour scale flux data we then performed quality control on the acquired half hour scale flux data quality control qc is the basis of final flux data product quality assurance qa mainly include ①data label elimination ② abnormal data elimination etc in addition to the quality control of the observed data of eddy related fluxes it is necessary to further evaluate the reliability of the observed data of eddy related fluxes the energy closure degree of the two sites is greater than 80 chen et al 2015 li et al 2021 the energy closure error mainly comes from the spatial sampling error and the neglect of the soil thermal energy storage above the soil heat flux plate but generally meet the needs of flux observation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model description we use the aem model a process model specially designed for the special physiological and ecological structure of vegetation in temperate deserts to analyze the hydrological cycle characteristics of the ecosystems in the arid region of central asia the aem model operates on a daily scale and the main modules include photosynthesis energy balance hydrological cycle and soil biochemical modules zhang et al 2013 among them the water cycle is driven by absorbed solar radiation and photosynthesis is driven by photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the tree canopy in the aem the water cycle is driven by absorbed solar radiation srad and photosynthesis is driven by canopy absorbed photosynthetic active radiation par the canopy is divided into sunlit and shaded fractions in which photosynthesis and evapotranspiration et were estimated independently a fraction of srad is intercepted by canopy the rest srad energy is absorbed by the soil surface likewise a fraction of daily precipitation is intercepted by the canopy throughfall and irrigated water enter the soil and move downward during this process driven by the solar radiation absorbed by the canopy and soil surface water leaves the ecosystem through a series of energy exchange processes snow sublimation evaporation and transpiration the energy exchanges and potential evapotranspiration rate are estimated using the penman monteith approach wigmosta et al 1994 the actual transpiration rate is determined by two factors the water demanded by the plants to support potential transpiration and the maximum water uptake capacity of the root system under the current soil moisture condition water movement through the groundwater soil root canopy atmosphere continuum is driven by the gradient of water potential between the different water compartments finally a portion of the input water will leave the ecosystem as either surface runoff or drainage flow the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis of the sunlit and shaded canopies in an ecosystem or forest stand are added to derive the ecosystem stand level primary productivity and canopy evapotranspiration then the canopy evapotranspiration and the soil evaporation are added to derive the ecosystem stand level evapotranspiration if a unit study area i e a grid pixel is composed by multiple ecosystem type then the ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration of each ecosystem are integrated by area weighted linear combination to derive the ecosystem productivity and evapotranspiration of the unit study area because the processes of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration are modelled at leaf to canopy levels and then scaled up to ecosystem and regional levels the nonlinear responses of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to climate changes from various pfts could be conserved and integrated by our simulation et calculation can be divided into the following parts et t r e plant s plant e soil s ground t r is canopy transpiration e plant and e soil are precipitation intercepted by vegetation and evaporation from soil surface respectively s plant and s ground are the snow sublimation of the vegetation canopy and the soil surface respectively the transpiration t r of the vegetation canopy can be calculated from two parts the sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves t r t r sunlit la i sunlit t r shaded la i shaded among them t r sunlit t r shaded are the transpiration of sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves respectively la i sunlit la i shaded are the lai of sunlit leaves and the shaded leaves respectively the transpiration of shaded and sunlit leaves of vegetation is calculated by penman monteith equation wigmosta et al 1994 t r j s l p r n j ρ c p vpd r a slp γ 1 r s j r a λ v slp pa c is the slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature curve r n j is the net radiation energy absorbed by the sunlit or shaded leaf j indicates the sunlit leaf or shaded leaf ρ g m3 is the air density cp j g c is the specific heat of air at constant pressure vpd vapor pressure deficit ra s m is the aerodynamic resistance to vapor transport γ pa c is the psychrometric constant r s j s m is the sunlit or shaded canopy resistance to vapor transport λ v j kg is the latent heat of vaporization of water e soil is also calculated according to penman monteith the specific calculated method of e plant s plant s ground is detailed in zhang et al 2013 which also detailed the distribution of energy between the sunlit canopy the shady canopy and the soil surface and details of the daily balance of leaf interception and snow ponds 2 3 2 factorial experiments in this study simulation experiments of different scenarios were designed to isolate and quantify the relative contributions of different environmental factors to t et and factor analysis was used to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of multiple environmental factors a total of 5 experimental scenarios were designed for factor analysis ① s o v e r a l l simulates real scenarios that is t or et dynamics under climate change and the interaction of multiple climate factors ② s c o 2 f e r t simulates a scenario in which only co2 concentrations change while other climate factors remain constant maintaining equilibrium ③ s p r e c i p t a t i o n simulates scenarios in which only precipitation changes and other climate factors and co2 remain unchanged ④ s t e m p e r a t u r e simulates a scenario in which only temperature changes maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature and other climate factors as well as co2 remain unchanged ⑤ s c l i m a t e climate change operates at the actual state while co2 remains unchanged at the initial state of 1980 the variations in t et and t et from 1980 to 2020 were calculated by comparing the average values from 2000 to 2020 and from 1980 to 1999 the specific formula is as follows overal l effect va

experimental scenario table 2 for all simulations carbon water cycle processes were initialized using the same strategy consisting of two steps at the first step the aem model was run for 3000 years using co2 concentration in 1980 and the equilibrium climate constituted by the mean climate from 1980 to 1989 to allow all carbon water processes approach equilibrium states at the second step the model was further run for 10 years using co2 concentration in 1980 and the detrended climate data during 1980 to 1989 to eliminate possible biases of carbon water processes li et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 then the aem model was run for the period from 1980 to 2020 with temporally variant or invariant climate and co2 concentration data table 2 when single element simulation is performed the aem model was run with the temporally variant element and the other elements remain unchanged driven by equilibrium climate which was generated using the average climate data in the generation of equilibrium climate trends of climate variables were removed while their day to day variations were remained 3 results and analysis 3 1 aem validation due to the optimized root system architecture and root water absorption method the aem model has significant advantages in simulating the water cycle of vegetation in arid regions using the newly acquired flux data of juhuatai the site is a typical weedy meadow and the constructive species are mainly geranium sp potentilla sp poa sp and codonopsis clematidea schrenk c b clarke and fukang stations the ecosystem is a typical temperate desert in areas with shallow water tables 1 5 m natural vegetation is usually dominated by tamarix ramosissima in areas with deep water tables haloxylon ammodendron typically dominates shrub communities to compare and verify the simulation results it is found that the correlation r square between the aem simulated et results and the measured data is 0 82 y 0 66x 0 47 p 0 05 and 0 90 y 1 32x 0 05 p 0 05 the five day moving average simulated values matched well with the measured values however it was also found that the aem simulated et values were overestimated during the peak growth season doy 175 to doy 233 which may be related to the overestimation of the cfsr reanalysis precipitation data input to the model in arid regions fig 2 b doy 1 to doy 90 affected by equipment failure no valid data was detected 3 2 spatiotemporal pattern of t et et t and precipitation in central asia ecosystems from 1980 to 2020 central asia ecosystems experienced a significant climate change and the precipitation showed a significant downward trend 1 94 mm a fig 3 except for the tianshan mountains and altay mountains with an increasing precipitation pattern 1 5 mm a 77 of central asia showed decreased precipitation mainly concentrated in southern xinjiang of china 10 mm a and northern kazakhstan steppe 5 mm a fig 4 d the precipitation during the decade from 1998 to 2008 was only 80 of the multi year average and the la niña phenomenon may be the main reason for the decrease in precipitation in central asia during this period li et al 2015 in the past four decades the temperature in central asia has been generally rise 0 2 c 10a higher than the global warming rate of 0 18 10a https www climate gov the increase in temperature and the decrease in precipitation further aggravated the living conditions of vegetation in central asia ecosystems under the influence of the coupling effect of climate change and co2 the et and t and the ratio of t et in the central asian ecosystem showed a significant interannual variation trend during 1980 to 2020 et and t showed a significantly declining trend in central asia ecosystems variation rates were 0 92 mm a and 0 69 mm a p 0 01 respectively the areas with more severe decline are the southern xinjiang region of china and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan affected by warming and decreasing precipitation evaporation is intense in these areas and vegetation transpiration and photosynthesis are significantly limited although t et remained relatively stable on the whole the annual value ranged from 0 42 to 0 55 and change rate 0 001 p 0 01 however from the spatial change map we find that the increase in t et in areas with abundant precipitation such as tianshan mountainous areas change rate usually 5 10 3 covers the declining trend of extreme desert areas in southern xinjiang 7 10 3 and the two major desert areas kara kum desert and kyzyl kum desert 3 10 3 7 10 3 in southern central asia figs 3 and 4 show that precipitation is the decisive factor for the variation of t et and t et in the central asian ecosystem r square is 0 60 0 59 and 0 46 p 0 01 respectively and the effect of precipitation on biotic factors t was greater than that on abiotic factors e r square 0 41 p 0 01 according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region the main vegetation type is non phreatophytic shrub and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan the main vegetation type is grassland and it is traditional pastoral area are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian 3 3 separating and quantifying the impact of different environmental factors on t et although the study found that precipitation is the dominant factor affecting vegetation in central asia figs 3 4 the relative contributions and specific magnitudes of precipitation and other factors to the variations of ecosystems et t and t et were still unclear therefore we designed five scenarios table 2 used six formulas to decompose and quantify the individual effects of precipitation temperature and co2 enrichment and analyzed the interactive effects between climate change and co2 the results show that the coupling effect of different factors overall effect has a negative effect on t 17 95 mm a in which climate change 18 35 mm a and its important component precipitation 21 96 mm a contribute most of it the individual effects of temperature changes on t presents a positive promotion but not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in t due to reduced precipitation accounting for only 19 of the precipitation effect the effect of co2 enrichment on t is almost negligible probably because desert vegetation is insensitive to co2 in the context of severe drought stress zhang et al 2017 moreover we found that the positive effect of temperature changes on t and et is reversed when it affects t et showing a negative effect affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative 0 31 mm a in addition although et contains the abiotic component e the overall pattern is similar to t with an overall decrease of 20 mm a over the past four decades in general according to the influence degree of environmental factors on variables t et and t et the order is precipitation individual factor climate change coupling effect temperature individual effect co2 individual effect interactive effect c o 2 f e r t c l i m a t e in order to further accurately identify the impact of different environmental factors on different pfts the study refined the response pattern of t et and the ratio of t et in major pfts in central asia ecosystems fig 6 indicated that the importance of precipitation effect varies significantly across different pfts ps and bdf are most affected by precipitation on the one hand ps and bdf have experienced a significant decrease in precipitation 93 mm and 125 mm respectively during the past decades and the decline rate is much higher than that of other vegetation types on the other hand the representative vegetation of ps tamarix is mainly distributed in the desert edge of the arid and water deficient southern xinjiang fig 1 in addition the bdf is located in the valley and its living conditions are worse than the upper mountain forest areas where enf is located from fig 6 we can see that although crp also experienced a large drop in precipitation 67 mm its t et t et rose against the trend this is because the managed crops are affected by human management and their water and fertilizer conditions are sufficient less restricted by natural conditions the influence of temperature effect on various vegetation types is relatively intuitive with the increase of temperature the t and et of various vegetation generally increase but because the increase of t is smaller than that of et which caused a negative feedback of t et on warming it is generally believed that the effect of co2 enrichment will significantly promote vegetation photosynthesis and reduces transpiration at the leaf ecosystem scale ueyama et al 2020 however we found that the effect of co2 enrichment on vegetation t in arid areas is mainly in forest ps and crp drought stressed vegetation is insensitive to co2 response possibly because more photosynthates are allocated to roots resulting in leaf area declination or even leaf abscission and dormancy in extreme cases naumburg et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 the effect of co2 on crp and ps is small and even has some promotion fig 6a this may be because farmland is not limited by precipitation and the vegetation leaf area shows an increasing trend at high co2 concentration although the stomatal conductance decreases the ecosystem overall t did not decrease significantly furthermore we identified the spatial patterns of the dominant climatic controls on t et and the ratio of t et dynamic pixel by pixel over central asia fig 7 on the spatial scale precipitation is still the main controlling factor of the central asian ecosystem mainly distributed in the extremely arid region in southern xinjiang of china and the sparse shrub desert region in the western part of central asia accounting for 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et of the total area of the study area respectively the temperature controlled areas are mainly distributed in the alpine tianshan mountains the altay mountains and the high latitude northern kazakhstan grasslands the common feature of these areas is that temperature is a stress factor that limits the development of ecosystems accounting for 12 et 14 t and 14 the ratio of t et of the study area it is generally believed that the co2 enrichment effect will increase the photosynthesis of vegetation reduce the stomatal conductance thereby reduce the vegetation transpiration and improve the water use efficiency of the vegetation and the co2 enrichment effect will show more sensitive characteristics when the precipitation decreases however this improvement in response efficiency is based on the fact that drought stress does not endanger the physiological structure of the vegetation itself severe drought will cause the vegetation to allocate more photosynthetic products to the underground part resulting in a decrease in the leaf area of the vegetation this would cause the co2 enrichment effect at the ecosystem scale to be offset by the reduction in photosynthesis due to the decrease in vegetation leaf area from the spatial pattern we can also see that the effect of co2 enrichment on the et of central asian ecosystems is not significant compared to that of temperature and precipitation and is only sporadically distributed in mountainous areas with relatively good hydrothermal conditions mainly bdf and enf and the northern steppe region of kazakhstan since the effect of co2 enrichment on t or et was not significant the interactive effect between co2 and climate change c o 2 f e r t c l i m a t e often co appeared in areas with more significant climate change or more sensitive to co2 response 4 discussion 4 1 the characteristics of dry land t et and its comparison with previous studies the t et 0 42 0 54 of the arid region of central asia simulated by the aem model is generally smaller than the global observation mean estimated by the isotope based method 0 64 0 13 good et al 2015 higher than the simulation results 0 41 0 11 by multi models of cmip5 coupled model inter comparison project 5 lian et al 2018 this is because the overall t et in arid regions is smaller than that of vegetation in non arid regions in addition to the results of lian et al 2018 which are generally considered to be underestimated wei et al 2017 comparing the results in other arid area lu et al 2017 used the isotope technique method to measure the value 0 46 in hyper arid southern california in usa which is similar to the result of this study slightly higher than that 0 41 of guo et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018 using the isotope technique method in arid tibetan plateau china and semiarid northeastern china the simulated values of t et for different vegetation types in this study were comparable to those of previous studies table 2 for example we found that the t et of different forest types obtained by different methods was not consistent range from 0 50 to 0 79 ren et al 2019 and the t et values 0 42 0 57 of enf in the tianshan mountains of central asia in this study is close to this range and is comparable to zhou et al 2016 calculated enf t et 0 56 by using 17 site data however the lower limit of bdf 0 24 0 68 is slightly lower than this range mainly because the bdf in central asia is dominated by populus euphratica forests which tend to live in extremely arid desert areas chen and luo 2013 compared to enf in upper mountain forest areas where the background precipitation was higher and temperature was lower its physiological characteristics are more inclined to the desert shrubs with weak transpiration and strong evaporation central asian desert shrubs are divided into two types phreatophytic shrub e g tamarix ps and non phreatophytic shrub e g haloxylon ammonica nps the t et value 0 42 of non phreatophytic shrub was comparable to the field measurement values of cavanaugh et al 2011 at the creosote site lucky hills site in usa 0 37 0 44 or fang et al 2019 in yan an china 0 41 0 42 respectively nps is generally smaller than that of ps 0 49 this is because ps can rely on the developed root system to absorb groundwater to supplement themselves while utilizing external precipitation thereby promoting the growth of vegetation similarly we found that the mean t et of forests 0 51 and farmland ecosystems 0 54 with relatively good water and heat conditions was significantly larger than that of grasslands 0 49 under arid background which also indicates that precipitation can often greatly improve vegetation growth in arid environment increase vegetation transpiration and then increase the t et value 4 2 the distribution characteristics of main control factors and its influence on t et it is difficult to separate and quantify the main controlling factors of t et and the relative contributions between different factors based on site or remote sensing methods based on model controlled experiments this study not only analyzed the spatial response pattern of each pfts t et to different environmental factors but also quantified the relative contributions of different factors although it is generally believed that temperature and precipitation are the main control variables of t et in temperate desert ecosystems our results show that precipitation occupies an absolute dominant position among the factors affecting t et in arid regions accounting for 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et of the total area of the study area respectively fig 7 only farmland ecosystems were affected by human management irrigation etc and their t et changes were not sensitive to precipitation responses we found that precipitation was positively correlated with t et and t et overall r square is 0 60 0 59 and 0 46 p 0 01 respectively for example due to the topographic effect a large amount of precipitation is formed on the northwest windward slope of the tianshan mountains which will maintain the growth of forests represented by enf thereby increasing the evapotranspiration of the ecosystem this is also the main reason for the increase of t and et on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains fig 4a 4b this is also consistent with niu et al 2019 s finding that in the context of drought an increase in precipitation would cause t et to increase by promoting vegetation growth previous studies have shown that temperature often alters the t et ratio by altering the stomatal conductance of vegetation zhu et al 2015 warming modulates the vapor pressure deficit inside and outside the leaf which in turn alters vegetation transpiration and evapotranspiration rates niu et al 2019 central asia has experienced a significant temperature increase over the past four decades which generally promotes vegetation transpiration as well as soil evaporation fig 5 however the increase in vegetation photosynthetic rate and transpiration caused by temperature increase is offset by the water shortage e increase caused by temperature increase resulting in t et being insensitive to the temperature effect and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation fig 5 in addition some studies suggest that the response of semi arid ecosystems to temperature changes is often regulated by precipitation mueller et al 2016 therefore although the arid regions of central asia will continue to warm at a rate exceeding the global average in the future the temperature increase may not have a direct and significant impact on the t et of arid region ecosystems it is generally believed that the increase of co2 concentration will reduce the stomatal conductance at the leaf scale but at the same time it will increase the transpiration area at the ecosystem scale co2 enrichment effect leads to an increase in lai which partially compensates for the decrease in stomatal conductance due to the increase in co2 concentration stoy et al 2019 our study found that elevated co2 generally increased ecosystem transpiration rates fig 5 but different vegetation types had different response characteristics fig 6 ps can provide groundwater replenishment due to the developed underground root system and crp due to artificial management irrigation etc resulting in the effect of co2 enrichment on lai which increases transpiration larger than the reduction of leaf scale transpiration rate other vegetation types under drought stress tend to transfer a large number of photosynthetic products to the underground root system reduce the leaf area above ground or use dormancy to alleviate the water loss caused by transpiration naumburg et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 we not only quantified the individual effects of different factors but also assessed the interactive effect between co2 and climate change using factorial analysis it is generally believed that elevated co2 will increase vegetation photosynthesis and reduce vegetation transpiration thereby improving water use efficiency however when the coupled effects of climate change and co2 are superimposed and analyzed there are often large uncertainties this study found that the interactive effect reduced et and t and promoted t et by designing a multi scenario experiment this finding is supported by previous modeling studies that found the interactive effect between climate change and co2 negatively influenced et zhu et al 2020 we also found that the vegetation response under extreme drought conditions is not sensitive to co2 while climate change generally has a negative effect and dominates the interactive effect with co2 which indicates that the co2 enrichment effect is not enough to offset the negative effects of climate change 4 3 the implications and model uncertainty the ratio of t to et characterizes how the ecosystem water vapor flux is allocated between physical and biological processes kool et al 2014 li et al 2020 ren et al 2019 we find that precipitation dominates the areas of 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively although some studies have shown that the correlation between precipitation and t et has greater uncertainty for example some studies have found that precipitation shows a positive effect li et al 2015 or shows a negative effect or no obvious response gu et al 2018 li et al 2019 this study found that precipitation is the positive factor that dominates t et changes in the arid regions of central asia especially in the extreme arid regions of southern xinjiang and the central and western regions fig 7 this finding is relatively consistent with previous studies that precipitation not only dominated the change pattern of vegetation npp zhang et al 2017 but also played a decisive role in et zhu et al 2020 based on cmip5 data it is shown that under different climate scenarios in the future the precipitation in southern xinjiang mainly shrubs such as haloxylon ammonium and tamarix will decrease significantly which will further aggravate the water stress of regional vegetation and t et may further decrease in the arid steppe region of northern kazakhstan the future precipitation will increase 3 9 mm 10a zhang et al 2017 which will alleviate the current drought stress pattern promote vegetation growth and increase t et we also found that the effect of temperature on vegetation t et is small fig 5 and 7 so the general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation t et in the future we may need to pay more attention to the effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on t et caused by future warming in addition aem may underestimate the temperature effect to a certain extent fig 5 although the aem model considers the direct effect of temperature on photosynthesis it does not consider the effect of vpd changes caused by increasing temperature on stomatal conductance some studies have found that vpd can better explain and illustrate the change pattern of vegetation productivity than precipitation konings et al 2017 model methods tend to underestimate large scale regional t et patterns chang et al 2018 because model methods often overlook or have cognitive defects of water vapor diffusion from the rising falling evaporating surface in the soil to the soil surface the aem model firstly considers the structural characteristics of the vegetation canopy in arid regions in order to better simulate the energy distribution of the vegetation canopy in arid regions second the differences in carbon water and energy cycles between deep rooted vegetation such as tamarix etc unique to central asia rain fed shallow rooted vegetation such as haloxylon ammonium haloxylon ammonium etc and zonal vegetation with vertical root system distribution that can fully utilize the water in the suspended soil layer to grow in detail are distinguished in central asia third combined with the soil water potential and the hydrodynamic conductance of plants the one dimensional richards equation was used to simulate the transport of water in the continuum of groundwater soil unsaturated zone root zone hairy root lateral root tap root stem leaf atmosphere moving process by characterizing the unique groundwater distribution in temperate deserts such as the soil suspension moisture layer we can consider the compensation mechanism for plants to utilize water in different soil layers under extreme water shortages leib et al 2006 this leads to the relative reliability of the simulation results table 3 nevertheless some uncertainties inevitably exist in this study for example we analyzed the impact of climate change effects on ecosystem t et but ignoring changes in land use and land cover will lead to uncertainties in the assessment of carbon and water cycles in arid regions for example previous study han et al 2012 found that in the 1990s after the disintegration of the soviet union the phenomenon of farmland abandonment occurred from time to time and about 22 of the farmland was abandoned although the farmland accounted for a small area in central asia the net change in cropland area was smaller and recovered in the 2000s but this uncertainty also requires attention after the 2000s the natural land use change was small 5 in central asia chen et al 2014 and the uncertainty caused by the effects of land use change was minimized in addition due to the fact that central asia is located in the hinterland of eurasia climate station sites are very scarce we use the well performing cfsr reanalysis meteorological data in central asia as the driving data for the model this dataset has been used by numerous studies li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 and achieved good results however some studies have also found that the precipitation data of this dataset is overestimated to a certain extent in the arid regions of central asia hu et al 2014 because majority of the croplands in central asia located in plains which generally had an arid semiarid climate background we assumed the croplands in our study area were irrigated this assumption however may lead to overestimated photosynthesis and underestimated drought effects on those rainfed crops in the study area furthermore the aem model does not consider the impact of different irrigation methods drip irrigation flood irrigation etc on the farmland ecosystem on the one hand the aem model s main advantage is to depict the structural characteristics of desert vegetation which has certain limitations on the farmland ecosystem on the other hand farmland is not the main vegetation type in central asia which will not have a significant impact on our results since we assume that there is no water shortage in irrigated farmland its et responds more to temperature than to precipitation under the background of high co2 concentration the crop leaf area shows an increasing trend fig 6 additional in previous studies li et al 2013 zhang and ren 2017 fang et al 2019 we found that temperature and precipitation are key to the carbon water cycle of central asian ecosystems although the relative humidity and shortwave radiation were among the climate drivers in the s overall and s climate simulation their effects were not analyzed because previous studies and our preliminary research indicated that the interannual changes in relative humidity and shortwave radiation were small and had relatively weak influences on the dynamics of et and carbon stock in the study area 5 conclusion in this study the individual and interactive effect of multi environmental factor climate change and co2 etc on the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration over central asia ecosystems were calculated using the aem model based on climate scenarios and factor analysis we found the aem model performed well for different plant functional types in typical drylands in central asia we also evaluated spatiotemporal pattern of the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration in central asia the result indicated that precipitation dominated the areas of 86 et 77 t and 71 the ratio of t et in the arid region of central asia respectively the effect of temperature on the ratio of t et was negative and slight and the temperature increase effect is only 9 7 of the negative effect of precipitation affected by the insignificant effect of co2 enrichment on t the interactive effect between climate change and co2 effect appear to be little and negative according to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation we found that the southern xinjiang region and the turgay plateau in northwestern kazakhstan are the ecologically vulnerable areas in central asian the results also indicated that general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation t et in the future we may need to pay more attention to the effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on t et caused by future warming declaration of competing interest the authors declare

24232,blue crabs callinectes sapidus support valuable fisheries in the us mid atlantic bight mab and their unpredictable and variable recruitment suggests that a better understanding of larval development and dispersal is needed blue crab larval dispersal involves export to the continental shelf followed by re entry of estuaries transport is facilitated by wind and buoyancy driven surface currents and zoeae generally maintain a near surface distribution though several studies have investigated c sapidus larval dispersal none have evaluated the effects of behavioral variability on transport this study simulates first stage larvae using documented behavioral variation within an idealized wind driven estuarine plume in order to investigate the roles of swimming behavior stratified current systems and turbulent mixing on transport model results showed that larval transport was predominately influenced by wind speed but transport was significantly affected by behavioral characteristics faster swimming larvae were more able to maintain a near surface position and had more control over their vertical position despite vertical diffusivity and in all model scenarios larvae travelled farther and had different vertical distributions than passive particles modeled net transport distance of simulated broods differed by a factor of 1 8 with a maximum 4 7 fold difference between any individual larvae and in all scenarios behaving larvae showed further net transport and a shallower vertical distribution than passive particles these results indicate that

introduction high inter annual variability in blue crab callinectes sapidus recruitment creates challenges for long term management and predicting patterns of larval settlement is not yet possible due to critical gaps in understanding early life stage processes while models of c sapidus larval dispersal exist for the mid atlantic bight mab a thorough review can be found in epifanio and cohen 2016 critical knowledge gaps in early life stage processes and biophysical interactions limit our understanding of c sapidus dispersal population connectivity and the spatial distribution of recruits across a variety of taxa larval dispersal distance is inadequately explained solely by passive transport kingsford et al 2002 metaxas and saunders 2009 pineda and reyns 2018 particularly for species with long pelagic larval durations shanks 2009 and larval behavior in general can greatly influence how larvae disperse mcedward 1995 pineda et al 2007 several laboratory studies have identified complex swimming behavior in c sapidus larvae often regulated by environmental conditions epifanio and cohen 2016 forward and buswell 1989 sulkin et al 1980 yet c sapidus larval dispersal models typically treat larvae as either passive particles moving within the upper few meters of the water column garvine et al 1997 johnson and hess 1990 tilburg et al 2009a or with a fixed vertical distribution of larvae criales et al 2019 as yet c sapidus larval dispersal model have not considered the impact of more complex behaviors on dispersal processes after hatching near the mouths of estuaries blue crab larvae zoeae swim to the surface and are exported onto the continental shelf where they undergo 7 8 molt stages over a 30 40 day duration before metamorphosis costlow and bookhout 1959 current understanding of blue crab larval dispersal in the mab epifanio and tilburg 2008 dictates that larvae are carried southward via a near shore buoyancy driven surface current recruitment back to their parental estuary can occur when upwelling currents maintain larvae in an offshore reducing along shore transport epifanio and garvine 2001 eventually wind driven downwelling events bring larvae back into estarine habitats epifanio and garvine 2001 this hypothetical recruitment pathway for larvae necessitates that they remain in these surface currents to successfully reenter estuarine habitat though it is often reported that blue crab zoeae exist entirely within the neuston epifanio 1995 field sampling shows their vertical position can extend several meters below the surface provenzano 1983 smyth 1980 likely due to a combination of swimming behavior and vertical mixing laboratory studies have demonstrated swimming responses of c sapidus zoeae to temperature salinity light gravity pressure forward and buswell 1989 sulkin et al 1980 as well as turbulence in megalopae welch et al 1999 early stage larvae exhibit negative geotaxis and high barokinesis resulting in continual upward swimming sulkin 1984 in situ zoeae presumably stop swimming for some time and resume swimming once triggered by depth or time dependent cues additionally since zoeae occupy the turbulent suface mixed layer vertical mixing should prevent zoeae from staying exclusively within the neuston c sapidus zoeal swimming ability is a function of both behavior and morphology zoeal swimming appendage length is an indicator of vertical velocity the verticality and straightness of swimming trajectories while dorsal cross sectional area is a strong indicator of maximum swimming speed caracappa and munroe 2019 recent work has shown that the offspring of different female crabs broods can differ in both morphological and behavioral characteristics caracappa and munroe 2019 2018 zoeae from different broods have been observed to swim at speeds varying by a factor of three which was partially explained by corresponding differences in morphology caracappa and munroe 2019 despite natural variation in traits being expected within a population when combined with the physical processes of dispersal the resulting larval transport patterns may partially depend on a zoea s parentage the potential for maternal influences to affect offsprings dispersal trajectories may have further implications on blue crab metapopulation dynamics specifically female crabs in the same location could contribute to settling habitats differently by virtue of their offsprings behavioral and morphological characteristics c sapidus larvae develop on the inner continental shelf in the mab where circulation is primarily governed by the buoyant outflow of large riverine estuaries and wind driven ekman dynamics garvine et al 1997 with an overlaying southwest mean current lentz 2008 yankovsky et al 2000 the southward elongation of these estuarine plumes creates a fresher and stratified region were zoeae are often retained ruzecki 1981 episodic and seasonal changes in wind direction can cause offshore or inshore transport of near surface waters and result in retention or expulsion of zoeae from the proximity of natal estuaries epifanio 1995 additionally vertically sheared currents can be generated by wind stress and friction craig 1996 richman et al 1987 and wind stress and breaking waves result in an increasing vertical diffusivity with depth influencing the larval vertical position visser 1997 several studies have modeled callinectes sapidus larval dispersal in the mab but to our knowledge none have considered the effects of complex individualized behaviors early models of c sapidus dispersal involved lagragian transport of buoyant particles near the mouth of cheapeake bay johnson 1985 johnson et al 1984 identifying the importance of wind driven and buoyancy driven features in particle transport improvements to similar models sought to provide possible reinvasion mechanisms for blue crab larvae garvine et al 1997 johnson and hess 1990 later studies using improved circulation models proposed possible offshore retention of zoeae such that groups of larvae can stay relatively close to natal estuaries and facilitate later reinvasion tilburg et al 2009b 2007 2005 more recent models have shown success with incorporating behaving criales et al 2019 and surface drifting giltz et al 2020 particles though larval behavior was treated as uniform the goal of this study was to use model simulations of an idealized estuarine plume over the continental shelf in order to explore how behavioral physical interactions may influence the transport of c sapidus larvae while incorporating recent observational and experimental data our objectives were to 1 formulate a hypothetical larval behavior model for first stage c sapidus zoeae 2 estimate the degree to which larval behaviors influence transport with respect to passive transport and 3 quantify the effects of brood level behavioral differences on larval transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 model design all parameter names and definitions are listed in table 1 the following idealized physical simulation was chosen over more complex modeling frameworks like roms as the behaviors investigated in this study require a near surface vertical resolution on a centimeter scale much smaller than existing roms products for the region the development of a higher resolution product would have been impractical without adequate support that such behaviors are relevant for c sapidus larval dispersal processes larval transport was simulated in an idealized two layer estuarine plume in upwelling conditions over a continental shelf with an unbounded horizontal plane and a depth of 50 m horizontal advection was driven entirely by a wind driven ekman velocity profile under constant northward wind stress simulations were set to be in the northern hemisphere with positive x u velocity as eastward along plume and positive y v velocity as northward across plume other vertical processes e g upwelling and downwelling events have been shown to influence larval settlement epifanio and garvine 2001 shanks and brink 2005 sponaugle et al 2002 they occur at speeds that would dominate over any larval behaviors as such no vertical advection was present besides for that generated from vertical diffusivity to more easily isolate behavior effects in conditions where larvae are more likely to have control over their vertical position the depth of the estuarine plume zp was defined using a model by fong and geyer 2001 which was developed to investigate the dynamics of riverine plumes similar to that occupied by c sapidus zoeae in the mab 1 z p 4 r i c τ f ρ 0 2 g ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 3 where ρ0 is the mean density of seawater within the plume 1019 kg m 3 ρ is the density of the bottom layer

observations whitney and garvine 2005 and while measured before typical spawning april may they provide a reasonable upper bound on annual plume stratification although not necessarily representative of extreme events or climatological averages given the high ineterannual variability in estuarine export jiang and xia 2016 it may be necessary to simulate a dynamic plume depth in future iterations horizontal velocity profiles were then defined as a steady state ekman system with a constant northward wind pond and pickard 1983 2 u z 2 π τ z p ρ 0 f cos π 4 π z p z e π z p z 3 v z 2 π τ z p ρ 0 f sin π 4 π z p z e π z p z where z is the depth in meters the usage of zp as the ekman depth constrains the flow to within the estuarine plume a vertical diffusivity kz profile was also specified by 4

was based on a model by fong and geyer 2001 this parameterization of kz produced a differentiable diffusivity profile as a function of wind speed with a maximum kz at z p 2 and a maximum d k z d z at the surface and zp a cubic spline was used to create a smooth but rapid transition in kz at the plume interface i e pycnocline three physical scenarios were used that had unique kz and velocity profiles fig 1 each using a different constant wind speed 5 m s 1 10 m s 1 15 m s 1 these speeds ecompass the range in observations by the noaa ndbc cman4 station in the mouth of delaware bay usa https www ndbc noaa gov it was within each of these physical scenarios that various larval behavior configurations were investigated 2 2 larval behavior the in situ swimming behavior of c sapidus zoeae has not been well documented on short time scales so a two phased hypothetical behavioral model was used that includes elements of both laboratory and field observations this behavioral model presumes that while generally surface keeping c sapidus zoeae cease swimming periodically and are cued to resume swimming by a depth cue these short oscillations have been observed in laboratory conditions caracappa and munroe 2019 but have not been measured in the coastal ocean in the first phase larvae sink passively until they reach a hypothetical depth trigger dmax the hypothetical dmax parameter aims to reproduce a barokinetic response documented in laboratory settings sulkin et al 1980 but as a discrete environmental cue once reaching a depth of dmax a second swimming phase begins where larvae swim upwards until reaching the surface since the value dmax is uncertain three possible values 0 1 5 and 3 m were used econompassing the vertical distribution of observed zoeae provenzano 1983 in a still water column larvae with a nonzero dmax will vertically oscillate between the surface and their dmax in a sawtooth pattern fig 2 thus given a fixed swimming and sinking velocity dmax also determines the frequency of particles vertical oscillations this behavior differs from depth tracking as there is no evidence that larvae aggregate at any non surface depths but it does represent a type of depth regulation whereby larvae swim such that they stay above rather than at their dmax a dmax of 0 m results in constant upward swimming regardless of depth with no passive sinking phase as a hypothetical parameter dmax 0 m is treated as a control in the absence of turbulence particles would behave as buoyant surface drifters observations show that first stage c sapidus zoeae exhibit significant brood dependent morphology and swimming behavior caracappa and munroe 2019 2018 empirical relationships between swimming velocity and morphology were used to generate distributions of possible behaviors as there is no available data on paired swimming and sinking observations for individual larvae within a single brood four larval broods from caracappa munroe 2019 denoted groups a through d were used to generate behaviors these broods were selected due to their significant differences in both swimming velocity and morphology a composite group using the combined distribution of all larvae measured in caracappa and munroe 2019 was also used group o totaling 5 larval groups individual swimming and sinking velocities were generated from the dorsal cross sectional area ad a highly correlated morphometric upward swimming velocity wswim was best approximated an exponential function of ad and a normally distributed error term with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation equal to that of the residuals of the regression fig 3 table 2 an exponential relationship was chosen to constrain wswim to positive values a random value of ad was drawn for each larvae based on observed distributions within each group and a corresponding wswim was generated sinking velocity wsink was estimated using morphology and a force balance including drag gravitational sinking and buoyancy 6 w s i n k 2 g v l ρ l ρ f ρ f a a c d where g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 ρl is the density of larvae 1066 kg m 3 fuchs and low unpublished data vl is an

range for zoeae including c sapidus 0 6 to 10 based on estiamtes from caracappa and munroe 2019 linear regressions were used to generate aa lc and vt for each larvae as a function of ad table 2 this allowed for individual and brood variation in wsink and wswim to be generated from the same morphometric data table 3 2 3 inclusion of turbulent motion simulated particles moved individually and exhibited vertical motion based on a turbulence behavior model by ross sharples 2004 which accounts for spatially non uniform diffusivity this discrete time equation determines the particle depth at the next timestep zn 1 based on its current depth zn 9 z n 1 z n δ k z z n δ z δ t r 2 r k z z n 1 2 δ k z z n δ z δ t δ t 1 2 w p δ t where t is the discrete time increment 1 s r is a uniformly distributed random number between 1 and 1 r is the variance of r 1 3 and wp is the directed particle velocity wswim or wsink depending on the behavioral phase the second term is deterministic and moves particles towards depths of increased diffusivity i e towards mid plume depths the third term is a stochastic and nonlinear process with a random direction and increasing magnitude with depth the final term represents the directed motion of larvae a simple reflective boundary was used such that if particles were transported vertically beyond the top or bottom boundary in the next timestep they were reflected proportionally inward 10 z n 1 z n z n 1 0 2 h z n 1 z n 1 h to more clearly distinguish the interactions between physical processes and larval behaviors the only physical processes acting on simulated larvae were vertical diffusivity and horizontal currents for all simulations horizontal diffusivity was absent as it would have affected all larvae equally regardless of behavior 2 4 model implementation and analysis all simulations and statistical analyses were implemented in r r core team 2015 in each model configuration 10 000 particles were released at the same horizontal position at 1 m depth and their x y z position was tracked for 4 simulated days the typical duration of first stage c sapidus zoeae costlow and bookhout 1959 only first stage processes were considered since individualized swimming behaviors have not been reported for older zoeae the number of particles exceeds that needed to reach less than 5 unexplained variance simons et al 2013 and allowed for a smooth distribution of particle positions a timestep of 1 s was used meeting criteria proposed by ross and sharples 2004 and positional data was recorded every 10 min the net horizontal transport s was then calculated as the euclidean distance between the final and initial x y coordinates excluding differences in vertical position the net transport in the x along plume and y cross plume directions were also calculated as xnet and ynet respectively since transport metrics were not normally distributed a median was used as the central statistic with the median absolute deviation mad as a measure of dispersion net transport is not always the most relevant metric when predicting the larval recruitment pineda et al 2007 but it provides a useful indicator as to the degree that behavioral characteristics influence particle transport in a semi uniform physical environment the péclet number pe was calculated for all particles in each model configuration pe is a dimensionless metric relating to the ratio of diffusive and advective forces and can be used as an indicator of the dominant forces acting on swimming plankton karp boss et al 1996 pe is defined as 11 p e z p w s w i m k z where k z is the depth averaged between the surface and zp the fraction of simulated larvae with pe 1 was used to indicate whether larval motion during a given configuration was dominated by behavior or turbulence two distinct model scenarios were constructed each with several distinct physical and behavioral configurations in the behavior scenario particles had active swimming behaviors with 45 configurations including all combinations of wind speed 3 dmax 3 and larval group 5 in the passive scenario simulated larvae were neutrally buoyant and possessed no behavior wswim 0 ms 1 and wsink 0 ms 1 the passive scenario acted as a control for swimming behavior and included configurations for each of the three wind speeds for each scenario an anova was used to determine whether s differed between configurations of wind speed dmax and larval group kolmogorov smirnov k s tests were used to determine whether the distribution of s from configurations with behaving particles differed from the corresponding configuration with passive particles but the same physics an anova was used to determine whether the mean vertical position of particles at the final time step differed between model configurations k s tests were also used to evaluate whether mean particle depth differed in configurations with and without larval behavior the maximum theoretical transport smax was calculated for each combination of wind speed and dmax by evaluating the horizontal advection at one half dmax 12 s m a x t t o t u d m a x 2 2 v d m a x 2 2 where ttot is the total duration of the simulation 4 days this metric represents the mean horizontal advection a behaving particle would experience in the absence of turbulence due to the parameterization of the behavioral model any particle with dmax greater than 0 m would have a subsurface mean depth even if wswim was high thus smax is not equivalent to surface transport and provides a simple reference point to compare to realized net transport s and quantify the effect of turbulence on behaving particles 3 results 3 1 behaving particle scenarios for model configurations with behaving particles wind speed was the dominant factor where increased wind speed resulted in further transport in all cases fig 4 this was expected given that the mean current velocity scales with τ1 3 a 3 factor anova s wind dmax larval group table 4 showed a significant interaction between wind speed and dmax when dmax 0 m faster swimming larvae stay nearer to the surface at low wind speeds fig 5 and thus behave more like buoyant surface drifters as dmax increases net transport and its variability decline table 5 since larvae spend more time in deeper slower moving horizontal currents larval groups had significant effects on transport distances especially when dmax 0 m faster swimming broods were able to stay closer to the surface and transport further regardless of higher kz during stronger wind stress configurations as dmax increased particles were more evenly mixed vertically throughout the plume fig 5 and the brood effect was diminished when wind speed and kz increased brood difference in transport also increased for each larval group s showed a unimodal and a semi symmetrical distribution for particles with a non surface dmax fig 6 particles with dmax 0 m had more skewed distributions and median transport differed between larval groups the fasting swimming group a was transported significantly further than all other groups k s test p 0 001 as wind speed increased median vertical position decreased table 5 since larvae were more uniformly mixed throughout the plume layer when kz was high larvae acted more like passive particles transported by a depth averaged current along plume transport xnet was larger than cross plume transport ynet fig 4 model configuration parameters had similar effects on xnet as they did to s however at an intermediate plume depth particles experienced a reversal in cross plume flow resulting in a more southward trajectory than surface particles the effect of this flow reversal was evident from a strong interaction between wind speed and dmax on ynet fig 4 when dmax 0 m near surface larvae had a smaller ynet and as wind speed and kz increased larvae experience near zero depth averaged v velocity however as dmax increased stronger swimming larvae s behavior constrained them higher in the plume layer and were more likely to be positioned near the flow reversal depth ulitmately larvae with a deeper dmax experienced more southerly trajectories fig 7 3 2 passive particle scenarios in passive particle scenarios wind was a significant factor in determining net transport anova f 18 086 p 0 001 where faster winds increased net transport this was expected since horizontal advection scaled with wind stress and vertical advection was stochastic passive particles became uniformly distributed with depth throughout the plume within 1 2 h there was a slight aggregation of particles at the pycnoline fig 5 caused by the rapid decrease in kz to the background diffusivity over the course of the 4 day simulation particles had a deeper depth distribution in the lower layer but were still not uniformly distributed in all 45 configurations with behaving particles the distribution of s and vertical position differed from analogous configurations with passive particles k s p 0 001 indicating that even simple surface keeping behavior dmax 0 m may significantly alter larval transport when turbulent mixing is present even when mixing was minimized wind speed of 5 m s 1 behaving larvae with a dmax of 0 m had a mean vertical position one tenth of passive particles additionally the median s for all larval groups was greater than that of passive particles in the same physical conditions table 5 behaving particles at a 5 m s 1 wind speed and dmax 3 m behaved most like passive particles fig 4 when dmax was closer to the plume depth larvae spent more time in their sinking phase had a deeper depth distribution and had net transport fig 6 and trajectories fig 7 more like passive particles 3 3 swimming velocity and transport configurations with behaving particles showed that transport was related to larval swimming velocity and thus larval group there was a positive non linear relationship between s and wswim whereby faster swimming larvae were transported further but this relationship asymptotes at a maximum transport distance smax bounded by physical conditions and their dmax fig 8 if dmax 0 m this smax is defined by the horizontal advection at one half of dmax due to the larvae s oscillating behavior larvae with higher wswim travelled closer to smax when wind speed was lower and dmax 0 m the majority of larvae swam too slowly to reach smax in most model configurations as shown by their lower pe with the exception of configures with the slowest wind speeds the fraction of all simulated larvae whose péclet number exceeded one was calculated fig 9 pe depends on plume depth constant in this model larval swimming speeds and vertical diffusivity and is not affected by the dmax parameter thus pe is a characteristic of larval group and wind scenario only at a wind speed of 5 m s 1 at least 95 of zoeae from all larval groups had a pe 1 thus zoeae had control over their vertical position when wind speeds are low however as wind speed increased the proportion of larvae with pe 1 decreased and the difference in pe proportion between broods is more apparent when winds were 15 m s 1 88 of larvae the fastest swimming brood a and 30 of larvae from the slowest swimming brood d had pe 1 this disparity between broods explains why there is an increase in brood level differences in transport at higher wind speeds in no model configurations with behaving particles do all larvae have a pe 1 so broods never entirely act like passive particles in fact only at the fastest wind speed and for the slowest swimming broods c and d do a majority of the larvae have a pe 1 4 discussion 4 1 larval behavior and transport though the idealized plume structure and ekman dynamics in this model exclude other important physical processes upwelling winds are the dominant process that drives surface waters in the nearshore mid atlantic bight lentz 2008 lentz and largier 2006 rennie et al 1999 the simplicity of this model suited the scope of this study and facilitated the investigation of interactions between wind speed and larval behaviors even when hypothetical aspects of the larval behavior model are ignored i e when dmax 0 m larval traits still influenced transport via larvae s ability to counter vertical mixing the presence of behaviors does not guarantee changes in transport especially if larval swimming was not strong enough to counter turbulence however there was no model configuration were the majority of particles behaved as if they were passive particles even at high wind speeds and strong turbulence these results indicate that brood variation in c sapidus zoeal swimming behavior observed by caracappa and munroe 2019 could result in brood dependent larval transport despite most zooplankton lacking the ability to control their horizontal position via swimming many are able to exert control over their vertical position horizontal advection can vary substantially with depth i e sheared flow allowing vertical swimming behavior to alter larval trajectories in ways different than those predicted by passive transport alone metaxas 2001 shanks 2009 1995 behavior driven differences in larval transport have been simulated in models of larval bivalves munroe et al 2018 north et al 2008 corals szmant and meadows 2006 and other decapod crustaceans katz et al 1994 moksnes et al 2014 the vertical distribution of zoeae should be more uniform when winds are stronger but the response of c sapidus zoeae may also be affected by turbulence the results of this model align with field observations where under relatively calm conditions zoeae are heavily skewed towards the surface provenzano 1983 in constrast to c sapidus other estuarine crab species larvae develop within estuaries and exhibit selective tidal stream transport undergoing diel vertical migrations over several meters epifanio and cohen 2016 for carcinus maenas banas et al 2009 moksnes et al 2014 more complex biophysical models show that this behavior results in a larger degree of control over horizontal position than in the case of this study suggesting that while c sapidus larvae behavior may influence transport it is to a lesser degree than for other species since c sapidus larvae maintain a position near the surface and field sampling may be difficult under stronger wind conditions the potential influences of behavior may have been overlooked observations regarding the vertical distribution of zoeae as a function of wind speed or turbulence would fill critical data gaps and allow for further refinement of our behavioral model the nature of the dmax parameter and resulting vertical oscillations in are model are mostly hypothetical and presuppose a resting period that is triggered by depth though highly simplistic centimeter scale depth measurements at timescales of minutes are prohibitively difficult to measure in situ in the case that larvae do not experience a prolonged passive sinking phase dmax would be 0 m in still conditions laboratory behavioral experiments have not been done with deep enough encolosures to identify a true dmax despite the underlying larval swimming behavior in all scenarios constrained to vertical oscillation all model configurations showed that wind driven mixing resulted in complex patterns in vertical position over time the duration of either swimming or sinking phases varied greatly depending on the strength of the mixing and particles swimming speed despite the uncertainty in parameterizing potential swimming behavior brood dependent transport distance was still seen for surface keeping particles dmax 0 m larval behaviors included in this model reflected observation but they were based on experiments done under controlled and static conditions caracappa and munroe 2019 realistcally c sapidus larval behavior also varies with environmental conditions forward and cronin 1980 sulkin et al 1980 and molt stage sulkin et al 1980 however behavioral responses to some potentially important environmental conditions e g turbulence salinity temperature light food have not been studied or lack information needed to generate distributions of individualized behaviors these data gaps make it difficult to construct individual based models using more complex physical conditions and refined behaviors more experimental or in situ observations are needed to better understand the range of c sapidus larval behaviors and how they can interact with dispersal processes 4 2 behavioral variation the investigation of brood dependent larval dispersal in zoeae stems from recent experimental work multivariate morphological differences between larval broods have been documented in both c sapidus caracappa and munroe 2018 and pugettia quadridens tamura et al 2017 and brood dependent mortality to stressors has been documented in lithodes santolla di salvatore et al 2020 brood effects in c sapidus larvae have been shown to influence swimming behavior as well caracappa and munroe 2019 when incorporated into this model the 2 5 fold difference in swimming velocity between broods translated to a maximum 1 8 fold difference in transport distance however across all larvae irrespective of brood net transport distance varied by a factor of 2 during the slowest win speeds larval swimming velocity possessed highly skewed distributions which result in similarly skewed distributions of transport distance such that faster swimming larvae were transported further than their slower swimming analogues the magnitude of swimming and behavioral effects are evident when compared against net transport for passive particles which have shorter transport distances with narrower distributions brood effects were present in all configurations but were smaller at decreased wind speed and deeper d max thus brood effects and behavioral effects in general on transport may be situational and depend on local physical conditions the larval broods chosen for this study form a continuous overlapping distribution of swimming velocity but it is uncertain whether they are representative of the entire reproducing population the presence of possible outlier broods e g group a suggests a small subset of the reproducing population could produce larvae more capable of maintaining a surface postion countering vertical mixing and transporting further distances it may be that outlier larvae end up dispersing to more distant settling habitats founder individuals by virtue of their swimming ability it is worth stressing that transport distance has limitations as a metric of successful dispersal successful recruitment of c sapidus larvae is a relatively rare event with estimates of over 99 mortality during larval development and dispersal mcconaugha 1992 past modeling efforts have identified that loss to advection i e larval wastage may be the largest component of mortality garvine et al 1997 larvae exported too far south along the mab shelf may be advected outside suitable settlement habitat via the gulf stream in fact differences in transport potential between broods may simply indicate differences in dispersal strategy existing c sapidus dispersal models suggest transport distances are highly variable often with divergent dispersal patterns whereby some larvae are retained near their spawning location while others are transported much farther away criales et al 2019 the larvae simulated here may reflect such recruitment strategies via the high variation in behavior more complex models of shelf dynamics are needed to predict realistic dispersal trajectories and evaluate settling sites success across the population and we recommend a consideration of behavioral variation in their construction one difficulty in incorporating behaviors into individual based larval dispersal models is in parameterizing invidiuals responses to environmental conditions extensive observations and targeted experiments are needed and even with decades of behavioral experiments a comprehensive c sapidus larval behavioral model has not been created our hypothetical model of c sapidus larval transport and behavior allows for both individually varying behaviors and simulations suggest and maternal influences on behavior leading to behavior and brood dependent transport further experimental and modeling work is needed to identify whether such behavioral and maternal influence affect dispersal under more complex hydrogrpahic conditions credit authorship contribution

24232,blue crabs callinectes sapidus support valuable fisheries in the us mid atlantic bight mab and their unpredictable and variable recruitment suggests that a better understanding of larval development and dispersal is needed blue crab larval dispersal involves export to the continental shelf followed by re entry of estuaries transport is facilitated by wind and buoyancy driven surface currents and zoeae generally maintain a near surface distribution though several studies have investigated c sapidus larval dispersal none have evaluated the effects of behavioral variability on transport this study simulates first stage larvae using documented behavioral variation within an idealized wind driven estuarine plume in order to investigate the roles of swimming behavior stratified current systems and turbulent mixing on transport model results showed that larval transport was predominately influenced by wind speed but transport was significantly affected by behavioral characteristics faster swimming larvae were more able to maintain a near surface position and had more control over their vertical position despite vertical diffusivity and in all model scenarios larvae travelled farther and had different vertical distributions than passive particles modeled net transport distance of simulated broods differed by a factor of 1 8 with a maximum 4 7 fold difference between any individual larvae and in all scenarios behaving larvae showed further net transport and a shallower vertical distribution than passive particles these results indicate that

introduction high inter annual variability in blue crab callinectes sapidus recruitment creates challenges for long term management and predicting patterns of larval settlement is not yet possible due to critical gaps in understanding early life stage processes while models of c sapidus larval dispersal exist for the mid atlantic bight mab a thorough review can be found in epifanio and cohen 2016 critical knowledge gaps in early life stage processes and biophysical interactions limit our understanding of c sapidus dispersal population connectivity and the spatial distribution of recruits across a variety of taxa larval dispersal distance is inadequately explained solely by passive transport kingsford et al 2002 metaxas and saunders 2009 pineda and reyns 2018 particularly for species with long pelagic larval durations shanks 2009 and larval behavior in general can greatly influence how larvae disperse mcedward 1995 pineda et al 2007 several laboratory studies have identified complex swimming behavior in c sapidus larvae often regulated by environmental conditions epifanio and cohen 2016 forward and buswell 1989 sulkin et al 1980 yet c sapidus larval dispersal models typically treat larvae as either passive particles moving within the upper few meters of the water column garvine et al 1997 johnson and hess 1990 tilburg et al 2009a or with a fixed vertical distribution of larvae criales et al 2019 as yet c sapidus larval dispersal model have not considered the impact of more complex behaviors on dispersal processes after hatching near the mouths of estuaries blue crab larvae zoeae swim to the surface and are exported onto the continental shelf where they undergo 7 8 molt stages over a 30 40 day duration before metamorphosis costlow and bookhout 1959 current understanding of blue crab larval dispersal in the mab epifanio and tilburg 2008 dictates that larvae are carried southward via a near shore buoyancy driven surface current recruitment back to their parental estuary can occur when upwelling currents maintain larvae in an offshore reducing along shore transport epifanio and garvine 2001 eventually wind driven downwelling events bring larvae back into estarine habitats epifanio and garvine 2001 this hypothetical recruitment pathway for larvae necessitates that they remain in these surface currents to successfully reenter estuarine habitat though it is often reported that blue crab zoeae exist entirely within the neuston epifanio 1995 field sampling shows their vertical position can extend several meters below the surface provenzano 1983 smyth 1980 likely due to a combination of swimming behavior and vertical mixing laboratory studies have demonstrated swimming responses of c sapidus zoeae to temperature salinity light gravity pressure forward and buswell 1989 sulkin et al 1980 as well as turbulence in megalopae welch et al 1999 early stage larvae exhibit negative geotaxis and high barokinesis resulting in continual upward swimming sulkin 1984 in situ zoeae presumably stop swimming for some time and resume swimming once triggered by depth or time dependent cues additionally since zoeae occupy the turbulent suface mixed layer vertical mixing should prevent zoeae from staying exclusively within the neuston c sapidus zoeal swimming ability is a function of both behavior and morphology zoeal swimming appendage length is an indicator of vertical velocity the verticality and straightness of swimming trajectories while dorsal cross sectional area is a strong indicator of maximum swimming speed caracappa and munroe 2019 recent work has shown that the offspring of different female crabs broods can differ in both morphological and behavioral characteristics caracappa and munroe 2019 2018 zoeae from different broods have been observed to swim at speeds varying by a factor of three which was partially explained by corresponding differences in morphology caracappa and munroe 2019 despite natural variation in traits being expected within a population when combined with the physical processes of dispersal the resulting larval transport patterns may partially depend on a zoea s parentage the potential for maternal influences to affect offsprings dispersal trajectories may have further implications on blue crab metapopulation dynamics specifically female crabs in the same location could contribute to settling habitats differently by virtue of their offsprings behavioral and morphological characteristics c sapidus larvae develop on the inner continental shelf in the mab where circulation is primarily governed by the buoyant outflow of large riverine estuaries and wind driven ekman dynamics garvine et al 1997 with an overlaying southwest mean current lentz 2008 yankovsky et al 2000 the southward elongation of these estuarine plumes creates a fresher and stratified region were zoeae are often retained ruzecki 1981 episodic and seasonal changes in wind direction can cause offshore or inshore transport of near surface waters and result in retention or expulsion of zoeae from the proximity of natal estuaries epifanio 1995 additionally vertically sheared currents can be generated by wind stress and friction craig 1996 richman et al 1987 and wind stress and breaking waves result in an increasing vertical diffusivity with depth influencing the larval vertical position visser 1997 several studies have modeled callinectes sapidus larval dispersal in the mab but to our knowledge none have considered the effects of complex individualized behaviors early models of c sapidus dispersal involved lagragian transport of buoyant particles near the mouth of cheapeake bay johnson 1985 johnson et al 1984 identifying the importance of wind driven and buoyancy driven features in particle transport improvements to similar models sought to provide possible reinvasion mechanisms for blue crab larvae garvine et al 1997 johnson and hess 1990 later studies using improved circulation models proposed possible offshore retention of zoeae such that groups of larvae can stay relatively close to natal estuaries and facilitate later reinvasion tilburg et al 2009b 2007 2005 more recent models have shown success with incorporating behaving criales et al 2019 and surface drifting giltz et al 2020 particles though larval behavior was treated as uniform the goal of this study was to use model simulations of an idealized estuarine plume over the continental shelf in order to explore how behavioral physical interactions may influence the transport of c sapidus larvae while incorporating recent observational and experimental data our objectives were to 1 formulate a hypothetical larval behavior model for first stage c sapidus zoeae 2 estimate the degree to which larval behaviors influence transport with respect to passive transport and 3 quantify the effects of brood level behavioral differences on larval transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 model design all parameter names and definitions are listed in table 1 the following idealized physical simulation was chosen over more complex modeling frameworks like roms as the behaviors investigated in this study require a near surface vertical resolution on a centimeter scale much smaller than existing roms products for the region the development of a higher resolution product would have been impractical without adequate support that such behaviors are relevant for c sapidus larval dispersal processes larval transport was simulated in an idealized two layer estuarine plume in upwelling conditions over a continental shelf with an unbounded horizontal plane and a depth of 50 m horizontal advection was driven entirely by a wind driven ekman velocity profile under constant northward wind stress simulations were set to be in the northern hemisphere with positive x u velocity as eastward along plume and positive y v velocity as northward across plume other vertical processes e g upwelling and downwelling events have been shown to influence larval settlement epifanio and garvine 2001 shanks and brink 2005 sponaugle et al 2002 they occur at speeds that would dominate over any larval behaviors as such no vertical advection was present besides for that generated from vertical diffusivity to more easily isolate behavior effects in conditions where larvae are more likely to have control over their vertical position the depth of the estuarine plume zp was defined using a model by fong and geyer 2001 which was developed to investigate the dynamics of riverine plumes similar to that occupied by c sapidus zoeae in the mab 1 z p 4 r i c τ f ρ 0 2 g ρ ρ 0 ρ 1 3 where ρ0 is the mean density of seawater within the plume 1019 kg m 3 ρ is the density of the bottom layer

observations whitney and garvine 2005 and while measured before typical spawning april may they provide a reasonable upper bound on annual plume stratification although not necessarily representative of extreme events or climatological averages given the high ineterannual variability in estuarine export jiang and xia 2016 it may be necessary to simulate a dynamic plume depth in future iterations horizontal velocity profiles were then defined as a steady state ekman system with a constant northward wind pond and pickard 1983 2 u z 2 π τ z p ρ 0 f cos π 4 π z p z e π z p z 3 v z 2 π τ z p ρ 0 f sin π 4 π z p z e π z p z where z is the depth in meters the usage of zp as the ekman depth constrains the flow to within the estuarine plume a vertical diffusivity kz profile was also specified by 4

was based on a model by fong and geyer 2001 this parameterization of kz produced a differentiable diffusivity profile as a function of wind speed with a maximum kz at z p 2 and a maximum d k z d z at the surface and zp a cubic spline was used to create a smooth but rapid transition in kz at the plume interface i e pycnocline three physical scenarios were used that had unique kz and velocity profiles fig 1 each using a different constant wind speed 5 m s 1 10 m s 1 15 m s 1 these speeds ecompass the range in observations by the noaa ndbc cman4 station in the mouth of delaware bay usa https www ndbc noaa gov it was within each of these physical scenarios that various larval behavior configurations were investigated 2 2 larval behavior the in situ swimming behavior of c sapidus zoeae has not been well documented on short time scales so a two phased hypothetical behavioral model was used that includes elements of both laboratory and field observations this behavioral model presumes that while generally surface keeping c sapidus zoeae cease swimming periodically and are cued to resume swimming by a depth cue these short oscillations have been observed in laboratory conditions caracappa and munroe 2019 but have not been measured in the coastal ocean in the first phase larvae sink passively until they reach a hypothetical depth trigger dmax the hypothetical dmax parameter aims to reproduce a barokinetic response documented in laboratory settings sulkin et al 1980 but as a discrete environmental cue once reaching a depth of dmax a second swimming phase begins where larvae swim upwards until reaching the surface since the value dmax is uncertain three possible values 0 1 5 and 3 m were used econompassing the vertical distribution of observed zoeae provenzano 1983 in a still water column larvae with a nonzero dmax will vertically oscillate between the surface and their dmax in a sawtooth pattern fig 2 thus given a fixed swimming and sinking velocity dmax also determines the frequency of particles vertical oscillations this behavior differs from depth tracking as there is no evidence that larvae aggregate at any non surface depths but it does represent a type of depth regulation whereby larvae swim such that they stay above rather than at their dmax a dmax of 0 m results in constant upward swimming regardless of depth with no passive sinking phase as a hypothetical parameter dmax 0 m is treated as a control in the absence of turbulence particles would behave as buoyant surface drifters observations show that first stage c sapidus zoeae exhibit significant brood dependent morphology and swimming behavior caracappa and munroe 2019 2018 empirical relationships between swimming velocity and morphology were used to generate distributions of possible behaviors as there is no available data on paired swimming and sinking observations for individual larvae within a single brood four larval broods from caracappa munroe 2019 denoted groups a through d were used to generate behaviors these broods were selected due to their significant differences in both swimming velocity and morphology a composite group using the combined distribution of all larvae measured in caracappa and munroe 2019 was also used group o totaling 5 larval groups individual swimming and sinking velocities were generated from the dorsal cross sectional area ad a highly correlated morphometric upward swimming velocity wswim was best approximated an exponential function of ad and a normally distributed error term with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation equal to that of the residuals of the regression fig 3 table 2 an exponential relationship was chosen to constrain wswim to positive values a random value of ad was drawn for each larvae based on observed distributions within each group and a corresponding wswim was generated sinking velocity wsink was estimated using morphology and a force balance including drag gravitational sinking and buoyancy 6 w s i n k 2 g v l ρ l ρ f ρ f a a c d where g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 ρl is the density of larvae 1066 kg m 3 fuchs and low unpublished data vl is an

range for zoeae including c sapidus 0 6 to 10 based on estiamtes from caracappa and munroe 2019 linear regressions were used to generate aa lc and vt for each larvae as a function of ad table 2 this allowed for individual and brood variation in wsink and wswim to be generated from the same morphometric data table 3 2 3 inclusion of turbulent motion simulated particles moved individually and exhibited vertical motion based on a turbulence behavior model by ross sharples 2004 which accounts for spatially non uniform diffusivity this discrete time equation determines the particle depth at the next timestep zn 1 based on its current depth zn 9 z n 1 z n δ k z z n δ z δ t r 2 r k z z n 1 2 δ k z z n δ z δ t δ t 1 2 w p δ t where t is the discrete time increment 1 s r is a uniformly distributed random number between 1 and 1 r is the variance of r 1 3 and wp is the directed particle velocity wswim or wsink depending on the behavioral phase the second term is deterministic and moves particles towards depths of increased diffusivity i e towards mid plume depths the third term is a stochastic and nonlinear process with a random direction and increasing magnitude with depth the final term represents the directed motion of larvae a simple reflective boundary was used such that if particles were transported vertically beyond the top or bottom boundary in the next timestep they were reflected proportionally inward 10 z n 1 z n z n 1 0 2 h z n 1 z n 1 h to more clearly distinguish the interactions between physical processes and larval behaviors the only physical processes acting on simulated larvae were vertical diffusivity and horizontal currents for all simulations horizontal diffusivity was absent as it would have affected all larvae equally regardless of behavior 2 4 model implementation and analysis all simulations and statistical analyses were implemented in r r core team 2015 in each model configuration 10 000 particles were released at the same horizontal position at 1 m depth and their x y z position was tracked for 4 simulated days the typical duration of first stage c sapidus zoeae costlow and bookhout 1959 only first stage processes were considered since individualized swimming behaviors have not been reported for older zoeae the number of particles exceeds that needed to reach less than 5 unexplained variance simons et al 2013 and allowed for a smooth distribution of particle positions a timestep of 1 s was used meeting criteria proposed by ross and sharples 2004 and positional data was recorded every 10 min the net horizontal transport s was then calculated as the euclidean distance between the final and initial x y coordinates excluding differences in vertical position the net transport in the x along plume and y cross plume directions were also calculated as xnet and ynet respectively since transport metrics were not normally distributed a median was used as the central statistic with the median absolute deviation mad as a measure of dispersion net transport is not always the most relevant metric when predicting the larval recruitment pineda et al 2007 but it provides a useful indicator as to the degree that behavioral characteristics influence particle transport in a semi uniform physical environment the péclet number pe was calculated for all particles in each model configuration pe is a dimensionless metric relating to the ratio of diffusive and advective forces and can be used as an indicator of the dominant forces acting on swimming plankton karp boss et al 1996 pe is defined as 11 p e z p w s w i m k z where k z is the depth averaged between the surface and zp the fraction of simulated larvae with pe 1 was used to indicate whether larval motion during a given configuration was dominated by behavior or turbulence two distinct model scenarios were constructed each with several distinct physical and behavioral configurations in the behavior scenario particles had active swimming behaviors with 45 configurations including all combinations of wind speed 3 dmax 3 and larval group 5 in the passive scenario simulated larvae were neutrally buoyant and possessed no behavior wswim 0 ms 1 and wsink 0 ms 1 the passive scenario acted as a control for swimming behavior and included configurations for each of the three wind speeds for each scenario an anova was used to determine whether s differed between configurations of wind speed dmax and larval group kolmogorov smirnov k s tests were used to determine whether the distribution of s from configurations with behaving particles differed from the corresponding configuration with passive particles but the same physics an anova was used to determine whether the mean vertical position of particles at the final time step differed between model configurations k s tests were also used to evaluate whether mean particle depth differed in configurations with and without larval behavior the maximum theoretical transport smax was calculated for each combination of wind speed and dmax by evaluating the horizontal advection at one half dmax 12 s m a x t t o t u d m a x 2 2 v d m a x 2 2 where ttot is the total duration of the simulation 4 days this metric represents the mean horizontal advection a behaving particle would experience in the absence of turbulence due to the parameterization of the behavioral model any particle with dmax greater than 0 m would have a subsurface mean depth even if wswim was high thus smax is not equivalent to surface transport and provides a simple reference point to compare to realized net transport s and quantify the effect of turbulence on behaving particles 3 results 3 1 behaving particle scenarios for model configurations with behaving particles wind speed was the dominant factor where increased wind speed resulted in further transport in all cases fig 4 this was expected given that the mean current velocity scales with τ1 3 a 3 factor anova s wind dmax larval group table 4 showed a significant interaction between wind speed and dmax when dmax 0 m faster swimming larvae stay nearer to the surface at low wind speeds fig 5 and thus behave more like buoyant surface drifters as dmax increases net transport and its variability decline table 5 since larvae spend more time in deeper slower moving horizontal currents larval groups had significant effects on transport distances especially when dmax 0 m faster swimming broods were able to stay closer to the surface and transport further regardless of higher kz during stronger wind stress configurations as dmax increased particles were more evenly mixed vertically throughout the plume fig 5 and the brood effect was diminished when wind speed and kz increased brood difference in transport also increased for each larval group s showed a unimodal and a semi symmetrical distribution for particles with a non surface dmax fig 6 particles with dmax 0 m had more skewed distributions and median transport differed between larval groups the fasting swimming group a was transported significantly further than all other groups k s test p 0 001 as wind speed increased median vertical position decreased table 5 since larvae were more uniformly mixed throughout the plume layer when kz was high larvae acted more like passive particles transported by a depth averaged current along plume transport xnet was larger than cross plume transport ynet fig 4 model configuration parameters had similar effects on xnet as they did to s however at an intermediate plume depth particles experienced a reversal in cross plume flow resulting in a more southward trajectory than surface particles the effect of this flow reversal was evident from a strong interaction between wind speed and dmax on ynet fig 4 when dmax 0 m near surface larvae had a smaller ynet and as wind speed and kz increased larvae experience near zero depth averaged v velocity however as dmax increased stronger swimming larvae s behavior constrained them higher in the plume layer and were more likely to be positioned near the flow reversal depth ulitmately larvae with a deeper dmax experienced more southerly trajectories fig 7 3 2 passive particle scenarios in passive particle scenarios wind was a significant factor in determining net transport anova f 18 086 p 0 001 where faster winds increased net transport this was expected since horizontal advection scaled with wind stress and vertical advection was stochastic passive particles became uniformly distributed with depth throughout the plume within 1 2 h there was a slight aggregation of particles at the pycnoline fig 5 caused by the rapid decrease in kz to the background diffusivity over the course of the 4 day simulation particles had a deeper depth distribution in the lower layer but were still not uniformly distributed in all 45 configurations with behaving particles the distribution of s and vertical position differed from analogous configurations with passive particles k s p 0 001 indicating that even simple surface keeping behavior dmax 0 m may significantly alter larval transport when turbulent mixing is present even when mixing was minimized wind speed of 5 m s 1 behaving larvae with a dmax of 0 m had a mean vertical position one tenth of passive particles additionally the median s for all larval groups was greater than that of passive particles in the same physical conditions table 5 behaving particles at a 5 m s 1 wind speed and dmax 3 m behaved most like passive particles fig 4 when dmax was closer to the plume depth larvae spent more time in their sinking phase had a deeper depth distribution and had net transport fig 6 and trajectories fig 7 more like passive particles 3 3 swimming velocity and transport configurations with behaving particles showed that transport was related to larval swimming velocity and thus larval group there was a positive non linear relationship between s and wswim whereby faster swimming larvae were transported further but this relationship asymptotes at a maximum transport distance smax bounded by physical conditions and their dmax fig 8 if dmax 0 m this smax is defined by the horizontal advection at one half of dmax due to the larvae s oscillating behavior larvae with higher wswim travelled closer to smax when wind speed was lower and dmax 0 m the majority of larvae swam too slowly to reach smax in most model configurations as shown by their lower pe with the exception of configures with the slowest wind speeds the fraction of all simulated larvae whose péclet number exceeded one was calculated fig 9 pe depends on plume depth constant in this model larval swimming speeds and vertical diffusivity and is not affected by the dmax parameter thus pe is a characteristic of larval group and wind scenario only at a wind speed of 5 m s 1 at least 95 of zoeae from all larval groups had a pe 1 thus zoeae had control over their vertical position when wind speeds are low however as wind speed increased the proportion of larvae with pe 1 decreased and the difference in pe proportion between broods is more apparent when winds were 15 m s 1 88 of larvae the fastest swimming brood a and 30 of larvae from the slowest swimming brood d had pe 1 this disparity between broods explains why there is an increase in brood level differences in transport at higher wind speeds in no model configurations with behaving particles do all larvae have a pe 1 so broods never entirely act like passive particles in fact only at the fastest wind speed and for the slowest swimming broods c and d do a majority of the larvae have a pe 1 4 discussion 4 1 larval behavior and transport though the idealized plume structure and ekman dynamics in this model exclude other important physical processes upwelling winds are the dominant process that drives surface waters in the nearshore mid atlantic bight lentz 2008 lentz and largier 2006 rennie et al 1999 the simplicity of this model suited the scope of this study and facilitated the investigation of interactions between wind speed and larval behaviors even when hypothetical aspects of the larval behavior model are ignored i e when dmax 0 m larval traits still influenced transport via larvae s ability to counter vertical mixing the presence of behaviors does not guarantee changes in transport especially if larval swimming was not strong enough to counter turbulence however there was no model configuration were the majority of particles behaved as if they were passive particles even at high wind speeds and strong turbulence these results indicate that brood variation in c sapidus zoeal swimming behavior observed by caracappa and munroe 2019 could result in brood dependent larval transport despite most zooplankton lacking the ability to control their horizontal position via swimming many are able to exert control over their vertical position horizontal advection can vary substantially with depth i e sheared flow allowing vertical swimming behavior to alter larval trajectories in ways different than those predicted by passive transport alone metaxas 2001 shanks 2009 1995 behavior driven differences in larval transport have been simulated in models of larval bivalves munroe et al 2018 north et al 2008 corals szmant and meadows 2006 and other decapod crustaceans katz et al 1994 moksnes et al 2014 the vertical distribution of zoeae should be more uniform when winds are stronger but the response of c sapidus zoeae may also be affected by turbulence the results of this model align with field observations where under relatively calm conditions zoeae are heavily skewed towards the surface provenzano 1983 in constrast to c sapidus other estuarine crab species larvae develop within estuaries and exhibit selective tidal stream transport undergoing diel vertical migrations over several meters epifanio and cohen 2016 for carcinus maenas banas et al 2009 moksnes et al 2014 more complex biophysical models show that this behavior results in a larger degree of control over horizontal position than in the case of this study suggesting that while c sapidus larvae behavior may influence transport it is to a lesser degree than for other species since c sapidus larvae maintain a position near the surface and field sampling may be difficult under stronger wind conditions the potential influences of behavior may have been overlooked observations regarding the vertical distribution of zoeae as a function of wind speed or turbulence would fill critical data gaps and allow for further refinement of our behavioral model the nature of the dmax parameter and resulting vertical oscillations in are model are mostly hypothetical and presuppose a resting period that is triggered by depth though highly simplistic centimeter scale depth measurements at timescales of minutes are prohibitively difficult to measure in situ in the case that larvae do not experience a prolonged passive sinking phase dmax would be 0 m in still conditions laboratory behavioral experiments have not been done with deep enough encolosures to identify a true dmax despite the underlying larval swimming behavior in all scenarios constrained to vertical oscillation all model configurations showed that wind driven mixing resulted in complex patterns in vertical position over time the duration of either swimming or sinking phases varied greatly depending on the strength of the mixing and particles swimming speed despite the uncertainty in parameterizing potential swimming behavior brood dependent transport distance was still seen for surface keeping particles dmax 0 m larval behaviors included in this model reflected observation but they were based on experiments done under controlled and static conditions caracappa and munroe 2019 realistcally c sapidus larval behavior also varies with environmental conditions forward and cronin 1980 sulkin et al 1980 and molt stage sulkin et al 1980 however behavioral responses to some potentially important environmental conditions e g turbulence salinity temperature light food have not been studied or lack information needed to generate distributions of individualized behaviors these data gaps make it difficult to construct individual based models using more complex physical conditions and refined behaviors more experimental or in situ observations are needed to better understand the range of c sapidus larval behaviors and how they can interact with dispersal processes 4 2 behavioral variation the investigation of brood dependent larval dispersal in zoeae stems from recent experimental work multivariate morphological differences between larval broods have been documented in both c sapidus caracappa and munroe 2018 and pugettia quadridens tamura et al 2017 and brood dependent mortality to stressors has been documented in lithodes santolla di salvatore et al 2020 brood effects in c sapidus larvae have been shown to influence swimming behavior as well caracappa and munroe 2019 when incorporated into this model the 2 5 fold difference in swimming velocity between broods translated to a maximum 1 8 fold difference in transport distance however across all larvae irrespective of brood net transport distance varied by a factor of 2 during the slowest win speeds larval swimming velocity possessed highly skewed distributions which result in similarly skewed distributions of transport distance such that faster swimming larvae were transported further than their slower swimming analogues the magnitude of swimming and behavioral effects are evident when compared against net transport for passive particles which have shorter transport distances with narrower distributions brood effects were present in all configurations but were smaller at decreased wind speed and deeper d max thus brood effects and behavioral effects in general on transport may be situational and depend on local physical conditions the larval broods chosen for this study form a continuous overlapping distribution of swimming velocity but it is uncertain whether they are representative of the entire reproducing population the presence of possible outlier broods e g group a suggests a small subset of the reproducing population could produce larvae more capable of maintaining a surface postion countering vertical mixing and transporting further distances it may be that outlier larvae end up dispersing to more distant settling habitats founder individuals by virtue of their swimming ability it is worth stressing that transport distance has limitations as a metric of successful dispersal successful recruitment of c sapidus larvae is a relatively rare event with estimates of over 99 mortality during larval development and dispersal mcconaugha 1992 past modeling efforts have identified that loss to advection i e larval wastage may be the largest component of mortality garvine et al 1997 larvae exported too far south along the mab shelf may be advected outside suitable settlement habitat via the gulf stream in fact differences in transport potential between broods may simply indicate differences in dispersal strategy existing c sapidus dispersal models suggest transport distances are highly variable often with divergent dispersal patterns whereby some larvae are retained near their spawning location while others are transported much farther away criales et al 2019 the larvae simulated here may reflect such recruitment strategies via the high variation in behavior more complex models of shelf dynamics are needed to predict realistic dispersal trajectories and evaluate settling sites success across the population and we recommend a consideration of behavioral variation in their construction one difficulty in incorporating behaviors into individual based larval dispersal models is in parameterizing invidiuals responses to environmental conditions extensive observations and targeted experiments are needed and even with decades of behavioral experiments a comprehensive c sapidus larval behavioral model has not been created our hypothetical model of c sapidus larval transport and behavior allows for both individually varying behaviors and simulations suggest and maternal influences on behavior leading to behavior and brood dependent transport further experimental and modeling work is needed to identify whether such behavioral and maternal influence affect dispersal under more complex hydrogrpahic conditions credit authorship contribution

24233,peatlands are complex systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics due to internal and external feedback mechanisms however the feedback of vegetation on peat volume changes that potentially affect peatland dynamics is not well understood here we analyse the consequences of coupling between plant functional types with peat stiffness on a nonequilibrium model of a peatland by developing mpeat model in this formulation the peat systems prefer to exist in two possible states defined by two limit cycles one corresponding to a wet and the other to a dry attractor these states can also coexist under the same net rainfall indicating bistability in which a crucial drying threshold leads to a tipping point and associated regime shift from soft wet to stiff dry states with related changes in rates of carbon storage while the shift from wet to dry states constitutes a tipping point to shift from the dry to wet states requires more sustained increases in net rainfall indicating that dry state is the more stable attractor as the peatland grows as the model peatland evolves the response of surface motion carbon accumulation and water table depth to the same external forcing becomes increasingly higher amplitude indicating that a degree of caution may be required when interpreting the paleorecord investigation of the behaviour of these states in response to seasonal variations in water budget suggests that the wet state will display high amplitude and later peak timing when compared to the dry state a phenomenon that is observed in measures of surface motion our study highlights the possible importance of mechanical ecohydrological feedback and in particular the role of the coupling between the proportion of plant functional types peat young s modulus plant weight and water table position in influencing peatland regime shifts critical thresholds or tipping points and both short and long term peatland dynamical behaviour keywords ecohydrology nonlinear dynamics

7335037 mahdiyasa 2022 1 introduction peatland mechanics including the swelling and shrinking of peat pore space due to mechanical deformation produce significant feedbacks because they influence water budgets and carbon stocks mahdiyasa et al 2022 price 2003 waddington et al 2015 whittington and price 2006 these mechanical feedbacks are affected by vegetation malmer et al 1994 whittington et al 2007 which potentially provides an essential element of peatland nonlinear behaviour the purpose of this paper is to explore the consequences of coupling between mechanics and plant functional types pft for nonequilibrium models of peatland dynamics in multiple timeframes the model simulates an ombrotrophic peat body accumulating between fixed free draining boundaries on an impermeable substrate and presumed to experience uniform surface load on a square metre basis on account of the surface vegetation deformation of the peat body is free to occur due to gravity and the poroelastic behaviour of peat as a porous medium plant functional types are assumed to be a mix of sphagnum sedge and shrub as equations exist to calculate the exact composition of this mixture relative to water table depth however what matters is that this range of plant functional types provides a varied range of mechanical properties soft sphagnum to stiff shrubs that enable feedback mechanisms to be considered these constraints mean that the model does not provide a simulation of forested peatland as the loading would be much more complex peatland that experiences substantial snowfall as the surface loading would be much more variable permafrost peatland or peatland that is frozen for a significant period as the presence of ice would completely change the mechanical behaviour of the system in essence the results of the model will be most applicable to temperate peatlands peatland behaviour is affected by the interplay between positive destabilising and negative stabilising feedback from internal and external factors these feedbacks lead to nonlinear dynamics which in turn create the possibility of peatlands having more than one equilibrium state and experiencing abrupt shifts to alternative states with fundamental differences in characteristics and structures belyea 2009 belyea and baird 2006 hilbert et al 2000 understanding the nonlinear dynamics of peatlands and in particular tipping points is important because of the possibility that a sudden shift in behaviour could release a large amount of carbon stored in the peatland berg et al 2009 jackson et al 2017 loisel et al 2017 lunt et al 2019 yu et al 2010 or may put the peatland into a less resilient state with consequences for the global carbon cycle chaudhary et al 2020 dise 2009 kleinen et al 2012 models of nonlinear peatland dynamics e g baird et al 2012 frolking et al 2010 heinemeyer et al 2010 morris et al 2012 2015 2011 swindles et al 2012 yu et al 2001 take an ecohydrological approach and assume constant or partial changes of peat physical properties within an equilibrium condition for example hilbert et al 2000 proposed the bistability of both wet and dry peatland states potentially coexist through the nonlinear interactions between water balance and mass accumulation hilbert et al 2000 also propose a tipping point could arise due to slight variability in water input which leads to the change in peatland behaviour from carbon sinks to carbon sources similarly van der velde et al 2021 developed a model to analyse regime shifts across biomes from peatland to forest indicating bistability conditions and major release of carbon when the switch occurs both hilbert et al 2000 and van der velde et al 2021 use the peatland water budget as the primary variable to determine the critical threshold before the regime shifts take place however peatland internal feedback mechanisms that can maintain the water budget are not considered and are sources of uncertainty in their models in particular these models ignore mechanical feedback and the equilibrium assumption is not realised in peatlands where sustained growth continually changes the ecology hydrology and mechanics of the peatland system mpeat mahdiyasa et al 2022 is a one dimensional model of peatland dynamics that incorporates mechanical ecological and hydrological feedbacks through the coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation which is known as poroelasticity biot 1941 coussy 2004 de boer 2000 detournay and cheng 1993 wang 2000 mpeat simulates peatland growth by adding a new layer or cohort of peat annually above the flat impermeable and rigid substrate without the requirement of an initial peat depth condition every new layer contains information about the initial value of peat physical properties including bulk density active porosity hydraulic conductivity and young s modulus mpeat conceptualises peatland into two different zones the unsaturated zone above the water table and the saturated zone below the water table aerobic condition in the unsaturated zone results in a high rate of decay while in the saturated zone peat experiences a low rate of anaerobic decay in both zones the decomposition process reduces young s modulus which indicates the stiffness of the material against tensile or compressive forces the changes in young s modulus lead to the mechanical deformation of the peat pore structure which has a significant influence on the peat bulk density active porosity and hydraulic conductivity however the effect of mechanical deformation on the peat pore structure is also affected by pft whittington et al 2007 found that peatland sites dominated by shrub experience limited compressibility leading to lower hydraulic conductivity reduction when the water table drop these conditions allow rapid water discharge from the peatland promoting drier conditions and maintaining the dominance of the shrub in contrast sites dominated by sedge or sphagnum have a better ability to expand or shrink which keeps the relative position of the water table close to the surface and supports the growth of these plant communities therefore stiffer peat dominated by shrubs could become a dry attractor while softer peat with sedge or sphagnum dominance has the possibility to turn into a wet attractor the objectives of this paper are to 1 present a model of peatland dynamics that incorporates the feedback between mechanical processes and plant functional types 2 investigate the peatland regime shifts and tipping points in a growing system accounting for fully coupled mechanical ecohydrological feedback 3 analyse both short and long term nonlinear dynamics of the peatland 2 methods we based our model on mpeat mahdiyasa et al 2022 because it includes feedback between mechanical ecological and hydrological processes as the peatland develops and adapts it by introducing fundamental changes in the formulation of peat stiffness and plant weight at the top surface this was necessary as the initial formulation of mpeat does not take into account the influence of plant functional types pft on the peat stiffness and assumes a constant proportion of pft during the simulation which significantly affects the total plant weight that acts as the source of loading by doing this we are able to use a modified version of mpeat to consider the interactions between young s modulus pft proportion plant weight and water table position fig 1 as most of the mpeat formulations remain unchanged we only describe the modifications below for the full formulation see supplementary material 2 1 model formulation in this model young s modulus is determined not only by decomposition zhu et al 2020 but also by pft peat dominated by shrub becomes stiffer and has higher young s modulus compared to sphagnum peat because the geotechnical behaviour of peat including young s modulus is related to its origin farrell 2012 which shrub produces stiffer plant litter than sphagnum ämmälä 2019 wagner et al 2012 furthermore shrub roots provide a supporting matrix in the unsaturated zone reducing the compression effect malmer et al 1994 to accommodate this behaviour young s modulus of all layers in the unsaturated zone increases to a value determined by pft in contrast if the condition is sphagnum dominant the effect of pft on young s modulus only occurs at the top surface fig 2 we propose an equation that includes the influence of decomposition and pft on the peat young s modulus as follows 1 e χ 1 θ t ζ b 1 c 1 b 2 c 2 b 3 c 3 where e is the young s modulus pa θ is the remaining mass which can be obtained from the mass per unit area that has experienced decay m t kg m 2 divided by the initial mass per unit area m 0 kg m 2 or mathematically can be

proportions with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively due to the uncertainties in the range value of peat young s modulus e g dykes 2008 price et al 2005 reeve et al 2013 we choose the parameters in eq 1 such that young s modulus value is in agreement with the data provided by boylan et al 2008 mesri and ajlouni 2007 and long 2005 in the range of 8 10 4 1 6 10 6 pa through this range value of young s modulus we enable to investigate the effect of mechanical feedback on the peatland dynamics our model formulates the water table position at the centre of a circular domed peatland which is constrained by the rivers based on the equation from childs 1969 see also morris et al 2015 swindles et al 2012 in this formulation a peatland receives the water from net rainfall that is defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration and loses water due to lateral discharge towards the rivers which is affected by the active porosity hydraulic conductivity and the distance from the centre to the river or peatland radius 2 d γ d t r ϕ 2 κ γ 2 l 2 ϕ where γ is the water table height m r is the net rainfall m y r 1 that is defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration l is the peatland radius m ϕ is the active porosity and κ is the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 water table position influences peat production decomposition rate and pft composition moore et al 2002 measured the relationship between the proportion of pft with the position of the water table and found a strong negative relationship between water table position and shrub proportion where the water table was low pft composition was dominated by shrub we apply linear regression to estimate the pft proportion based on the minimum value of water table depth in each interval from moore et al 2002 data as follows 3 c 1 2 23 z 0 28 4 c 2 1 42 z 0 63 5 c 3 0 81 z 0 64 where c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pft proportions with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively and z is the water table depth m with the range value between 0 2 0 5 m based on moore et al 2002 measurements we assume the pft proportion outside the range of the water table depth is equal to the estimated value when the water table depth is located in the limit range the value of the coefficient of determination r 2 from the linear regression model for shrub sedge and sphagnum proportions are 0 95 0 78 and 0 82 respectively these values of r 2 indicate that the linear fitting is appropriate to model the relationship between water table depth and pft proportion the dependency of pft proportion on the water table depth that is formulated in this model provides a more reasonable approach for investigating the influence of pft on peatland mechanics compared to the constant proportion of pft in the initial version of mpeat pft proportion affects the plant weight at the top surface which represents the total weight of the living plants that set up the community plant weight becomes the source of loading in this system and is calculated through the following equations mahdiyasa et al 2022 moore et al 2002 6 y c 1 10 log 10 ψ 0 409 0 985 1 d 1 g c 2 10 log 10 ψ 0

constants for plant wet condition with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively 2 2 model implementation we run two groups of simulations with different time scales in the first group we simulated long term peatland development under a constant radius of 500 m and flat substrate over a period of 6000 years with the parameter values summarised in table 1 we employed an annual time series of net rainfall fig 3 a and annual average air temperature fig 3b generated from a sinusoidal function with some noise to create variable wet or dry climatic conditions the range value of net rainfall and average air temperature used in our model are in line with the reported data from morris et al 2015 young et al 2019 and young et al 2021 in this group the water is added evenly in small increments with timesteps equal to 0 1 years to produce a stable and convergent simulation the boundary conditions of the model were an impermeable layer with no displacement at the bottom and a fully drained condition of the top layer the rate of surface motion is obtained from the annual changes in peatland height which is affected by mechanical ecological and hydrological feedback in the second group we decoupled peat production and decomposition processes and focused on the mechanical and hydrological feedback on a shorter time scale we used peat properties that had been simulated from the first group to model short term peatland surface motion with weekly timesteps over 150 weeks we chose peat properties between the ages of 4000 3900 years bp and 2000 1900 years bp to represent the dry and wet conditions of the peatland based on the position of the water table fig 4 b unlike the first set of simulations where peat production and decomposition influence the mechanical deformation through the changes in young s modulus eq 1 the swelling and shrinking in the short term simulations are affected by the plant weight at the top surface and water table position through the effective stress effective stress has an essential role in this model because it can explain the relationship between the total stress received by peat with excess pore water pressure biot 1941 price 2003 terzaghi 1943 and the effect of compaction on the peat physical properties mahdiyasa et al 2022 schlotzhauer and price 1999 whittington and price 2006 the model in this group was driven by climatic input in the form of weekly net rainfall only because all variables are not affected by air temperature fig 3c therefore throughout the year the water is added unevenly to the peatland in the short term simulation 2 3 sensitivity analysis model sensitivity to input parameters was evaluated by changing the value of parameters that couple pft with young s modulus eq 1 we chose to explore the effect of these parameters because of the shortage of information on how significant pft is on the peat stiffness which in turn influences the dynamics of the peatland we increased the value of b 1 to represent the condition that shrubs control the peat stiffness by producing a higher young s modulus in contrast the decreasing value of b 3 simulated the condition that sphagnum was the essential pft in reducing peat stiffness we performed one at a time sensitivity analysis or changed the value of one parameter and all others remained the same as the baseline value table 1 for each simulation the sensitivity analysis outputs consist of the relationship between peat stiffness with the dynamics of surface motion and the peatland carbon balance including carbon input carbon output and net carbon accumulation 3 results 3 1 long term dynamical behaviour once the unsaturated zone has developed the pft proportion fluctuates depending on the water table position which in turn affects the plant weight at the top surface for instance from 5200 4302 years bp water table depth is around 0 24 m fig 4b sphagnum is the dominant pft 44 compared to the shrub 27 and sedge 29 fig 4a and the value of plant weight is about 22 14 kg m 2 fig 4c contrastingly from 4274 3375 years bp the water table depth is around 0 32 m shrub proportion increases to 43 while sphagnum and sedge decrease to the value of 38 and 19 respectively and plant weight increases to 26 65 kg m 2 the differences in the pft composition water table depth and plant weight lead to variations in the rate of surface motion fig 5 a and b the rate of surface motion is obtained from the average rate of motion over an entire year essentially the net swelling and shrinking of a surface after a complete annual cycle with positive values indicating that the peatland surface is going up while the negative values indicate the peatland surface is going down we use the rate of surface motion to explain the movement of the peatland surface rather than the absolute position because the reference point will change over time this approach provides a more robust and efficient calculation process because it can be simulated without specifying some arbitrary datum as the peatland develops five distinct clusters of the rate of surface motion are produced three corresponding to wetter conditions 5200 4302 3199 1793 and 699 0 years bp and two corresponding to drier conditions 4274 3375 and 1764 876 years bp fig 5a the range of the rate of surface motion in the dry state is from 0 51 until 0 23 mm y r 1 with the net rainfall fluctuating around 600 790 mm y r 1 conversely if the net rainfall varies about 750 1000 mm y r 1 peatland is attracted to the wet state represented by the high rate of surface motion in the range of 1 64 and 1 52 mm y r 1 the overlap between these two ranges of net rainfall around 750 790 mm y r 1 allows the dry attractor and wet attractor to coexist which indicates the possibility of a bistability condition fig 5d dry or wet attractors are the oscillatory states of the peatland toward which that peatland system tends to evolve which have fundamental differences in characteristics and structures furthermore the transition time from dry to wet state wet shift persists for around 174 years fig 5b and requires 90 mm y r 1 change in net rainfall fig 5c whereas the transition time from wet to dry dry shift is about 26 years involving about 50 mm y r 1 change in net rainfall long term carbon input output and net accumulation are affected significantly by the peatland state for example the transition from wet to dry condition that occurs around 4301 to 4275 years bp increases the rate of carbon input from 0 33 to 0 39 kg c m 2 y r 1 due to the enhancement of productivity fig 6 a however this condition also leads to a substantial rise in the rate of peatland carbon release from 0 30 to 0 36 kg c m 2 y r 1 over the same time interval as the consequence of increasing the depth of the unsaturated zone fig 6b in contrast the transition from dry to wet state about 3374 to 3200 years bp reduces the rate of carbon addition from 0 39 to 0 33 kg c m 2 y r 1 and carbon output from 0 37 to 0 31 kg c m 2 y r 1 because of the lower peat production and decomposition process as the water table is closer to the surface from 0 31 to 0 26 m the average value of the net rate of carbon accumulation obtained from the difference between the rate of carbon input and output is about 0 024 kg c m 2 y r 1 over the simulation time fig 6c which is in line with reported measurements between 0 021 0 025 kg c m 2 y r 1 chaudhary et al 2020 loisel et al 2017 loisel et al 2014 treat et al 2016 yu et al 2010 3 2 short term dynamical behaviour peat that grows in dry conditions has different characteristics including the physical properties compared to the wet peat which results in distinct behaviour of short term surface motion during 4000 3900 years bp shrub proportion increased due to the low net rainfall between 610 660 mm y r 1 fig 3a which led to the high young s modulus value in the range of 3 53 10 5 3 65 10 5 pa fig 7 d furthermore the decrease in water input produced a deep position of the water table 0 35 0 32 m from the surface fig 4b resulting in a more considerable effect of compaction which is represented by the high value of bulk density 115 119 kg m 3 and low value of active porosity 0 33 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity 2 3 10 8 4 9 10 8 m s 1 in that period fig 7a c the condition was different during 2000 1900 years bp when peatland experienced high net rainfall 910 950 mm y r 1 which resulted in a shallow water table position 0 18 0 20 m and consequently led to the sphagnum dominance condition in this situation peat stiffness decreased indicated by the low value of young s modulus 3 14 10 5 3 22 10 5 pa the high position of the water table reduced the effective stress which produced peat with lower bulk density 93 95 kg m 3 and higher active porosity 0 41 0 43 and hydraulic conductivity 5 8 10 7 7 8 10 7 m s 1 moreover the surface loading from plant weight during 4000 3900 years bp dry period and 2000 1900 years bp wet period was around 26 12 28 92 kg m 2 and 19 38 20 44 kg m 2 respectively fig 4c peat characteristics between the ages of 4000 3900 years bp and 2000 1900 years bp which represent dry and wet periods were employed to simulate short term surface motion the amplitude of surface motion and peak timing varied between dry and wet peat over 150 weeks surface displacement ranged from 0 11 to 0 04 m for peat formed in dry condition while for peat developed in a wet environment it fluctuated between 0 21 and 0 05 m fig 8 a the negative or positive values indicate shrinkage or swelling of the peat surface from the initial elevation which was 1 52 m for the dry peat and 2 36 m for the wet peat periods of peak timing of surface motion were not synchronized across the two time series with wet peat experiencing a delay in peak timing relative to the dry peak of around five weeks in addition the hysteresis of surface elevation with the water level also appears for both dry peat fig 8b and wet peat fig 8c this phenomenon suggests the water level drops faster than the pore structure can collapse and the opposite happens when water is added to the peatland 3 3 sensitivity analysis the parameter b 1 eq 1 controls the effect of the shrub proportion on the peat young s modulus as the pft composition changes because of the fluctuation in water table depth increasing parameter b 1 to 3 75 fig 9 led to a higher young s modulus with a value between 4 07 10 5 7 92 10 5 pa which in turn reduced the rate of surface motion to the range of 1 48 until 1 12 mm y r 1 this condition on average results in a higher rate of carbon addition and carbon output with a value of about 2 2 and 5 6 compared to the baseline value because the increasing rate of carbon output is higher than carbon input the net rate of carbon accumulation decreases by around 39 moreover a higher value of young s modulus leads to a lower amplitude of surface motion for both dry peat 0 07 m and wet peat 0 17 m but the shift in peak timing is the same with the short term baseline simulation around five weeks the changes in young s modulus value due to the variation in sphagnum proportion are determined by b 3 parameter eq 1 decreasing b 3 parameter to 0 375 resulted in a lower young s modulus value 2 43 10 5 3 13 10 5 pa and as a consequence the range of surface motion rate increased to the value between 1 48 and 1 69 mm y r 1 this condition reduced the rate of carbon addition and carbon output by around 1 5 and 3 2 compared to the baseline simulation the net carbon accumulation rate increased by approximately 19 due to a greater reduction in carbon output than carbon input furthermore a lower young s modulus value led to a higher amplitude of surface motion for both dry peat and wet peat in the short term simulation with the value of about 0 20 m and 0 32 m respectively and produced a more extended shift in peak timing about six weeks 4 discussion the most significant observation arising from this model is the apparent bistability of the peatland with respect to net rainfall fig 5d with both wet and dry states being possible for the same net rainfall but at different times another view of this is that as net rainfall varies over time the peatland jumps between attractors characterised by two limit cycles in comparison to the bistability predicted by hilbert et al 2000 who consider equilibrium states our model is more complex because the system is continually evolving by definition an equilibrium state can be achieved if the state variable does not change with time however interactions between internal and external feedback mechanisms will prevent the peatland from reaching that condition because the peat physical properties including bulk density active porosity hydraulic conductivity and young s modulus change in time and space boylan et al 2008 fraser et al 2001 hogan et al 2006 lewis et al 2012 this dynamic view of an evolving system is potentially more useful as there is no indication that holocene peatlands are close to an equilibrium state it can also be seen figs 5b and 6c that as the model peatland grows the amplitude of oscillations particularly in the wet state increases this is not surprising as growth between the fixed lateral boundaries in the model will steepen hydrological gradients over time generating increasing extreme responses to the same changes in net rainfall it should also in the long term favour the dry state assuming that the processes of decay do not impose an earlier limit if these modelled results have a bearing on reality then some caution should also be exercised when interpreting the response of the peat to palaeoclimatic change as the same climate forcing could generate quite different outcomes in the evolving peatland system the inference of a permanent state of disequilibrium also raises the important question as to whether it would ever be possible for an observer on the surface of a peatland to determine if the system was tending to a long term stable carbon balance as might be expected if they were to assume a constant decay rate another key observation that operates on different time frames is the hysteretic behaviour of surface elevation with the water level short term hysteresis is a well known consequence of the filling and draining of porous matter and is obtained from field measurement the data from fritz et al 2008 showed that delayed response of the surface motion to the changes in water level results in a hysteresis loop with a positive relationship between these two variables and this observation is in agreement with our simulation results fig 10 the slope of surface elevation with water level decreases in the dry period which may indicate that peat is stiffer at depth in the study area measured by fritz et al 2008 because the enhancement of peat stiffness will produce lower surface displacement and results in a flatter curve in our simulations stiffer peat that formed in dry conditions has a smaller slope of surface elevation with water level 0 3 compared to the wet peat 0 6 while fritz et al 2008 data show that the slope in the dry and wet conditions are around 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the more pronounced difference between dry and wet conditions in the fritz et al 2008 data might be related to the peat characteristics in that specific site including the restiad pft composition compared to our model and possibly the influence of this on the microporosity rezanezhad et al 2010 silins and rothwell 1998 however the main reason for comparison with fritz et al 2008 data is to demonstrate how the model provides an interpretative framework for analysing their observation of a peatland which in other respects e g uniform surface loading and reduction in elasticity with decay can be considered comparable to our model furthermore this comparison also indicates the ability of our model to capture the heterogeneity and nonlinearity of peatland behaviour provide a context for interpreting field data and suggest that our chosen physical properties appear to be reasonable for the purpose of analysing peatland behaviour the long term nonlinear hysteretic response to oscillatory changes in net precipitation may reflect fundamental differences in the behaviour of the wetting and drying system that result from a change in the state of the peatland fig 5d intuitively differences in the response of peatland to wetting and drying are reasonable as it should be easier to lose potential energy by lowering a water table than to build potential energy this result may also indicate that the production of peat by compaction is a nonlinear process on multiannual timescales with periods of either net growth accumulation or subsidence compaction of the peat occurring in response to longer terms changes in weather or climate some evidence of such longer term oscillatory mechanical behaviour can be observed in the field observations of howie and hebda 2018 whose data when plotted on an appropriate scale appears to display evidence of multiannual oscillations in surface motion 4 1 peatland regime shifts and tipping points we found that a more substantial change in net rainfall is required to move the peatland from a dry state to wet state than the other way around fig 5a and c a significant increase in water input is necessary to produce higher excess pore water pressure and expand the pore space leading to more substantial peat water storage which is the requirement for the regime shift from dry to wet states however as the dry state develops the flow of water on the near surface will be more favourable because the compaction effect is less significant for the stiffer material and consequently near surface hydraulic conductivity will remain high preventing the peatland from accumulating more water therefore a dry state turns into a more dominant attractor that can accommodate greater perturbations and potentially becomes a preferable state in the long term as the peatland grows it is notably difficult to predict when the regime shifts will appear in complex dynamical systems scheffer et al 2009 scheffer and carpenter 2003 including peatlands belyea 2009 belyea and baird 2006 because they involve heterogeneous processes and nonlinear feedbacks however as the system approaches a tipping point the variability of state behaviour changes carpenter and brock 2006 kleinen et al 2003 oborny et al 2005 van nes and scheffer 2003 in our case is the rate of surface motion that can be used as an early warning signal for instance before the regime shift around 3200 years bp the standard deviation in the rate of surface motion increased from 0 07 to 0 27 mm y r 1 fig 11 indicating the upcoming major transition from dry state to wet state this is because the ability of the system to recover from perturbations and track fluctuations is decreasing near the critical threshold berglund and gentz 2002 the proposed model shows how the feedback between internal and external factors affects peatland states and regime shifts under uniform landscape conditions however the state behaviour is also influenced by the spatial topography of the peatland assuming a sufficiently complex landscape e g blanket bog with variable slopes drainage lines and local hydrology and then on account of lateral flow with variations in the net water budget it appears to be quite likely that wet and dry states could coexist in a landscape and particularly if the net rainfall were to fall within the region of bistability this conclusion is supported by satellite observation of surface motion that indicates the bimodal wet state or dry state behaviour in such landscape bradley et al 2022 with a mean annual net rainfall of around 800 mm y r 1 a value that is remarkably close to the 760 to 790 mm y r 1 annual net rainfall range in which bistability occurs within our model however in practice the situation is potentially far more complex for example microtopography of hummocks and hollows also exerts an influence on peatland mechanical behaviour marshall et al 2022 at a much smaller scale 1 10 m than the 90 m scale observations of bradley et al 2022 a complex landscape together with the variability of the peat physical properties throughout the peatland area may also promote one state to be more stable than the other slope variabilities in a complex landscape have a major impact on the peatland hydrology holden 2005 holden and burt 2003 where the areas with a steeper slope experiences a higher rate of water discharge this condition results in a smaller decrease in net rainfall required to shift from wet state to dry state than would be the case if the substrate was flat moreover higher bulk density and lower hydraulic conductivity at mesotope margins baird et al 2008 lapen et al 2005 lewis et al 2012 suggest smaller peat water storage in that location which supports the dry state becoming more stable conversely lower hydraulic gradients at mesotope centres will promote the accumulation of water resulting in the wet condition becoming a dominant state the state should change rapidly at a transition region between these two areas margin and centre and this is consistent with satellite observations bradley et al 2022 4 2 peatland characteristics in different states our simulation results show apparent differences in the characteristics of peatland surface motion between the wet state and dry state over long term and short term periods in the long term simulations the rate of surface motion of dry peat is lower compared to wet peat fig 5a and b the plant community composition in the dry state is dominated by shrub alshammari et al 2020 moore et al 2002 sottocornola et al 2009 wierda et al 1997 which increases peat stiffness fig 7d and loading from plant weight at the top surface fig 4c the presence of shrub roots provides a supporting matrix malmer et al 1994 particularly in the unsaturated zone where mechanical deformation mainly occurs fenton 1980 mahdiyasa et al 2022 quinton et al 2000 waddington et al 2010 whittington and price 2006 which limits the expansion and contraction of peat volume and prevent the peatland surface from oscillating with a higher amplitude in the short term simulation the differences between wet and dry states are not only the magnitude but also the peak timing of surface motion generally if we exclude the effect of peat addition and decomposition the main drivers in short term surface motion are the interactions between effective stress excess pore water pressure and peat physical properties the peat physical properties of short term simulations are obtained between the ages of 4000 3900 bp and 2000 1900 bp to represent the dry and wet states respectively fig 7 the different values of young s modulus between the two states result in a considerable distinction in the amplitude of surface motion which corroborates the result from reeve et al 2013 indicating that lower young s modulus produces more substantial changes in elevation of peat surface moreover the wet peat has a lower bulk density and higher active porosity waddington et al 2010 whittington and price 2006 which lead to more significant water storage due to the larger pore size these characteristics delay the effect of effective stresses on the reduction or expansion of peat volume because the process of expulsion or infiltration of water requires more time resulting in a shift in the peak timing of surface motion another possible explanation for this is that the variation in hydraulic conductivity between wet and dry peat leads to the difference in time for excess pore water pressure to reach equilibrium biot 1941 ferronato et al 2010 moradi et al 2019 terzaghi 1943 producing the delayed effect of compression our short term simulation result which is developed from the coupling between mechanical and hydrological feedbacks agrees in general with the satellite measurements from bradley et al 2022 who found that wet peat dominated by sphagnum tends to experience a delay in peak timing as opposed to that characteristic peat in the dry state typically dominated by shrub undergoes earlier time to reach the peak of surface elevation these distinct behaviours of surface motion including amplitude and peak timing between wet and dry peat could be used as a reliable indicator to assess peatland conditions however the shifts in peak timing are more evident in the satellite observations compared to our simulation with a difference of about ten weeks this discrepancy could be attributed to the seasonal growth and dieback of plants that are not included in our short term simulation peat physical properties variation between model simulation and the study location and possibly the accuracy of signal processing undertaken by bradley et al 2022 4 3 peatland carbon balance and resilience our simulations show that the peatland accumulates carbon more effectively in the drier states with the water table depth fluctuating in the range of 0 3 0 35 m because at that interval peat production reaches the maximum value as shown by belyea and clymo 2001 from observational studies and morris et al 2012 from the theoretical model digibog fig 6 therefore the significant increase in peat production cancels out the effect of a considerable rise in peat decomposition furthermore this result indicates the important contribution of vascular plants as the unsaturated zone thickness increases to peat production that provides a significant amount of above ground biomass and root biomass moore et al 2002 wallén 1986 wallèn 1987 wallén et al 1988 charman et al 2013 support our results and found that peatlands become stronger carbon sinks under a warming climate because the net primary productivity is a more critical variable than decomposition for determining long term peatland carbon accumulation however as the peatland in the stiffer drier state is less able to adjust its surface height to a falling water table it is more susceptible to periods of drought and fire damage and becomes less resilient conversely although peatlands in the wetter state will accumulate less carbon it is more resilient to further changes in the climate as the peatland surface experiences more oscillation in the wetter state and can adjust more effectively to the fluctuations of water input alshammari et al 2020 bradley et al 2022 the drop in water input will be accompanied by a decrease in surface elevation due to the compaction which maintains the relative position of the water table from the surface mahdiyasa et al 2022 whittington and price 2006 5 conclusion at the heart of this paper is an empirical and straightforward relationship between young s modulus and plant functional types in which shrubs should produce stiffer peat compared to sphagnum this simplicity combined with a scarcity of young s modulus data results in a number of sources of uncertainty in the simulations however despite these limitations the results are supported by both field and satellite data and as better data become available the inputs to the model can be modified to improve the accuracy of the results for example more realistic results may be achieved by the inclusion of the leaf drop term for shrubs and sedges on the total plant weight formulation or by adapting the formulation of plant functional type and above ground biomass to encompass a greater range of environmental conditions and peatland types the proposed model shows that the interactions between mechanical processes and plant functional types exercise considerable influence on peatland dynamics by considering the effect of plant functional types on the peat stiffness as the peatland grows the limit cycles of wet and dry attractors could coexist under the same net rainfall which potentially provides a more realistic approach to understanding bistability because the interactions between internal and external feedback mechanisms will prevent peatland from reaching the equilibrium state the condition of a continuously evolving system indicated by the increasing oscillation rate of surface motion carbon balance and water table depth over time under the same climatic influence also suggests that caution might be needed to interpret the paleorecord data from the peatland finally we demonstrate how the application of fully coupled mechanical ecohydrological feedback could help explain the regime shift tipping point and nonlinear dynamics of the peatland in multiple timeframes credit authorship contribution statement adilan w

24233,peatlands are complex systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics due to internal and external feedback mechanisms however the feedback of vegetation on peat volume changes that potentially affect peatland dynamics is not well understood here we analyse the consequences of coupling between plant functional types with peat stiffness on a nonequilibrium model of a peatland by developing mpeat model in this formulation the peat systems prefer to exist in two possible states defined by two limit cycles one corresponding to a wet and the other to a dry attractor these states can also coexist under the same net rainfall indicating bistability in which a crucial drying threshold leads to a tipping point and associated regime shift from soft wet to stiff dry states with related changes in rates of carbon storage while the shift from wet to dry states constitutes a tipping point to shift from the dry to wet states requires more sustained increases in net rainfall indicating that dry state is the more stable attractor as the peatland grows as the model peatland evolves the response of surface motion carbon accumulation and water table depth to the same external forcing becomes increasingly higher amplitude indicating that a degree of caution may be required when interpreting the paleorecord investigation of the behaviour of these states in response to seasonal variations in water budget suggests that the wet state will display high amplitude and later peak timing when compared to the dry state a phenomenon that is observed in measures of surface motion our study highlights the possible importance of mechanical ecohydrological feedback and in particular the role of the coupling between the proportion of plant functional types peat young s modulus plant weight

water budgets and carbon stocks mahdiyasa et al 2022 price 2003 waddington et al 2015 whittington and price 2006 these mechanical feedbacks are affected by vegetation malmer et al 1994 whittington et

types pft for nonequilibrium models of peatland dynamics in multiple timeframes the model simulates an ombrotrophic peat body accumulating between fixed free draining boundaries on an impermeable substrate and presumed to experience uniform surface load on a square metre basis on account of the surface vegetation deformation of the peat body is free to occur due to gravity and the poroelastic behaviour of peat as a porous medium plant functional types are assumed to be a mix of sphagnum sedge and shrub as equations exist to calculate the exact composition of this mixture relative to water table depth however what matters is that this range of plant functional types provides a varied range of mechanical properties soft sphagnum to stiff shrubs that enable feedback mechanisms to be considered these constraints mean that the model does not provide a simulation of forested peatland as the loading would be much more complex peatland that experiences substantial snowfall as the surface loading would be much more variable permafrost peatland or peatland that is frozen for a significant period as the presence of ice would completely change the mechanical behaviour of the system in essence the results of the model will be most applicable to temperate peatlands peatland behaviour is affected by the interplay between positive destabilising and negative stabilising feedback from internal and external factors these feedbacks lead to nonlinear dynamics which in turn create the possibility of peatlands having more than one equilibrium state and experiencing abrupt shifts to alternative states with fundamental differences in characteristics and structures belyea 2009 belyea and baird 2006 hilbert et al 2000 understanding the nonlinear dynamics of peatlands and in particular tipping points is important because of the possibility that a sudden shift in behaviour could release a large amount of carbon stored in the peatland berg et al 2009 jackson et al 2017 loisel et al 2017 lunt et al 2019 yu et al 2010 or may put the peatland into a less resilient state with consequences for the global carbon cycle chaudhary et al 2020 dise 2009 kleinen et al 2012 models of nonlinear peatland dynamics e g baird et al 2012 frolking et al 2010 heinemeyer et al 2010 morris et al 2012 2015 2011 swindles et al 2012 yu et al 2001 take an ecohydrological approach and assume constant or partial changes of peat physical properties within an equilibrium condition for example hilbert et al 2000 proposed the bistability of both wet and dry peatland states potentially coexist through the nonlinear interactions between water balance and mass accumulation hilbert et al 2000 also propose a tipping point could arise due to slight variability in water input which leads to the change in peatland behaviour from carbon sinks to carbon sources similarly van der velde et al 2021 developed a model to analyse regime shifts across biomes from peatland to forest indicating bistability conditions and major release of carbon when the switch occurs both hilbert et al 2000 and van der velde et al 2021 use the peatland water budget as the primary variable to determine the critical threshold before the regime shifts take place however peatland internal feedback mechanisms that can maintain the water budget are not considered and are sources of uncertainty in their models in particular these models ignore mechanical feedback and the equilibrium assumption is not realised in peatlands where sustained growth continually changes the ecology hydrology and mechanics of the peatland system mpeat mahdiyasa et al 2022 is a one dimensional model of peatland dynamics that incorporates mechanical ecological and hydrological feedbacks through the coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation which is known as poroelasticity biot 1941 coussy 2004 de boer 2000 detournay and cheng 1993 wang 2000 mpeat simulates peatland growth by adding a new layer or cohort of peat annually above the flat impermeable and rigid substrate without the requirement of an initial peat depth condition every new layer contains information about the initial value of peat physical properties including bulk density active porosity hydraulic conductivity and young s modulus mpeat conceptualises peatland into two different zones the unsaturated zone above the water table and the saturated zone below the water table aerobic condition in the unsaturated zone results in a high rate of decay while in the saturated zone peat experiences a low rate of anaerobic decay in both zones the decomposition process reduces young s modulus which indicates the stiffness of the material against tensile or compressive forces the changes in young s modulus lead to the mechanical deformation of the peat pore structure which has a significant influence on the peat bulk density active porosity and hydraulic conductivity however the effect of mechanical deformation on the peat pore structure is also affected by pft whittington et al 2007 found that peatland sites dominated by shrub experience limited compressibility leading to lower hydraulic conductivity reduction when the water table drop these conditions allow rapid water discharge from the peatland promoting drier conditions and maintaining the dominance of the shrub in contrast sites dominated by sedge or sphagnum have a better ability to expand or shrink which keeps the relative position of the water table close to the surface and supports the growth of these plant communities therefore stiffer peat dominated by shrubs could become a dry attractor while softer peat with sedge or sphagnum dominance has the possibility to turn into a wet attractor the objectives of this paper are to 1 present a model of peatland dynamics that incorporates the feedback between mechanical processes and plant functional types 2 investigate the peatland regime shifts and tipping points in a growing system accounting for fully coupled mechanical ecohydrological feedback 3 analyse both short and long term nonlinear dynamics of the peatland 2 methods we based our model on mpeat mahdiyasa et al 2022 because it includes feedback between mechanical ecological and hydrological processes as the peatland develops and adapts it by introducing fundamental changes in the formulation of peat stiffness and plant weight at the top surface this was necessary as the initial formulation of mpeat does not take into account the influence of plant functional types pft on the peat stiffness and assumes a constant proportion of pft during the simulation which significantly affects the total plant weight that acts as the source of loading by doing this we are able to use a modified version of mpeat to consider the interactions between young s modulus pft proportion plant weight and water table position fig 1 as most of the mpeat formulations remain unchanged we only describe the modifications below for the full formulation see supplementary material 2 1 model formulation in this model young s modulus is determined not only by decomposition zhu et al 2020 but also by pft peat dominated by shrub becomes stiffer and has higher young s modulus compared to sphagnum peat because the geotechnical behaviour of peat including young s modulus is related to its origin farrell 2012 which shrub produces stiffer plant litter than sphagnum ämmälä 2019 wagner et al 2012 furthermore shrub roots provide a supporting matrix in the unsaturated zone reducing the compression effect malmer et al 1994 to accommodate this behaviour young s modulus of all layers in the unsaturated zone increases to a value determined by pft in contrast if the condition is sphagnum dominant the effect of pft on young s modulus only occurs at the top surface fig 2 we propose an equation that includes the influence of decomposition and pft on the peat young s modulus as follows 1 e χ 1 θ t ζ b 1 c 1 b 2 c 2 b 3 c 3 where e is the young s modulus pa θ is the remaining mass which can be obtained from the mass per unit area that has experienced decay m t kg m 2 divided by the initial mass per unit area m 0 kg m 2 or mathematically can be written as θ t m t m 0 χ is the first young s modulus parameter pa ζ is the second young s modulus parameter b 1 b 2 b 3 are the coefficient to couple pft with young s modulus c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pft proportions with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively due to the uncertainties in the range value of peat young s modulus e g dykes 2008 price et al 2005 reeve et al 2013 we choose the parameters in eq 1 such that young s modulus value is in agreement with the data provided by boylan et al 2008 mesri and ajlouni 2007 and long 2005 in the range of 8 10 4 1 6 10 6 pa through this range value of young s modulus we enable to investigate the effect of mechanical feedback on the peatland dynamics our model formulates the water table position at the centre of a circular domed peatland which is constrained by the rivers based on the equation from childs 1969 see also morris et al 2015 swindles et al 2012 in this formulation a peatland receives the water from net rainfall that is defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration and loses water due to lateral discharge towards the rivers which is affected by the active porosity hydraulic conductivity and the distance from the centre to the river or peatland radius 2 d γ d t r ϕ 2 κ γ 2 l 2 ϕ where γ is the water table height m r is the net rainfall m y r 1 that is defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration l is the peatland radius m ϕ is the active porosity and κ is the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 water table position influences peat production decomposition rate and pft composition moore et al 2002 measured the relationship between the proportion of pft with the position of the water table and found a strong negative relationship between water table position and shrub proportion where the water table was low pft composition was dominated by shrub we apply linear regression to estimate the pft proportion based on the minimum value of water table depth in each interval from moore et al 2002 data as follows 3 c 1 2 23 z 0 28 4 c 2 1 42 z 0 63 5 c 3 0 81 z 0 64 where c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pft proportions with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively and z is the water table depth m with the range value between 0 2 0 5 m based on moore et al 2002 measurements we assume the pft proportion outside the range of the water table depth is equal to the estimated value when the water table depth is located in the limit range the value of the coefficient of determination r 2 from the linear regression model for shrub sedge and sphagnum proportions are 0 95 0 78 and 0 82 respectively these values of r 2 indicate that the linear fitting is appropriate to model the relationship between water table depth and pft proportion the dependency of pft proportion on the water table depth that is formulated in this model provides a more reasonable approach for investigating the influence of pft on peatland mechanics compared to the constant proportion of pft in the initial version of mpeat pft proportion affects the plant weight at the top surface which represents the total weight of the living plants that set up the community plant weight becomes the source of loading in this system and is calculated through the following equations mahdiyasa et al 2022 moore et al 2002 6 y c 1 10 log 10 ψ 0 409 0 985 1 d 1 g c 2 10 log 10 ψ 0 001 1 d 2 g c 3 0 144 1 d 3 g where y is the plant weight pa ψ is the peat production kg m 2 y r 1 g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 are the pft proportions and d 1 d 2 d 3 are the constants for plant wet condition with the indices 1 2 3 indicating shrub sedge and sphagnum respectively 2 2 model implementation we run two groups of simulations with different time scales in the first group we simulated long term peatland development under a constant radius of 500 m and flat substrate over a period of 6000 years with the parameter values summarised in table 1 we employed an annual time series of net rainfall fig 3 a and annual average air temperature fig 3b generated from a sinusoidal function with some noise to create variable wet or dry climatic conditions the range value of net rainfall and average air temperature used in our model are in line with the reported data from morris et al 2015 young et al 2019 and young et al 2021 in this group the water is added evenly in small increments with timesteps equal to 0 1 years to produce a stable and convergent simulation the boundary conditions of the model were an impermeable layer with no displacement at the bottom and a fully drained condition of the top layer the rate of surface motion is obtained from the annual changes in peatland height which is affected by mechanical ecological and hydrological feedback in the second group we decoupled peat production and decomposition processes and focused on the mechanical and hydrological feedback on a shorter time scale we used peat properties that had been simulated from the first group to model short term peatland surface motion with weekly timesteps over 150 weeks we chose peat properties between the ages of 4000 3900 years bp and 2000 1900 years bp to represent the dry and wet conditions of the peatland based on the position of the water table fig 4 b unlike the first set of simulations where peat production and decomposition influence the mechanical deformation through the changes in young s modulus eq 1 the swelling and shrinking in the short term simulations are affected by the plant weight at the top surface and water table position through the effective stress effective stress has an essential role in this model because it can explain the relationship between the total stress received by peat with excess pore water pressure biot 1941 price 2003 terzaghi 1943 and the effect of compaction on the peat physical properties mahdiyasa et al 2022 schlotzhauer and price 1999 whittington and price 2006 the model in this group was driven by climatic input in the form of weekly net rainfall only because all variables are not affected by air temperature fig 3c therefore throughout the year the water is added unevenly to the peatland in the short term simulation 2 3 sensitivity analysis model sensitivity to input parameters was evaluated by changing the value of parameters that couple pft with young s modulus eq 1 we chose to explore the effect of these parameters because of the shortage of information on how significant pft is on the peat stiffness which in turn influences the dynamics of the peatland we increased the value of b 1 to represent the condition that shrubs control the peat stiffness by producing a higher young s modulus in contrast the decreasing value of b 3 simulated the condition that sphagnum was the essential pft in reducing peat stiffness we performed one at a time sensitivity analysis or changed the value of one parameter and all others remained the same as the baseline value table 1 for each simulation the sensitivity analysis outputs consist of the relationship between peat stiffness with the dynamics of surface motion and the peatland carbon balance including carbon input carbon output and net carbon accumulation 3 results 3 1 long term dynamical behaviour once the unsaturated zone has developed the pft proportion fluctuates depending on the water table position which in turn affects the plant weight at the top surface for instance from 5200 4302 years bp water table depth is around 0 24 m fig 4b sphagnum is the dominant pft 44 compared to the shrub 27 and sedge 29 fig 4a and the value of plant weight is about 22 14 kg m 2 fig 4c contrastingly from 4274 3375 years bp the water table depth is around 0 32 m shrub proportion increases to 43 while sphagnum and sedge decrease to the value of 38 and 19 respectively and plant weight increases to 26 65 kg m 2 the differences in the pft composition water table depth and plant weight lead to variations in the rate of surface motion fig 5 a and b the rate of surface motion is obtained from the average rate of motion over an entire year essentially the net swelling and shrinking of a surface after a complete annual cycle with positive values indicating that the peatland surface is going up while the negative values indicate the peatland surface is going down we use the rate of surface motion to explain the movement of the peatland surface rather than the absolute position because the reference point will change over time this approach provides a more robust and efficient calculation process because it can be simulated without specifying some arbitrary datum as the peatland develops five distinct clusters of the rate of surface motion are produced three corresponding to wetter conditions 5200 4302 3199 1793 and 699 0 years bp and two corresponding to drier conditions 4274 3375 and 1764 876 years bp fig 5a the range of the rate of surface motion in the dry state is from 0 51 until 0 23 mm y r 1 with the net rainfall fluctuating around 600 790 mm y r 1 conversely if the net rainfall varies about 750 1000 mm y r 1 peatland is attracted to the wet state represented by the high rate of surface motion in the range of 1 64 and 1 52 mm y r 1 the overlap between these two ranges of net rainfall around 750 790 mm y r 1 allows the dry attractor and wet attractor to coexist which indicates the possibility of a bistability condition fig 5d dry or wet attractors are the oscillatory states of the peatland toward which that peatland system tends to evolve which have fundamental differences in characteristics and structures furthermore the transition time from dry to wet state wet shift persists for around 174 years fig 5b and requires 90 mm y r 1 change in net rainfall fig 5c whereas the transition time from wet to dry dry shift is about 26 years involving about 50 mm y r 1 change in net rainfall long term carbon input output and net accumulation are affected significantly by the peatland state for example the transition from wet to dry condition that occurs around 4301 to 4275 years bp increases the rate of carbon input from 0 33 to 0 39 kg c m 2 y r 1 due to the enhancement of productivity fig 6 a however this condition also leads to a substantial rise in the rate of peatland carbon release from 0 30 to 0 36 kg c m 2 y r 1 over the same time interval as the consequence of increasing the depth of the unsaturated zone fig 6b in contrast the transition from dry to wet state about 3374 to 3200 years bp reduces the rate of carbon addition from 0 39 to 0 33 kg c m 2 y r 1 and carbon output from 0 37 to 0 31 kg c m 2 y r 1 because of the lower peat production and decomposition process as the water table is closer to the surface from 0 31 to 0 26 m the average value of the net rate of carbon accumulation obtained from the difference between the rate of carbon input and output is about 0 024 kg c m 2 y r 1 over the simulation time fig 6c which is in line with reported measurements between 0 021 0 025 kg c m 2 y r 1 chaudhary et al 2020 loisel et al 2017 loisel et al 2014 treat et al 2016 yu et al 2010 3 2 short term dynamical behaviour peat that grows in dry conditions has different characteristics including the physical properties compared to the wet peat which results in distinct behaviour of short term surface motion during 4000 3900 years bp shrub proportion increased due to the low net rainfall between 610 660 mm y r 1 fig 3a which led to the high young s modulus value in the range of 3 53 10 5 3 65 10 5 pa fig 7 d furthermore the decrease in water input produced a deep position of the water table 0 35 0 32 m from the surface fig 4b resulting in a more considerable effect of compaction which is represented by the high value of bulk density 115 119 kg m 3 and low value of active porosity 0 33 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity 2 3 10 8 4 9 10 8 m s 1 in that period fig 7a c the condition was different during 2000 1900 years bp when peatland experienced high net rainfall 910 950 mm y r 1 which resulted in a shallow water table position 0 18 0 20 m and consequently led to the sphagnum dominance condition in this situation peat stiffness decreased indicated by the low value of young s modulus 3 14 10 5 3 22 10 5 pa the high position of the water table reduced the effective stress which produced peat with lower bulk density 93 95 kg m 3 and higher active porosity 0 41 0 43 and hydraulic conductivity 5 8 10 7 7 8 10 7 m s 1 moreover the surface loading from plant weight during 4000 3900 years bp dry period and 2000 1900 years bp wet period was around 26 12 28 92 kg m 2 and 19 38 20 44 kg m 2 respectively fig 4c peat characteristics between the ages of 4000 3900 years bp and 2000 1900 years bp which represent dry and wet periods were employed to simulate short term surface motion the amplitude of surface motion and peak timing varied between dry and wet peat over 150 weeks surface displacement ranged from 0 11 to 0 04 m for peat formed in dry condition while for peat developed in a wet environment it fluctuated between 0 21 and 0 05 m fig 8 a the negative or positive values indicate shrinkage or swelling of the peat surface from the initial elevation which was 1 52 m for the dry peat and 2 36 m for the wet peat periods of peak timing of surface motion were not synchronized across the two time series with wet peat experiencing a delay in peak timing relative to the dry peak of around five weeks in addition the hysteresis of surface elevation with the water level also appears for both dry peat fig 8b and wet peat fig 8c this phenomenon suggests the water level drops faster than the pore structure can collapse and the opposite happens when water is added to the peatland 3 3 sensitivity analysis the parameter b 1 eq 1 controls the effect of the shrub proportion on the peat young s modulus as the pft composition changes because of the fluctuation in water table depth increasing parameter b 1 to 3 75 fig 9 led to a higher young s modulus with a value between 4 07 10 5 7 92 10 5 pa which in turn reduced the rate of surface motion to the range of 1 48 until 1 12 mm y r 1 this condition on average results in a higher rate of carbon addition and carbon output with a value of about 2 2 and 5 6 compared to the baseline value because the increasing rate of carbon output is higher than carbon input the net rate of carbon accumulation decreases by around 39 moreover a higher value of young s modulus leads to a lower amplitude of surface motion for both dry peat 0 07 m and wet peat 0 17 m but the shift in peak timing is the same with the short term baseline simulation around five weeks the changes in young s modulus value due to the variation in sphagnum proportion are determined by b 3 parameter eq 1 decreasing b 3 parameter to 0 375 resulted in a lower young s modulus value 2 43 10 5 3 13 10 5 pa and as a consequence the range of surface motion rate increased to the value between 1 48 and 1 69 mm y r 1 this condition reduced the rate of carbon addition and carbon output by around 1 5 and 3 2 compared to the baseline simulation the net carbon accumulation rate increased by approximately 19 due to a greater reduction in carbon output than carbon input furthermore a lower young s modulus value led to a higher amplitude of surface motion for both dry peat and wet peat in the short term simulation with the value of about 0 20 m and 0 32 m respectively and produced a more extended shift in peak timing about six weeks 4 discussion the most significant observation arising from this model is the apparent bistability of the peatland with respect to net rainfall fig 5d with both wet and dry states being possible for the same net rainfall but at different times another view of this is that as net rainfall varies over time the peatland jumps between attractors characterised by two limit cycles in comparison to the bistability predicted by hilbert et al 2000 who consider equilibrium states our model is more complex because the system is continually evolving by definition an equilibrium state can be achieved if the state variable does not change with time however interactions between internal and external feedback mechanisms will prevent the peatland from reaching that condition because the peat physical properties including bulk density active porosity hydraulic conductivity and young s modulus change in time and space boylan et al 2008 fraser et al 2001 hogan et al 2006 lewis et al 2012 this dynamic view of an evolving system is potentially more useful as there is no indication that holocene peatlands are close to an equilibrium state it can also be seen figs 5b and 6c that as the model peatland grows the amplitude of oscillations particularly in the wet state increases this is not surprising as growth between the fixed lateral boundaries in the model will steepen hydrological gradients over time generating increasing extreme responses to the same changes in net rainfall it should also in the long term favour the dry state assuming that the processes of decay do not impose an earlier limit if these modelled results have a bearing on reality then some caution should also be exercised when interpreting the response of the peat to palaeoclimatic change as the same climate forcing could generate quite different outcomes in the evolving peatland system the inference of a permanent state of disequilibrium also raises the important question as to whether it would ever be possible for an observer on the surface of a peatland to determine if the system was tending to a long term stable carbon balance as might be expected if they were to assume a constant decay rate another key observation that operates on different time frames is the hysteretic behaviour of surface elevation with the water level short term hysteresis is a well known consequence of the filling and draining of porous matter and is obtained from field measurement the data from fritz et al 2008 showed that delayed response of the surface motion to the changes in water level results in a hysteresis loop with a positive relationship between these two variables and this observation is in agreement with our simulation results fig 10 the slope of surface elevation with water level decreases in the dry period which may indicate that peat is stiffer at depth in the study area measured by fritz et al 2008 because the enhancement of peat stiffness will produce lower surface displacement and results in a flatter curve in our simulations stiffer peat that formed in dry conditions has a smaller slope of surface elevation with water level 0 3 compared to the wet peat 0 6 while fritz et al 2008 data show that the slope in the dry and wet conditions are around 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the more pronounced difference between dry and wet conditions in the fritz et al 2008 data might be related to the peat characteristics in that specific site including the restiad pft composition compared to our model and possibly the influence of this on the microporosity rezanezhad et al 2010 silins and rothwell 1998 however the main reason for comparison with fritz et al 2008 data is to demonstrate how the model provides an interpretative framework for analysing their observation of a peatland which in other respects e g uniform surface loading and reduction in elasticity with decay can be considered comparable to our model furthermore this comparison also indicates the ability of our model to capture the heterogeneity and nonlinearity of peatland behaviour provide a context for interpreting field data and suggest that our chosen physical properties appear to be reasonable for the purpose of analysing peatland behaviour the long term nonlinear hysteretic response to oscillatory changes in net precipitation may reflect fundamental differences in the behaviour of the wetting and drying system that result from a change in the state of the peatland fig 5d intuitively differences in the response of peatland to wetting and drying are reasonable as it should be easier to lose potential energy by lowering a water table than to build potential energy this result may also indicate that the production of peat by compaction is a nonlinear process on multiannual timescales with periods of either net growth accumulation or subsidence compaction of the peat occurring in response to longer terms changes in weather or climate some evidence of such longer term oscillatory mechanical behaviour can be observed in the field observations of howie and hebda 2018 whose data when plotted on an appropriate scale appears to display evidence of multiannual oscillations in surface motion 4 1 peatland regime shifts and tipping points we found that a more substantial change in net rainfall is required to move the peatland from a dry state to wet state than the other way around fig 5a and c a significant increase in water input is necessary to produce higher excess pore water pressure and expand the pore space leading to more substantial peat water storage which is the requirement for the regime shift from dry to wet states however as the dry state develops the flow of water on the near surface will be more favourable because the compaction effect is less significant for the stiffer material and consequently near surface hydraulic conductivity will remain high preventing the peatland from accumulating more water therefore a dry state turns into a more dominant attractor that can accommodate greater perturbations and potentially becomes a preferable state in the long term as the peatland grows it is notably difficult to predict when the regime shifts will appear in complex dynamical systems scheffer et al 2009 scheffer and carpenter 2003 including peatlands belyea 2009 belyea and baird 2006 because they involve heterogeneous processes and nonlinear feedbacks however as the system approaches a tipping point the variability of state behaviour changes carpenter and brock 2006 kleinen et al 2003 oborny et al 2005 van nes and scheffer 2003 in our case is the rate of surface motion that can be used as an early warning signal for instance before the regime shift around 3200 years bp the standard deviation in the rate of surface motion increased from 0 07 to 0 27 mm y r 1 fig 11 indicating the upcoming major transition from dry state to wet state this is because the ability of the system to recover from perturbations and track fluctuations is decreasing near the critical threshold berglund and gentz 2002 the proposed model shows how the feedback between internal and external factors affects peatland states and regime shifts under uniform landscape conditions however the state behaviour is also influenced by the spatial topography of the peatland assuming a sufficiently complex landscape e g blanket bog with variable slopes drainage lines and local hydrology and then on account of lateral flow with variations in the net water budget it appears to be quite likely that wet and dry states could coexist in a landscape and particularly if the net rainfall were to fall within the region of bistability this conclusion is supported by satellite observation of surface motion that indicates the bimodal wet state or dry state behaviour in such landscape bradley et al 2022 with a mean annual net rainfall of around 800 mm y r 1 a value that is remarkably close to the 760 to 790 mm y r 1 annual net rainfall range in which bistability occurs within our model however in practice the situation is potentially far more complex for example microtopography of hummocks and hollows also exerts an influence on peatland mechanical behaviour marshall et al 2022 at a much smaller scale 1 10 m than the 90 m scale observations of bradley et al 2022 a complex landscape together with the variability of the peat physical properties throughout the peatland area may also promote one state to be more stable than the other slope variabilities in a complex landscape have a major impact on the peatland hydrology holden 2005 holden and burt 2003 where the areas with a steeper slope experiences a higher rate of water discharge this condition results in a smaller decrease in net rainfall required to shift from wet state to dry state than would be the case if the substrate was flat moreover higher bulk density and lower hydraulic conductivity at mesotope margins baird et al 2008 lapen et al 2005 lewis et al 2012 suggest smaller peat water storage in that location which supports the dry state becoming more stable conversely lower hydraulic gradients at mesotope centres will promote the accumulation of water resulting in the wet condition becoming a dominant state the state should change rapidly at a transition region between these two areas margin and centre and this is consistent with satellite observations bradley et al 2022 4 2 peatland characteristics in different states our simulation results show apparent differences in the characteristics of peatland surface motion between the wet state and dry state over long term and short term periods in the long term simulations the rate of surface motion of dry peat is lower compared to wet peat fig 5a and b the plant community composition in the dry state is dominated by shrub alshammari et al 2020 moore et al 2002 sottocornola et al 2009 wierda et al 1997 which increases peat stiffness fig 7d and loading from plant weight at the top surface fig 4c the presence of shrub roots provides a supporting matrix malmer et al 1994 particularly in the unsaturated zone where mechanical deformation mainly occurs fenton 1980 mahdiyasa et al 2022 quinton et al 2000 waddington et al 2010 whittington and price 2006 which limits the expansion and contraction of peat volume and prevent the peatland surface from oscillating with a higher amplitude in the short term simulation the differences between wet and dry states are not only the magnitude but also the peak timing of surface motion generally if we exclude the effect of peat addition and decomposition the main drivers in short term surface motion are the interactions between effective stress excess pore water pressure and peat physical properties the peat physical properties of short term simulations are obtained between the ages of 4000 3900 bp and 2000 1900 bp to represent the dry and wet states respectively fig 7 the different values of young s modulus between the two states result in a considerable distinction in the amplitude of surface motion which corroborates the result from reeve et al 2013 indicating that lower young s modulus produces more substantial changes in elevation of peat surface moreover the wet peat has a lower bulk density and higher active porosity waddington et al 2010 whittington and price 2006 which lead to more significant water storage due to the larger pore size these characteristics delay the effect of effective stresses on the reduction or expansion of peat volume because the process of expulsion or infiltration of water requires more time resulting in a shift in the peak timing of surface motion another possible explanation for this is that the variation in hydraulic conductivity between wet and dry peat leads to the difference in time for excess pore water pressure to reach equilibrium biot 1941 ferronato et al 2010 moradi et al 2019 terzaghi 1943 producing the delayed effect of compression our short term simulation result which is developed from the coupling between mechanical and hydrological feedbacks agrees in general with the satellite measurements from bradley et al 2022 who found that wet peat dominated by sphagnum tends to experience a delay in peak timing as opposed to that characteristic peat in the dry state typically dominated by shrub undergoes earlier time to reach the peak of surface elevation these distinct behaviours of surface motion including amplitude and peak timing between wet and dry peat could be used as a reliable indicator to assess peatland conditions however the shifts in peak timing are more evident in the satellite observations compared to our simulation with a difference of about ten weeks this discrepancy could be attributed to the seasonal growth and dieback of plants that are not included in our short term simulation peat physical properties variation between model simulation and the study location and possibly the accuracy of signal processing undertaken by bradley et al 2022 4 3 peatland carbon balance and resilience our simulations show that the peatland accumulates carbon more effectively in the drier states with the water table depth fluctuating in the range of 0 3 0 35 m because at that interval peat production reaches the maximum value as shown by belyea and clymo 2001 from observational studies and morris et al 2012 from the theoretical model digibog fig 6 therefore the significant increase in peat production cancels out the effect of a considerable rise in peat decomposition furthermore this result indicates the important contribution of vascular plants as the unsaturated zone thickness increases to peat production that provides a significant amount of above ground biomass and root biomass moore et al 2002 wallén 1986 wallèn 1987 wallén et al 1988 charman et al 2013 support our results and found that peatlands become stronger carbon sinks under a warming climate because the net primary productivity is a more critical variable than decomposition for determining long term peatland carbon accumulation however as the peatland in the stiffer drier state is less able to adjust its surface height to a falling water table it is more susceptible to periods of drought and fire damage and becomes less resilient conversely although peatlands in the wetter state will accumulate less carbon it is more resilient to further changes in the climate as the peatland surface experiences more oscillation in the wetter state and can adjust more effectively to the fluctuations of water input alshammari et al 2020 bradley et al 2022 the drop in water input will be accompanied by a decrease in surface elevation due to the compaction which maintains the relative position of the water table from the surface mahdiyasa et al 2022 whittington and price 2006 5 conclusion at the heart of this paper is an empirical and straightforward relationship between young s modulus and plant functional types in which shrubs should produce stiffer peat compared to sphagnum this simplicity combined with a scarcity of young s modulus data results in a number of sources of uncertainty in the simulations however despite these limitations the results are supported by both field and satellite data and as better data become available the inputs to the model can be modified to improve the accuracy of the results for example more realistic results may be achieved by the inclusion of the leaf drop term for shrubs and sedges on the total plant weight formulation or by adapting the formulation of plant functional type and above ground biomass to encompass a greater range of environmental conditions and peatland types the proposed model shows that the interactions between mechanical processes and plant functional types exercise considerable influence on peatland dynamics by considering the effect of plant functional types on the peat stiffness as the peatland grows the limit cycles of wet and dry attractors could coexist under the same net rainfall which potentially provides a more realistic approach to understanding bistability because the interactions between internal and external feedback mechanisms will prevent peatland from reaching the equilibrium state the condition of a continuously evolving system indicated by the increasing oscillation rate of surface motion carbon balance and water table depth over time under the same climatic influence also suggests that caution might be needed to interpret the paleorecord data from the peatland finally we demonstrate how the application of fully coupled mechanical ecohydrological feedback could help explain the regime shift tipping point and nonlinear dynamics of the peatland in multiple timeframes credit authorship contribution statement adilan w

24234,protection from gravitational natural hazards such as snow avalanches and rockfall is among the most important ecosystem services provided by forests in steep mountain terrain such as the european alps these so called protection forests often have to be actively managed to ensure a sustainable ecosystem service provision in time and space for studying these slowly developing ecosystems dynamic forest models are important tools to assess the effect of management on the protective function however existing models focus on the current protective effect and in many cases neglect aspects of stand resistance and resilience to large disturbances which are important factors for maintaining the long term protective function therefore we developed proform a new dynamic forest model aimed at 1 reproducing stand dynamics of managed temperate mountain forests and 2 assessing their protective function in detail proform is a structurally simple model that contains mechanistic formulations of basic demographic processes but was developed mainly with empirical data it is spatially explicit and was developed with a focus on regeneration dynamics the model is parameterized for four tree species picea abies abies alba fagus sylvatica and acer pseudoplatanus and four elevational zones ranging from mixed species submontane to spruce dominated subalpine forests proform was calibrated with and validated against independent data from long term forest inventories from switzerland it exhibited a satisfactory performance in reproducing measured basal area stem number diameter distribution and mean crown ratio at the stand level comparable to the performance of other typically more complex models illustrative example simulations demonstrate the assessment of the protective function of a stand against gravitational hazards according to multiple criteria used in forestry practice in alpine countries proform is a valuable new tool to study the impacts of management on the protective effect of mountain forests and to inform forest managers keywords dynamic forest model spatially explicit model model calibration model validation stand dynamics sustainable forest management forest inventory data data availability proform v1 02 original data github the experimental forest management network reference data envidat 1 introduction mountain forests provide important ecosystem services es such as timber carbon storage water regulation scenic beauty and protection of human infrastructure from gravitational natural hazards so called protection forests cf eea 2010 in the alpine countries of switzerland and austria 49 and 42 respectively of the forested area provides a protective function against mass movements such as snow avalanches rockfall and landslides bundesministerium für land und forstwirtschaft 2022 losey and wehrli 2013 in general terms the protective quality of a forest depends on stand structure and composition brang et al 2006 which are arising from site conditions and climate as well as the local disturbance and management history in many mountain forests protective es should be provided continuously and on a relatively small spatial scale single stands to hillslopes e g above villages or other human infrastructure such as roads to ensure protection in the long term these stands should not only reduce the risk of natural hazards but also be resistant and resilient to disturbances and therefore feature a species composition in accordance with site conditions a sustainable diameter distribution and continuous regeneration brang 2001 to meet these requirements most protection forests have to be managed regularly as natural forest dynamics at small spatial scales may e g lead to low resistance and high risks of bark beetle outbreaks with increasing stand density low resilience due to suppressed regeneration and insufficient protection after large disturbances brang et al 2006 dorren et al 2004 o hara 2006 mountain forests develop slowly and hence observation or even experimentation alone are unlikely to be able to unravel appropriate approaches to sustainable protection forest management dynamic vegetation models dvms are valuable tools to study the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers such as climate change and management on forest dynamics and es provision maréchaux et al 2021 to assess the protection effect of simulated forest stands against natural hazards two approaches have been used first dynamic forest models have been coupled with models that explicitly simulate natural hazards mainly rockfall examples include wehrli et al 2006 who fed outputs of the forest gap model forclim into the rockfall model rockfornet berger and dorren 2007 and estimated the residual hazard of a stand calculated as the percentage of rocks that are not stopped within the forest further examples were provided with the growth simulator prognaus brauner et al 2005 and the hybrid patch model picus rammer et al 2010 woltjer et al 2008 second a more common approach is to derive indices of es provision from metrics describing forest structure and composition the main output of dvms via so called linker functions blattert et al 2017 the linker function s output can be classified in two groups a categorical assessment in two or three categories using threshold values for stand characteristics such as stem density gap size basal area or projected canopy area e g brang and hallenbarter 2007 cordonnier et al 2008 wehrli et al 2007 and b numerical indices quantifying the degree of protection a forest provides e g briner et al 2013 cordonnier et al 2014 elkin et al 2013 the widely used numerical indices for snow avalanches and rockfall by cordonnier et al 2014 are examples for complex linker functions the index for avalanche protection incorporated basal area average diameter at breast height dbh and slope whereas the one for rockfall protection used stem density average dbh the percentage of evergreen and deciduous species slope rock diameter and density and initial rock fall height many of the linker functions for quantifying the es protection from natural hazards that are used with dvms in europe are based directly or indirectly on nais frehner et al 2005 the system for assessing protection forest quality in swiss forestry practice it specifies the minimal and ideal attributes of a forest stand for each combination of site type i e phytosociological association and natural hazard by describing forest states that are expected to provide sufficient and sustainable protection these attributes called minimal and ideal profiles consist of threshold values for a series of forest attributes including species mixture vertical and horizontal stand structure stand stability and various aspects of tree regeneration most linker functions used in dvms focus on natural hazard specific prerequisites regarding stem density canopy cover and gap size for the spatially explicit models however aspects related to resistance such as species composition or stand stability and to resilience such as abundance and composition of regeneration have hardly ever been included exceptions are the indices used with landclim briner et al 2013 elkin et al 2013 that include the number of species or distinguish between coniferous and broadleaved species and the assessment of regeneration density as a measure of resilience cordonnier et al 2008 irauschek et al 2017a in simulation studies so far the protective function has never been estimated based on the full breadth of nais indicators frehner et al 2005 which are used in multiple alpine countries one of the main reasons is that very few of the models actually provide the outputs to do so particularly regarding tree regeneration dynamics for these reasons we developed and evaluated proform protection forest management a new forest simulation model specifically aimed at studying the impacts of management on forest dynamics and the detailed assessment of the protective function the focus on regeneration and spatial stand structure in model development allows for the assessment of the protective quality with a broad set of indices adapted from nais proform is a process based model operating at the stand scale that was developed mostly with empirical data it is parameterized for four of the most important stand dominating tree species in switzerland i e norway spruce picea abies l h karst silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l and sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus l brändli et al 2020 and four distinct elevational zones in the swiss alps the current version of the model does not represent large disturbances and assumes a constant climate in this paper we present the model structure its parameterization and validation as well as examples for the assessment of the protective quality of simulated stands 2 materials and methods 2 1 system nais the indices used in proform to assess the protection forest quality are based on nais the swiss guidelines for protection forest management frehner et al 2005 in the neighboring countries france gauquelin and courbaud 2006 italy berretti et al 2006 vacik et al 2010a 2010b austria and germany amt der tiroler landesregierung 2019 basch and interreg 2021 similar frameworks that are based on nais are used in nais minimal and ideal profiles are formulated for each combination of site type and prevailing natural hazard the minimal profile describes the stand s state that is required to provide an effective and sustainable protective function while the ideal profile describes the long term ideal state i e a forest state well above the minimum requirements the profiles comprise threshold values and ranges in seven categories 1 species mixture in terms of their share of canopy cover 2 vertical structure i e the stand s diameter distribution stem number and basal area 3 horizontal arrangement i e the spatial clustering of trees texture maximum gap size and total canopy cover 4 stability of support trees i e those trees that contribute most to the stand s stability in terms of crown length and shape stem slenderness and rooting stability 5 seedbed quality in terms of the abundance of competing ground vegetation and suitable microsites for germination 6 seedlings trees 10 to 40 cm in height and 7 saplings and thicket trees 40 cm in height to 12 cm dbh both latter categories in terms of species composition and abundance thus the nais system allows for the assessment of a stand s current protective quality its resistance against severe disturbances and its resilience after a disturbance based on an assessment of the stand structure species composition vertical and horizontal arrangement regeneration structural stability etc the minimal and ideal profile for each category is compared to the current forest state as well as the state expected for 50 years in the future assuming that no interventions were to take place to this end a semi quantitative index value is awarded for each category ranging from very bad across minimal to ideal if the minimal profile is not met presently or in the coming 50 years in at least one category management interventions are defined to ameliorate the protective function provided that they are cost efficient for more details cf brang et al 2006 2 2 description of proform here we present an abbreviated and simplified description of the proform model version 1 0 the complete description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 is available in the supplementary material s1 there all model equations algorithms parameters including their values as well as the parameterization and calibration procedures are described proform is implemented in r r core team 2021 and the source code is freely available schmid et al 2023 2 2 1 overview the purpose of proform is to predict the dynamics of managed forest stands and to assess the resulting protective function against gravitational natural hazards proform is a dynamic spatially explicit process based model the main premise in its development was to keep the processes and functions simple and interpretable and to develop and parameterize them with empirical data as much as possible proform is parameterized for the four most important tree species in swiss protection forests norway spruce picea abies subsequently abbreviated as pabi silver fir abies alba abbr aalb european beech fagus sylvatica abbr fsyl and sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus abbr apse brändli et al 2020 the model is parameterized for four elevational zones henceforth called strata i e submontane sm upper montane um high montane hm and subalpine sa according to nais frehner et al 2005 for the time being we have assumed the climate to be constant and do not simulate disturbances other than management simulated stand development emerges from the growth of trees on spatially explicit cells in turn stand development is determined by the basic demographic processes spatial interactions and management the model is based on two main entities grid cells and cohorts the grid cells form the spatial basis and each cell is characterized by its size its location within the grid its capacity for regeneration cell quality and its local topography table 1 these qualities are static state variables sensu grimm et al 2006 each cell contains either one or two cohorts depending on the simulation settings for details see further below cohorts are the basic unit to describe trees in the model and consist of aggregations of identical trees they are characterized by the true state variables i e changing over time species spc stem number n diameter at breast height d height h and height to crown base hcb the number of cohorts per cell is constant and they can therefore also be empty bare ground and hence have the species none assigned table 1 the positions of individual trees within a cohort are unknown the environment is represented by the current time step of the simulation one time step equals one year and for each time step two distinct states of the state variables are calculated state 1 in spring before the growth period and state 2 in fall after the growth period but before management total simulation time can be chosen by the user typically it is ca 100 years proform is a three dimensional model containing x and y coordinates of each cell and the height of each cohort as the z coordinate grid cells cover the entire simulation area and are hexagonal in shape fig 1 in order to facilitate the calculation of neighbor interactions as in this setting all neighbors are equidistant depending on the simulation settings their size ranges between 40 and 100 m2 chosen so that the canopy of a dominant tree can fill the entire cell the size and dimensions of the simulation grid can be chosen freely with a typical size of around 1 ha spatial interactions occur between cohorts on neighboring cells and depending on the process the state variables of the cohorts on one or two rings of equidistant neighbors of the target cell are considered fig 1 the model uses a toroidal representation of space to avoid edge effects at initialization proform assembles the stand based on a table containing the state variables for each cohort on each cell and the grid specifications cell size and grid dimensions provided in the simulation settings and establishes the neighbor relationships using a stochastic process values of local topography and cell quality are assigned to each cell according to parameterized ranges management instructions can be passed as input data to the model in the simulation settings a series of parameters have to be defined the stratum i e the elevational zone determining the potential species composition of the stand and the sets of parameter values to be applied in the functions describing the demographic processes the total simulation time in years site aspect and slope in degrees used for calculating certain competition indices and the characterization of gaps and the species composition of the surrounding forest which is used to determine the probabilities of species assignment at germination and thus potential species change after the death of the last tree of a cohort furthermore the stand s site and regeneration quality have to be defined on an ordinal scale of 1 low to 5 high these parameters are aggregated proxies for a series of abiotic and biotic factors such as nutrient availability soil water content or browsing pressure that influence tree growth site quality and regeneration growth and abundance regeneration quality and are used for calculating stratum specific reduction factors called pre factors for growth and regeneration respectively linear interpolation between a minimal value and 1 cf eq s1 2 in supplementary material s1 there are two main processes in proform that are executed consecutively fig 2 first stand development is calculated based on natural forest dynamics and the scheduled management interventions second the protective function of the stand over time is assessed forest dynamics and management are calculated in a loop of eight steps over each time step after the variable values from the initialization data have been assigned to state 2 fall of the first time step 1 calculation of auxiliary variables for state 2 2 calculation of the change in stem numbers through management if scheduled for the current time step 3 saving of a copy of the current state 4 increasing the time step by one 5 updating the state variables of state 1 spring 6 calculation of the auxiliary variables for state 1 7 calculation of changes in state variables through natural forest dynamics growth mortality and regeneration and 8 updating the state variables of state 2 the calculation of changes in state variables and the updating processes are applied to all cohorts simultaneously in the second process using the complete simulation results the protective quality is assessed retrospectively for each time step in turn in three steps 1 gaps i e areas without trees 12 cm in dbh are identified and characterized in terms of area length along the slope and width perpendicular to the slope 2 relevant stand characteristics are derived and 3 these characteristics are compared to the minimal and ideal profiles of the respective stratum and natural hazard and the indices of protection quality are calculated 2 2 2 forest dynamics and management growth is calculated differently for cohorts below and above a threshold d of 12 cm for cohorts between the minimal h of 10 cm and d 12 cm referred to as regeneration height growth dh is modeled eq 1 potential height growth dhpot is a linear function of height h the competition index cih local topography site slope and aspect as well as stratum specific constants of the degree day sum and the standard evapotranspiration index spei including an intercept abbreviated in matrix notation xβ in eq 1 written out in eqs s1 28 s1 32 the auxiliary variable cih is a proxy of competition for multiple resources such as light nutrients and rooting space it is calculated as the weighted sum of the auxiliary variable basal area ba of the neighboring cells schmid et al 2021 and eq s1 12 potential height growth is reduced by site conditions pre factor pfdh based on the regeneration quality of the stand eq 1 1 d h p f d h d h p o t p f d h exp x β diameter growth dd of this regeneration is derived from height using a linear allometric function eq s1 35 for cohorts with d 12 cm referred to as adult trees diameter growth is modeled eq 2 we assume that trees have a potential growth rate ddpot that is constant between a d of 12 cm and a species specific threshold d fig 3a based on data of the swiss national forest inventory cf fig s1 9 in supplementary material s1 above which it declines linearly to zero at a species specific maximum dmax eq s1 37 this potential growth rate is reduced by a reduction factor rfdd calculated as a function of the local competition index cid and an exponent expdd fig 3 b and eq s1 38 and by site conditions pre factor pfdd based on the site quality of the simulated stand eq 2 the auxiliary variable cid eq s1 18 is closely related to cih height growth of adult trees is derived from diameter using a logistic allometric function of d eq s1 33 all growth functions are species specific and the functions for adult trees are also stratum specific 2 d d p f d d r f d d c i d d d p o t d mortality is modeled explicitly in cohorts with h 130 cm only as stem numbers are not tracked below this threshold single tree mortality i e the reduction of n per cohort dnmort is determined in a stochastic process using a species specific mortality probability the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm is determined using empirically derived logistic probability functions that have previously been used in the model forclim hülsmann et al 2018 they depend on relative basal area increment relbai calculated from d and dd and in the case of spruce the competition index cim eqs s1 46 s1 49 the auxiliary variable cim is a proxy for stand age and is calculated as the mean diameter of all cohorts with d 7 cm in the entire stand to avoid extrapolation beyond the data range underlying these functions the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm is assumed to be constant regeneration i e the appearance of new trees is represented by two processes either through a germination from bare ground or b the presence of advance regeneration directly after the last tree of a cohort has died or has been harvested both processes contain a stochastic element and are modified by site conditions pre factor pfgi based on the regeneration quality of the simulated stand the potential annual germination probability of seedlings in an empty cohort is calculated based on a bernoulli trial defined by a cumulative success probability of 95 over a stratum specific time tgerm this potential germination probability is multiplied by pfgi and further reduced if there is another non empty cohort on the same cell eqs s1 60 s1 63 to determine the actual germination probability the process of advance regeneration is only modeled in strata with one cohort per cell where regeneration below the canopy is not kept track of explicitly hm and sa see further below if advance regeneration occurs the cohort is immediately populated with saplings instead of being changed to bare ground assuming that the germination has happened previously the probability for advance regeneration being present depends on the cohort s d before death or harvest and on pfgi eq s1 66 cohorts with h 130 cm seedlings and saplings have no stem numbers assigned as the development of the stem number of the early phase of regeneration is poorly understood due to its high stochasticity and because in a management context usually merely the presence of and area covered by seedlings and saplings are of relevance but not their exact stem number therefore only when a cohort grows beyond that threshold dningr and thereby future n is determined in the process referred to as ingrowth dningr is calculated from a species specific maximal stem number that is modified by cell quality a proxy for the suitability of a microsite for regeneration and by pfgi the pre factor based on the regeneration quality of the simulated stand and further reduced if there is already a cohort with h 130 cm on the same cell eqs s1 41 s1 43 the change in height to crown base dhcb is modeled with a function developed from theoretical considerations the main driver of dhcb is the competition index cic an auxiliary variable that is a proxy for the shading that a cohort experiences from its neighbor cells it is calculated as a variant of the bal basal area of larger trees in the neighboring cohorts including all cohorts with d larger than a certain fraction of the target cohort s d antos et al 2010 as not only larger neighbors influence crown growth or recession but considerably smaller neighbors do not eq s1 22 in a first step the potential change in hcb dhcbpot is calculated below a first threshold value of cic i e in situations with only few or small neighboring cohorts the crown base is lowered through secondary crown development stagnation in case of spruce above this value dhcbpot is positive and the crown base is elevated above a second threshold value of cic dhcbpot increases at its maximal rate fig 3c and eq s1 57 this maximum value of dhcbpot is determined by 1 an absolute maximum and 2 a maximum fraction of tree height eq s1 53 the minimum value at a cic of zero is calculated as a negative share of the maximal value eq s1 55 to obtain the definitive dhcb dhcbpot is if necessary capped to ensure that 1 a minimal crown ratio fraction of tree height occupied by the crown is retained and 2 hcb does not drop below zero eqs s1 54 s1 56 and s1 58 currently there are two management types in proform both are based on the concept of relative diameter classes rdc mina et al 2017 the instructions for each management intervention state the time step of the intervention and the share of basal area to be removed by species from a fixed number of relative diameter classes of equal width spanning the respective current range of diameters this formulation allows for a reliable translation of empirical single tree harvest records as usually found in inventories into model instructions mina et al 2017 the management type rdc tree randomly removes single trees from cohorts according to the instructions and thereby mimics a single tree selection type of continuous cover forestry ccf brang et al 2014 pommerening and murphy 2004 the management type rdc cohort which is not used in this study randomly removes entire cohorts and corresponds to a fine grained version of group selection in ccf both algorithms determine dnmgm the number of trees to be harvested within each cohort the functions updating the state variables of state 1 and 2 depend on their previous values and the changes since then either through management or forest dynamics hence there are no time lag effects a cohort s species can change at germination and after the complete harvesting or natural death of the entire cohort with or without advance regeneration the new species is randomly selected according to probabilities for each species that are determined by the currently simulated species share and the species shares of the surrounding forests defined in the simulation settings ecological differences between species e g shade tolerance are not included in this simplified approach cf s1 for the rationale the updated stem number results from the previous stem number dningr dnmort and dnmgm in case only growth occurred the updated diameter height and height to crown base are calculated from the respective previous value and the corresponding change dd dh and dhcb respectively if all trees in a cohort died naturally or were harvested and no advance regeneration is present these state variables are set to zero if advance regeneration is present d is set to zero h to the corresponding parameterized minimum height and hcb is randomly selected from within the possible values restricted by the minimal crown ratios according to the updated species if germination occurs d and hcb remain at zero and h is set to the minimal cohort height of 10 cm 2 2 3 assessment of protection quality to assess the protective quality of the simulated stand the minimal and ideal profiles frehner et al 2005 according to the simulation s stratum and the selected natural hazard snow avalanche landslide erosion debris flow rockfall or torrents floods are defined in terms of the modeled variables the profiles used in proform reflect the combination of site types in the stratification see section 2 3 and the natural hazards threshold values and ranges of the different stand characteristics for all but one category seedbed quality are derived the assessment for each time step is based on the state variables of state 1 and starts by the analysis of gap size in nais gaps are defined as areas without trees that have a diameter larger or equal to 12 cm in proform assuming that a cohort s canopy covers the entire cell gaps are defined as continuous areas of adjacent cells with no cohorts with d 12 cm irrespective of their size or shape for each gap the area in m2 the maximal length along the slope and the maximal width perpendicular to the slope both in m are determined using the cell borders as limits and taking the stand s slope into account in nais gap borders in rockfall protection forests are delimited by stem positions rather than canopy borders therefore an extended gap length is calculated assuming a mean position of the outermost tree within a cell as the exact tree positions are unknown a numerical index for each nais category is calculated by comparing the respective stand characteristics to the profiles the indices per category are calculated as the mean of multiple subindices each relating to one stand characteristic within that category an index value of 1 indicates that the minimal profile is not met in any subindex 0 that the minimal but not the ideal profile is met and 1 that the ideal profile is achieved to avoid compensation of below minimal subindex values a maximum combined index value of 0 1 is enforced if a single subindex is valued below zero the index for species mixture checks the species composition in terms of basal area of trees with d 12 cm the index for vertical structure checks the canopy cover shares of four diameter classes 12 cm 12 30 cm 30 50 cm and 50 cm and in rockfall protection forests also the stem numbers in four diameter classes 8 12 cm 12 24 cm 24 36 cm and 36 cm as well as the total basal area of trees with d 8 cm three rockfall scenarios are implemented one with small rocks 0 02 m3 and two with larger rocks of 1 m3 vol the latter differentiating hillslope lengths of 250 and 500 m with the prerequisites determined using rockfornet berger and dorren 2007 the index for the horizontal arrangement texture checks gap area maximal length and width as well as total canopy cover with the minimal thresholds depending on the natural hazard the stability of support trees is assessed with an index based on mean crown ratios support trees are defined as the trees with the largest diameter within the four diameter classes used for the species mixture index a total of 100 trees per hectare are selected for the assessment with the number of trees per diameter class corresponding to the total share of cohorts within these classes the index for seedlings 10 h 40 cm checks seedling abundance and their species composition in gaps the index for saplings and thicket h 40 cm to d 12 cm checks the total area covered by this regeneration class and its composition 2 3 model parameterization most of the parameter values used in proform were determined at the submodel level based on the analysis of empirical data or on expert knowledge parameterization described here additionally some parameter values were calibrated by comparing simulated emergent patterns to independent stand measurements see section model calibration the four strata that proform is currently parameterized for encompass the most abundant site types of the corresponding elevational zone in swiss protection forests arge 2020 frehner et al 2021 2005 currently 56 of the protection forest area lie in the upper montane um mixed species forests naturally dominated by beech and silver fir occurring between 800 and 1400 m a s l high montane hm naturally homogenous spruce silver fir forests 1200 1700 m a s l and subalpine zones sa spruce dominated forests with cluster texture 1500 2000 m a s l under climate change elevational zones are expected to shift upwards and an increasing share of the protection forest area will come to lie in the submontane zone sm multi layered beech dominated mixed species forests currently located between 350 and 700 m a s l projections based on two variants of the a1b climate scenario 4 2 c and 2 9 c increase in annual mean temperature and 13 7 and 4 6 annual precipitation respectively place roughly 40 of today s protection forest area in this elevational zone losey and wehrli 2013 frehner and huber 2019 the detailed method for and results of the selection of the corresponding site types are described in schmid et al 2021 and in s1 respectively the strata and their corresponding site types were used on the one hand to guide the collection of field data of regeneration growth schmid et al 2021 and to determine the subset of inventory data for the parameterization of the model and on the other hand to set basic model characteristics depending on the stratum including potential species composition the number of cohorts per cell and cell size in sm silver fir beech and maple can occur in um all four species in hm spruce and silver fir and in sa only spruce in sm and um each cell contains two cohorts as regeneration below the canopy is an important trait of forests at lower elevations in hm and sa there is only one cohort per cell as regeneration at higher elevations occurs primarily in gaps although we acknowledge that in hm fir regeneration can be found under a spruce canopy two data sets were used to parameterize multiple model functions first the swiss national forest inventory brändli et al 2020 wsl 2020 from which a subset of all four inventories corresponding to the site types of each stratum was used arge 2020 frehner et al 2021 this data set is simply referred to as nfi data the second dataset henceforth called regeneration growth data comprises height growth data of regeneration in forest gaps brüllhardt et al 2020 schmid et al 2021 the data of schmid et al 2021 contains measurements of spruce in hm and sa and was extended for this study to silver fir beech and maple as well as the strata sm and um brüllhardt et al 2020 gathered data on beech and maple regeneration growth in low elevation forests of which only the explicitly measured height growth data was used both studies followed very similar field protocols in terms of site selection and data collection and could therefore be readily combined the regeneration growth data table 2 consists of 5 004 measurements of tree height and tree height growth of 928 dominant and co dominant trees within regeneration clusters located in small gaps and under the canopy collected across large parts of switzerland fig 4 competition from the surrounding stand was assessed by indices derived from an inventory of all trees in a 9 to 15 m radius around each plot center including tree positions schmid et al 2021 field sites are characterized by slope aspect local topography and data on the degree day sum and drought index spei remund et al 2016 three basic stratum specific cell parameters are assigned during the initialization cell size local topography and cell quality cell size was parameterized using crown projection areas pretzsch 2014 of the four target species so that a large tree would fill an entire cell with its canopy the probabilities for each class of local topography to be assigned at initialization were derived from the observations within the regeneration growth data the possible range of cell quality was estimated based on expert knowledge the growth functions were parameterized using both the regeneration growth data and the nfi data the detailed methodology for deriving the potential height growth functions from the regeneration growth data are described in schmid et al 2021 the diameter height allometries for the regeneration were parameterized using the same data set using the final height and dbh measurements of all target trees for the diameter growth of adult trees maximal growth rates ddmax the threshold diameter above which growth declines d and the maximal diameter dmax fig 3a were derived directly from nfi data the exponent determining the shape of the helper function expdd fig 3b that is used to calculate the reduction factor based on local competition was estimated based on expert knowledge the maximum value of the competition index above which no growth occurs cid max fig 3b was determined from the largest measured values in the regeneration growth data the allometries for calculating the height of adult trees from their diameter were parameterized using nfi data to determine the asymptote and shape of the functions and the output of the diameter allometries for regeneration to ensure a smooth transition between the two growth functions at d 12 cm the parameters of the species specific functions for the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm were adopted as is from hülsmann et al 2018 the species and stratum specific annual mortality probabilities for smaller trees were determined based on the mean passing times for the regeneration to grow from 130 cm height to 4 cm in diameter resulting from the height growth function and the expected reduction in stem numbers in an average cohort during that time the stem number reduction was estimated from 1 average stem numbers at 130 cm height resulting from modeled ingrowth and 2 plausible stem numbers at 4 cm diameter based on measured crown projection areas pretzsch 2014 and density assumptions the stratum specific annual germination probability of bare ground cohorts and the probability for the occurrence of advance regeneration in the strata hm and sa were parameterized using nfi data the expected time until germination has occurred with a 95 probability in a bare ground cohort tgerm was estimated based on an analysis of the temporal development of regeneration cover in the different strata the probabilities for the occurrence of advance regeneration were determined using the share of nfi plots stratified by their developmental stage that exceeded a certain regeneration cover the initial height of newly germinated trees was set to 10 cm the height of advance regeneration to 40 cm the species specific maximum number of ingrowing trees per cell was determined based on expert knowledge estimates on crown projection areas of trees at 130 cm height and mean regeneration densities to calculate the change in hcb the maximal absolute and relative rates of crown height change the species specific minimal crown ratios as well as the relative diameter threshold for trees in the corresponding competition index were estimated based on expert knowledge 2 4 model calibration a total of five parameter values in proform were calibrated using long term empirical time series of inventory data three of these parameters relate to the pre factors pfdh pfdd and pfgi which are used to reduce regeneration height growth diameter growth of adult trees and germination and ingrowth respectively the calibrated stratum specific parameters describe the values of these the pre factors when site quality in case of pfdd or regeneration quality in case of pfdh and pfgi are set to their minimal value of 1 the other two parameters are used for calculating the species and stratum specific change in hcb and represent the threshold values for the competition index cic marking the limits between secondary crown development crown base recession and maximal crown base recession cic thr1 and cic thr2 in fig 3c as calibration data inventories of experimental forest management efm plots forrester et al 2021b 2019 were used the main criteria for plot selection were that they were managed the elevational zone had to match the ones included in the model and the stands could not contain more than a few individual trees of species not included in proform furthermore the time series length should be 50 years and the plot size 0 5 ha if possible 16 plots fit these criteria of which seven were selected for calibration and the remaining nine for later validation table 3 and fig 4 two calibration plots belonged to stratum sm three to um and one each to hm and sa ranging in elevation from 550 to 1640 m a s l and in slope from 5 to 28 four plots were monospecific and three were mixed species stands only very few sycamore maples were present in one um plot and the hm plot was a pure spruce stand plot sizes ranged from 0 2 to 2 ha time series lengths from 47 to 103 years with 9 to 17 inventories at the time of the first inventory three stands were uniform thickets one a uniform stand in timber stage and three uneven aged forests detailed information on the selected plots can be found in table s2 1 in supplementary material s2 the single tree inventories contain measured and derived information on tree species dbh height crown projection area status alive to be harvested dead or missing inventories were carried out in autumn and usually followed by an intervention in the subsequent winter the first inventories were used to create initialization data for proform the data of small plots was replicated to create virtual plots of ca 1 ha same species trees with similar dbh were aggregated into cohorts with the reported crown projection areas in conjunction with the model s cell size dictating the maximum number of trees per cohort based on stand descriptions and ingrowth patterns in subsequent inventories additional cohorts containing regeneration below the caliper threshold had to be added all cohorts were distributed randomly in space as no spatial information was available for the first inventories management instructions times of interventions and species specific removal intensities for the management type rdc tree i e single tree removal were derived from the inventory data using five relative diameter classes both initialization data and management instructions only depict the four parameterized species based on the stand descriptions the raw inventory data and preliminary simulations using the uncalibrated model each plot was assigned a site and regeneration quality as well as species shares of the surrounding forest which then remained unchanged throughout the calibration process calibration simulations with the length of the respective measured time series were run and the outputs of those time steps corresponding to years with inventories before and after the management interventions were compared to the measured data additionally simulations initialized with bare ground conditions and without management were run for 1 000 years equilibrium simulations to assess the long term effects of the parameter settings model calibration was done for each stratum in a two step iterative process first the parameters relating to the pre factors were jointly calibrated starting with multiple sets of parameter values covering a plausible range simulations were run and the following metrics of the entire stand and per species were compared visually basal area stem number and diameter distributions parameter values were then iteratively adjusted by hand for further simulations until the simulation outputs matched the entire empirical time series to a satisfactory extent aiming for an overall deviation of less than 30 to ensure realistic parameter values pre factor values were not set below 0 3 i e a 70 reduction of growth and germination on the worst site conditions compared to the best second the cic thresholds for crown base change were calibrated analogously comparing simulated and measured mean crown lengths the initial set of tested parameter values was informed by the distribution of cic in previous simulation runs equilibrium simulations were used to guide parameter value estimates when the empirical records were uninformative 2 5 model validation model validation was carried out using the other nine out of the 16 efm plots table 3 and fig 4 one plot belonged to stratum sm four to um three to hm and one to sa and they were situated between 670 and 1680 m a s l at slopes between 9 and 36 all but one of the sm and um plots were mixed species stands again without a marked share of sycamore maple hm and sa plots were pure spruce stands while the validation plots in hm only contained three inventories recorded over 20 23 years and were therefore of limited use the remaining plots spanned 71 101 years with 10 16 inventories plot sizes ranged from 0 2 to 2 ha at the time of the first inventories two plots were uniform thickets four uniform stands in timber stage one a two layered stand and two uneven aged forests detailed information on the calibration plots can be found in table s2 1 the creation of model initialization data management prescriptions and simulation settings followed the same procedure as for the calibration plots using a caliper threshold of 8 cm the simulated time series of total basal area ba and stem number sn as well as of the crown ratio of the 100 thickest trees per ha cr were validated using three metrics bias precision and accuracy pretzsch et al 2002 bias is expressed as the percentage bias pbias eq 4 and precision as the standard deviation of the errors sd eq 5 with both metrics being based on relative errors eq 3 accuracy is quantified by the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 6 and 7 these metrics were calculated for each time step before and after the intervention for which an inventory was available for comparison and they were averaged over the entire simulation period furthermore simulated and measured diameter distributions dd were compared using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test in eqs 3 7 ypredi and yobsi are the predicted and observed stand metric of time

the respective strata and the equilibrium simulations as a further guide however some parameter values had to be estimated using calibrated values from other strata or species in hm and sa only one plot was available for calibration morissen and hospental respectively therefore the minimal values of pfgi and pfdh for hm and the minimal value of pfdd for sa had to be derived from other strata because in morissen no ingrowth occurred and there were relatively few trees below 12 cm dbh in hospental site quality is ideal i e 5 and therefore the minimal value of pfdd has no effect furthermore as very few records of sycamore maple were available in sm and um and none for silver fir in hm the respective cic thresholds for modeling crown length change were assumed to be identical to those of beech and spruce respectively the calibrated model yielded satisfactory results most simulated total ba sn and cr matched the empirical data closely fig 5 full results in s3 when applying the validation metrics to the calibration simulations model performance was high mean pbias over all calibration plots for ba sn and cr ranged between 2 2 and 8 5 the mean standard deviation of the error between 7 3 and 10 8 and the mean nrmse between 11 6 and 35 6 table s3 1 at the time of the last inventory the results of ba sn and cr of all species combined never deviated more than 30 from the empirical data except for two cases but only temporarily over several consecutive inventories in biel west sm the mean cr of the 100 thickest trees per ha was overestimated strongly during about half of the simulation period fig s3 1 and in hospental sa ba and sn were underestimated strongly during the first 30 simulated years fig 5j k due to an overestimation of mortality even though the simulated and measured dd of all species combined at the time of the last inventory were significantly different on a 5 level according to the kolmogorov smirnov test in all plots except sigriswil lower um and hospental sa table s3 1 they were quite similar in shape in most cases figs 5 and s3 obvious differences could be observed in biel west where the initially unimodal stand structure developed into a bimodal two layered structure which was not reproduced correctly by the model fig 5c furthermore the initially quite narrow range of tree diameters in morissen hm did not broaden sufficiently over time in the simulation fig 5i the species specific results in mixed stands deviated more from the measured data than the total stand data in biel west the sn per species matched the records rather well fig 5b but the final stand was simulated to consist of a dominant silver fir layer and a large group of intermediately sized beech instead of an upper layer and suppressed regeneration with both species mixed fig s3 1 in the two mixed species um stands buttes bdp and rougemont la the species specific ba was reproduced accurately but the sn of silver fir was underestimated while that of spruce was overestimated fig s3 3 and fig 5d e the accuracy of the simulated growth of initialized regeneration and the appearance of new regeneration throughout the simulations was assessed qualitatively in half of the simulations the growth of the initialized regeneration conformed to measurements in the other half it tended to be overestimated the amount and species composition of newly appearing regeneration matched the empirical data well furthermore in some simulations regeneration waves were simulated to appear too late 3 2 model validation the model validation yielded very good results for most plots fig 6 full results in s4 due to the short time series and incomplete records of the three hm validation plots the results of this stratum are of limited value and are reported only in s4 furthermore as very few records of sycamore maple were available the performance of this species cannot be evaluated thoroughly model performance was high with overall absolute mean pbias values of 3 2 10 4 and 7 6 for ba sn and cr respectively a maximum mean sd value of 15 9 and mean nrmse values of 18 4 31 2 and 48 8 for ba sn and cr respectively table s4 1 the simulated dd at the time of the last inventory differed significantly from the measured data on a 5 level according to the kolmogorov smirnov test table s4 1 but were similar in shape in most cases figs 6 and s4 the simulation results for biel east sm matched measured total ba and total as well as species specific sn well over time but the ba of silver fir was over and that of beech underestimated in the second half of the simulation fig 6a b this can be attributed to the initially dominant silver fir which remained very dominant throughout the simulation leading to the excessive suppression of beech mean cr were overestimated for both species during the entire simulated period fig s4 1 the dd at the last inventory revealed that the resulting stand did not correspond well to the expected two layered stand as the number of small trees was considerably underestimated fig 6c the appearance of a new group of regeneration was simulated to arrive 15 years too early and its growth was not sufficiently suppressed not shown in three of the four um validation plots buttes lcr rougemont g and sigriswil upper simulated total ba agreed well with the empirical data figs 6d s4 2 s4 4 and s4 5 but it was systematically overestimated by roughly 20 in le chenit fig s4 3 in the two mixed species plots buttes lcr and rougemont g the ba of spruce was overestimated while it was underestimated for silver fir the temporal trend in sn was reproduced well in buttes lcr but the observed increase in sn was simulated with a delay of ca 25 years fig 6e in rougemont g simulated total sn deviated negatively from the measured data over the course of the simulation but matched them again well at the end fig s4 4 however the species shares of spruce and silver fir were inverted at this point as the newly appearing regeneration consisted mostly of spruce instead of silver fir in the spruce dominated plots le chenit and sigriswil upper measured total sn were reproduced well figs s4 3 and s4 5 in all um plots simulated overall and species specific cr and the dd of the larger trees matched the empirical data well over time growth rates of the initialized regeneration were slightly too high in two simulations le chenit and rougemont g and the amount of new regeneration was overestimated in two simulations buttes lcr and sigriswil upper and underestimated in one rougemont g while the timing of its appearance was accurate except for the delay in buttes lcr mentioned above not shown in the sa validation plot realp mortality was overestimated in the first 30 years of the simulation and hence ba and sn were underestimated in this period fig 6g h simulated ba matched the records well towards the end of the simulation but sn continued to be underestimated cr of spruce agreed with the empirical data over the entire period fig s4 9 the analysis of the dd revealed that the growth rate of regeneration was overestimated not shown causing an increasing shift towards higher diameters while the shape of the curve was tracked well fig 6i 3 3 assessment of protection quality as an example for the assessment of the protection quality we calculated the corresponding set of indices for the 90 year simulations of the um plots rougemont g used for the validation and rougemont la used for the calibration we used the natural hazard profiles for torrents and floods the detailed profile values are listed in table s5 1 both stands are composed almost exclusively of norway spruce and silver fir the main difference is that rougemont g was transformed from a two layered stand into a single tree selection forest with a typical inverse j shaped diameter distribution while rougemont la featured such a diameter distribution over the entire measurement period overall both stands featured similar protective effects over time fig 7 the indices for mixture seedlings and saplings and thicket were very similar or even identical over time in both stands and always below the minimal profile the analysis of the underlying subindices revealed that among the trees with dbh 12 mixture index the share of spruce was too high and that of beech and sycamore maple too low the low index values for seedlings resulted from both the species composition almost no beech and maple and the relatively stringent requirement in the minimal profile that 80 of all cells without saplings or larger h 40 cm need to contain seedlings the index value for saplings and thicket was always slightly below the minimal profile again primarily due to species composition with too much spruce and too little beech even though the regeneration cover fulfilled the ideal profile vertical structure in rougemont g was rated better on average than in rougemont la fulfilling the minimal profile during roughly half of the simulated period both stands however failed to reach the ideal profile at any point because the lowest diameter class was consistently under and hence the upper classes underrepresented the index for horizontal arrangement is determined by the requirements regarding the natural hazard i e in this case gap length gap size and canopy cover it started out at the ideal value of 1 and dropped slightly below 0 over time driven by exceedingly long and large gaps due to the spatially random harvesting that was applied finally the index for support trees which is assessing the mean crown length of the most stable trees increased in both simulations over time from the minimum to the maximum this was due to increasing mean crown lengths of silver fir with the change happening earlier in rougemont la 4 discussion 4 1 model structure and development the purpose of proform is to investigate the effects of management on the protective function of mountain forest stands the model is process based including submodels for regeneration growth and mortality which were developed largely independently of each other using different sets of empirical data the main data sources were a combination of regeneration growth data across large parts of switzerland brüllhardt et al 2020 schmid et al 2021 the swiss nfi brändli et al 2020 wsl 2020 and forest reserve data from switzerland and germany for the mortality functions hülsmann et al 2018 only the submodel for the dynamics of the crown base height was developed based on theoretical considerations but then linked to empirical data in the model calibration being partly process based and partly based on empirical data proform is a hybrid between pure process based stand models such as 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 and pure empirical models such as bwinpro hansen and nagel 2014 or swissstandsim zell 2018 zell et al 2020 proform is more closely related to other stand scale models developed for temperate and mountain forests in which at least some submodels were developed and parameterized based on empirical data e g forclim bugmann 1996 picus lexer and hönninger 2001 seidl et al 2005 or samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 the main design principles underlying proform are 1 the use of cohorts of identical trees as the main agent similar to gap models such as forclim and 4c bugmann et al 1997 and 2 spatial explicitness by assigning each cohort to a cell with known location thus allowing for interactions among neighboring cells a concept found e g in picus and many empirical single tree stand models such as silva pretzsch et al 2002 another principle underlying proform is 3 that the basic growth equation quantifies growth under optimal conditions which is then reduced by environmental factors and local competition as experienced by the cohorts this concept is widespread and applied e g in many gap models bugmann 2001 a peculiarity of proform is the use of two growth equations to be able to simulate the growth of trees starting from very small sizes here a height of 10 cm similar to a version of forclim wehrli et al 2007 one equation is used for modeling height growth of regeneration and one for diameter growth of adult trees with the transition at 12 cm dbh in our case dictated by the calipering threshold of the swiss national forest inventory a different approach was used in sortie pacala et al 1996 by modeling stem diameter at 10 instead of 130 cm tree height apart from these two examples only few dynamic stand models include regeneration from such a small size as proform in the context of sustainable protection from natural hazard a focus on small trees i e regeneration is crucial however and proform fulfills this requirement well proform is a relatively simple model it has low structural complexity includes only four species and no explicit climate dependency of the demographic functions however it is parameterized for four discrete elevational zones to represent typical conditions in swiss mountain forests we applied a simple concept to aggregate multiple abiotic and biotic factors that influence tree growth and regeneration occurrence such as local climate soil quality or browsing pressure into two parameters for site characterization site and regeneration quality which in turn affect simulated growth and regeneration dynamics through pre factors applied to the respective functions implicitly these qualities and the resulting pre factors can be used to aggregate different factors depending on the simulated site this allows the model to be applied to stands along a large environmental gradient and thus under most conditions in the northern and central european alps however to apply the model to sites outside its original geographic range site specific parameterization of the environmental factors would be needed lastly even though the model cannot be directly used to simulate forest dynamics under a changing climate preliminary conclusions by analogy are possible due to the expected upward shift of elevational zones frehner and huber 2019 zischg et al 2021 4 2 model parameterization and calibration most of proform s parameters were not calibrated but determined using empirical data in one of three ways a by fitting statistical models e g for the core functions of the height growth of regeneration b by deriving single parameter values within more theoretical submodels e g the maximum diameter growth rate of trees 12 cm dbh or c by estimation informed by data analysis e g the time required for bare ground cells to contain regeneration in this process to which we refer as parameterization outputs of the entire model at the stand scale were not compared to empirical data a similar procedure was followed in the development of sortie pacala et al 1996 this approach conserves the process formulations and their respective parameter values as qualitative and quantitative hypotheses regarding the underlying ecological processes only in the subsequent model calibration simulated patterns emerging at the stand scale were compared to time series of independent data to determine the values of five parameters a common procedure for parameter selection would have been to conduct a sensitivity analysis e g huber et al 2018 lagarrigues et al 2015 lin et al 2022 instead we selected parameters that we deemed important to tie the model even more strongly to empirical data but for which we were unable to make an assessment in the sense of parameterization cf above the minimal values of the three pre factors used in regeneration germination and ingrowth and growth height and diameter growth were calibrated because these allow the model to simulate below optimal growth conditions which the submodels core functions are parameterized for also the two competition thresholds determining the onset of crown base lowering or elevation were calibrated to link the purely theory based submodel for crown dynamics to empirical data during calibration the parameter values were adjusted iteratively and simultaneously by hand similar to the calibration procedure by pabst et al 2008 with zelig and risch et al 2005 with forclim we deliberately decided against more sophisticated calibration procedures such as parameter optimization e g lin et al 2022 mina et al 2016 or bayesian approaches e g cailleret et al 2020 forrester et al 2021a lagarrigues et al 2015 van oijen et al 2013 that would arguably have led to a closer fit of model results to the data we had only rather few stand records per stratum available for calibration which in some cases also lacked information on certain processes relevant to calibration such as almost no records of sycamore maple or no new regeneration appearing in the stands of the hm zone therefore our simple calibration procedure offered several advantages it allowed us to avoid overfitting the model to these time series to take specific emergent patterns in equilibrium simulations into account and to use parameter values calibrated with higher certainty to estimate values of strata or species with less or no information in the calibration data finally it allowed us to select a set of parameter values that are ecologically consistent across all four strata something that is rather difficult to achieve with automated procedures cf bircher 2015 4 3 model performance the stand data from the swiss efm network forrester et al 2021b 2019 used to assess model performance during calibration and validation cover exceptionally long periods i e up to more than a century the plots selected to assess the performance of proform furthermore cover a large environmental gradient in terms of elevation and growth conditions they comprise a wide range of stand structures and species compositions and can therefore be regarded as a stringent test set the use of these records posed three main challenges that introduced uncertainties to the assessment process first there were unknown quantities of regeneration below the calipering threshold in most plots initializing the model with only the recorded trees would have created artificial lags as encountered e g by didion et al 2009 to avoid this problem assumptions had to be made on the quantity and composition of regeneration below the caliper threshold second the simulation settings for site and regeneration quality had to be estimated based on very limited local information on site conditions and the factors influencing regeneration growth e g browsing pressure third no spatial information was available on the initial stand structure and the management interventions the cohorts at initialization and the location of management interventions were therefore distributed randomly in space various model processes contain stochastic components most notably regeneration mortality and management that could compromise the meaningfulness of comparing single model runs to empirical data however preliminary tests have shown that the influence of these stochastic events on emergent patterns at the stand level is relatively small as they act on the cohort level and are averaged out over the entire stand still using the rdc harvest algorithm uncertainties were introduced as its dependency on the accuracy of the simulated diameter distribution at the time of intervention can augment existing discrepancies between simulated and measured diameter distributions over time in spite of these potential sources of error proform performed very satisfactorily in general the simulated emergent patterns of basal area stem numbers diameter distribution and species composition agreed well with observations over long periods despite it being a relatively simple model the validation revealed its ability to reproduce the dynamics of managed stands at least as well as much more complex simulation models such as samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 zelig pabst et al 2008 forclim bircher et al 2015 didion et al 2009 mina et al 2017 rasche et al 2011 wehrli et al 2005 picus irauschek et al 2017b pardos et al 2015 seidl et al 2005 silva mette et al 2009 pretzsch et al 2002 schmid et al 2006 or 4c lasch et al 2005 judging by the validation metrics reported in these studies furthermore most other forest stand models have been validated against considerably shorter time series e g 15 to 30 years for picus and silva 40 to 65 years for samsara2 zelig and 4c different versions of forclim have been validated against efm plots and some of them were also used in the present study for calibration it is noteworthy that the ability of proform to reproduce the dynamics of these plots is similar to the performance of recent forclim versions bircher et al 2015 mina et al 2017 it is quite remarkable that in spite of its simplicity and the problems underlying the definition of appropriate settings for model testing proform is performing so well 4 4 model limitations and further development despite the general success of the model the calibration and validation revealed some weaknesses and thus indications for further development the most pronounced discrepancies between observed and simulated data were evident in the diameter distributions in the sm plots biel east and biel west suggesting that the model has a problem capturing the differentiation of a uniform stand into a two layer structure this behavior resulted from 1 an incorrect representation of inter species competition and 2 an increasing divergence over time caused by the rdc management algorithm competition effects across species could certainly be refined by introducing species specific growth responses to competition and site quality another problem is that the diameter distribution in initially highly uniform young stands remained too narrow over time this became evident in the hm calibration plot morissen and to a lesser extent in the sa plots hospental and realp the underlying reason is the simplifying assumption that there are no individual differences in growth among trees of the same diameter as they are experiencing the same level of competition furthermore in the um plots buttes lcr and rougemont g the timing of new waves of regeneration was evidently delayed this could be caused by many factors playing important roles in the dynamics of regeneration establishment that are not represented in the model such as masting cycles or fluctuations in browsing pressure however the amount and in buttes lcr also the species composition of the regeneration wave matched the observations well and we therefore do not consider this a major problem still the species selection procedure at germination could be improved by including e g the local competition level and species specific shade tolerance finally growth and therefore basal area in the um plot le chenit which features extremely poor growth conditions was always overestimated this indicates that the calibrated minimal value of the growth reduction factor is not low enough as a result of attributing the same site quality instead of a slightly higher one to the more favorable site of sigriswil lower which was used for calibration even though the applied management algorithm with its spatially random selection of single trees produced good results for most plots further options should be added to the model to represent the spectrum of current management practices in mountain forests brang et al 2006 streit et al 2009 this could include locally clustered interventions round or slit shaped gaps the species specific promotion of regeneration through appropriate gap sizes or the enhancement of collective stand stability by promoting stable trees with long crowns in addition the model can be used to simulate the dynamics of unmanaged stands however the plausibility of such simulation results especially over long periods would first need to be assessed thoroughly as this was not the scope of our study 4 5 assessments of the protective quality of forest stands the assessments of the protective quality of the two um plots at rougemont revealed that these stands do not satisfy the requirements for protection forests against torrents and floods as the minimal profile was not met across all indices at any point in time this can be attributed mainly to the management schemes applied at these two plots which was not focused on maximizing the protective effect and its representation in the model the protective function in these two stands would greatly benefit from an active promotion of beech and sycamore maple as well as spatially clustered interventions instead of the random removal of single trees that resulted at some point in oddly shaped but large and or long gaps as small openings were becoming connected over time in the simulation still these two case studies illustrate the holistic approach of nais frehner et al 2005 and its implementation in proform the major model features enabling this are 1 the model s spatially explicit nature and 2 the explicit modeling of regeneration starting from very small height gap models such as forclim or 4c and distance independent growth simulators such as bwinpro or swissstandsim lack the spatial information required to assess gaps and usually model ingrowth with a size threshold well above a height of 1 3 m but cf wehrli et al 2007 for forclim while these shortcomings are not present in samsara2 this model is currently parameterized for norway spruce and silver fir only among the stand scale forest models applicable to european mountain forests picus in connection with the regeneration submodel described in woltjer et al 2008 is to our knowledge the only other model with which an assessment of the protective function of similar breadth could be achieved while picus is among the most complex forest stand models bugmann and seidl 2022 proform is located on the opposite side of the complexity spectrum hence it occupies its own niche for possible model applications as for example comparatively little input data and site characterizations are needed to run the model possible further developments of proform to improve the assessment of the protective function would be to include 1 lying deadwood as a favorable seedbed for spruce at high elevations and as obstacles to rock and snow movements 2 ground vegetation influencing local germination probabilities and 3 further tree species 5 conclusions with the development and testing of proform we have shown that it is possible to provide a relatively simple dynamic model that captures the dynamics of mountain forest stands accurately the model is mostly based on empirical data yet describes the demographic processes in an ecologically interpretable way which makes its projections more robust compared to pure empirical approaches furthermore the features of proform make it possible to represent most of the criteria used in many european countries to assess the protective function of mountain forest stands integrating both the protective function of the current stand structure as well as the stand s resistance and resilience to large disturbances thus proform can be used to assess the long term sustainability of the protective function of mountain forest stands lastly the high accuracy and level of detail in the assessment of the protective function embedded in proform render this tool valuable for investigating the complex effects of current and alternative management schemes on the provisioning of the ecosystem service protection against natural hazards of temperate mountain forests in practical forest management credit authorship

24234,protection from gravitational natural hazards such as snow avalanches and rockfall is among the most important ecosystem services provided by forests in steep mountain terrain such as the european alps these so called protection forests often have to be actively managed to ensure a sustainable ecosystem service provision in time and space for studying these slowly developing ecosystems dynamic forest models are important tools to assess the effect of management on the protective function however existing models focus on the current protective effect and in many cases neglect aspects of stand resistance and resilience to large disturbances which are important factors for maintaining the long term protective function therefore we developed proform a new dynamic forest model aimed at 1 reproducing stand dynamics of managed temperate mountain forests and 2 assessing their protective function in detail proform is a structurally simple model that contains mechanistic formulations of basic demographic processes but was developed mainly with empirical data it is spatially explicit and was developed with a focus on regeneration dynamics the model is parameterized for four tree species picea abies abies alba fagus sylvatica and acer pseudoplatanus and four elevational zones ranging from mixed species submontane to spruce dominated subalpine forests proform was calibrated with and validated against independent data from long term forest inventories from switzerland it exhibited a satisfactory performance in reproducing measured basal area stem number diameter distribution and mean crown ratio at the stand level comparable to the performance of other typically more complex models illustrative example simulations demonstrate the assessment of the protective function of a stand against gravitational hazards according to multiple criteria used in forestry practice in alpine countries proform is a valuable new tool to study the impacts of management on the protective effect of mountain forests and to inform forest managers keywords dynamic forest model spatially explicit model model calibration model validation stand dynamics sustainable forest

important ecosystem services es such as timber carbon storage water regulation scenic beauty and protection of human infrastructure from gravitational natural hazards so called protection forests cf eea 2010 in the alpine countries of switzerland and austria 49 and 42 respectively of the forested area provides a protective function against mass movements such as snow avalanches rockfall and landslides bundesministerium für land und forstwirtschaft 2022 losey and wehrli 2013 in general terms the protective quality of a forest depends on stand structure and composition brang et al 2006 which are arising from site conditions and climate as well as the local disturbance and management history in many mountain forests protective es should be provided continuously and on a relatively small spatial scale single stands to hillslopes e g above villages or other human infrastructure such as roads to ensure protection in the long term these stands should not only reduce the risk of natural hazards but also be resistant and resilient to disturbances and therefore feature a species composition in accordance with site conditions a sustainable diameter distribution and continuous regeneration brang 2001 to meet these requirements most protection forests have to be managed regularly as natural forest dynamics at small spatial scales may e g lead to low resistance and high risks of bark beetle outbreaks with increasing stand density low resilience due to suppressed regeneration and insufficient protection after large disturbances brang et al 2006 dorren et al 2004 o hara 2006 mountain forests develop slowly and hence observation or even experimentation alone are unlikely to be able to unravel appropriate approaches to sustainable protection forest management dynamic vegetation models dvms are valuable tools to study the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers such as climate change and management on forest dynamics and es provision maréchaux et al 2021 to assess the protection effect of simulated forest stands against natural hazards two approaches have been used first dynamic forest models have been coupled with models that explicitly simulate natural hazards mainly rockfall examples include wehrli et al 2006 who fed outputs of the forest gap model forclim into the rockfall model rockfornet berger and dorren 2007 and estimated the residual hazard of a stand calculated as the percentage of rocks that are not stopped within the forest further examples were provided with the growth simulator prognaus brauner et al 2005 and the hybrid patch model picus rammer et al 2010 woltjer et al 2008 second a more common approach is to derive indices of es provision from metrics describing forest structure and composition the main output of dvms via so called linker functions blattert et al 2017 the linker function s output can be classified in two groups a categorical assessment in two or three categories using threshold values for stand characteristics such as stem density gap size basal area or projected canopy area e g brang and hallenbarter 2007 cordonnier et al 2008 wehrli et al 2007 and b numerical indices quantifying the degree of protection a forest provides e g briner et al 2013 cordonnier et al 2014 elkin et al 2013 the widely used numerical indices for snow avalanches and rockfall by cordonnier et al 2014 are examples for complex linker functions the index for avalanche protection incorporated basal area average diameter at breast height dbh and slope whereas the one for rockfall protection used stem density average dbh the percentage of evergreen and deciduous species slope rock diameter and density and initial rock fall height many of the linker functions for quantifying the es protection from natural hazards that are used with dvms in europe are based directly or indirectly on nais frehner et al 2005 the system for assessing protection forest quality in swiss forestry practice it specifies the minimal and ideal attributes of a forest stand for each combination of site type i e phytosociological association and natural hazard by describing forest states that are expected to provide sufficient and sustainable protection these attributes called minimal and ideal profiles consist of threshold values for a series of forest attributes including species mixture vertical and horizontal stand structure stand stability and various aspects of tree regeneration most linker functions used in dvms focus on natural hazard specific prerequisites regarding stem density canopy cover and gap size for the spatially explicit models however aspects related to resistance such as species composition or stand stability and to resilience such as abundance and composition of regeneration have hardly ever been included exceptions are the indices used with landclim briner et al 2013 elkin et al 2013 that include the number of species or distinguish between coniferous and broadleaved species and the assessment of regeneration density as a measure of resilience cordonnier et al 2008 irauschek et al 2017a in simulation studies so far the protective function has never been estimated based on the full breadth of nais indicators frehner et al 2005 which are used in multiple alpine countries one of the main reasons is that very few of the models actually provide the outputs to do so particularly regarding tree regeneration dynamics for these reasons we developed and evaluated proform protection forest management a new forest simulation model specifically aimed at studying the impacts of management on forest dynamics and the detailed assessment of the protective function the focus on regeneration and spatial stand structure in model development allows for the assessment of the protective quality with a broad set of indices adapted from nais proform is a process based model operating at the stand scale that was developed mostly with empirical data it is parameterized for four of the most important stand dominating tree species in switzerland i e norway spruce picea abies l h karst silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l and sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus l brändli et al 2020 and four distinct elevational zones in the swiss alps the current version of the model does not represent large disturbances and assumes a constant climate in this paper we present the model structure its parameterization and validation as well as examples for the assessment of the protective quality of simulated stands 2 materials and methods 2 1 system nais the indices used in proform to assess the protection forest quality are based on nais the swiss guidelines for protection forest management frehner et al 2005 in the neighboring countries france gauquelin and courbaud 2006 italy berretti et al 2006 vacik et al 2010a 2010b austria and germany amt der tiroler landesregierung 2019 basch and interreg 2021 similar frameworks that are based on nais are used in nais minimal and ideal profiles are formulated for each combination of site type and prevailing natural hazard the minimal profile describes the stand s state that is required to provide an effective and sustainable protective function while the ideal profile describes the long term ideal state i e a forest state well above the minimum requirements the profiles comprise threshold values and ranges in seven categories 1 species mixture in terms of their share of canopy cover 2 vertical structure i e the stand s diameter distribution stem number and basal area 3 horizontal arrangement i e the spatial clustering of trees texture maximum gap size and total canopy cover 4 stability of support trees i e those trees that contribute most to the stand s stability in terms of crown length and shape stem slenderness and rooting stability 5 seedbed quality in terms of the abundance of competing ground vegetation and suitable microsites for germination 6 seedlings trees 10 to 40 cm in height and 7 saplings and thicket trees 40 cm in height to 12 cm dbh both latter categories in terms of species composition and abundance thus the nais system allows for the assessment of a stand s current protective quality its resistance against severe disturbances and its resilience after a disturbance based on an assessment of the stand structure species composition vertical and horizontal arrangement regeneration structural stability etc the minimal and ideal profile for each category is compared to the current forest state as well as the state expected for 50 years in the future assuming that no interventions were to take place to this end a semi quantitative index value is awarded for each category ranging from very bad across minimal to ideal if the minimal profile is not met presently or in the coming 50 years in at least one category management interventions are defined to ameliorate the protective function provided that they are cost efficient for more details cf brang et al 2006 2 2 description of proform here we present an abbreviated and simplified description of the proform model version 1 0 the complete description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 is available in the supplementary material s1 there all model equations algorithms parameters including their values as well as the parameterization and calibration procedures are described proform is implemented in r r core team 2021 and the source code is freely available schmid et al 2023 2 2 1 overview the purpose of proform is to predict the dynamics of managed forest stands and to assess the resulting protective function against gravitational natural hazards proform is a dynamic spatially explicit process based model the main premise in its development was to keep the processes and functions simple and interpretable and to develop and parameterize them with empirical data as much as possible proform is parameterized for the four most important tree species in swiss protection forests norway spruce picea abies subsequently abbreviated as pabi silver fir abies alba abbr aalb european beech fagus sylvatica abbr fsyl and sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus abbr apse brändli et al 2020 the model is parameterized for four elevational zones henceforth called strata i e submontane sm upper montane um high montane hm and subalpine sa according to nais frehner et al 2005 for the time being we have assumed the climate to be constant and do not simulate disturbances other than management simulated stand development emerges from the growth of trees on spatially explicit cells in turn stand development is determined by the basic demographic processes spatial interactions and management the model is based on two main entities grid cells and cohorts the grid cells form the spatial basis and each cell is characterized by its size its location within the grid its capacity for regeneration cell quality and its local topography table 1 these qualities are static state variables sensu grimm et al 2006 each cell contains either one or two cohorts depending on the simulation settings for details see further below cohorts are the basic unit to describe trees in the model and consist of aggregations of identical trees they are characterized by the true state variables i e changing over time species spc stem number n diameter at breast height d height h and height to crown base hcb the number of cohorts per cell is constant and they can therefore also be empty bare ground and hence have the species none assigned table 1 the positions of individual trees within a cohort are unknown the environment is represented by the current time step of the simulation one time step equals one year and for each time step two distinct states of the state variables are calculated state 1 in spring before the growth period and state 2 in fall after the growth period but before management total simulation time can be chosen by the user typically it is ca 100 years proform is a three dimensional model containing x and y coordinates of each cell and the height of each cohort as the z coordinate grid cells cover the entire simulation area and are hexagonal in shape fig 1 in order to facilitate the calculation of neighbor interactions as in this setting all neighbors are equidistant depending on the simulation settings their size ranges between 40 and 100 m2 chosen so that the canopy of a dominant tree can fill the entire cell the size and dimensions of the simulation grid can be chosen freely with a typical size of around 1 ha spatial interactions occur between cohorts on neighboring cells and depending on the process the state variables of the cohorts on one or two rings of equidistant neighbors of the target cell are considered fig 1 the model uses a toroidal representation of space to avoid edge effects at initialization proform assembles the stand based on a table containing the state variables for each cohort on each cell and the grid specifications cell size and grid dimensions provided in the simulation settings and establishes the neighbor relationships using a stochastic process values of local topography and cell quality are assigned to each cell according to parameterized ranges management instructions can be passed as input data to the model in the simulation settings a series of parameters have to be defined the stratum i e the elevational zone determining the potential species composition of the stand and the sets of parameter values to be applied in the functions describing the demographic processes the total simulation time in years site aspect and slope in degrees used for calculating certain competition indices and the characterization of gaps and the species composition of the surrounding forest which is used to determine the probabilities of species assignment at germination and thus potential species change after the death of the last tree of a cohort furthermore the stand s site and regeneration quality have to be defined on an ordinal scale of 1 low to 5 high these parameters are aggregated proxies for a series of abiotic and biotic factors such as nutrient availability soil water content or browsing pressure that influence tree growth site quality and regeneration growth and abundance regeneration quality and are used for calculating stratum specific reduction factors called pre factors for growth and regeneration respectively linear interpolation between a minimal value and 1 cf eq s1 2 in supplementary material s1 there are two main processes in proform that are executed consecutively fig 2 first stand development is calculated based on natural forest dynamics and the scheduled management interventions second the protective function of the stand over time is assessed forest dynamics and management are calculated in a loop of eight steps over each time step after the variable values from the initialization data have been assigned to state 2 fall of the first time step 1 calculation of auxiliary variables for state 2 2 calculation of the change in stem numbers through management if scheduled for the current time step 3 saving of a copy of the current state 4 increasing the time step by one 5 updating the state variables of state 1 spring 6 calculation of the auxiliary variables for state 1 7 calculation of changes in state variables through natural forest dynamics growth mortality and regeneration and 8 updating the state variables of state 2 the calculation of changes in state variables and the updating processes are applied to all cohorts simultaneously in the second process using the complete simulation results the protective quality is assessed retrospectively for each time step in turn in three steps 1 gaps i e areas without trees 12 cm in dbh are identified and characterized in terms of area length along the slope and width perpendicular to the slope 2 relevant stand characteristics are derived and 3 these characteristics are compared to the minimal and ideal profiles of the respective stratum and natural hazard and the indices of protection quality are calculated 2 2 2 forest dynamics and management growth is calculated differently for cohorts below and above a threshold d of 12 cm for cohorts between the minimal h of 10 cm and d 12 cm referred to as regeneration height growth dh is modeled eq 1 potential height growth dhpot is a linear function of height h the competition index cih local topography site slope and aspect as well as stratum specific constants of the degree day sum and the standard evapotranspiration index spei including an intercept abbreviated in matrix notation xβ in eq 1 written out in eqs s1 28 s1 32 the auxiliary variable cih is a proxy of competition for multiple resources such as light nutrients and rooting space it is calculated as the weighted sum of the auxiliary variable basal area ba of the neighboring cells schmid et al 2021 and eq s1 12 potential height growth is reduced by site conditions pre factor pfdh based on the regeneration quality of the stand eq 1 1 d h p f d h d h p o t p f d h exp x β diameter growth dd of this regeneration is derived from height using a linear allometric function eq s1 35 for cohorts with d 12 cm referred to as adult trees diameter growth is modeled eq 2 we assume that trees have a potential growth rate ddpot that is constant between a d of 12 cm and a species specific threshold d fig 3a based on data of the swiss national forest inventory cf fig s1 9 in supplementary material s1 above which it declines linearly to zero at a species specific maximum dmax eq s1 37 this potential growth rate is reduced by a reduction factor rfdd calculated as a function of the local competition index cid and an exponent expdd fig 3 b and eq s1 38 and by site conditions pre factor pfdd based on the site quality of the simulated stand eq 2 the auxiliary variable cid eq s1 18 is closely related to cih height growth of adult trees is derived from diameter using a logistic allometric function of d eq s1 33 all growth functions are species specific and the functions for adult trees are also stratum specific 2 d d p f d d r f d d c i d d d p o t d mortality is modeled explicitly in cohorts with h 130 cm only as stem numbers are not tracked below this threshold single tree mortality i e the reduction of n per cohort dnmort is determined in a stochastic process using a species specific mortality probability the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm is determined using empirically derived logistic probability functions that have previously been used in the model forclim hülsmann et al 2018 they depend on relative basal area increment relbai calculated from d and dd and in the case of spruce the competition index cim eqs s1 46 s1 49 the auxiliary variable cim is a proxy for stand age and is calculated as the mean diameter of all cohorts with d 7 cm in the entire stand to avoid extrapolation beyond the data range underlying these functions the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm is assumed to be constant regeneration i e the appearance of new trees is represented by two processes either through a germination from bare ground or b the presence of advance regeneration directly after the last tree of a cohort has died or has been harvested both processes contain a stochastic element and are modified by site conditions pre factor pfgi based on the regeneration quality of the simulated stand the potential annual germination probability of seedlings in an empty cohort is calculated based on a bernoulli trial defined by a cumulative success probability of 95 over a stratum specific time tgerm this potential germination probability is multiplied by pfgi and further reduced if there is another non empty cohort on the same cell eqs s1 60 s1 63 to determine the actual germination probability the process of advance regeneration is only modeled in strata with one cohort per cell where regeneration below the canopy is not kept track of explicitly hm and sa see further below if advance regeneration occurs the cohort is immediately populated with saplings instead of being changed to bare ground assuming that the germination has happened previously the probability for advance regeneration being present depends on the cohort s d before death or harvest and on pfgi eq s1 66 cohorts with h 130 cm seedlings and saplings have no stem numbers assigned as the development of the stem number of the early phase of regeneration is poorly understood due to its high stochasticity and because in a management context usually merely the presence of and area covered by seedlings and saplings are of relevance but not their exact stem number therefore only when a cohort grows beyond that threshold dningr and thereby future n is determined in the process referred to as ingrowth dningr is calculated from a species specific maximal stem number that is modified by cell quality a proxy for the suitability of a microsite for regeneration and by pfgi the pre factor based on the regeneration quality of the simulated stand and further reduced if there is already a cohort with h 130 cm on the same cell eqs s1 41 s1 43 the change in height to crown base dhcb is modeled with a function developed from theoretical considerations the main driver of dhcb is the competition index cic an auxiliary variable that is a proxy for the shading that a cohort experiences from its neighbor cells it is calculated as a variant of the bal basal area of larger trees in the neighboring cohorts including all cohorts with d larger than a certain fraction of the target cohort s d antos et al 2010 as not only larger neighbors influence crown growth or recession but considerably smaller neighbors do not eq s1 22 in a first step the potential change in hcb dhcbpot is calculated below a first threshold value of cic i e in situations with only few or small neighboring cohorts the crown base is lowered through secondary crown development stagnation in case of spruce above this value dhcbpot is positive and the crown base is elevated above a second threshold value of cic dhcbpot increases at its maximal rate fig 3c and eq s1 57 this maximum value of dhcbpot is determined by 1 an absolute maximum and 2 a maximum fraction of tree height eq s1 53 the minimum value at a cic of zero is calculated as a negative share of the maximal value eq s1 55 to obtain the definitive dhcb dhcbpot is if necessary capped to ensure that 1 a minimal crown ratio fraction of tree height occupied by the crown is retained and 2 hcb does not drop below zero eqs s1 54 s1 56 and s1 58 currently there are two management types in proform both are based on the concept of relative diameter classes rdc mina et al 2017 the instructions for each management intervention state the time step of the intervention and the share of basal area to be removed by species from a fixed number of relative diameter classes of equal width spanning the respective current range of diameters this formulation allows for a reliable translation of empirical single tree harvest records as usually found in inventories into model instructions mina et al 2017 the management type rdc tree randomly removes single trees from cohorts according to the instructions and thereby mimics a single tree selection type of continuous cover forestry ccf brang et al 2014 pommerening and murphy 2004 the management type rdc cohort which is not used in this study randomly removes entire cohorts and corresponds to a fine grained version of group selection in ccf both algorithms determine dnmgm the number of trees to be harvested within each cohort the functions updating the state variables of state 1 and 2 depend on their previous values and the changes since then either through management or forest dynamics hence there are no time lag effects a cohort s species can change at germination and after the complete harvesting or natural death of the entire cohort with or without advance regeneration the new species is randomly selected according to probabilities for each species that are determined by the currently simulated species share and the species shares of the surrounding forests defined in the simulation settings ecological differences between species e g shade tolerance are not included in this simplified approach cf s1 for the rationale the updated stem number results from the previous stem number dningr dnmort and dnmgm in case only growth occurred the updated diameter height and height to crown base are calculated from the respective previous value and the corresponding change dd dh and dhcb respectively if all trees in a cohort died naturally or were harvested and no advance regeneration is present these state variables are set to zero if advance regeneration is present d is set to zero h to the corresponding parameterized minimum height and hcb is randomly selected from within the possible values restricted by the minimal crown ratios according to the updated species if germination occurs d and hcb remain at zero and h is set to the minimal cohort height of 10 cm 2 2 3 assessment of protection quality to assess the protective quality of the simulated stand the minimal and ideal profiles frehner et al 2005 according to the simulation s stratum and the selected natural hazard snow avalanche landslide erosion debris flow rockfall or torrents floods are defined in terms of the modeled variables the profiles used in proform reflect the combination of site types in the stratification see section 2 3 and the natural hazards threshold values and ranges of the different stand characteristics for all but one category seedbed quality are derived the assessment for each time step is based on the state variables of state 1 and starts by the analysis of gap size in nais gaps are defined as areas without trees that have a diameter larger or equal to 12 cm in proform assuming that a cohort s canopy covers the entire cell gaps are defined as continuous areas of adjacent cells with no cohorts with d 12 cm irrespective of their size or shape for each gap the area in m2 the maximal length along the slope and the maximal width perpendicular to the slope both in m are determined using the cell borders as limits and taking the stand s slope into account in nais gap borders in rockfall protection forests are delimited by stem positions rather than canopy borders therefore an extended gap length is calculated assuming a mean position of the outermost tree within a cell as the exact tree positions are unknown a numerical index for each nais category is calculated by comparing the respective stand characteristics to the profiles the indices per category are calculated as the mean of multiple subindices each relating to one stand characteristic within that category an index value of 1 indicates that the minimal profile is not met in any subindex 0 that the minimal but not the ideal profile is met and 1 that the ideal profile is achieved to avoid compensation of below minimal subindex values a maximum combined index value of 0 1 is enforced if a single subindex is valued below zero the index for species mixture checks the species composition in terms of basal area of trees with d 12 cm the index for vertical structure checks the canopy cover shares of four diameter classes 12 cm 12 30 cm 30 50 cm and 50 cm and in rockfall protection forests also the stem numbers in four diameter classes 8 12 cm 12 24 cm 24 36 cm and 36 cm as well as the total basal area of trees with d 8 cm three rockfall scenarios are implemented one with small rocks 0 02 m3 and two with larger rocks of 1 m3 vol the latter differentiating hillslope lengths of 250 and 500 m with the prerequisites determined using rockfornet berger and dorren 2007 the index for the horizontal arrangement texture checks gap area maximal length and width as well as total canopy cover with the minimal thresholds depending on the natural hazard the stability of support trees is assessed with an index based on mean crown ratios support trees are defined as the trees with the largest diameter within the four diameter classes used for the species mixture index a total of 100 trees per hectare are selected for the assessment with the number of trees per diameter class corresponding to the total share of cohorts within these classes the index for seedlings 10 h 40 cm checks seedling abundance and their species composition in gaps the index for saplings and thicket h 40 cm to d 12 cm checks the total area covered by this regeneration class and its composition 2 3 model parameterization most of the parameter values used in proform were determined at the submodel level based on the analysis of empirical data or on expert knowledge parameterization described here additionally some parameter values were calibrated by comparing simulated emergent patterns to independent stand measurements see section model calibration the four strata that proform is currently parameterized for encompass the most abundant site types of the corresponding elevational zone in swiss protection forests arge 2020 frehner et al 2021 2005 currently 56 of the protection forest area lie in the upper montane um mixed species forests naturally dominated by beech and silver fir occurring between 800 and 1400 m a s l high montane hm naturally homogenous spruce silver fir forests 1200 1700 m a s l and subalpine zones sa spruce dominated forests with cluster texture 1500 2000 m a s l under climate change elevational zones are expected to shift upwards and an increasing share of the protection forest area will come to lie in the submontane zone sm multi layered beech dominated mixed species forests currently located between 350 and 700 m a s l projections based on two variants of the a1b climate scenario 4 2 c and 2 9 c increase in annual mean temperature and 13 7 and 4 6 annual precipitation respectively place roughly 40 of today s protection forest area in this elevational zone losey and wehrli 2013 frehner and huber 2019 the detailed method for and results of the selection of the corresponding site types are described in schmid et al 2021 and in s1 respectively the strata and their corresponding site types were used on the one hand to guide the collection of field data of regeneration growth schmid et al 2021 and to determine the subset of inventory data for the parameterization of the model and on the other hand to set basic model characteristics depending on the stratum including potential species composition the number of cohorts per cell and cell size in sm silver fir beech and maple can occur in um all four species in hm spruce and silver fir and in sa only spruce in sm and um each cell contains two cohorts as regeneration below the canopy is an important trait of forests at lower elevations in hm and sa there is only one cohort per cell as regeneration at higher elevations occurs primarily in gaps although we acknowledge that in hm fir regeneration can be found under a spruce canopy two data sets were used to parameterize multiple model functions first the swiss national forest inventory brändli et al 2020 wsl 2020 from which a subset of all four inventories corresponding to the site types of each stratum was used arge 2020 frehner et al 2021 this data set is simply referred to as nfi data the second dataset henceforth called regeneration growth data comprises height growth data of regeneration in forest gaps brüllhardt et al 2020 schmid et al 2021 the data of schmid et al 2021 contains measurements of spruce in hm and sa and was extended for this study to silver fir beech and maple as well as the strata sm and um brüllhardt et al 2020 gathered data on beech and maple regeneration growth in low elevation forests of which only the explicitly measured height growth data was used both studies followed very similar field protocols in terms of site selection and data collection and could therefore be readily combined the regeneration growth data table 2 consists of 5 004 measurements of tree height and tree height growth of 928 dominant and co dominant trees within regeneration clusters located in small gaps and under the canopy collected across large parts of switzerland fig 4 competition from the surrounding stand was assessed by indices derived from an inventory of all trees in a 9 to 15 m radius around each plot center including tree positions schmid et al 2021 field sites are characterized by slope aspect local topography and data on the degree day sum and drought index spei remund et al 2016 three basic stratum specific cell parameters are assigned during the initialization cell size local topography and cell quality cell size was parameterized using crown projection areas pretzsch 2014 of the four target species so that a large tree would fill an entire cell with its canopy the probabilities for each class of local topography to be assigned at initialization were derived from the observations within the regeneration growth data the possible range of cell quality was estimated based on expert knowledge the growth functions were parameterized using both the regeneration growth data and the nfi data the detailed methodology for deriving the potential height growth functions from the regeneration growth data are described in schmid et al 2021 the diameter height allometries for the regeneration were parameterized using the same data set using the final height and dbh measurements of all target trees for the diameter growth of adult trees maximal growth rates ddmax the threshold diameter above which growth declines d and the maximal diameter dmax fig 3a were derived directly from nfi data the exponent determining the shape of the helper function expdd fig 3b that is used to calculate the reduction factor based on local competition was estimated based on expert knowledge the maximum value of the competition index above which no growth occurs cid max fig 3b was determined from the largest measured values in the regeneration growth data the allometries for calculating the height of adult trees from their diameter were parameterized using nfi data to determine the asymptote and shape of the functions and the output of the diameter allometries for regeneration to ensure a smooth transition between the two growth functions at d 12 cm the parameters of the species specific functions for the mortality probability of trees with d 4 cm were adopted as is from hülsmann et al 2018 the species and stratum specific annual mortality probabilities for smaller trees were determined based on the mean passing times for the regeneration to grow from 130 cm height to 4 cm in diameter resulting from the height growth function and the expected reduction in stem numbers in an average cohort during that time the stem number reduction was estimated from 1 average stem numbers at 130 cm height resulting from modeled ingrowth and 2 plausible stem numbers at 4 cm diameter based on measured crown projection areas pretzsch 2014 and density assumptions the stratum specific annual germination probability of bare ground cohorts and the probability for the occurrence of advance regeneration in the strata hm and sa were parameterized using nfi data the expected time until germination has occurred with a 95 probability in a bare ground cohort tgerm was estimated based on an analysis of the temporal development of regeneration cover in the different strata the probabilities for the occurrence of advance regeneration were determined using the share of nfi plots stratified by their developmental stage that exceeded a certain regeneration cover the initial height of newly germinated trees was set to 10 cm the height of advance regeneration to 40 cm the species specific maximum number of ingrowing trees per cell was determined based on expert knowledge estimates on crown projection areas of trees at 130 cm height and mean regeneration densities to calculate the change in hcb the maximal absolute and relative rates of crown height change the species specific minimal crown ratios as well as the relative diameter threshold for trees in the corresponding competition index were estimated based on expert knowledge 2 4 model calibration a total of five parameter values in proform were calibrated using long term empirical time series of inventory data three of these parameters relate to the pre factors pfdh pfdd and pfgi which are used to reduce regeneration height growth diameter growth of adult trees and germination and ingrowth respectively the calibrated stratum specific parameters describe the values of these the pre factors when site quality in case of pfdd or regeneration quality in case of pfdh and pfgi are set to their

between secondary crown development crown base recession and maximal crown base recession cic thr1 and cic thr2 in fig 3c as calibration data inventories of experimental forest management efm plots forrester et al 2021b 2019 were used the main criteria for plot selection were that they were managed the elevational zone had to match the ones included in the model and the stands could not contain more than a few individual trees of species not included in proform furthermore the time series length should be 50 years and the plot size 0 5 ha if possible 16 plots fit these criteria of which seven were selected for calibration and the remaining nine for later validation table 3 and fig 4 two calibration plots belonged to stratum sm three to um and one each to hm and sa ranging in elevation from 550 to 1640 m a s l and in slope from 5 to 28 four plots were monospecific and three were mixed species stands only very few sycamore maples were present in one um plot and the hm plot was a pure spruce stand plot sizes ranged from 0 2 to 2 ha time series lengths from 47 to 103 years with 9 to 17 inventories at the time of the first inventory three stands were uniform thickets one a uniform stand in timber stage and three uneven aged forests detailed information on the selected plots can be found in table s2 1 in supplementary material s2 the single tree inventories contain measured and derived information on tree species dbh height crown projection area status alive to be harvested dead or missing inventories were carried out in autumn and usually followed by an intervention in the subsequent winter the first inventories were used to create initialization data for proform the data of small plots was replicated to create virtual plots of ca 1 ha same species trees with similar dbh were aggregated into cohorts with the reported crown projection areas in conjunction with the model s cell size dictating the maximum number of trees per cohort based on stand descriptions and ingrowth patterns in subsequent inventories additional cohorts containing regeneration below the caliper threshold had to be added all cohorts were distributed randomly in space as no spatial information was available for the first inventories management instructions times of interventions and species specific removal intensities for the management type rdc tree i e single tree removal were derived from the inventory data using five relative diameter classes both initialization data and management instructions only depict the four parameterized species based on the stand descriptions the raw inventory data and preliminary simulations using the uncalibrated model each plot was assigned a site and regeneration quality as well as species shares of the surrounding forest which then remained unchanged throughout the calibration process calibration simulations with the length of the respective measured time series were run and the outputs of those time steps corresponding to years with inventories before and after the management interventions were compared to the measured data additionally simulations initialized with bare ground conditions and without management were run for 1 000 years equilibrium simulations to assess the long term effects of the parameter settings model calibration was done for each stratum in a two step iterative process first the parameters relating to the pre factors were jointly calibrated starting with multiple sets of parameter values covering a plausible range simulations were run and the following metrics of the entire stand and per species were compared visually basal area stem number and diameter distributions parameter values were then iteratively adjusted by hand for further simulations until the simulation outputs matched the entire empirical time series to a satisfactory extent aiming for an overall deviation of less than 30 to ensure realistic parameter values pre factor values were not set below 0 3 i e a 70 reduction of growth and germination on the worst site conditions compared to the best second the cic thresholds for crown base change were calibrated analogously comparing simulated and measured mean crown lengths the initial set of tested parameter values was informed by the distribution of cic in previous simulation runs equilibrium simulations were used to guide parameter value estimates when the empirical records were uninformative 2 5 model validation model validation was carried out using the other nine out of the 16 efm plots table 3 and fig 4 one plot belonged to stratum sm four to um three to hm and one to sa and they were situated between 670 and 1680 m a s l at slopes between 9 and 36 all but one of the sm and um plots were mixed species stands again without a marked share of sycamore maple hm and sa plots were pure spruce stands while the validation plots in hm only contained three inventories recorded over 20 23 years and were therefore of limited use the remaining plots spanned 71 101 years with 10 16 inventories plot sizes ranged from 0 2 to 2 ha at the time of the first inventories two plots were uniform thickets four uniform stands in timber stage one a two layered stand and two uneven aged forests detailed information on the calibration plots can be found in table s2 1 the creation of model initialization data management prescriptions and simulation settings followed the same procedure as for the calibration plots using a caliper threshold of 8 cm the simulated time series of total basal area ba and stem number sn as well as of the crown ratio of the 100 thickest trees per ha cr were validated using three metrics bias precision and accuracy pretzsch et al 2002 bias is expressed as the percentage bias pbias eq 4 and precision as the standard deviation of the errors sd eq 5 with both metrics being based on relative errors eq 3 accuracy is quantified by the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 6 and 7 these metrics were calculated for each time step before and after the intervention for which an inventory was available for comparison and they were averaged over the entire simulation period furthermore simulated and measured diameter distributions dd were compared using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test in eqs 3 7 ypredi and yobsi are the predicted and observed stand metric of time

the respective strata and the equilibrium simulations as a further guide however some parameter values had to be estimated using calibrated values from other strata or species in hm and sa only one plot was available for calibration morissen and hospental respectively therefore the minimal values of pfgi and pfdh for hm and the minimal value of pfdd for sa had to be derived from other strata because in morissen no ingrowth occurred and there were relatively few trees below 12 cm dbh in hospental site quality is ideal i e 5 and therefore the minimal value of pfdd has no effect furthermore as very few records of sycamore maple were available in sm and um and none for silver fir in hm the respective cic thresholds for modeling crown length change were assumed to be identical to those of beech and spruce respectively the calibrated model yielded satisfactory results most simulated total ba sn and cr matched the empirical data closely fig 5 full results in s3 when applying the validation metrics to the calibration simulations model performance was high mean pbias over all calibration plots for ba sn and cr ranged between 2 2 and 8 5 the mean standard deviation of the error between 7 3 and 10 8 and the mean nrmse between 11 6 and 35 6 table s3 1 at the time of the last inventory the results of ba sn and cr of all species combined never deviated more than 30 from the empirical data except for two cases but only temporarily over several consecutive inventories in biel west sm the mean cr of the 100 thickest trees per ha was overestimated strongly during about half of the simulation period fig s3 1 and in hospental sa ba and sn were underestimated strongly during the first 30 simulated years fig 5j k due to an overestimation of mortality even though the simulated and measured dd of all species combined at the time of the last inventory were significantly different on a 5 level according to the kolmogorov smirnov test in all plots except sigriswil lower um and hospental sa table s3 1 they were quite similar in shape in most cases figs 5 and s3 obvious differences could be observed in biel west where the initially unimodal stand structure developed into a bimodal two layered structure which was not reproduced correctly by the model fig 5c furthermore the initially quite narrow range of tree diameters in morissen hm did not broaden sufficiently over time in the simulation fig 5i the species specific results in mixed stands deviated more from the measured data than the total stand data in biel west the sn per species matched the records rather well fig 5b but the final stand was simulated to consist of a dominant silver fir layer and a large group of intermediately sized beech instead of an upper layer and suppressed regeneration with both species mixed fig s3 1 in the two mixed species um stands buttes bdp and rougemont la the species specific ba was reproduced accurately but the sn of silver fir was underestimated while that of spruce was overestimated fig s3 3 and fig 5d e the accuracy of the simulated growth of initialized regeneration and the appearance of new regeneration throughout the simulations was assessed qualitatively in half of the simulations the growth of the initialized regeneration conformed to measurements in the other half it tended to be overestimated the amount and species composition of newly appearing regeneration matched the empirical data well furthermore in some simulations regeneration waves were simulated to appear too late 3 2 model validation the model validation yielded very good results for most plots fig 6 full results in s4 due to the short time series and incomplete records of the three hm validation plots the results of this stratum are of limited value and are reported only in s4 furthermore as very few records of sycamore maple were available the performance of this species cannot be evaluated thoroughly model performance was high with overall absolute mean pbias values of 3 2 10 4 and 7 6 for ba sn and cr respectively a maximum mean sd value of 15 9 and mean nrmse values of 18 4 31 2 and 48 8 for ba sn and cr respectively table s4 1 the simulated dd at the time of the last inventory differed significantly from the measured data on a 5 level according to the kolmogorov smirnov test table s4 1 but were similar in shape in most cases figs 6 and s4 the simulation results for biel east sm matched measured total ba and total as well as species specific sn well over time but the ba of silver fir was over and that of beech underestimated in the second half of the simulation fig 6a b this can be attributed to the initially dominant silver fir which remained very dominant throughout the simulation leading to the excessive suppression of beech mean cr were overestimated for both species during the entire simulated period fig s4 1 the dd at the last inventory revealed that the resulting stand did not correspond well to the expected two layered stand as the number of small trees was considerably underestimated fig 6c the appearance of a new group of regeneration was simulated to arrive 15 years too early and its growth was not sufficiently suppressed not shown in three of the four um validation plots buttes lcr rougemont g and sigriswil upper simulated total ba agreed well with the empirical data figs 6d s4 2 s4 4 and s4 5 but it was systematically overestimated by roughly 20 in le chenit fig s4 3 in the two mixed species plots buttes lcr and rougemont g the ba of spruce was overestimated while it was underestimated for silver fir the temporal trend in sn was reproduced well in buttes lcr but the observed increase in sn was simulated with a delay of ca 25 years fig 6e in rougemont g simulated total sn deviated negatively from the measured data over the course of the simulation but matched them again well at the end fig s4 4 however the species shares of spruce and silver fir were inverted at this point as the newly appearing regeneration consisted mostly of spruce instead of silver fir in the spruce dominated plots le chenit and sigriswil upper measured total sn were reproduced well figs s4 3 and s4 5 in all um plots simulated overall and species specific cr and the dd of the larger trees matched the empirical data well over time growth rates of the initialized regeneration were slightly too high in two simulations le chenit and rougemont g and the amount of new regeneration was overestimated in two simulations buttes lcr and sigriswil upper and underestimated in one rougemont g while the timing of its appearance was accurate except for the delay in buttes lcr mentioned above not shown in the sa validation plot realp mortality was overestimated in the first 30 years of the simulation and hence ba and sn were underestimated in this period fig 6g h simulated ba matched the records well towards the end of the simulation but sn continued to be underestimated cr of spruce agreed with the empirical data over the entire period fig s4 9 the analysis of the dd revealed that the growth rate of regeneration was overestimated not shown causing an increasing shift towards higher diameters while the shape of the curve was tracked well fig 6i 3 3 assessment of protection quality as an example for the assessment of the protection quality we calculated the corresponding set of indices for the 90 year simulations of the um plots rougemont g used for the validation and rougemont la used for the calibration we used the natural hazard profiles for torrents and floods the detailed profile values are listed in table s5 1 both stands are composed almost exclusively of norway spruce and silver fir the main difference is that rougemont g was transformed from a two layered stand into a single tree selection forest with a typical inverse j shaped diameter distribution while rougemont la featured such a diameter distribution over the entire measurement period overall both stands featured similar protective effects over time fig 7 the indices for mixture seedlings and saplings and thicket were very similar or even identical over time in both stands and always below the minimal profile the analysis of the underlying subindices revealed that among the trees with dbh 12 mixture index the share of spruce was too high and that of beech and sycamore maple too low the low index values for seedlings resulted from both the species composition almost no beech and maple and the relatively stringent requirement in the minimal profile that 80 of all cells without saplings or larger h 40 cm need to contain seedlings the index value for saplings and thicket was always slightly below the minimal profile again primarily due to species composition with too much spruce and too little beech even though the regeneration cover fulfilled the ideal profile vertical structure in rougemont g was rated better on average than in rougemont la fulfilling the minimal profile during roughly half of the simulated period both stands however failed to reach the ideal profile at any point because the lowest diameter class was consistently under and hence the upper classes underrepresented the index for horizontal arrangement is determined by the requirements regarding the natural hazard i e in this case gap length gap size and canopy cover it started out at the ideal value of 1 and dropped slightly below 0 over time driven by exceedingly long and large gaps due to the spatially random harvesting that was applied finally the index for support trees which is assessing the mean crown length of the most stable trees increased in both simulations over time from the minimum to the maximum this was due to increasing mean crown lengths of silver fir with the change happening earlier in rougemont la 4 discussion 4 1 model structure and development the purpose of proform is to investigate the effects of management on the protective function of mountain forest stands the model is process based including submodels for regeneration growth and mortality which were developed largely independently of each other using different sets of empirical data the main data sources were a combination of regeneration growth data across large parts of switzerland brüllhardt et al 2020 schmid et al 2021 the swiss nfi brändli et al 2020 wsl 2020 and forest reserve data from switzerland and germany for the mortality functions hülsmann et al 2018 only the submodel for the dynamics of the crown base height was developed based on theoretical considerations but then linked to empirical data in the model calibration being partly process based and partly based on empirical data proform is a hybrid between pure process based stand models such as 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 and pure empirical models such as bwinpro hansen and nagel 2014 or swissstandsim zell 2018 zell et al 2020 proform is more closely related to other stand scale models developed for temperate and mountain forests in which at least some submodels were developed and parameterized based on empirical data e g forclim bugmann 1996 picus lexer and hönninger 2001 seidl et al 2005 or samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 the main design principles underlying proform are 1 the use of cohorts of identical trees as the main agent similar to gap models such as forclim and 4c bugmann et al 1997 and 2 spatial explicitness by assigning each cohort to a cell with known location thus allowing for interactions among neighboring cells a concept found e g in picus and many empirical single tree stand models such as silva pretzsch et al 2002 another principle underlying proform is 3 that the basic growth equation quantifies growth under optimal conditions which is then reduced by environmental factors and local competition as experienced by the cohorts this concept is widespread and applied e g in many gap models bugmann 2001 a peculiarity of proform is the use of two growth equations to be able to simulate the growth of trees starting from very small sizes here a height of 10 cm similar to a version of forclim wehrli et al 2007 one equation is used for modeling height growth of regeneration and one for diameter growth of adult trees with the transition at 12 cm dbh in our case dictated by the calipering threshold of the swiss national forest inventory a different approach was used in sortie pacala et al 1996 by modeling stem diameter at 10 instead of 130 cm tree height apart from these two examples only few dynamic stand models include regeneration from such a small size as proform in the context of sustainable protection from natural hazard a focus on small trees i e regeneration is crucial however and proform fulfills this requirement well proform is a relatively simple model it has low structural complexity includes only four species and no explicit climate dependency of the demographic functions however it is parameterized for four discrete elevational zones to represent typical conditions in swiss mountain forests we applied a simple concept to aggregate multiple abiotic and biotic factors that influence tree growth and regeneration occurrence such as local climate soil quality or browsing pressure into two parameters for site characterization site and regeneration quality which in turn affect simulated growth and regeneration dynamics through pre factors applied to the respective functions implicitly these qualities and the resulting pre factors can be used to aggregate different factors depending on the simulated site this allows the model to be applied to stands along a large environmental gradient and thus under most conditions in the northern and central european alps however to apply the model to sites outside its original geographic range site specific parameterization of the environmental factors would be needed lastly even though the model cannot be directly used to simulate forest dynamics under a changing climate preliminary conclusions by analogy are possible due to the expected upward shift of elevational zones frehner and huber 2019 zischg et al 2021 4 2 model parameterization and calibration most of proform s parameters were not calibrated but determined using empirical data in one of three ways a by fitting statistical models e g for the core functions of the height growth of regeneration b by deriving single parameter values within more theoretical submodels e g the maximum diameter growth rate of trees 12 cm dbh or c by estimation informed by data analysis e g the time required for bare ground cells to contain regeneration in this process to which we refer as parameterization outputs of the entire model at the stand scale were not compared to empirical data a similar procedure was followed in the development of sortie pacala et al 1996 this approach conserves the process formulations and their respective parameter values as qualitative and quantitative hypotheses regarding the underlying ecological processes only in the subsequent model calibration simulated patterns emerging at the stand scale were compared to time series of independent data to determine the values of five parameters a common procedure for parameter selection would have been to conduct a sensitivity analysis e g huber et al 2018 lagarrigues et al 2015 lin et al 2022 instead we selected parameters that we deemed important to tie the model even more strongly to empirical data but for which we were unable to make an assessment in the sense of parameterization cf above the minimal values of the three pre factors used in regeneration germination and ingrowth and growth height and diameter growth were calibrated because these allow the model to simulate below optimal growth conditions which the submodels core functions are parameterized for also the two competition thresholds determining the onset of crown base lowering or elevation were calibrated to link the purely theory based submodel for crown dynamics to empirical data during calibration the parameter values were adjusted iteratively and simultaneously by hand similar to the calibration procedure by pabst et al 2008 with zelig and risch et al 2005 with forclim we deliberately decided against more sophisticated calibration procedures such as parameter optimization e g lin et al 2022 mina et al 2016 or bayesian approaches e g cailleret et al 2020 forrester et al 2021a lagarrigues et al 2015 van oijen et al 2013 that would arguably have led to a closer fit of model results to the data we had only rather few stand records per stratum available for calibration which in some cases also lacked information on certain processes relevant to calibration such as almost no records of sycamore maple or no new regeneration appearing in the stands of the hm zone therefore our simple calibration procedure offered several advantages it allowed us to avoid overfitting the model to these time series to take specific emergent patterns in equilibrium simulations into account and to use parameter values calibrated with higher certainty to estimate values of strata or species with less or no information in the calibration data finally it allowed us to select a set of parameter values that are ecologically consistent across all four strata something that is rather difficult to achieve with automated procedures cf bircher 2015 4 3 model performance the stand data from the swiss efm network forrester et al 2021b 2019 used to assess model performance during calibration and validation cover exceptionally long periods i e up to more than a century the plots selected to assess the performance of proform furthermore cover a large environmental gradient in terms of elevation and growth conditions they comprise a wide range of stand structures and species compositions and can therefore be regarded as a stringent test set the use of these records posed three main challenges that introduced uncertainties to the assessment process first there were unknown quantities of regeneration below the calipering threshold in most plots initializing the model with only the recorded trees would have created artificial lags as encountered e g by didion et al 2009 to avoid this problem assumptions had to be made on the quantity and composition of regeneration below the caliper threshold second the simulation settings for site and regeneration quality had to be estimated based on very limited local information on site conditions and the factors influencing regeneration growth e g browsing pressure third no spatial information was available on the initial stand structure and the management interventions the cohorts at initialization and the location of management interventions were therefore distributed randomly in space various model processes contain stochastic components most notably regeneration mortality and management that could compromise the meaningfulness of comparing single model runs to empirical data however preliminary tests have shown that the influence of these stochastic events on emergent patterns at the stand level is relatively small as they act on the cohort level and are averaged out over the entire stand still using the rdc harvest algorithm uncertainties were introduced as its dependency on the accuracy of the simulated diameter distribution at the time of intervention can augment existing discrepancies between simulated and measured diameter distributions over time in spite of these potential sources of error proform performed very satisfactorily in general the simulated emergent patterns of basal area stem numbers diameter distribution and species composition agreed well with observations over long periods despite it being a relatively simple model the validation revealed its ability to reproduce the dynamics of managed stands at least as well as much more complex simulation models such as samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 zelig pabst et al 2008 forclim bircher et al 2015 didion et al 2009 mina et al 2017 rasche et al 2011 wehrli et al 2005 picus irauschek et al 2017b pardos et al 2015 seidl et al 2005 silva mette et al 2009 pretzsch et al 2002 schmid et al 2006 or 4c lasch et al 2005 judging by the validation metrics reported in these studies furthermore most other forest stand models have been validated against considerably shorter time series e g 15 to 30 years for picus and silva 40 to 65 years for samsara2 zelig and 4c different versions of forclim have been validated against efm plots and some of them were also used in the present study for calibration it is noteworthy that the ability of proform to reproduce the dynamics of these plots is similar to the performance of recent forclim versions bircher et al 2015 mina et al 2017 it is quite remarkable that in spite of its simplicity and the problems underlying the definition of appropriate settings for model testing proform is performing so well 4 4 model limitations and further development despite the general success of the model the calibration and validation revealed some weaknesses and thus indications for further development the most pronounced discrepancies between observed and simulated data were evident in the diameter distributions in the sm plots biel east and biel west suggesting that the model has a problem capturing the differentiation of a uniform stand into a two layer structure this behavior resulted from 1 an incorrect representation of inter species competition and 2 an increasing divergence over time caused by the rdc management algorithm competition effects across species could certainly be refined by introducing species specific growth responses to competition and site quality another problem is that the diameter distribution in initially highly uniform young stands remained too narrow over time this became evident in the hm calibration plot morissen and to a lesser extent in the sa plots hospental and realp the underlying reason is the simplifying assumption that there are no individual differences in growth among trees of the same diameter as they are experiencing the same level of competition furthermore in the um plots buttes lcr and rougemont g the timing of new waves of regeneration was evidently delayed this could be caused by many factors playing important roles in the dynamics of regeneration establishment that are not represented in the model such as masting cycles or fluctuations in browsing pressure however the amount and in buttes lcr also the species composition of the regeneration wave matched the observations well and we therefore do not consider this a major problem still the species selection procedure at germination could be improved by including e g the local competition level and species specific shade tolerance finally growth and therefore basal area in the um plot le chenit which features extremely poor growth conditions was always overestimated this indicates that the calibrated minimal value of the growth reduction factor is not low enough as a result of attributing the same site quality instead of a slightly higher one to the more favorable site of sigriswil lower which was used for calibration even though the applied management algorithm with its spatially random selection of single trees produced good results for most plots further options should be added to the model to represent the spectrum of current management practices in mountain forests brang et al 2006 streit et al 2009 this could include locally clustered interventions round or slit shaped gaps the species specific promotion of regeneration through appropriate gap sizes or the enhancement of collective stand stability by promoting stable trees with long crowns in addition the model can be used to simulate the dynamics of unmanaged stands however the plausibility of such simulation results especially over long periods would first need to be assessed thoroughly as this was not the scope of our study 4 5 assessments of the protective quality of forest stands the assessments of the protective quality of the two um plots at rougemont revealed that these stands do not satisfy the requirements for protection forests against torrents and floods as the minimal profile was not met across all indices at any point in time this can be attributed mainly to the management schemes applied at these two plots which was not focused on maximizing the protective effect and its representation in the model the protective function in these two stands would greatly benefit from an active promotion of beech and sycamore maple as well as spatially clustered interventions instead of the random removal of single trees that resulted at some point in oddly shaped but large and or long gaps as small openings were becoming connected over time in the simulation still these two case studies illustrate the holistic approach of nais frehner et al 2005 and its implementation in proform the major model features enabling this are 1 the model s spatially explicit nature and 2 the explicit modeling of regeneration starting from very small height gap models such as forclim or 4c and distance independent growth simulators such as bwinpro or swissstandsim lack the spatial information required to assess gaps and usually model ingrowth with a size threshold well above a height of 1 3 m but cf wehrli et al 2007 for forclim while these shortcomings are not present in samsara2 this model is currently parameterized for norway spruce and silver fir only among the stand scale forest models applicable to european mountain forests picus in connection with the regeneration submodel described in woltjer et al 2008 is to our knowledge the only other model with which an assessment of the protective function of similar breadth could be achieved while picus is among the most complex forest stand models bugmann and seidl 2022 proform is located on the opposite side of the complexity spectrum hence it occupies its own niche for possible model applications as for example comparatively little input data and site characterizations are needed to run the model possible further developments of proform to improve the assessment of the protective function would be to include 1 lying deadwood as a favorable seedbed for spruce at high elevations and as obstacles to rock and snow movements 2 ground vegetation influencing local germination probabilities and 3 further tree species 5 conclusions with the development and testing of proform we have shown that it is possible to provide a relatively simple dynamic model that captures the dynamics of mountain forest stands accurately the model is mostly based on empirical data yet describes the demographic processes in an ecologically interpretable way which makes its projections more robust compared to pure empirical approaches furthermore the features of proform make it possible to represent most of the criteria used in many european countries to assess the protective function of mountain forest stands integrating both the protective function of the current stand structure as well as the stand s resistance and resilience to large disturbances thus proform can be used to assess the long term sustainability of the protective function of mountain forest stands lastly the high accuracy and level of detail in the assessment of the protective function embedded in proform render this tool valuable for investigating the complex effects of current and alternative management schemes on the provisioning of the ecosystem service protection against natural hazards of temperate mountain forests in practical forest management credit authorship
