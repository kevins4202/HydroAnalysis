district 1 introduction worldwide groundwater is the major source of irrigation and drinking water mukherjee et al 2018 2021 groundwater has broad significance as a resource and can be utilized when needed growth of population increases the food and water uses and leads to a worldwide increase in water demand choubin et al 2019 mosavi et al 2020 2021 presently people are facing the problem of water scarcity worldwide and it is created big challenge for the social economic and industrial development contamination of ground water by the fluoride and arsenic is the burning problem not only in india but also all over the world ijumulana et al 2020 2021 lima et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021a 2021b as a result of this contamination the availability of water for domestic uses decreases sharply in india over 65 of irrigated water and 85 of drinking water come from the groundwater storage as per the world bank report published in 2010 from last three decades in india 54 people are facing the problem of water scarcity at least 1 month as per un report world water assessment programme 2018 according to water stress index 11 large cities in india are facing an extreme water scarcity problem where chennai is the most and kolkata in west bengal is one of them kookana et al 2020 since 1947 to 2017 in india the groundwater storage has decline from 6 2 thousand cubic meters to 1 5 thousand cubic meters according to water resource information system wris of india even in the state of west bengal the groundwater level has been declining rapidly kruk et al 2018 malda district has three major rivers namely ganga mahananda and fulhar the water level of these rivers is decreasing rapidly due to climate change these rivers play a very important role in groundwater recharge in the malda district by seepage infiltration etc ray and shekhar 2009 the declining trend of river water level is indirectly affecting the groundwater storage in this district this district has high agricultural dependence and in turn has high water demand for agriculture das and pal 2018 huge amount of groundwater has been extracted for irrigation and drinking as a result the problems of water scarcity for drinking and other purposes has aggravated in this study area due to groundwater shortage agriculture is being confined in a particular season like monsoonal mitra 2016 so water availability mapping is very important for managing the water scarcity problem to the planner water management authorities and local people viewing aforesaid condition in this study groundwater potential maps were prepared for managing it groundwater condition of an area is determined by a number of factors and the role of factors varies region to region depending upon the geo environmental conditions andualem and demeke 2019 jha et al 2010 machiwal et al 2011 several researchers used different topographical hydrological and environmental factors such as geology lithology geomorphology rainfall soil slope relief ndvi ndwi distance from drainage distance from lineament topographical wetness index twi stream power index spi sediment transportation index sti land use land cover lulc curvature and aspect for mapping the groundwater potential area in geographic information system gis environment andualem and demeke 2019 jha et al 2010 gumma and pavelic 2013 sokeng et al 2016 rahmati et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 ozdemir 2011 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 sutradhar et al 2021 das et al 2021 there are no standard rules to select the effective groundwater potential determining factors gwpdfs for selecting the gwpdfs different researchers used different statistical methods like multicollinearity analysis saha 2017 arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 mousavi et al 2017 correlation based method cao et al 2013 lee et al 2012 navane and sahoo 2017 etc in the present study for the selection of gwpdfs multi collinearity and rank correlation based attribute selection methods were applied several statistical approaches were used for preparing the gwpms the frequency ratio oh et al 2011 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 naghibi et al 2015 weights of evidence ozdemir 2011a corsini et al 2009 razandi et al 2015 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 and index of entropy naghibi et al 2015 are the most popular among statistical methods used by the scholars in recent decades researchers have introduced the machine learning algorithms mla for modelling different hazards as well as groundwater potentiality of different parts of the world these methods include decision trees naghibi et al 2016 zabihi et al 2016 mousavi et al 2017 golkarian et al 2018 support vector machine pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 pradhan 2013 artificial neural network ann lee et al 2018 bagging breiman 1996 random forest naghibi et al 2015 zabihi et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 bui et al 2012 etc however the performances of these models are better than the conventional statistical method but it can be further improved by ensemble frame work ensemble techniques use the mla to combine the several base classifiers for improving the accuracy of the models pham et al 2017 however these machine learning techniques were proven as more reliable and accurate in working with nonlinear and complex data than the statistical probabilistic methods naghibi et al 2015 in a paper of naghibi et al 2016 support vector machine svm and random forest rf methods were used and they got excellent results most of the above studies used single models in groundwater research however viewing the accurateness of the machine learning methods svm rf and bagging were used in the present study which are new for this region naghibi et al 2020 recently introduced a novel ensemble model which was used in a groundwater related study considering some data mining models and the frequency ratio the findings of their research indicated that the applied ensemble model had performed better than a single model in this study a novel ensemble of ann and bagging ann bagging was used and compared with the rf svm and bagging this new ensemble computational intelligence method ann bagging is quit new in the groundwater study comparison among the ensemble ann bagging and svm rf as well as bagging techniques for building groundwater potential maps is quite new however the ensemble model i e ann bagging was rarely used in landslides susceptibility modeling lee et al 2012 butt et al 2013 and mapping the susceptibility to flood tehrany et al 2014 2015 application of machine learning ensemble techniques integrating with remote sensing and geographical information system gis is new in india in this regard current research contributes to the development of new ensemble models of ann and bagging and compared this model with svm rf and bagging for groundwater potentiality prediction thus the aims of this study are 1 evaluating the performance of the svm ann bagging bagging rf model in groundwater potential assessment 2 ranking the determining factors of groundwater gwpdfs and 3 providing spatial information and guidance in decision making processes concerning groundwater management in the study area 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area malda district is located in the middle of north bengal and south bengal malda district has a border of 165 6 km with bangladesh in the north eastern side the study area is bounded by bihar and jharkhand in the west and south west north dinajpur and south dinajpur in the north bangladesh in east and murshidabad district in south respectively the total area of the district is about 3933 sq km which is extended between 250 32 80 north to 240 40 20 north latitudes and 880 28 10 to 870 45 50 east longitudes fig 1 tal diara and barind are three physiographic divisions of the study area and this district has fifteen blocks and two municipalities as per census 2011 the total population is 39 97 929 and the majority of the population depends on agriculture and other allied industry due to groundwater shortage agriculture goes to seasonal particularly in monsoonal months osborne et al 2015 as a result this district faces the initial thrust of water scarcity total irrigated area of the district is 2016 sq km 51 26 which is being done through minor irrigation scheme ray and shekhar 2009 study area is covered by the heplaquepts ustocrepts entisol and inceptisol soil malda district is dominated by the monsoon climate and annual average rainfall and temperature is 1554 mm and 26 4 c respectively nearly 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during june to september 2 2 materials in the present study 93 groundwater withdrawal points and seventeen gwpdfs including elevation slope aspect curvature normalize different water index ndwi topographic wetness index twi normalize difference vegetation index ndvi stream power index spi sediment transport index sti geology geomorphology rainfall lithology and land use land cover lulc were considered table 1 shows the data sources used in this research elevation slope aspect curvature distance from the river spi sti twi maps were derived from srtm dem of 30 30 resolutions which was collected from usgs earth explorer ndvi lulc ndwi ndvi ndwi lineaments and lulc maps were prepared using the landsat oli 8 images taken from the usgs earth explorer geology geomorphology and soil were taken from the survey of india scaled on 1 50000 rainfall data were collected from imd these factors directly or indirectly influence the groundwater table among these groundwater potentiality determining factors geology lithology soil distance from lineament ndwi rainfall ndvi lulc and distance from river are much more determine the potentiality rather than slope curvature aspect geomorphology spi sti twi and ndvi to identify the potentiality of groundwater in this area therefore these variables from the given sources were used for measuring the groundwater potentiality the resolution of all the gwpdfs is not same to prepare the groundwater potential map the resolution of the dem 30m 30m was considered as the base scale and the factors had more larger or smaller resolution were resembled 2 3 methodology in recent years various new techniques were used for modelling the groundwater so it is very difficult to say what method is better for delineating the groundwater potential area however in the present research two machine learning svm rf and two hybrid ensemble bagging ann bagging techniques were used for mapping the groundwater potentiality the data were collected from 93 places in malda district regarding the withdrawal of groundwater for groundwater potential analysis following steps were have followed fig 2 1 data regarding the groundwater withdrawal of 93 wells and gwpdfs such as geomorphology geology rainfall soil relief slope aspect curvature lithology lulc spi sti twi ndvi ndwi distance from lineament and distance from river were collected and then thematic layers of the gwpdfs were prepared using arc gis software 2 for selecting the variables correlation based factor selection method and multi collinearity analysis

classification system 4 finally the groundwater potential models were validated by receiver operating characteristics roc curve sensitivity specificity accuracy positive predictive value ppv mean actual error mae root mean square error rmse and sensitivity analysis 2 4 methods applied for selecting the groundwater determining factors groundwater resources are actively determined by environmental factors and the dynamics of groundwater are determined by socio economic environment basically the nature of economic activity population trend and social norms that affect the attitude of groundwater users these factors have significant role in designing any policies or management plans for groundwater uses and sustainable development garduno et al 2011 factor selection is therefore an important aspect for groundwater modelling for exploring the groundwater potential area selection of appropriate gwpdfs are needed arabameri et al 2019 lee et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 srivastava

das and pardeshi 2018 and multi collinearity analysis arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2012 were used in this present study to select the gwpdfs first literatures were reviewed and finally the correlation based attribute selection method and multi collinearity analysis were used detailed discussion regarding the correlation based attribute section can be found in the study of phong et al 2021 and regarding the multi collinearity analysis can be found in the literatures of saha 2017 gayen and saha 2017 and arabameri et al 2019 2 5 data preparation 2 5 1 groundwater inventory datasets the groundwater controlling datasets have significant role in groundwater potential area identification naghibi et al 2016 lee et al 2018 the well sample database was prepared after the field visit with the handheld gps and yield data were collected from cgdb india total 93 well were considered for the study area out of the total sample 65 70 samples were used as training data

various geo environmental factors 17 gwpdfs including relief slope aspect curvature geomorphology geology lithology ndvi ndwi distance from the river distance from lineament spi sti twi lulc rainfall were considered for mapping the potential area of groundwater table 2 elevation the elevation is an important factor for groundwater potentiality mapping ozdemir 2011a b the malda district consists of low lying alluvial planes sloping towards the south west fig 3a a few elevated areas are present in the north eastern part of the district having the elevation up to 52m from the mean sea level slope slope map was extracted from the dem and used for modelling the groundwater potential area slope influences the groundwater table where slope is high the amount of stored water is less due to less water stagnation gülay et al 2016 in this study area slope ranges between 00 540 fig 3b so it is important to consider the slope variable for measuring the groundwater potential area aspect aspect influences the water retention capacity of the region marr 1961 it is also controlled by the hydraulic conductivity geological setting and relief factors karacan and goodman 2012 aspect map fig 3c of the present study area was extracted from the dem curvature the plain curvature primarily effects in the acceleration and deceleration of flow as well as convergence and divergence of flow on the surface of soil oh et al 2011 benjmel et al 2020 the curvature of the study area was classified into three groups i e concave convex and flat surface fig 3d geology groundwater potentiality of a place is determined by the geological setting of an area naghibi et al 2016 malda district have four geologic formations fig 3e barind geologic formation has been found in a relatively small part of the district formed during the pleistocene ice age malda geologic formation was formed in the holocene era which stretched into the middle part of malda the new alluvial formation covers the eastern portion of the district ganga mahananda geological part is higher groundwater potential than rest of geologic formations ray and shekhar 2009 geomorphology geomorphology is significant factor for groundwater potentiality mapping gülay et al 2016 the study area is the part of ganga river basin comprising quaternary sediments deposited by the ganga mahananda river system situated just adjacent to the south western of the study area ray and shekhar 2009 the area is geomorphologically composed of active flood plain older flood plain and the oldest flood plain fig 3f lithology the lithology of an area determines soil porosity and soil permeability which is essential for groundwater resource mapping oikonomidis et al 2015 the lithology of the study area is a result of subsidence of concomitant deposition in the garo rajmahal gap ckakraborty et al 2007 large scale sedimentation by the himalayan rivers took place during pleistocene and recent period older alluvial of pleistocene age occupies the eastern part of the district the older alluvium is characterized by argillaceous sediment clay and caliginous material lateralization of the sediment is often observed at the surface clay fig 3g the clay is very stiff and plastic in character and has less potentiality of groundwater ray and shekhar 2009 soil groundwater potential is determined by the soil character of the region naghibi et al 2015 four types of soil have been found in the study area fig 3h these are i heplaquepts ii ustocrepts iii entisol and iv inceptisol rainfall rainfall is a very important factor for the delineating the groundwater potential zone magesh et al 2012 the malda district is significantly under hot and humid monsoonal climate reduction in the water quantities during summer months and recharging of water during monsoon and post monsoon months depend to a great extent on precipitation fig 3i normalize difference vegetation index ndvi the normalize difference vegetation index ndvi indicates the vegetation character of an area and influences groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2015 in malda district vegetations are sparsely distributed vegetation cover mainly found in the roadside and the bank of the river high ndvi values indicate higher vegetation concentration ndvi was calculated from the satellite image fig 3j using equation 4 4 n d v i n i r re d n i r re d normalized difference water index ndwi ndwi indicates the distribution of water bodies gao 1996 therefore it is an important factor for identifying groundwater potential area naghibi et al 2015 higher ndwi value represents high depth of water ziaul and pal 2018 the ndwi was derived from the satellite images fig 3k using equation 5 5 n d w i g r e e n n i r g r e e n n i r land use and land cover

2017 chen et al 2018 it was first used by bai et al 2008 svm is important supervised classifier that is suitable for measure wide range of classification problems lee et al 2017 nothing like traditional methods which reduce errors of the test training svms always intend to reduce a higher incidence of the superior error it also generates split hyperplane between data kernel implemented in svm to be relatively flexible in selecting the threshold for distinguishing potential area from non potential area auria and moro 2008 9 mathematically it can be minimized as 1 2 w 2 where w is the norm of normal hyper plane 10 subject to the following constraints y i w x i 1 where y i 1 xi is set of separable training vector 1 2 n b is a scalar base and w xi represents the scalar product operation introducing the lagrangian multiplier the cost function can be defined as 11 l 1 2 w 2 i 1 n λ i y i w x i b 1 where λi is the lagrangian multiplier it is possible to achieve the solution by the double minimizing equation 11 for non separable case one can change the constraints b setting up slack variables ξi more detailed regarding this method can be found in the work of roy et al 2019 12 y i w x i b 1 ξ i 2 6 2 artificial neural network ann ann is one of the most commonly deployed artificial intelligence and data mining frameworks similar to human brain biological neural networks this model is an integrated node structure which can be learned to predict the required outcome from the given input merdun et al 2006 gaudio et al 2021 this technique exhibits significant advantages in traditional computational models as it does not require assumptions or predefined constraints about the form of the model for instance between dependent and independent variables galankashi et al 2015 it is capable of detecting and analyzing complex nonlinear interactions within the dataset frank et al 2016 this approach may also provide the pattern generalization during training galankashi et

used as the basic classifier of bagging bagging algorithm reduces the entropy and minimizes the error of the variance witten et al 2005 for the bagging process different combinations of training data by base learner was derived breiman 1996 bagging is short of bootstrap aggregating which replaced by training instances chen et al 2019 breiman 1996 mathematically equation 13 is constructed as 13 t x

validation datasets are 0 19 0 06 0 10 and 0 15 respectively table 6 from the statistical measurements and roc curves it can be said all the models have good capability in groundwater potential mapping in this area above all the ann bagging model has better capability in modeling the groundwater potential area than the other models 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity was analyzed to assess the role of each factor on the groundwater potential area mapping the outcomes of sensitivity analysis showed the values of factors attained in percentage contribution pc the contribution of gwdfs i e

distance from the river rainfall lithology relief have stronger influence than other factors fig 8 sensitivity analysis will help to increase model performance and know the important role of factors that is essential for understanding the structure of the model 4 discussion now a day s due to the rapid growth of the population demand of groundwater for drinking and irrigation has increased especially in the gangetic plain areas rajmohan and prathapar 2013 most of the parts of the malda district are rural area and people heavily depend on groundwater for irrigation the irregularity of rainfall increased the demand of groundwater as irrigation water for agricultural activities to handle the massive pressure on groundwater it is essential to identify the groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential map is the basic tool for the groundwater management and planning in sustainable way the geo environmental factors like relief soil geomorphology geology slope slope aspect curvature rainfall etc control groundwater potentiality of an area arabameri et al 2019 kim et al 2019 lee et al 2018 chen et al 2019 such essential datasets were used in this analysis as input datasets for mapping the groundwater potential area correlation based factor selection and multi collinearity analysis were considered for checking the applicability of the selected factors in this evaluating process the outcomes are more accurate than previous work the machine learning ensemble models have represented the excellent result in the other works done by mosavi et al 2021 lee et al 2018 arabameri et al 2019 termeh et al 2019 lee et al 2018 the areal coverage of groundwater potential zones shows little variations given by the different models fig 6 nearly 23 of the study area is very highly potential for groundwater according to the results of the applied models western and south western part of the district has high groundwater potentiality the main causes of high groundwater potentiality in western and south western areas of malda district are the presence of the ganga river favourable soil and lithological condition sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze the contribution of each variable in model performance according to the sensitivity analysis soil lithology geomorphology geology rainfall and distance from river are more significant to delineate water potential area fig 8 on the other hand spi sti twi aspect the curvature has quite less contribution among gwdfs fig 8 all the models selected have excellent capability for mapping the groundwater potential area but there are little variance in accuracy in each model auc roc se sp accuracy ppv mae mrse were calculated for the validation of the results table 6 for landslide susceptibility assessment in the himalaya in india pham et al 2016 employed mlp neural networks as the basic classifier with ensemble meta classifiers the prediction abilities of a single model were improved by using ensemble meta classifiers ensemble machine learning algorithms increase the accuracy of the basic classifiers pham et al 2017 2016c similarly the ensemble of bagging and ann yields better results for identifying groundwater potential zone than the individual models in this investigation bagging is a significant tool to boost a single classifier s prediction accuracy by using variance and bias reduction in the creation of an ensemble learning classifier pham et al 2017 in this case using the rbf kernel feature bagging improves the stability of the ann base classifier model bootstrap sampling could decrease the noise of a single classifier in a data set resulting in a corresponding reduce in the variance of the classification model breiman 1996 as per the result of the different machine learning techniques ann bagging ensemble model is the best model for mapping the groundwater potentiality in the present study area however ensemble techniques are more reliable than the single model these machines learning models can be used to produce groundwater potential maps and may be used for groundwater management for managing the groundwater resources management of aquifer recharge is important which involves landscape modification and building infrastructure intentionally to enhance groundwater recharge shamsudduha et al 2007 ghayoumian et al 2007 groundwater in the gangatic plain areas is mostly depending on recharge from river stream cgwb 2010 hydraulic connection with the river and aquifer can increase the groundwater level and minimize the water shortage problem for irrigation and pumping maitra 2010 drip pepsi drip irrigation process is very much applicable for water shortage areas khalid at al 2018 in this context there is an urgent need to explore various benefitting options for optimal utilization of these resources malda district has good number of wetlands due to lack of management of these wetland water holding capacity as well as water quality is deteriorating day by day proper management of these wetlands can provide good amount of water for irrigation rainwater harvesting is another important option for managing groundwater resources in the study area 5 conclusion this research was carried out not only to analyze the functionality of hybrid models bagging and ann bagging but also to compare their capability and robustness of four state of the art models such as svm ann bagging bagging and rf this work also tried to point out the groundwater potentiality scenario in the study area the relevancy of all gwpdfs was investigated using all modelling approaches according to the results of the applied models nearly 23 41 area of the district has very high potentiality of groundwater western and south western parts of the study area fall under the category of very high potential zone because of the presence of ganga river favourable soil lithological condition and relatively higher concentration of rainfall on the other hand in the north eastern parts of the district the potentiality of groundwater is very low in addition the result of variable importance indicated that the distance from the river is the most important gwdf followed by distance from lineament lithology and soil respectively on the other aspect slope and twi factors were the least important factors in the modeling procedure this study showed that there were some distinctions in term of accuracy of predictions reliability and robustness of individual machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods the findings highlighted that the understanding of the strengths and limitations remained somewhat challenging for model selection even when performing model comparisons with some clear objectives such as predictive success and robustness based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria ann bagging obtained the most outstanding performance although it sometimes showed a minor sensitivity to adjustments in the calibration validation data the rf and svm had a slightly smaller precision as compared to the ann bagging bagging in terms of prediction efficiency in addition the results of this study could be helpful to water resource managers to cope with the current uncertain situation and explore different factors which more reliably affect groundwater potential furthermore this approach could be used as a guide for future research to analyze the susceptibility of groundwater to climate change i e as a framework for the study of national water resources

could be helpful to land use planners and local people for groundwater management graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential ann bagging support vector machine random forest malda district 1 introduction worldwide groundwater is the major source of irrigation and drinking water mukherjee et al 2018 2021 groundwater has broad significance as a resource and can be utilized when needed growth of population increases the food and water uses and leads to a worldwide increase in water demand choubin et al 2019 mosavi et al 2020 2021 presently people are facing the problem of water scarcity worldwide and it is created big challenge for the social economic and industrial development contamination of ground water by the fluoride and arsenic is the burning problem not only in india but also all over the world ijumulana et al 2020 2021 lima et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021a 2021b as a result of this contamination the availability of water for domestic uses decreases sharply in india over 65 of irrigated water and 85 of drinking water come from the groundwater storage as per the world bank report published in 2010 from last three decades in india 54 people are facing the problem of water scarcity at least 1 month as per un report world water assessment programme 2018 according to water stress index 11 large cities in india are facing an extreme water scarcity problem where chennai is the most and kolkata in west bengal is one of them kookana et al 2020 since 1947 to 2017 in india the groundwater storage has decline from 6 2 thousand cubic meters to 1 5 thousand cubic meters according to water resource information system wris of india even in the state of west bengal the groundwater level has been declining rapidly kruk et al 2018 malda district has three major rivers namely ganga mahananda and fulhar the water level of these rivers is decreasing rapidly due to climate change these rivers play a very important role in groundwater recharge in the malda district by seepage infiltration etc ray and shekhar 2009 the declining trend of river water level is indirectly affecting the groundwater storage in this district this district has high agricultural dependence and in turn has high water demand for agriculture das and pal 2018 huge amount of groundwater has been extracted for irrigation and drinking as a result the problems of water scarcity for drinking and other purposes has aggravated in this study area due to groundwater shortage agriculture is being confined in a particular season like monsoonal mitra 2016 so water availability mapping is very important for managing the water scarcity problem to the planner water management authorities and local people viewing aforesaid condition in this study groundwater potential maps were prepared for managing it groundwater condition of an area is determined by a number of factors and the role of factors varies region to region depending upon the geo environmental conditions andualem and demeke 2019 jha et al 2010 machiwal et al 2011 several researchers used different topographical hydrological and environmental factors such as geology lithology geomorphology

rahmati et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 ozdemir 2011 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 sutradhar et al 2021 das et al 2021 there are no standard rules to select the effective groundwater potential determining factors gwpdfs for selecting the gwpdfs different researchers used different statistical methods like multicollinearity analysis saha 2017 arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 mousavi et al 2017 correlation based method cao et al 2013 lee et al 2012 navane and sahoo 2017 etc in the present study for the selection of gwpdfs multi collinearity and rank correlation based attribute selection methods were applied several statistical approaches were used for preparing the gwpms the frequency ratio oh et al 2011 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 naghibi et al 2015 weights of evidence ozdemir 2011a corsini et al 2009 razandi et al 2015 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 and index of entropy naghibi et al 2015 are the most popular among statistical methods used by the scholars in recent decades researchers have introduced the machine learning algorithms mla for modelling different hazards as well as groundwater potentiality of different parts of the world these methods include decision trees naghibi et al 2016 zabihi et al 2016 mousavi et al 2017 golkarian et al 2018 support vector machine pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 pradhan 2013 artificial neural network ann lee et al 2018 bagging breiman 1996 random forest naghibi et al 2015 zabihi et al 2016 tahmassebipoor et al 2016 bui et al 2012 etc however the performances of these models are better than the conventional statistical method but it can be further improved by ensemble frame work ensemble techniques use the mla to combine the several base classifiers for improving the accuracy of the models pham et al 2017 however these machine learning techniques were proven as more reliable and accurate in working with nonlinear and complex data than the statistical probabilistic methods naghibi et al 2015 in a paper of naghibi et al 2016 support vector machine svm and random forest rf methods were used and they got excellent results most of the above studies used single models in groundwater research however viewing the accurateness of the machine learning methods svm rf and bagging were used in the present study which are new for this region naghibi et al 2020 recently introduced a novel ensemble model which was used in a groundwater related study considering some data mining models and the frequency ratio the findings of their research indicated that the applied ensemble model had performed better than a single model in this study a novel ensemble of ann and bagging ann bagging was used and compared with the rf svm and bagging this new ensemble computational intelligence method ann bagging is quit new in the groundwater study comparison among the ensemble ann bagging and svm rf as well as bagging techniques for building groundwater potential maps is quite new however the ensemble model i e ann bagging was rarely used in landslides susceptibility modeling lee et al 2012 butt et al 2013 and mapping the susceptibility to flood tehrany et al 2014 2015 application of machine learning ensemble techniques integrating with remote sensing and geographical information system gis is new in india in this regard current research contributes to the development of new ensemble models of ann and bagging and compared this model with svm rf and bagging for groundwater potentiality prediction thus the aims of this study are 1 evaluating the performance of the svm ann bagging bagging rf model in groundwater potential assessment 2 ranking the determining factors of groundwater gwpdfs and 3 providing spatial information and guidance in decision making processes concerning groundwater management in the study area 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area malda district is located in the middle of north bengal and south bengal malda district has a border of 165 6 km with bangladesh in the north eastern side the study area is bounded by bihar and jharkhand in the west and south west north dinajpur and south dinajpur in the north bangladesh in east and murshidabad district in south respectively the total area of the district is about 3933 sq km which is extended between 250 32 80 north to 240 40 20 north latitudes and 880 28 10 to 870 45 50 east longitudes fig 1 tal diara and barind are three physiographic divisions of the study area and this district has fifteen blocks and two municipalities as per census 2011 the total population is 39 97 929 and the majority of the population depends on agriculture and other allied industry due to groundwater shortage agriculture goes to seasonal particularly in monsoonal months osborne et al 2015 as a result this district faces the initial thrust of water scarcity total irrigated area of the district is 2016 sq km 51 26 which is being done through minor irrigation scheme ray and shekhar 2009 study area is covered by the heplaquepts ustocrepts entisol and inceptisol soil malda district is dominated by the monsoon climate and annual average rainfall and temperature is 1554 mm and 26 4 c respectively nearly 85 of the annual rainfall occurs during june to september 2 2 materials in the present study 93 groundwater withdrawal points and seventeen gwpdfs including elevation slope aspect curvature normalize different

geomorphology and soil were taken from the survey of india scaled on 1 50000 rainfall data were collected from imd these factors directly or indirectly influence the groundwater table among these groundwater potentiality determining factors geology lithology soil distance from lineament ndwi rainfall ndvi lulc and distance from river are much more determine the potentiality rather than slope curvature aspect geomorphology spi sti twi and ndvi to identify the potentiality of groundwater in this area therefore these variables from the given sources were used for measuring the groundwater potentiality the resolution of all the gwpdfs is not same to prepare the groundwater potential map the resolution of the dem 30m 30m was considered as the base scale and the factors had more larger or smaller resolution were resembled 2 3 methodology in recent years various new techniques were used for modelling the groundwater so it is very difficult to say what method is better for delineating the groundwater potential area however in the present research two machine learning svm rf and two hybrid ensemble bagging ann bagging techniques were used for mapping the groundwater potentiality the data were collected from 93 places in malda district regarding the withdrawal of groundwater for groundwater potential analysis following steps were have followed fig 2 1 data regarding the groundwater withdrawal of 93 wells and gwpdfs such as geomorphology geology rainfall soil relief slope aspect curvature lithology lulc spi sti twi ndvi ndwi distance from lineament and distance from

environmental factors and the dynamics of groundwater are determined by socio economic environment basically the nature of economic activity population trend and social norms that affect the attitude of groundwater users these factors have significant role in designing any policies or management plans for groundwater uses and sustainable development garduno et al 2011 factor selection is therefore an important aspect for groundwater modelling for exploring the groundwater potential area selection of appropriate gwpdfs are needed arabameri et al 2019 lee et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 srivastava

das and pardeshi 2018 and multi collinearity analysis arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2012 were used in this present study to select the gwpdfs first literatures were reviewed and finally the correlation based attribute selection method and multi collinearity analysis were used detailed discussion regarding the correlation based attribute section can be found in the study of phong et al 2021 and regarding the multi collinearity analysis can be found in the literatures of saha 2017 gayen and saha 2017 and arabameri et al 2019 2 5 data preparation 2 5 1 groundwater

various geo environmental factors 17 gwpdfs including relief slope aspect curvature geomorphology geology lithology ndvi ndwi distance from the river distance from lineament spi sti twi lulc rainfall were considered for mapping the potential area of groundwater table 2 elevation the elevation is an important factor for groundwater potentiality mapping ozdemir 2011a b the malda district consists of low lying alluvial planes sloping towards the south west fig 3a a few elevated areas are present in the north eastern part of the district having the elevation up to 52m from the mean sea level slope slope map was extracted from the dem and used for modelling the groundwater potential area slope influences the groundwater table where slope is high the amount of stored water is less due to less water stagnation gülay et al 2016 in this study area slope ranges between 00 540 fig 3b so it is important to consider the slope variable for measuring the groundwater potential area aspect aspect influences the water retention capacity of the region marr 1961 it is also controlled by the hydraulic conductivity geological setting and relief factors karacan and goodman 2012 aspect map fig 3c of the present study area was extracted from the dem curvature the plain curvature primarily effects in the acceleration and deceleration of flow as well as convergence and divergence of flow on the surface of soil oh et al 2011 benjmel et al 2020 the curvature of the study area was classified into three groups i e concave convex and flat surface fig 3d geology groundwater potentiality of a place is determined by the geological setting of an area naghibi et al 2016 malda district have four geologic formations fig 3e barind geologic formation has been found in a relatively small part of the district formed during the pleistocene ice age malda geologic formation was formed in the holocene era which stretched into the middle part of malda the new alluvial formation covers the eastern portion of the district ganga mahananda geological part is higher groundwater potential than rest of geologic formations ray and shekhar 2009 geomorphology geomorphology is significant factor for groundwater potentiality mapping gülay et al 2016 the study area is the part of ganga river basin comprising quaternary sediments deposited by the ganga mahananda river system situated just adjacent to the south western of the study area ray and shekhar 2009 the area is geomorphologically composed of active flood plain older flood plain and the oldest flood plain fig 3f lithology the lithology of an area determines soil porosity and soil permeability which is essential for groundwater resource mapping oikonomidis et al 2015 the lithology of the study area is a result of subsidence of concomitant deposition in the garo rajmahal gap ckakraborty et al 2007 large scale sedimentation by the himalayan rivers took place during pleistocene and recent period older alluvial of pleistocene age occupies the eastern part of the district the older alluvium is characterized by argillaceous sediment clay and caliginous material lateralization of the sediment is often observed at the surface clay fig 3g the clay is very stiff and plastic in character and has less potentiality of groundwater ray and shekhar 2009 soil groundwater potential is determined by the soil character of the region naghibi et al 2015 four types of soil have been found in the study area fig 3h these are i heplaquepts ii ustocrepts iii entisol and iv inceptisol rainfall rainfall is a very important factor for the delineating the groundwater potential zone magesh et al 2012 the malda district is significantly under hot and humid monsoonal climate reduction in the water quantities during summer months and recharging of water during monsoon and post monsoon months depend to a great extent on precipitation fig 3i normalize difference vegetation index ndvi the normalize difference vegetation index ndvi indicates the vegetation character of an area and influences groundwater recharge naghibi et al 2015 in malda district vegetations are sparsely distributed vegetation cover mainly found in the roadside and the bank of the river high ndvi values indicate higher vegetation concentration ndvi was calculated from the satellite image fig 3j using equation 4 4 n d v i n i r re d n i r re d normalized difference water index ndwi ndwi indicates the distribution of water bodies gao 1996 therefore it is an important factor for identifying groundwater potential area naghibi et al 2015 higher

traditional methods which reduce errors of the test training svms always intend to reduce a higher incidence of the superior error it also generates split hyperplane between data kernel implemented in svm to be relatively flexible in selecting the threshold for distinguishing potential area from non potential area auria and moro 2008 9 mathematically it can be minimized as 1 2 w 2 where w is the norm of normal hyper plane 10 subject to the following constraints y i w x i 1 where y i 1 xi is set of separable training vector 1 2 n b is a scalar base and w xi represents the scalar product operation introducing the lagrangian multiplier the cost function can be defined as 11 l 1 2 w 2 i 1 n λ i y i w x i b 1 where λi is the lagrangian multiplier it is possible to achieve the solution by

this model is an integrated node structure which can be learned to predict the required outcome from the given input merdun et al 2006 gaudio et al 2021 this technique exhibits significant advantages in traditional computational models as it does not require assumptions or predefined constraints about the form of the model for instance between dependent and independent variables galankashi et al 2015 it is capable of detecting and analyzing complex nonlinear interactions within the dataset frank et al 2016 this approach may also provide the pattern generalization during training galankashi et al 2015 the ann was investigated using a back propagation algorithm in terms of gradient descent and momentum we ve used the optimum solution to number error in this analysis the number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23 and the learning rate was varied from 0 01 to 1 0 in increments of 0 05 for each configuration the rmse between the model output and the measured data was calculated the ideal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the appropriate learning rate with the highest model output as can be seen by rmse using the trial and error process the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimum learning rate has been defined 2 6 3 bagging hothorn and lusen developed the bagging ensemble technique lausen and schumacher 1996 in this study reptree was used as the basic classifier of bagging bagging algorithm reduces the entropy and minimizes the error of the variance witten et al 2005 for the bagging process different combinations of training data by base learner was derived breiman 1996 bagging is short of bootstrap aggregating which replaced by training instances chen et al 2019 breiman 1996 mathematically equation 13 is constructed as 13 t x n y n n 1 2 3 n where t is the total included data y is the class labels in this study xn is the water potential determining parameters and yn is the well and non well points 2 6 4 random forest rf rf is a distribution free methodology that is more effective as an extension of the classification and regression trees and produces multiple classification trees to boost predictive efficiency of the model breiman 2001 during rf modeling each tree split was determined using the randomized subset of variables rf model can solve i pre assumption of data distribution ii outfitting problems iii large number of datasets may minimize the bias and variance problems iv maximum number of factors increases the diversity of forest v resulting excellent prediction for performance 2 7 techniques of models validation one technique is not sufficient to validate and judge the performance of models because of uneven distribution of samples within some places area under the auc roc curve was constructed for the validation of model performances using equation 14 training dataset was used to assess the goodness of fit and validation dataset was used to estimate the accuracy of groundwater potential models arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2019 this is commonly used method for the validation of model performances pham et al 2017 the high value of auc table 3 of the specific model represents highly

sensitivity analysis was used to measure the effect of each factor on model s output crosetto and tarantola 2001 chen et al 2018 lodwick et al 1990 first used this method the quantitative contribution of each factor was estimated by map removal sensitivity analysis method using the following equation 21 p c a u c a l l a u c i a u c i 100 where auc all means all determining factors of groundwater to evaluate the model auci is indicates the auc value excluding each factor 3 results 3 1 correlation based attribute ranking the correlation based factor selection technique is the useful tool to determine gwdfs lee et al 2018 this method showed that the selected 17 parameters have significant role in determining the groundwater potentiality among the selected factor lithology achieved the

3 3 groundwater potential models using the natural break classification system the groundwater potential maps produced by svm fig 5a ann bagging fig 5b bagging fig 5c and rf fig 5d were categorized into five groups such as very high high medium low very low the result of svm model showed that 920 76 sq km area 23 41 is very highly potential 693 48 sq km area 17 63 is highly potential 1132 03 sq

validation datasets are 0 19 0 06 0 10 and 0 15 respectively table 6 from the statistical measurements and roc curves it can be said all the models have good capability in groundwater potential mapping in this area above all the ann bagging model has better capability in modeling the groundwater potential area than the other models 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity was analyzed to assess the role of each factor on the groundwater potential area mapping the outcomes of sensitivity analysis showed the values of factors attained in percentage contribution pc the contribution of gwdfs i e rainfall twi spi sti relief ndvi lithology curvature ndwi distance from river aspect soil land use geology geomorphology and slope are 10 87 1 19 4 79 0 98 15 12 4 56 16 41 2 48 11 47 20 15 1 4 21 2 6 48 5 43 8 66 and 1 42 fig 8 respectively in the modeling of groundwater potential area slope aspect sti twi curvature have little contribution to make an area potential for groundwater and whereas distance from the river rainfall lithology relief have stronger influence than other factors fig 8 sensitivity analysis will help to increase model performance and know the important role of factors that is essential for understanding the structure of the model 4 discussion now a day s due to the rapid growth of the population demand of groundwater for drinking and irrigation has increased especially in the gangetic plain areas rajmohan and prathapar 2013 most of the parts of the malda district are rural area and people heavily depend on groundwater for irrigation the irregularity of rainfall increased the demand of groundwater as irrigation water for agricultural activities to handle the massive pressure on groundwater it is essential to identify the groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential map is the basic tool for the groundwater management and planning in sustainable way the geo environmental factors like relief soil geomorphology geology slope slope aspect curvature rainfall etc control groundwater potentiality of an area arabameri et al 2019 kim et al 2019 lee et al 2018 chen et al 2019 such essential datasets were used in this analysis as input datasets for mapping the groundwater potential area correlation based factor selection and multi collinearity analysis were considered for checking the applicability of the selected factors in this evaluating process the outcomes are more accurate than previous work the machine learning ensemble models have represented the excellent result in the other works done by mosavi et al 2021 lee et al 2018 arabameri et al 2019 termeh et al 2019 lee et al 2018 the areal coverage of groundwater potential zones shows little variations given by the different models fig 6 nearly 23 of the study area is very highly potential for groundwater according to the results of the applied models western and south western part of the district has high groundwater potentiality the main causes of high groundwater potentiality in western and south western areas of malda district are the presence of the ganga river favourable soil and lithological condition sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze the contribution of each variable in model performance according to the sensitivity analysis soil lithology geomorphology geology rainfall and distance from river are more significant to delineate water potential area fig 8 on the other hand spi sti twi aspect the curvature has quite less contribution among gwdfs fig 8 all the models selected have excellent capability for mapping the groundwater potential area but there are little variance in accuracy in each model auc roc se sp accuracy ppv mae mrse were calculated for the validation of the results table 6 for landslide susceptibility assessment in the himalaya in india pham et al 2016 employed mlp neural networks as the basic classifier with ensemble meta classifiers the prediction abilities of a single model were improved by using ensemble meta classifiers ensemble machine learning algorithms increase the accuracy of the basic classifiers pham et al 2017 2016c similarly the ensemble of bagging and ann yields better results for identifying groundwater potential zone than the individual models in this investigation bagging is a significant tool to boost a single classifier s prediction accuracy by using variance and bias reduction in the creation of an ensemble learning classifier pham et al 2017 in this case using the rbf kernel feature bagging improves the stability of the ann base classifier model bootstrap sampling could decrease the noise of a single classifier in a data set resulting in a corresponding reduce in the variance of the classification model breiman 1996 as per the result of the different machine learning techniques ann bagging ensemble model is the best model for mapping the groundwater potentiality in the present study area however ensemble techniques are more reliable than the single model these machines learning models can be used to produce groundwater potential maps and may be used for groundwater management for managing the groundwater resources management of aquifer recharge is important which involves landscape modification and building infrastructure intentionally to enhance groundwater recharge shamsudduha et al 2007 ghayoumian et al 2007 groundwater in the gangatic plain areas is mostly depending on recharge from river stream cgwb 2010 hydraulic connection with the river and aquifer can increase the groundwater level and minimize the water shortage problem for irrigation and pumping maitra 2010 drip pepsi drip irrigation process is very much applicable for water shortage areas khalid at al 2018 in this context there is an urgent need to explore various benefitting options for optimal utilization of these resources malda district has good number of wetlands due to lack of management of these wetland water holding capacity as well as water quality is deteriorating day by day proper management of these wetlands can provide good amount of water for irrigation rainwater harvesting is another important option for managing groundwater resources in the study area 5 conclusion this research was carried out not only to analyze the functionality of hybrid models bagging and ann bagging but also to compare their capability and robustness of four state of the art models such as svm ann bagging bagging and rf this work also tried to point out the groundwater potentiality scenario in the study area the relevancy of all gwpdfs was investigated using all modelling approaches according to the results of the applied models nearly 23 41 area of the district has very high potentiality of groundwater western and south western parts of the study area fall under the category of very high potential zone because of the presence of ganga river favourable soil lithological condition and relatively higher concentration of rainfall on the other hand in the north eastern parts of the district the potentiality of groundwater is very low in addition the result of variable importance indicated that the distance from the river is the most important gwdf followed by distance from lineament lithology and soil respectively on the other aspect slope and twi factors were the least important factors in the modeling procedure this study showed that there were some distinctions in term of accuracy of predictions reliability and robustness of individual machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods the findings highlighted that the understanding of the strengths and limitations remained somewhat challenging for model selection even when performing model comparisons with some clear objectives such as predictive success and robustness based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria ann bagging obtained the most outstanding performance although it sometimes showed a minor sensitivity to adjustments in the calibration validation data the rf and svm had a slightly smaller precision as compared to the ann bagging bagging in terms of prediction efficiency in addition the results of this study could be helpful to water resource managers to cope with the current uncertain situation and explore different factors which more reliably affect groundwater potential furthermore this approach could be used as a guide for future research to analyze the susceptibility of groundwater to climate change i e as a framework for the study of national water resources

and groundwater flow mineral precipitation dissolution prolonged storage in the aquifer exchange and adsorption desorption gas exsolution dissolution recent studies have also shown that land use and urbanization have an impact on hydrochemistry implying that groundwater resources must be assessed and managed effectively according to water quality surveys farmers in semi arid and dry regions continue to utilize water that would otherwise be deemed unfit according to several scientific institutions criteria as a result in irrigation areas it is necessary to assess the aquifers potential for groundwater pollution groundwater quality deteriorates in two ways first as a result of geochemical processes in aquifers and soils and second as a result of inappropriate canals drainages used for irrigation as a result a frequent assessment of irrigation and drinking water quality is required irrigation necessitates an adequate quantity of useable water the index which is based on the composition and concentration of dissolved components in water can be used to determine its suitability for agricultural use the nature of the mineral components in the water as well as their effects on the soil and plants determine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation the excess of salts affects plant growth by restoring plant uptake capacity due to complex changes arising from osmotic processes todd 1980 in general water quality parameters major cations such as na ca2 mg2 k and anions cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 and heavy metals are indicators of drinking water consumption while water quality indices such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage ssp na residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity ra kellys ratio kr or kellys index ki permeability index pi chloro alkali indices cai1 and cai2 potential salinity ps magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar total dissolved solids tds and total hardness th based on primary water quality parameters are commonly used to determine water quality for irrigation 2 related works shah et al 2018a 2018b has recorded the water quality experiments in the dholera district in gujarat groundwater samples were taken from shallow geothermal wells scattered around the dholera district ph total dissolved salts tds na k ca2 mg2 f hco3 cl and so42 were measured in samples taken from nine geothermal wells and

the water contains corrosive particles and tds is also high ranging from 410 to 696 5 mg l with an average of 541 53 mg l the goal of this study was to look at the hydrochemical mechanisms that influence groundwater chemistry and to use water quality indicators to estimate the acceptability of springs and groundwater for irrigation and drinking by sappa et al 2015 in italy hydrochemical na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 as well as physical ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids properties of water chemical characteristics such as sodium adsorption ratio sar total hardness mg hazard

for laboratory analysis raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with nitric acid was reduced to ph 2 for the determination of cationic concentrations the preservation of samples was critical to reducing the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the laboratory where all the chemical tests were carried out to obtain concentration values standard apha methods were used to determine the concentrations of cl so4 2 f ca2 mg2 hco3 b ar3 fe2 si4 pb2 and ni2 inductively

complete datasets for some of the measured parameters necessitated data pre treatment the multiple imputation method was used with a total of 5 imputations to generate the missing outputs takahashi 2017 4 3 suitability for drinking purposes 4 3 1 computation of the water quality index wqi to get a broad picture of the groundwater quality for drinking purposes wqi is one of the best tools which work effectively wqi is well stated as a score displaying the combined impact of various quality factors of groundwater horton 1965 kumari and rai 2020 li and wu 2019 the derivation of wqi involves weight assignment for each parameter normalization of the weights standardization of the parameters calculation of individual wqi scores and aggregation of the scores adimalla et al 2020 el baba et al 2020 to calculate the wqi the weight has been assigned for the physicochemical parameters according to the parameter s relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking water purposes the assigned weight ranges from 1 to 5 the maximum weight of 5 has been allocated for nitrate and tds 4 for ph ec so42 3 for hco3 cl 2 for ca2 na k and weight 1 assigned for magnesium patil et al 2020 the relative weight wi is computed from the following equation 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is defined as the weight of each parameter and n is total the number of parameters the concentration of all parameters of each water sample is divided by its corresponding standard as per the rules laid down in the world health organisation who 2011 and later it is multiplied by 100 to assign a quality rating scale q i for each parameter which is given as follows 2 q i c i s i 100 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i i 1 n s i i where q i is the rating based on the concentration of the ith parameter and sri is the sub index of the ith parameter finally the wqi is calculated using eq 4 4 4 statistical analysis 4 4 1 principal component analysis and factor analysis large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret principal component analysis pca is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 as a dimension reduction method pca projects the data into a new lower dimensional subspace original observations of possibly correlated variables are transformed into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components mechelli and vieira 2019 pca provides an approximation of a data table a data matrix x in terms of the product of two small matrices t and p these matrices t and p capture the essential data patterns of x kim 2018 wold et al 1987 it extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of the original variables the eigenvalues of the pcs are the measure of their associated variance the participation of original variables in the pcs is given by the loadings and the coordinates of the objects are called scores bhuiyan et al 2016 the principal components pc can be expressed as 5 z i j a i 1 x 1 j a i 2 x 2 j a i 3 x 3 j a i m x m j where z is the component score a is the component loading x is the measured value of the variable and is the component number j is the sample number and m is the total number of variables factor analysis is a statistical technique that seeks to identify a small number of latent factors accounting for relations between response variables kim 2018 the vital feature of this technique is to extract the pc which is a linear combination of the original variables and which can illustrate the maximum of the total variance the maximum residual variability is defined by the remaining factors patil et al 2020 the factors extracted are uncorrelated or orthogonal to each other the variances extracted by the factors are called the eigenvalues behera and das 2018 the factor extraction has been done with a minimum acceptable eigenvalue greater than 1 the factor loading matrix is rotated to an orthogonal simple structure according to varimax rotation which results in the maximization of the variance of the factor loading of the variables jayakumar and siraz 1997 the equation for fa is 6 z i j a f 1 f 1 i a f 2 f 2 i a f 3 f 3 i a f m f m i e f i where z is the measured variable a is the factor loading f is the factor score e is the residual term accounting for errors or other sources of variation i is the sample number and m is the total number of factors the terms strong moderate and weak as applied to factor loadings refer to absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively liu et al 2003 4 4 2 cluster analysis cluster analysis is an unsupervised pattern recognition technique that classifies the water samples and sampling sites into homogenous groups based on the nearness or similarity of the quality of water by uncovering intrinsic structure without making a priori assumptions about the data kumar et al 2020 routroy et al 2013 singh et al 2005 the dissimilarity among various water quality parameters and sampling stations is represented by a horizontal axis ward s linkage method with squared euclidean distance was used in this analysis egbueri 2020 two dendrogram was produced to show the quality groups of the water samples and physicochemical parameters the stations are clustered based on their chemical homogeneity in water samples gathered from various stations 4 4 3 pearson correlation matrix the detailed examination of the correlation matrix is advantageous as it shows the role of each parameter individually and their influence in the process of hydrochemistry patil et al 2020 in correlation analysis in groundwater studies a preliminary descriptive technique was employed on the groundwater from seven different samplings sited in the study area to measure the degree of association observed between any analyzed physicochemical variables rezaei et al 2019 a positive correlation r 0 indicates the changes in variables are uniform as one parameter increases others also increase while the negative correlation indicates the opposite changes in parameters the correlation is said to be positive when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other parameter and it is negative when an increase in one parameter causes a decrease in the other the correlation coefficient r has a value between 1 and 1 the correlation between the parameter is characterized as strong when it is in the range of 0 8 to 1 0 and 0 8 to 1 0 moderate when it is having a value of 0 5 to 0 8 and 0 5 to 0 8 weak when it is in the range of 0 0 to 0 5 and 0 0 to 0 5 behera and das 2018 5 results and discussion 5 1 physical parameter descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation and the major ion values are compared bis 2012 who 2011 are shown in table 1 to find the suitability of the groundwater samples collected for drinking purposes the ph is one of the most important parameters indicating drinking water suitability table 1 shows ph values vary from 8 6 to 9 4 exceeding the permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 per bis 2012 who 2011 for drinking purposes and 6 5 8 4 per ayers and westcot 1994 a higher value of ph indicates alkaline water which may be caused by due leaching process and improper irrigation pursuit a higher value of ph can increase the scale formation in water pipes during irrigation and also reduce the disinfection potential of chloride jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds are the two important interlinked parameters for water quality index in irrigation tds is the measurement of the total dissolved salts in water and the effect of the concentration of dissolved salts on soil and crops ec is a measure of the degree to which water conducts electricity shah et al 2018a 2018b if tds is less than 1000 mg l then water is considered fresh and for higher values 1000 mg l of tds the suitability of water will decrease gradually for drinking purposes todd 1980 westcott and ayers 1984 classify water as suitable for irrigation purposes if tds 450 mg l ec 700 μs cm and unsuitable for tds 2000 mg l ec 3000 μs cm according to who standards the maximum desirable extent of tds is 500 mg l who 2011 when an abundant amount of salt is accumulated in the soil it halts the generation of crops jain et al 2011 table 1 shows the amount of tds and ec ranging from 18 72 to 410 mg l and 388 07 611 94 μ s cm which falls under the permissible limit for drinking and irrigation purposes the magnesium and calcium ions in water are measured to speculate the suitability of water and its hardness these ions are present in a prolific amount in groundwater and exist predominately as bicarbonates and also present as sulfates and chlorides in shred amounts logeshkumaran et al 2015 table 1 shows the amount of ca2 and mg2 varies between 1 and 2 mg l in the water samples which is less than the maximum permissible amount bis 2012 who 2011 table 1 shows the amount of na and k varies from 10 to 125 mg l and 0 81 2 5 mg l respectively indicating suitable content of sodium and potassium ions in water for drinking purposes as per who standards who 2011 in our case we found that na is the dominant cation the concentration of na is higher than that of ca 2 which indicates that the process of ion exchange has taken place between ca 2 and na ions due to the infiltration of water which has been previously exposed to igneous or evaporite rock hem 1985 these cations are released from silicate and carbonate mineral weathering enhanced by respired co2 from oxic and anoxic organic matter degradation mudzielwana et al 2020 ayers and westcot 1994 classify water based on the degree of restriction on use for the concentration of na less than 69 mg l doesn t affect crop production between 69 and 207 mg l will have a slight to moderate effect on the crop production and more than 207 mg l will severely affect crop production and so it should not be utilized for crop production the concentration of na from two sampling sites bara palasi and tantoli have less than 69 mg l while the remaining samples have na concentrations between 69 and 207 mg l almost all the samples are suitable for irrigation purposes with additional treatment to reduce na concentration the amount of co3 2 and hco3 ions in water obtained from hot springs are about 26 75 mg l and 24 420 mg l respectively as shown in table 1 the concentration of bicarbonate does not exceed the maximum permissible amount as per bis 2012 the amount of carbonate chiefly prevails between 40 and 50 mg l in 50 of the total samples of water in barapalasi a the study shows a high amount of bicarbonate 420 mg l while in other hot springs the bicarbonate ranges between 24 and 90 mg l the chloride in groundwater may be from diverse sources such as weathering leaching of sedimentary rocks and soil and domestic and municipal efﬂuents prasanth et al 2012 ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if hco3 is less than 91 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if hco3 is between 91 5 and 518 5 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production if hco 3is more than 518 5 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production a water sample from barapalasi a has hco 3 420 mg l in contrast the rest other samples have less than 91 5 mg l showing all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of hco 3 and are suitable for irrigation purposes chloride is not adsorbed or stored by soil so it moves quickly with soil water is consumed by the crop travels in the transpiration stream and is deposited in the leaves when the concentration of chloride in the leaves surpasses the tolerance of the crop signs of injury occur such as leaf burn or leaf tissue drying ayers and westcot 1994 the concentration of chloride ions in water ranges from 30 to 88 mg l as shown in table 1 the chloride concentration in water of the present study area does not exceed the maximum permissible concentration of chloride ions in drinkable water which is 250 mg l as per the world health organization bis 2012 who 2011 the concentration of chloride ions in water samples from the present study area doesn t exceed the permissible limit for the growth of strawberry grape avocado and citrus ayers and westcot 1994 the water sample containing sulphur can prompt adverse effects on the human body the maximum permissible content of sulphur in drinkable water is 200 250 mg l as per who and bis standards the amount of sulphur in water from the present study area is in the range of 0 01 mg l to 39 mg l as shown in table 1 which lies beneath the maximum permissible limit bis 2012 who 2011 blue baby syndrome and gastric cancer are attributed to the existence of nitrate ions in the water sample no3 concentration of the water samples varies between 0 1 and 0 25 mg l as shown in table 1 which lies within the maximum permissible amount of no3 ion in water samples viz 45 mg l bis 2012 who 2011 ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if no3 is less than 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if no3 is between 5 and 30 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production and if no3 is more than 30 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of no3 for irrigation purposes the amount of boron b in water from hot springs remains uniform and its concentration in water is 0 5 mg l as shown in table 1 the borate content of surface water can be significantly increased as a result of wastewater discharges because borate compounds are ingredients of domestic washing agents who 2011 the boron content in water from hot springs does not exceed the maximum permissible limit of 0 5 mg l as per bis 2012 most signs of crop toxicity arise after concentrations of boron in the leaves reach 250 mg kg to 300 mg kg ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if b 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if b 5 30 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production and if b 30 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of boron for irrigation purposes in groundwater the concentration of fluoride in underground water varies with different rock types epa 1985 the amount of fluoride in the water of the present study area ranges between 9 and 16 mg l as shown in table 1 exceeding the maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l as per bis 2012 fluoride doesn t cause a significant effect on water quality for irrigation purposes total hardness th of water samples ranges in trace amounts between 4 and 9 mg l as per table 1 which does not exceed a maximum limit of 200 mg l as per bis 2012 th doesn t cause a significant effect on crop production the maximum permissible amount of total hardness for potable water is 500 mg l and the most favorable amount is 100 mg l as per the who standard the water surpassing 300 mg l in total hardness is appraised as very hard logeshkumaran et al 2015 in the present water sample the water can be considered favorable for drinking 5 2 groundwater quality assessment for drinking purposes water quality index for each water sample is calculated and presented in table 2 wqi of water samples ranges from 27 33 to 38 55 the water sample having wqi 50 is considered excellent 50 to 100 as good 101 to 200 as poor 201 to 300 as very poor and wqi 301 is regarded as unsuitable for drinking purposes adimalla et al 2018 kumari and rai 2020 logeshkumaran et al 2015 based on the wqi value see table 2 all the water samples fall under excellent type for drinking purposes this suggests that water available from the sampling sites can be used without modification for drinking purposes 5 3 groundwater quality assessment for irrigation purposes the permeability of sedimentary rocks is greatly reduced by groundwater due to a high proportion of sodium ions present in water cations like ca2 and mg2 when replaced by na in water cause dispersion of clay particles and its expansion due to abundant sodium ions present between layers of clay minerals creating an adverse effect on soil framework by destroying the permeability of soil antony et al 2020 arveti et al 2011 dexter 2004 kelley 1951 khangembam and kshetrimayum 2019 kumar et al 2016 raju 1992 this indicates that the concentration of sodium is essential for classification in irrigation water quality to understand the effect of major chemical ions on rock permeability and groundwater for irrigation purposes sar rsc na kr and pi are computed for all the water samples and represented in table 2 sar is calculated to understand sodium proportion relative to calcium and magnesium ions sodium hazard is highest for s4 while the lowest for s1 and c1 c2 c3 c4 for salinity hazard water with sar 10 is appraised as magnificent for irrigation purposes allison and richards 1954 sar value ranges from 1 69 to 21 13 see table 2 hence they are a moderate water sample for irrigation purposes rsc methods are used to determine the adverse effects of carbonates and bicarbonates on the suitability of water for irrigation and agricultural activities ahamed et al 2013 water is safe to utilize in irrigation activities for rsc 1 25 meq l moderate for rsc between 1 25 and 2 5 meq l and unsuitable for irrigation if rsc 2 50 meq l allison and richards 1954 table 2 shows five water samples that have rsc values between 1 25 and 2 5 and are considered moderate for irrigation the rest two water samples have rsc values of more than 2 5 hence they are unsuitable for irrigation the percentage of sodium ranges between 76 67 and 97 62 see table 2 a graph of na versus ec suggests that four water samples fall under permissible to doubtful and three samples fall under doubtful to suitable category type for irrigation kelley 1951 proposed a technique based on kelly s ratio to analyze the trouble caused by sodium in irrigation activity kelly s ratio 1 is a measure of good quality of water for irrigation whereas the above one is peculiar to unsuitability for agricultural purposes due to alkali hazards karanth 1987 the calculated kelly s ratio for the present study area ranges from 3 29 to 41 08 see table 2 which indicates the unsuitability of water for irrigation purposes the classification of water into three classes is carried out by the water from the present study has moderate to high permeability ranging from 111 85 to 180 04 table 2 all the samples fall under class iii see fig 2 which shows that they have 25 maximum permeability and are unsuitable for irrigation purposes 5 4 statistical approach 5 4 1 principal component analysis and factor analysis fig 3 shows the scree plot of 18 factor components showing the contribution of individual factors on variance and a bivariate plot of f1 and f2 principal components table 3 factor analysis of groundwater chemical variables produced three principal components accounting for 99 16 see table 4 of the total variance of the data set the factor i accounts for 71 31 of the total variance attributed to strong positive pc loadings of ph tds k ec strong negative pc loading of hco3 total hard ca moderate positive pc loading of cl sio2 and moderate negative pc loading of f and co3 see table 4 it can be ascribed to the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater geological medium interaction strong loading of potassium calcium carbonates and bicarbonate attributed to factor 1 to ion exchange processes in the aquifer system and contribution to natural weathering of rock minerals as reported by earlier researchers also kumar et al 2006 machiwal and jha 2015 strong loadings of ph and bicarbonate ions indicate the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals factor 2 accounts for 15 316 see table 4 of the total variance and is characterized by strong to moderate positive loading of sio2 no3 and strong negative loading of na see table 4 na and sio2 show strong loading can be attributed to the fresh silicate weathering from the surface soils due to high alkalinity factor 3 accounts for 12 52 of the total variance which is described by moderate positive loading of no3 co3 cl na tds and strong negative loading of total fe table moderate to strong loadings of no3 and total fe in factor 3 is attributed to anthropogenic activities 5 4 2 descriptive statistics and pearson s correlation matrix the results of the correlation matrices for 7 water samples from the present study area taking 14 physiochemical variables are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 tds has strong correlation with k 0 99 cl 0 91 and ec 0 99 ph has strong negative correlation with f 0 89 and strong positive correlation with tds 0 87 and ec 0 91 this depicts that ph increases with an increase in tds and ec th has a strong positive correlation with f 0 94 and it is negatively correlated with ph 0 97 tds 0 91 and ec 0 93 cl has very strong positive correlation with k 0 92 weak positive correlation with mg2 0 27 so4 2 0 37 and moderate correlation with na 0 55 and ca2 0 69 indicates these parameters has mixed source of the origin rezaei et al 2020 moderate to the strong correlation of th with ca2 0 99 hco3 0 69 k 0 91 and cl 0 72 indicates that these major ions strongly influence th of water samples the hardness of water has a positive correlation with mg2 and ca2 which suggests that the hardness of water increases with an increase in calcium and magnesium ions the increase in calcium and magnesium ions in the water will form their respective insoluble carbonates or sulfates increasing the hardness of the water electrical conductivity has a positive correlation with tds sodium potassium and chloride ion which depicts that as the salinity of water increases its electrical conductivity increases the increase in salinity can be the result of ionic concentration increasing due to the evaporation of recharge water shah et al 2018a 2018b the correlation of ca2 with major chemical ions is weak to strong mg2 0 3 na 0 07 k 0 88 so4 2 0 31 and cl 0 69 the moderate correlation of ca2 with mg2 and cl are indications of carbonate dissolution al numanbakth et al 2019 ec and hco3 have a negative correlation of 0 68 signifying the mineralization of groundwater antony et al 2020 fig 4 clearly shows that mg is not correlating with other parameters and shows a constant trend in the scatter plot so4 2 and na k show a negative correlation and ca2 shows a positive correlation with hco3 co3 2 ca2 shows a positive correlation with hco3 co3 2 which supports the observation from the correlation matrix 5 4 3 cluster analysis in the present investigation dendrograms are constructed for various water constituents fig 5 and sampling stations fig 6 the linkage diagram for two parameters which is close to zero suggests that the two parameters are strongly correlated and carry the minimum degree of variation as compared to other hierarchical heights fig 5 shows a dendrogram linking various physicochemical parameters for seven water samples from fig 5 it is concluded that ca2 mg2 k and no3 ions are strongly correlated with each other conductivity and tds have minimum variation in quantity the degree of variation for tds and conductivity with other parameters is extremely high so the fluctuation in salinity is to be measured occasionally to ensure proper utilization of water in irrigation fig 6 shows a dendrogram linking different sampling stations based on variation in the chemical composition of the respective water sample it is revealed from fig 6 that kharkunda and agnikunda bara palasi cl and bara palasi a have a strong resemblance in terms of their chemical parameters while the former cluster varies strongly with the latter cluster tantloi shows a better correlation with agnikund and kharkunda hot springs 6 comparison with previous studies investigation of water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes has been carried out by several authors abbasnia et al 2019 akhtar et al 2020 aksever et al 2016 alam et al 2012 hassen et al 2016 li et al 2016 rufino et al 2019 the present study combines the practical approach of several authors work bhuiyan et al 2016 kim 2018 patil et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 jasrotia et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2013 maity et al 2017 muñoz et al 2015 to provide an integrated suitability analysis of physicochemical properties of water for irrigation and drinking purposes along with extending the study to source identification of water samples extensive investigation of pca and factor analysis has been carried out on water physicochemical parameters by several authors and geochemical influences have been discussed the results of pca analysis carried out by patil et al 2020 indicate mineralization of geological facies and dissolution of soil elements through water seeping the effect of salinization and silicate mineral weathering was investigated to be a significant component in the geochemical mixing of groundwater through pca analysis bhuiyan et al 2016 trabelsi and zouari 2019 the present study has shown that the dissolution of silicate minerals has played a vital role in groundwater chemical mixing understanding the mechanism of groundwater chemistry is essential to knowing the prevailing conditions during migration ismail et al 2020 logeshkumaran et al 2015 patil et al 2020 sunkari et al 2019 have constructed gibbs plot for investigation on groundwater and found most of the water samples to be under the influence of rock dominance while few samples fall under evaporation dominance in the present study area all the water samples fall under rock dominance which is supported by studies of several authors several authors have investigated hydro facies of water samples by generating trabelsi and zouari 2019 have prepared a piper plot of groundwater available from north eastern tunisia and found that most of the water samples are na cl types indication na and cl to be dominating cation and anion respectively al numanbakth et al 2019 have investigated groundwater from maddhapara northwest bangladesh and found out that most of the water samples fall under mg hco3 type and mixed type groundwater from perambalur district tamilnadu south india has been appraised by ahamed et al 2013 and it was concluded that water mainly falls under na cl type ca hco3 type and ca mg hco3 mixed type indicating the interactions among na mg2 and cl hco3 ions thermal water from deep well present in bolivian altiplano are major of na cl and na cl hco3 type while geothermal systems of western anatolia turkey shows na hco3 type water coming from deep wells and ca hco3 type water coming from hot spring bundschuh et al 2013 muñoz et al 2015 the present study suggests that three water samples fall under the na cl type while four samples fall under the na hco3 type indicating na to be dominating cation while cl and hco3 to be dominating anions in groundwater which shows a similar trend to previous studies al numanbakth et al 2019 haritash et al 2016 determined that most of the water samples fall under the s4 c1 type showing the high suitability for irrigation purposes the present study shows that the salinity doesn t vary but na varies for different water samples three water samples fall under s3 c2 two samples fall under s1 c2 while the remaining two fall under s1 c2 and s4 c2 the comparison with previous studies suggests that the results obtained are similar to other studies and gives a complete analysis of groundwater for irrigation and drinking purpose along with an extended investigation of source identification of water samples 7 conclusion the present investigation focuses on the geochemical properties of water available from bakreshwar tantloi hot springs to measure its sustainability for drinking and irrigation purposes the water from the current study area is appraised by following standard norms given by the world health organization and the bureau of indian standards water quality index wqi values reveal that the water is excellent for drinking purposes statistical investigation reveals natural weathering of minerals and reverses ion exchange among chemical ions pertained in the aquifer system which supports na replacing co3 2 and hco3 ions and thereby disturbing the rock permeability and quality of water for irrigation purposes pca analysis has shown that silicate weathering and dissolution prevailed and affected the geochemistry of groundwater sar na pi and ki results suggest that water from hot springs requires special techniques such as deionization and reverse osmosis to minimize its sodium content to utilize water for sustainable irrigation moreover nano filtration membranes could be utilized to remove arsenic from water the desalination process could be carried out with renewable energy sources which will prevent excess usage of nonrenewable energy resources as bakreshwar and tantloi are geothermal fields the water can be used in geothermal plants such as bktpp bakreshwar thermal power plant which is currently running on the bakreshwar river near bakreshwar hot springs the present research paper will be useful in upcoming irrigation projects in the birbhum district such as the mayurakshi river project and the hinglow river project and also for suitable crop selection authors contribution all the authors make a substantial

relatively small leaves shortened stature and sometimes very few leaves shannon and grieve 1998 coca et al 2012 studied the influence of salinity on onion growth production and quality specifications and concluded that excessive concentration levels of nacl were explicitly characterized by an increase in tds and a significant reduction in onion pyruvic acid content shannon and grieve 1998 as well as evaluated plant susceptibility and its tolerance to salinity groundwater can be desalinated using renewable energy sources and by using various nano filtration membranes to make it suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes tomaszewska et al 2021 jarma et al 2021 and the present study focuses on investigating the physical and chemical parameters of water samples to reveal its suitability

ca2 mg2 etc the relative composition of such elements defines various properties of the groundwater such as hardness alkalinity acidity etc and helps us decide whether they are competent enough to meet the drinking and irrigation standards statistical analysis like a correlation matrix is performed to determine the distribution of ion concentration in water samples the water quality index wqi is calculated for different water samples which helped us in determining the sustainability of water for drinking purposes sar rsc na kr and pi are computed to identify the water quality for

and groundwater flow mineral precipitation dissolution prolonged storage in the aquifer exchange and adsorption desorption gas exsolution dissolution recent studies have also shown that land use and urbanization have an impact on hydrochemistry implying that groundwater resources must be assessed and managed effectively according to water quality surveys farmers in semi arid and dry regions continue to utilize water that would otherwise be deemed unfit according to several scientific institutions criteria as a result in irrigation areas it is necessary to assess the aquifers potential for groundwater pollution groundwater quality deteriorates in two ways first as a result of geochemical processes in aquifers and soils and second as a result of inappropriate canals drainages used for irrigation as a result a frequent assessment of irrigation and drinking water quality is required irrigation necessitates an adequate quantity of useable water the index which is based on the composition and concentration of dissolved components in water can be used to determine its suitability for agricultural use the nature of the mineral components in the water as well as their effects on the soil and plants determine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation the excess of salts affects plant growth by restoring plant uptake capacity due to complex changes arising from osmotic processes todd 1980 in general water quality parameters major cations such as na ca2 mg2 k and anions cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 and heavy metals are indicators of drinking water consumption while water quality indices such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage ssp na residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity ra kellys ratio kr or kellys index ki permeability index pi chloro alkali indices cai1 and cai2 potential salinity ps magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar total dissolved solids tds and total hardness th based on primary water quality parameters are commonly used to determine water quality for irrigation 2 related works shah et al 2018a 2018b has recorded the water quality experiments in the dholera district in gujarat groundwater samples were taken from shallow geothermal wells scattered around the dholera district ph total dissolved salts tds na k ca2 mg2 f hco3 cl and so42 were measured in samples taken from nine geothermal wells and their distribution was charted using geographic distribution contours the levels of na cl tds and ec were discovered to be exceptionally high than the acceptable limit from the numerous graphs shown after the tests and data were collected in the capital city of iraq bagdad alsaqqar et al 2014 has collected a water sample from the industrial to see whether it is suitable for drinking purposes or not temperature alkalinity as mg l caco3 calcium mg l as ca ph and total dissolved solids tds mg l for different samples from wtps in baghdad city were investigated as water quality parameters related to chemical stability the chemical stability of water was assessed using two water quality indices the langelier saturation index lsi and the ryznar stability index rsi the data collected shows that the water contains corrosive particles and tds is also high ranging from 410 to 696 5 mg l with an average of 541 53 mg l the goal of this study was to look at the hydrochemical mechanisms that influence groundwater chemistry and to use water quality indicators to estimate the acceptability of springs and groundwater for irrigation and drinking by sappa et al 2015 in italy hydrochemical na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 as well as physical ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids properties of water chemical characteristics such as sodium adsorption ratio sar total hardness mg hazard mh sodium percentage na percent salinity hazard permeability index and kelly s ratio were derived based on the analytical data to assess the water quality except for the samples impacted by saltwater and heightened water rock interaction the findings of hydrochemical studies and computed water quality parameters indicated that most of the water samples are appropriate for irrigation and consumption at certain locations high salinity na percent sar and mh levels limit their appropriateness for agricultural purposes soylak et al 2002 researched water quality in yozgat and the surrounding area in turkey the chemical and physical parameters of the water samples were determined using standard procedures the results of the experiment showed a lot of variation but in the end the concentrations of investigated parameters in yozgat drinking water samples were within the permissible limits of the world health organization drinking water quality guidelines and the turkish authorities water pollution control regulation 3 study area bakreshwar has situated north westerly in the birbhum district of west bengal with an average altitude of 84 12 m fig 1 depicts the map of the sampling locations bakreshwar hot spring site is located at 23 88 n 87 37 e with an average temperature of 71 celcius there are likely ten significant hot springs in bakreshwar mukherjee et al

temperature ranges between 48 and 70 c it comes under the national helium conservation program so periodic assessment of helium in water is carried out mukhopadhyay and sarolkar 2012 two significant rivers surround bakreshwar and tantloi namely ajay and mayurakshi ajay river passes through jharkhand and infiltrates west bengal at simjuri bhattacharya et al 1997 while mayurakshi passes through jharkhand and then past by birbhum district of west bengal mayurakshi river contributes water to masanjore dam reservoir which has provided around 2400 km2 of fertile land claxton 2007 small water bodies such as the bakreshwar river and nil nirjan lake contribute water to bakreshwar dam and bakreshwar thermal power plant talha one of the hot springs in tantoli is located near betla national park which is constructed under project tiger rajvanshi 2012 4 materials and methods 4 1 sample collection and analytical procedures representative water samples from various locations were collected for laboratory analysis raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with nitric acid was reduced to ph 2 for the determination of cationic concentrations the preservation of samples was critical to reducing the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the laboratory where all the chemical tests were carried out to obtain concentration values standard apha methods were used to determine the concentrations of cl so4 2 f ca2 mg2 hco3 b ar3 fe2 si4 pb2 and ni2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms has been used for the analysis of sr2 cs rb and ba2 to determine the na and k content a flame photometric was used the limits of detection for all the instruments are 1 μ l to 1 mg l analytical precision for major ions was within 1 for all water samples ion balance errors ibe were 10 and most of them were 5 4 2 pre treatment of data the lack of complete datasets for some of the measured parameters necessitated data pre treatment the multiple imputation method was used with a total of 5 imputations to generate the missing outputs takahashi 2017 4 3 suitability for drinking purposes 4 3 1 computation of the water quality index wqi to get a broad picture of the groundwater quality for drinking purposes wqi is one of the best tools which work effectively wqi is well stated as a score displaying the combined impact of various quality factors of groundwater horton 1965 kumari and rai 2020 li and wu 2019 the derivation of wqi involves weight assignment for each parameter normalization of the weights standardization of the parameters calculation of individual wqi scores and aggregation of the scores adimalla et al 2020 el baba et al 2020 to calculate the wqi the weight has been assigned for the physicochemical parameters according to the parameter s relative importance in the overall quality of water for drinking water purposes the assigned weight ranges from 1 to 5 the maximum weight of 5 has been allocated for nitrate and tds 4 for ph ec so42 3 for hco3 cl 2 for ca2 na k and weight 1 assigned for magnesium patil et al 2020 the relative weight wi is computed from the following equation 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is defined as the weight of each parameter and n is total the number of parameters the concentration of all parameters of each water sample is divided by its corresponding standard as per the rules laid down in the world health organisation who 2011 and later it is multiplied by 100 to assign a quality rating scale q i for each parameter which is given as follows 2 q i c i s i 100 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i i 1 n s i i where q i is the rating based on the concentration of the ith parameter and sri is the sub index of the ith parameter finally the wqi is calculated using eq 4 4 4 statistical analysis 4 4 1 principal component analysis and factor analysis large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret principal component analysis pca is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 as a dimension reduction method pca projects the data into a new lower dimensional subspace original observations of possibly correlated variables are transformed into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components mechelli and vieira 2019 pca provides an approximation of a data table a data matrix x in terms of the product of two small matrices t and p these matrices t and p capture the essential data patterns of x kim 2018 wold et al 1987 it extracts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of the original variables the eigenvalues of the pcs are the measure of their associated variance the participation of original variables in the pcs is given by the loadings and the coordinates of the objects are called scores bhuiyan et al 2016 the principal components pc can be expressed as 5 z i j a i 1 x 1 j a i 2 x 2 j a i 3 x 3 j a i m x m j where z is the component score a is the component loading x is the measured value of the variable and is the component number j is the sample number and m is the total number of variables factor analysis is a statistical technique that seeks to identify a small number of latent factors accounting for relations between response variables kim 2018 the vital feature of this technique is to extract the pc which is a linear combination of the original variables and which can illustrate the maximum of the total variance the maximum residual variability is defined by the remaining factors patil et al 2020 the factors extracted are uncorrelated or orthogonal to each other the variances extracted by the factors are called the eigenvalues behera and das 2018 the factor extraction has been done with a minimum acceptable eigenvalue greater than 1 the factor loading matrix is rotated to an orthogonal simple structure according to varimax rotation which results in the maximization of the variance of the factor loading of the variables jayakumar and siraz 1997 the equation for fa is 6 z i j a f 1 f 1 i a f 2 f 2 i a f 3 f 3 i a f m f m i e f i where z is the measured variable a is the factor loading f is the factor score e is the residual term accounting for errors or other sources of variation i is the sample number and m is the total number of factors the terms strong moderate and weak as applied to factor loadings refer to absolute loading values of 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 respectively liu et al 2003 4 4 2 cluster analysis cluster analysis is an unsupervised pattern recognition technique that classifies the water samples and sampling sites into homogenous groups based on the nearness or similarity of the quality of water by uncovering intrinsic structure without making a priori assumptions about the data kumar et al 2020 routroy et al 2013 singh et al 2005 the dissimilarity among various water quality parameters and sampling stations is represented by a horizontal axis ward s linkage method with squared euclidean distance was used in this analysis egbueri 2020 two dendrogram was produced to show the quality groups of the water samples and physicochemical parameters the stations are clustered based on their chemical homogeneity in water samples gathered from various stations 4 4 3 pearson correlation matrix the detailed examination of the correlation matrix is advantageous as it shows the role of each parameter individually and their influence in the process of hydrochemistry patil et al 2020 in correlation analysis in groundwater studies a preliminary descriptive technique was employed on the groundwater from seven different samplings sited in the study area to measure the degree of association observed between any analyzed physicochemical variables rezaei et al 2019 a positive correlation r 0 indicates the changes in variables are uniform as one parameter increases others also increase while the negative correlation indicates the opposite changes in parameters the correlation is said to be positive when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other parameter and it is negative when an increase in one parameter causes a decrease in the other the correlation coefficient r has a value between 1 and 1 the correlation between the parameter is characterized as strong when it is in the range of 0 8 to 1 0 and 0 8 to 1 0 moderate when it is having a value of 0 5 to 0 8 and 0 5 to 0 8 weak when it is in the range of 0 0 to 0 5 and 0 0 to 0 5 behera and das 2018 5 results and discussion 5 1 physical parameter descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation and the major ion values are compared bis 2012 who 2011 are shown in table 1 to find the suitability of the groundwater samples collected for drinking purposes the ph is one of the most important parameters indicating drinking water suitability table 1 shows ph values vary from 8 6 to 9 4 exceeding the permissible limit of 6 5 8 5 per bis 2012 who 2011 for drinking purposes and 6 5 8 4 per ayers and westcot 1994 a higher value of ph indicates alkaline water which may be caused by due leaching process and improper irrigation pursuit a higher value of ph can increase the scale formation in water pipes during irrigation and also reduce the disinfection potential of chloride jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds are the two important interlinked parameters for water quality index in irrigation tds is the measurement of the total dissolved salts in water and the effect of the concentration of dissolved salts on soil and crops ec is a measure of the degree to which water conducts electricity shah et al 2018a 2018b if tds is less than 1000 mg l then water is considered fresh and for higher values 1000 mg l of tds the suitability of water will decrease gradually for drinking purposes todd 1980 westcott and ayers 1984 classify water as suitable for irrigation purposes if tds 450 mg l ec 700 μs cm and unsuitable for tds 2000 mg l ec 3000 μs cm according to who standards the maximum desirable extent of tds is 500 mg l who 2011 when an abundant amount of salt is accumulated in the soil it halts the generation of crops jain et al 2011 table 1 shows the amount of tds and ec ranging from 18 72 to 410 mg l and 388 07 611 94 μ s cm which falls under the permissible limit for drinking and irrigation purposes the magnesium and calcium ions in water are measured to speculate the suitability of water and its hardness these ions are present in a prolific amount in groundwater and exist predominately as bicarbonates and also present as sulfates and chlorides in shred amounts logeshkumaran et al 2015 table 1 shows the amount of ca2 and mg2 varies between 1 and 2 mg l in the water samples which is less than the maximum permissible amount bis 2012 who 2011 table 1 shows the amount of na and k varies from 10 to 125 mg l and 0 81 2 5 mg l respectively indicating suitable content of sodium and potassium ions in water for drinking purposes as per who standards who 2011 in our case we found that na is the dominant cation the concentration of na is higher than that of ca 2 which indicates that the process of ion exchange has taken place between ca 2 and na ions due to the infiltration of water which has been previously exposed to igneous or evaporite rock hem 1985 these cations are released from silicate and carbonate mineral weathering enhanced by respired co2 from oxic and anoxic organic matter degradation mudzielwana et al 2020 ayers and westcot 1994 classify water based on the degree of restriction on use for the concentration of na less than 69 mg l doesn t affect crop production between 69 and 207 mg l will have a slight to moderate effect on the crop production and more than 207 mg l will severely affect crop production and so it should not be utilized for crop production the concentration of na from two sampling sites bara palasi and tantoli have less than 69 mg l while the remaining samples have na concentrations between 69 and 207 mg l almost all the samples are suitable for irrigation purposes with additional treatment to reduce na concentration the amount of co3 2 and hco3 ions in water obtained from hot springs are about 26 75 mg l and 24 420 mg l respectively as shown in table 1 the concentration of bicarbonate does not exceed the maximum permissible amount as per bis 2012 the amount of carbonate chiefly prevails between 40 and 50 mg l in 50 of the total samples of water in barapalasi a the study shows a high amount of bicarbonate 420 mg l while in other hot springs the bicarbonate ranges between 24 and 90 mg l the chloride in groundwater may be from diverse sources such as weathering leaching of sedimentary rocks and soil and domestic and municipal efﬂuents prasanth et al 2012 ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if hco3 is less than 91 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if hco3 is between 91 5 and 518 5 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production if hco 3is more than 518 5 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production a water sample from barapalasi a has hco 3 420 mg l in contrast the rest other samples have less than 91 5 mg l showing all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of hco 3 and are suitable for irrigation purposes chloride is not adsorbed or stored by soil so it moves quickly with soil water is consumed by the crop travels in the transpiration stream and is deposited in the leaves when the concentration of chloride in the leaves surpasses the tolerance of the crop signs of injury occur such as leaf burn or leaf tissue drying ayers and westcot 1994 the concentration of chloride ions in water ranges from 30 to 88 mg l as shown in table 1 the chloride concentration in water of the present study area does not exceed the maximum permissible concentration of chloride ions in drinkable water which is 250 mg l as per the world health organization bis 2012 who 2011 the concentration of chloride ions in water samples from the present study area doesn t exceed the permissible limit for the growth of strawberry grape avocado and citrus ayers and westcot 1994 the water sample containing sulphur can prompt adverse effects on the human body the maximum permissible content of sulphur in drinkable water is 200 250 mg l as per who and bis standards the amount of sulphur in water from the present study area is in the range of 0 01 mg l to 39 mg l as shown in table 1 which lies beneath the maximum permissible limit bis 2012 who 2011 blue baby syndrome and gastric cancer are attributed to the existence of nitrate ions in the water sample no3 concentration of the water samples varies between 0 1 and 0 25 mg l as shown in table 1 which lies within the maximum permissible amount of no3 ion in water samples viz 45 mg l bis 2012 who 2011 ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if no3 is less than 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if no3 is between 5 and 30 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production and if no3 is more than 30 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of no3 for irrigation purposes the amount of boron b in water from hot springs remains uniform and its concentration in water is 0 5 mg l as shown in table 1 the borate content of surface water can be significantly increased as a result of wastewater discharges because borate compounds are ingredients of domestic washing agents who 2011 the boron content in water from hot springs does not exceed the maximum permissible limit of 0 5 mg l as per bis 2012 most signs of crop toxicity arise after concentrations of boron in the leaves reach 250 mg kg to 300 mg kg ayers and westcot 1994 have classified the degree of restriction on the use of water if b 5 mg l it won t affect crop production if b 5 30 mg l it will have a slight to moderate effect on crop production and if b 30 mg l it will cause severe damage to crop production all the water samples fall under the permissible limit of boron for irrigation purposes in groundwater the concentration of fluoride in underground water varies with different rock types epa 1985 the amount of fluoride in the water of the present study area ranges between 9 and 16 mg l as shown in table 1 exceeding the maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l as per bis 2012 fluoride doesn t cause a significant effect on water quality for irrigation purposes total hardness th of water samples ranges in trace amounts between 4 and 9 mg l as per table 1 which does not exceed a maximum limit of 200 mg l as per bis 2012 th doesn t cause a significant effect on crop production the maximum permissible amount of total hardness for potable water is 500 mg l and the most favorable amount is 100 mg l as per the who standard the water surpassing 300 mg l in total hardness is appraised as very hard logeshkumaran et al 2015 in the present water sample the water can be considered favorable for drinking 5 2 groundwater quality assessment for drinking purposes water quality index for each water sample is calculated and presented in table 2 wqi of water samples ranges from 27 33 to 38 55 the water sample having wqi 50 is considered excellent 50 to 100 as good 101 to 200 as poor 201 to 300 as very poor and wqi 301 is regarded as unsuitable for drinking purposes adimalla et al 2018 kumari and rai 2020 logeshkumaran et al 2015 based on the wqi value see table 2 all the water samples fall under excellent type for drinking purposes this suggests that water available from the sampling sites can be used without modification for drinking purposes 5 3 groundwater quality assessment for irrigation purposes the permeability of sedimentary rocks is greatly reduced by groundwater due to a high proportion of sodium ions present in water cations like ca2 and mg2 when replaced by na in water cause dispersion of clay particles and its expansion due to abundant sodium ions present between layers of clay minerals creating an adverse effect on soil framework by destroying the permeability of soil antony et al 2020 arveti et al 2011 dexter 2004 kelley 1951 khangembam and kshetrimayum 2019 kumar et al 2016 raju 1992 this indicates that the concentration of sodium is essential for classification in irrigation water quality to understand the effect of major chemical ions on rock permeability and groundwater for irrigation purposes sar rsc na kr and pi are computed for all the water samples and represented in table 2 sar is calculated to understand sodium proportion relative to calcium and magnesium ions sodium hazard is highest for s4 while the lowest for s1 and c1 c2 c3 c4 for salinity hazard water with sar 10 is appraised as magnificent for irrigation purposes allison and richards 1954 sar value ranges from 1 69 to 21 13 see table 2 hence they are a moderate water sample for irrigation purposes rsc methods are used to determine the adverse effects of carbonates and bicarbonates on the suitability of water for irrigation and agricultural activities ahamed et al 2013 water is safe to utilize in irrigation activities for rsc 1 25 meq l moderate for rsc between 1 25 and 2 5 meq l and unsuitable for irrigation if rsc 2 50 meq l allison and richards 1954 table 2 shows five water samples that have rsc values between 1 25 and 2 5 and are considered moderate for irrigation the rest two water samples have rsc values of more than 2 5 hence they are unsuitable for irrigation the percentage of sodium ranges between 76 67 and 97 62 see table 2 a graph of na versus ec suggests that four water samples fall under permissible to doubtful and three samples fall under doubtful to suitable category type for irrigation kelley 1951 proposed a technique based on kelly s ratio to analyze the trouble caused by sodium in irrigation activity kelly s ratio 1 is a measure of good quality of water for irrigation whereas the above one is peculiar to unsuitability for agricultural purposes due to alkali hazards karanth 1987 the calculated kelly s ratio for the present study area ranges from 3 29 to 41 08 see table 2 which indicates the unsuitability of water for irrigation purposes the classification of water into three classes is carried out by the water from the present study has moderate to high permeability ranging from 111 85 to 180 04 table 2 all the samples fall under class iii see fig 2 which shows that they have 25 maximum permeability and are unsuitable for irrigation purposes 5 4 statistical approach 5 4 1 principal component analysis and factor analysis fig 3 shows the scree plot of 18 factor components showing the contribution of individual factors on variance and a bivariate plot of f1 and f2 principal components table 3 factor analysis of groundwater chemical variables produced three principal components accounting for 99 16 see table 4 of the total variance of the data set the factor i accounts for 71 31 of the total variance attributed to strong positive pc loadings of ph tds k ec strong negative pc loading of hco3 total hard ca moderate positive pc loading of cl sio2 and moderate negative pc loading of f and co3 see table 4 it can be ascribed to the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater geological medium interaction strong loading of potassium calcium carbonates and bicarbonate attributed to factor 1 to ion exchange processes in the aquifer system and contribution to natural weathering of rock minerals as reported by earlier researchers also kumar et al 2006 machiwal and jha 2015 strong loadings of ph and bicarbonate ions indicate the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals factor 2 accounts for 15 316 see table 4 of the total variance and is characterized by strong to moderate positive loading of sio2 no3 and strong negative loading of na see table 4 na and sio2 show strong loading can be attributed to the fresh silicate weathering from the surface soils due to high alkalinity factor 3 accounts for 12 52 of the total variance which is described by moderate positive loading of no3 co3 cl na tds and strong negative loading of total fe table moderate to strong loadings of no3 and total fe in factor 3 is attributed to anthropogenic activities 5 4 2 descriptive statistics and pearson s correlation matrix the results of the correlation matrices for 7 water samples from the present study area taking 14 physiochemical variables are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 tds has strong correlation with k 0 99 cl 0 91 and ec 0 99 ph has strong negative correlation with f 0 89 and strong positive correlation with tds 0 87 and ec 0 91 this depicts that ph increases with an increase in tds and ec th has a strong positive correlation with f 0 94 and it is negatively correlated with ph 0 97 tds 0 91 and ec 0 93 cl has very strong positive correlation with k 0 92 weak positive correlation with mg2 0 27 so4 2 0 37 and moderate correlation with na 0 55 and ca2 0 69 indicates these parameters has mixed source of the origin rezaei et al 2020 moderate to the strong correlation of th with ca2 0 99 hco3 0 69 k 0 91 and cl 0 72 indicates that these major ions strongly influence th of water samples the hardness of water has a positive correlation with mg2 and ca2 which suggests that the hardness of water increases with an increase in calcium and magnesium ions the increase in calcium and magnesium ions in the water will form their respective insoluble carbonates or sulfates increasing the hardness of the water electrical conductivity has a positive correlation with tds sodium potassium and chloride ion which depicts that as the salinity of water increases its electrical conductivity increases the increase in salinity can be the result of ionic concentration increasing due to the evaporation of recharge water shah et al 2018a 2018b the correlation of ca2 with major chemical ions is weak to strong mg2 0 3 na 0 07 k 0 88 so4 2 0 31 and cl 0 69 the moderate correlation of ca2 with mg2 and cl are indications of carbonate dissolution al numanbakth et al 2019 ec and hco3 have a negative correlation of 0 68 signifying the mineralization of groundwater antony et al 2020 fig 4 clearly shows that mg is not correlating with other parameters and shows a constant trend in the scatter plot so4 2 and na k show a negative correlation and ca2 shows a positive correlation with hco3 co3 2 ca2 shows a positive correlation with hco3 co3 2 which supports the observation from the correlation matrix 5 4 3 cluster analysis in the present investigation dendrograms are constructed for various water constituents fig 5 and sampling stations fig 6 the linkage diagram for two parameters which is close to zero suggests that the two parameters are strongly correlated and carry the minimum degree of variation as compared to other hierarchical heights fig 5 shows a dendrogram linking various physicochemical parameters for seven water samples from fig 5 it is concluded that ca2 mg2 k and no3 ions are strongly correlated with each other conductivity and tds have minimum variation in quantity the degree of variation for tds and conductivity with other parameters is extremely high so the fluctuation in salinity is to be measured occasionally to ensure proper utilization of water in irrigation fig 6 shows a dendrogram linking different sampling stations based on variation in the chemical composition of the respective water sample it is revealed from fig 6 that kharkunda and agnikunda bara palasi cl and bara palasi a have a strong resemblance in terms of their chemical parameters while the former cluster varies strongly with the latter cluster tantloi shows a better correlation with agnikund and kharkunda hot springs 6 comparison with previous studies investigation of water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes has been carried out by several authors abbasnia et al 2019 akhtar et al 2020 aksever et al 2016 alam et al 2012 hassen et al 2016 li et al 2016 rufino et al 2019 the present study combines the practical approach of several authors work bhuiyan et al 2016 kim 2018 patil et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 jasrotia et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2013 maity et al 2017 muñoz et al 2015 to provide an integrated suitability analysis of physicochemical properties of water for irrigation and drinking purposes along with extending the study to source identification of water samples extensive investigation of pca and factor analysis has been carried out on water physicochemical parameters by several authors and geochemical influences have been discussed the results of pca analysis carried out by patil et al 2020 indicate mineralization of geological facies and dissolution of soil elements through water seeping the effect of salinization and silicate mineral weathering was investigated to be a significant component in the geochemical mixing of groundwater through pca analysis bhuiyan et al 2016 trabelsi and zouari 2019 the present study has shown that the dissolution of silicate minerals has played a vital role in groundwater chemical mixing understanding the mechanism of groundwater chemistry is essential to knowing the prevailing conditions during migration ismail et al 2020 logeshkumaran et al 2015 patil et al 2020 sunkari et al 2019 have constructed gibbs plot for investigation on groundwater and found most of the water samples to be under the influence of rock dominance while few samples fall under evaporation dominance in the present study area all the water samples fall under rock dominance which is supported by studies of several authors several authors have investigated hydro facies of water samples by generating trabelsi and zouari 2019 have prepared a piper plot of groundwater available from north eastern tunisia and found that most of the water samples are na cl types indication na and cl to be dominating cation and anion respectively al numanbakth et al 2019 have investigated groundwater from maddhapara northwest bangladesh and found out that most of the water samples fall under mg hco3 type and mixed type groundwater from perambalur district tamilnadu south india has been appraised by ahamed et al 2013 and it was concluded that water mainly falls under na cl type ca hco3 type and ca mg hco3 mixed type indicating the interactions among na mg2 and cl hco3 ions thermal water from deep well present in bolivian altiplano are major of na cl and na cl hco3 type while geothermal systems of western anatolia turkey shows na hco3 type water coming from deep wells and ca hco3 type water coming from hot spring bundschuh et al 2013 muñoz et al 2015 the present study suggests that three water samples fall under the na cl type while four samples fall under the na hco3 type indicating na to be dominating cation while cl and hco3 to be dominating anions in groundwater which shows a similar trend to previous studies al numanbakth et al 2019 haritash et al 2016 determined that most of the water samples fall under the s4 c1 type showing the high suitability for irrigation purposes the present study shows that the salinity doesn t vary but na varies for different water samples three water samples fall under s3 c2 two samples fall under s1 c2 while the remaining two fall under s1 c2 and s4 c2 the comparison with previous studies suggests that the results obtained are similar to other studies and gives a complete analysis of groundwater for irrigation and drinking purpose along with an extended investigation of source identification of water samples 7 conclusion the present investigation focuses on the geochemical properties of water available from bakreshwar tantloi hot springs to measure its sustainability for drinking and irrigation purposes the water from the current study area is appraised by following standard norms given by the world health organization and the bureau of indian standards water quality index wqi values reveal that the water is excellent for drinking purposes statistical investigation reveals natural weathering of minerals and reverses ion exchange among chemical ions pertained in the aquifer system which supports na replacing co3 2 and hco3 ions and thereby disturbing the rock permeability and quality of water for irrigation purposes pca analysis has shown that silicate weathering and dissolution prevailed and affected the geochemistry of groundwater sar na pi and ki results suggest that water from hot springs requires special techniques such as deionization and reverse osmosis to minimize its sodium content to utilize water for sustainable irrigation moreover nano filtration membranes could be utilized to remove arsenic from water the desalination process could be carried out with renewable energy sources which will prevent excess usage of nonrenewable energy resources as bakreshwar and tantloi are geothermal fields the water can be used in geothermal plants such as bktpp bakreshwar thermal power plant which is currently running on the bakreshwar river near bakreshwar hot springs the present research paper will be useful in upcoming irrigation projects in the birbhum district such as the mayurakshi river project and the hinglow river project and also for suitable crop selection authors contribution all the authors make a substantial

11802,groundwater uranium u content and the major hydrogeochemical processes were evaluated for six districts of assam lying mostly on the central and northern region of the brahmaputra floodplain a total of 504 groundwater samples were collected using the grid sampling technique uranium concentrations analysed using led fluorimeter model lf 2a ranged from below detection limit bdl to 13 5 μgl 1 all the u concentrations were found to be well below the prescribed limits of aerb who and usepa the highest groundwater u was recorded in a sample from nagaon a central brahmaputra floodplain district the sem edx spectra of the sediment samples revealed geogenic presence of u in the floodplain a comparative assessment between the relationships of u with other groundwater parameters revealed that shallow aquifers provided more feasibility for elemental interactions and hence more mobility of u species the correlation statistics in shallow aquifers depicted the importance of alkalinity on u release and mobilization uranium release during weathering of the geological strata was signified by the relationship of u with ec tds and salinity the role played by ph and orp in dissolution of u in the floodplain was not strong the dominant water type in the study was mg hco3 which was associated with higher u concentration this revealed the positive role of carbonate dissolution towards u release in the floodplain hydrogeochemical investigation further implied for greater silicate weathering and ion exchange compared to that of carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes the calculated undersaturation of calcite dolomite and gypsum explained their role as source minerals in the floodplain uranium dissolution and mobilization was found to have positive association with carbonate weathering as depicted by its significant relationship with calcite dolomite and gypsum health risk both radiological and chemical relating to u ingestion through drinking water was absent within the floodplain graphical abstract image 1 keywords uranium hydrogeochemistry mineral saturation weathering health risk 1 introduction uranium is a ubiquitous radioactive trace element having an average concentration of about 2 4 μgkg 1 in the earth s crust concentration of u in the groundwater is a function of its bedrock abundance ph oxidation states and the presence of other species which are capable of forming complexes with u viz carbonates sulphates fluorides chlorides phosphates silicates etc langmuir 1997 osmond and ivanovich 1992 saliba silva et al 2017 assessing the value of these ions along with the surrounding hydrogeological environment is therefore insightful in understanding u release mechanisms naturally u is found in granites monazite lignites and phosphate rocks brindha et al 2011 rishi et al 2017 according to gascoyne 1992 the weathering of u bearing rocks at the earth s surface under oxic condition marks the start of u natural geochemical cycle from where its isotopes u 238 and u 235 are released in water maintained at a ratio of 137 88 1 in aqueous systems u mainly occurs in three valence states viz 4 5 and 6 however the valencies are a function of the oxidation state of the system anoxic water primarily has u in the 4 states concentration of u at this state is lesser in aqueous systems as the minerals formed are less soluble and tend to remain bound to organic materials wu et al 2014 oxic waters however have u as uranyl ions 6 state which readily form soluble complexes of carbonates and hydroxides in various stoichiometric order relating ph and co2 g partial pressure kumar et al 2014 the processes influencing the conversion of u iv in the geological matrix to mobile u vi in groundwater often serves as the main u mobilization mechanism for a particular geological stratum such processes may be natural or anthropogenic mediated banning et al 2017 coyte et al 2019 several studies have reported such instances of u mobilization in nitrate rich environments banning et al 2017 bone et al 2017 hydrogeochemical processes such as seasonal fluctuation of water table may have significant impact in such oxidative mobilization processes bone et al 2017 uranium distribution in the groundwater has been reported worldwide in countries viz usa hakonson hayes et al 2002 warner et al 2011 brazil campos et al 2011 china wang et al 2012 korea kim et al 2004 nigeria arabi et al 2013 italy cinti et al 2015 etc dissolved u in both ground and surface water has also been reported in the indian subcontinent high u in indian groundwater has mostly been associated with oxidizing conditions that influence u solubility subsurface lithology and aquifer hco3 levels which renders formations of the soluble uranyl carbonates coyte et al 2018 lapworth et al 2021 rishi et al 2017 saini and bajwa 2016 yadav et al 2020 studies on several himalayan rivers like the indus pande et al 1994 yamuna rengarajan et al 2006 alakanda bhagirathi sarin et al 1992 and ganga brahmaputra chabaux et al 2001 has revealed the presence of u in their waters such studies indicate towards the probability of u occurrence in the fluvial alluvium of india there are several reports on u contamination in the gangetic plains of india kumar et al 2018 richards et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 the brahmaputra river originating from the tibetan plateau goswami et al 2014 is known to be the highest sediment carrying river latrubesse 2008 and has created alluvial floodplains on both its bank by sediment deposition sarma and phukan 2004 the sources of dissolved u in its river water belong to the tethyan sedimentary series of the northern tibetan plateau where u concentration up to 2 6 μgl 1 has been reported chabaux et al 2001 the floodplain subjected to seasonal flooding may therefore have u contribution from the himalayan sedimentary sources further characterization of sediment composition and the source of the floodplain is however necessary to arrive at such conclusions groundwater u above permissible limits prescribed by the health organizations has been reported in several indian states including karnataka babu et al 2008 punjab kumar et al 2011 singh et al 2012 andhra pradesh brindha et al 2011 brindha and elango 2013 uttar pradesh kumari et al 2014 haryana duggal et al 2017 singh et al 2014 tamil nadu adithya et al 2017 and rajasthan mittal et al 2017 pant et al 2019 consumption of excess u contaminated water is often associated with several ailments studies reported more biochemical toxicity associated with its consumption rather than the assumed radiotoxicity milvy and cothern 1990 the kidney being the major excretory organ for the metal is more susceptible to nephrotoxic effects vesterbacka et al 2005 biotoxicity of the metal affecting kidney metabolism is well reported domingo 1995 kurttio et al 2002 along with inflicting fertility issues efsa 2009 retainment of u in the human body poses a risk of bone cancer lariviere et al 2007 naja and volesky 2009 the study on u content in the floodplain groundwater of assam is a sought after topic as very minimal information regarding the same is available prevalence of u in the soil matrix of assam has been reported das et al 2018 kakati et al 2013 however the groundwater contamination and mobilization aspect were missing talukdar et al 1983 had done some preliminary investigation on u in natural water sources of assam using fission track method where the values ranged from 0 08 to 5 32 μgl 1 recently saikia et al 2021 has reported u presence in groundwater of nalbari lower floodplain district of assam the novelty of the present study therefore lies in the first hand attempt to assess the u content in groundwater its probable mobilization mechanism and its possible health effects along with the hydrogeochemistry of the central and northern brahmaputra floodplain setting the objectives the present work is therefore designed a to investigate the occurrence and distribution of u in the floodplain b to evaluate the relationship of u with other groundwater parameters including mineral saturation states c to evaluate the favourable mobilization mechanism of u in the floodplain d to evaluate dominant hydrogeochemical processes in the floodplain and e to perform radiological and chemical toxicity of u among the population dependent on groundwater for drinking and everyday usage 2 methodology 2 1 study area and geology the study area includes six districts of assam viz jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar in the north and nagaon sonitpur morigaon in the central region of the brahmaputra floodplain fig 1 the total study area spreads from 27 2064 n to 26 0017 n latitudes and 92 3370 e to 94 6425 e longitudes geologically the region primarily comprises of the alluvial plains formed by sedimentary deposits of the brahmaputra river and its tributaries along with rocky terrains of himalayan foothills towards the north the extensions of the shillong plateau and naga patkai thrust lie on the south and south east of the study area newer alluviums are mostly concentrated in the river vicinity while the older alluvium and hilly terrains occur mostly on the extremes i e north and south of the floodplain table 1 fig 1 details about the aquifer characteristics and geology of the region are further discussed in table 2 and fig 2 2 2 sampling and analyses a total of 504 groundwater samples were collected in the year 2016 the samples were collected from a grid size of 6 5 km2 so as to uniformly cover maximum possible locations the samples were collected mainly from tube wells which were widely used by people for drinking depth of the tube wells ranged from 3 to 134 m in situ measurement of groundwater parameters such as ph temperature salinity electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do were done using a portable multiparameter probe hanna india model hi9828 the probe was calibrated using a quick calibration standard solution before sampling in the laboratory standard apha 1995 methodologies were followed for all the analyses all the reagents used during analyses were of analytical grade merck total hardness th ca2 and mg2 were estimated using edta titrimetric method total alkalinity was estimated by acid titration method using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators phenolphthalein alkalinity for all the samples was found to be zero which indicated either absence or below the detection limit of carbonate alkalinity this implied that total alkalinity was the bicarbonate alkalinity the argentometric method using k2cro4 indicator was used for cl estimation the f so4 2 po4 3 and no3 concentrations were measured by spadns colorimetric method turbidimetric method ascorbic acid method and uv screening method respectively using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1700 na and k concentrations were estimated using a flame photometer systronics flame photometer 128 all these samples were collected in polypropylene bottles of 500 ml capacity and filtered using 0 45micron filter paper statistical analyses were performed using spss 23 and the maps were prepared using arc gis 10 4 1 saturation states of the minerals calcite dolomite gypsum and halite were calculated using phreeqc software package parkhurst and appelo 1999 2 3 uranium estimation in groundwater samples for u analyses the groundwater samples were collected separately in pre acid cleaned polypropylene containers of 1 l capacity in the field the samples were filtered with 0 45micron filtration unit and 2 ml of conc hno3 was added to minimize u loss due to biochemical changes saikia et al 2021 the u measurement was completed within 48 h of collection using a led fluorimeter model lf 2a quantalase enterprises private limited indore india in the laboratory the instrument can measure u concentration from 0 5 to 1000 μgl 1 with an accuracy of 10 or 0 05 μgl 1 whichever is greater and repeatability of better than 5 this is achieved by averaging the measurements over 1280 pulses the reading time of the instrument was 1 s per sample the detailed optimization method and analyses protocol are given elsewhere rathore et al 2001 sahoo et al 2008 2009 this method gives reading close to that given by another sophisticated instrument such as icp ms rohit et al 2018 before analysis the instrument was calibrated with 500 μgl 1 standard u solution catalog no icp ms 66n 0 01x 1 accu std usa the samples were buffered using an inorganic complexing agent fluran sodium pyrophosphate sodium dihydrogen phosphate to enhance the fluorescence of uranyl ion in the sample matrix well calibrated analytical balance and micropipettes were used during the analyses to minimize any error uncalibrated fluorescence or count method was used for all the u analyses which display only the fluorescence from the water sample which is proportional to the u level this method is also effective against the quenching effect of matrix elements like ca fe mn and mg 2 4 uranium detection in sediments in order to detect the presence of u in the geological matrix of the brahmaputra floodplain six sediment samples was collected one from each of the studied districts from depths ranging from 0 to 30 cm the surface was cleaned of any anthropogenic input prior to sample collection a bamboo tool was used for sample collection to prevent any metal contamination the samples were dried crushed and sieved to a size of less than 2 mm and observed under scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray sem edx jeol japan jsm 6390lv for the semi quantitative analyses 2 5 radiological and chemical risk assessment of u in groundwater uranium is a carcinogenic toxic element usepa 1991 and is hazardous to human health both radiologically and chemically hence its determination in the groundwater sources becomes inevitable in the present work radiological and chemical risk has been evaluated separately chandramohan et al 2018 mehra et al 2017 the methodologies for calculation of the radiological and chemical toxicity due to u intake through drinking water are described below 2 5 1 methodology for radiological risk radiological risk expressed in terms of excess cancer risk ecr is calculated using the following equations 1 and 2 epa 2000 1 excess cancer risk ecr u a b q l 1 rf mortality per b q l 1 2 excess cancer risk ecr u a b q

statistics of the groundwater parameters are shown in table 3 the ph of the samples in all the locations ranged from 5 8 to 8 5 indicating acidic to alkaline conditions in the aquifers only 7 of the samples have ph less than the lower limit 6 5 of the permissible range while the rest were found to be within the permissible limits who 2011 the orp values ranged from 110 mv to 254 mv with a mean of 46 5 mv it was observed that 74 of the samples in jorhat were found to be in reduced state while 90 of the samples in nagaon showed oxidized condition the tds values ranged from 15 to 675 mgl 1 and have a mean value of 157 2 mgl 1 only 2 samples were found to exceed the desirable limit of 600 mgl 1 who 2011 bicarbonate being the dominant anion its values ranged from 40 mgl 1 to 560 mgl 1 with a mean of 162 1 mgl 1 majority of the sampling locations have hco3 values exceeding the acceptable limit bis 2012 which were in the order 53 for morigaon 52 for nagaon 42 for jorhat 36 for sivasagar 19 for lakhimpur and 14 for sonitpur nine of the samples had ph between 8 3 and 8 5 which is also the indicator zone for carbonate species in natural water however at the excess of hco3 even in such a ph range detection of any co3 2 is not easily achievable hem 1985 this may render to the non detection of any co3 2 in the study area for all the locations f values ranged between bdl and 3 3 mgl 1 and had a mean value of 0 4 mgl 1 the highest f values were observed in sonitpur where 38 of the samples exceeded the permissible limit of 1 5 mgl 1 bis 2012 such a situation indicated concerning scenario for the population dependent on groundwater resources for drinking purpose the majority of the no3 values in the study were within the permissible limits bis 2012 except for one sample from lakhimpur 3 2 uranium distribution in the floodplain the u values in the samples varied from bdl to 3 8 μgl 1 for jorhat bdl to 5 2 μgl 1 for lakhimpur bdl to 9 3 μgl 1 for morigaon 0 1 to 13 5 μgl 1 for nagaon bdl to 2 1 μgl 1 for sivasagar and bdl to 5 9 μgl 1 for sonitpur table 3 all the measured u values were found to be within the recommended limits of 60 μgl 1 aerb 2004 and 30 μgl 1 usepa 2000 who 2011 the highest value of 13 5 μgl 1 was detected in a groundwater sample from nagaon where the estimated mean value for u concentration was 0 8 μgl 1 differences in u concentrations were observed among the districts of the same floodplain and hence their significance was further tested using anova statistics table 4 the result of the test implied the existence of a significant difference p 0 05 in the u distribution pattern between the different locations of the brahmaputra floodplain this may be attributed to the uniqueness of local hydrogeochemistry within the floodplain region possible difference in mineral weathering mineral availability in the geological strata groundwater flow pattern terrestrial slope contributing to the uniqueness of local hydrogeological environment may be the reasons behind such a significant difference in order to simplify the relative distribution pattern of u concentrations the values were classified into categories as shown in fig 3 overall 89 n 415 of the samples had u values in the range of less than 1 μgl 1 9 3 n 47 of the samples had values between 1 and 5 μgl 1 and 1 n 5 of the samples had values between 5 and 10 μgl 1 only one sample from nagaon had u concentration above 10 μgl 1 which is also the highest concentration value from this concentration distribution pattern it may be well assumed that u in the floodplain is under the safe margin health adversity related to u is however further studied in the later section due to non availability of lower threshold value of the metal to impose chemical toxicity uranium concentration as low as 0 1 mgkg 1 has the potential to inflict health adversity such as nephrotoxicity tanner 1978 presence of u in the geological matrix of the floodplain is further confirmed by the sem edx imageries fig 4 a f of the sediment samples collected from the floodplain districts the data showing the elemental composition of the samples is provided in the supplementary table the samples being representative its detection in sedimentary aquifers like the brahmaputra floodplain opens a new avenue for further source apportionment study similar presentation regarding the presence of u in the floodplain sediments were shown by das et al 2018 using sem edx spectra 3 3 relationship of u with other groundwater parameters the relationship between different groundwater parameters serves as a marker for important hydrogeochemical processes in an area the u values in groundwater depend on factors like oxidation states alkalinity and abundance of parameters with which it is capable of binding relationship exhibited by u with the groundwater parameters at different depths of the geological strata help to understand important hydrogeochemical aspect of the metal such as mobilization the correlation variations were hence examined at shallow 50 m and deeper 50 m aquifer levels it was observed that the groundwater samples from the north bank of the brahmaputra i e lakhimpur and sonitpur belonged to shallow aquifers the aquifer depth selection was however unintentional in the shallow aquifers u showed positive correlation with bicarbonate table 5 in jorhat r 0 28 p 0 05 lakhimpur r 0 31 p 0 01 morigaon r 0 49 p 0 01 nagaon r 0 30 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 27 p 0 05 indicating probable favourable conditions for formation of u soluble complexes several other studies showed similar results for u and bicarbonate indicating a significant role of bicarbonate in u mobilization keesari et al 2015 rishi et al 2017 although ph and orp play an important role in speciation of u however no major influence of the parameters was seen in the study area in both shallow and deeper aquifers table 5 positive correlation between u and depth was observed only in sivasagar r 0 34 p 0 01 in the shallow aquifer table 5 ec showed positive correlation with u table 5 in jorhat r 0 33 p 0 01 lakhimpur r 0 45 p 0 01 morigaon r 0 67 p 0 01 nagaon r 0 51 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 38 p 0 01 in the shallow aquifers similar trend for u and ec was reported in punjab rishi et al 2017 among the cations na in the shallow aquifers showed positive relationship with u in jorhat r 0 44 p 0 01 lakhimpur r 0 24 p 0 05 morigaon r 0 55 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 49 p 0 01 table 5 phosphate in the shallow aquifers showed positive relationship with u in jorhat r 0 26 p 0 05 and sivasagar r 0 57 p 0 01 table 5 pointing towards probable common sources in the tea cultivated districts it was observed that u exhibited most of the significant correlations in the shallow aquifers compared to that of the deeper aquifers table 5 such relationships revealed that the shallow aquifers provide more feasible environment for interaction of u with other groundwater parameters suggesting suitability for its mobilization mechanisms similar observation for favourable mobilization of u in shallow aquifers were observed by sahoo et al 2021 in punjab the probable factor for u mobilization was however the salt effect exhibited by interionic competition 3 4 evaluation of hydrogeochemical processes concentration of different major elements and their inter relationships often serve as a tool to understand the hydrogeochemical processes involved in controlling the chemistry of the aquifers facies in the groundwater system reflect the interaction between the mineral phase and its hydro phase often times groundwater flow pattern influence and contributes to its ionic distribution kumar and singh 2015 identification of dominant hydrogeochemical facies in a broader sense may sometimes however be difficult due to the involvement of individual hydrogeochemical facies of secondary recharges dano 2010 the piper plot is used as a tool for identification of the dominant hydrogeochemical facies of a study area the plot fig 5 in our study referred to mg hco3 to be the dominant water type about 61 7 n 311 of the total samples had mg hco3 as dominant water type morigaon showed the highest occurrence of this water type 82 2 followed by sivasagar 81 1 nagaon 66 7 lakhimpur 53 2 jorhat 49 3 and sonitpur 47 7 the other water types were ca hco3 19 2 na hco3 14 1 mg cl 2 k hco3 1 2 ca cl 1 na cl 0 6 and mg so4 0 2 the mg hco3 water type often has dolomite dissolution as its primary source equation 7 garrels 1976 7 camg co 3 2 2 h 2 co 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 hc o 3 1 dolomite dissolution the prevalence of na hco3 water type implied for a significant occurrence of silicate weathering and ionic exchange processes in the aquifers on the association of water types to u concentration it was revealed that five out of six samples having u values above 5 μgl 1 belonged to mghco3 water type while one sample had nahco3 water type this observation clearly indicated towards the favourable desorption of u during dolomite carbonate dissolution more insight into the dominant hydrogeochemical processes determining water types and their association with u desorption is provided in the later sections the gibb s plots gibbs 1970 prepared by plotting the ionic ratios of na k na k ca2 fig 6 a and cl cl hco3 fig 6b versus tds of groundwater provides three zones of dominant hydrogeochemical process viz evaporation weathering and rainfall dominance geographical location as such is one of the significant factors affecting groundwater quality beck et al 1985 the plots in this study indicated the dominant occurrence of rock weathering to primarily regulate the groundwater ionic chemistry information on the influence of climate on groundwater composition can also be extracted from the ec versus na cl plot fig 7 a the plot signifies the influence of evaporation on aquifer ionic composition jankowski and acworth 1997 which may have some effects in a sub tropical region like the study area in the plot dominance of evaporation is indicated by a parallel trend line which is achieved possibly due to the absence of mineral precipitation senthilkumar and elango 2013 an inclined trend line in the plot indicated the absence of influence of evaporation on groundwater composition implying occurrence of other hydrogeochemical processes like ionic exchanges prasanna et al 2011 an absence of evaporation was observed over groundwater ionic composition as indicated by inclined trendlines in all the locations an additional observation that can be reasoned from the plot is either increase or decrease of na cl with respect to ec decreasing trend in the plot explained the removal of na from groundwater implying the occurrence of reverse ion exchange processes rajmohan and elango 2004 zhu et al 2008 as observed for morigaon the rest of the locations showed an increasing trend indicating an excess of na possibly due to the occurrence of ion exchange processes intensity of occurrence of a particular weathering type often determines the concentration of the major ions silicate and carbonate weathering cover a broad spectrum of mineral weathering and primarily governs the concentration of major cations and anions the extent of such weathering processes can be evaluated using the so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 plot the plot is also helpful in analysing the cationic exchange type when the points in the plot lie above the 1 1 line it indicates excess of so4 2 and hco3 over ca2 and mg2 referring to dominant occurrence of silicate weathering and ion exchange processes datta and tyagi 1996 points below the 1 1 line in the plot refer to dominant occurrence of carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes having an excess of ca2 and mg2 concentration cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 the plot fig 7b prepared for the study area revealed the dominant occurrence of silicate weathering processes about 77 n 59 73 n 58 56 n 25 68 n 69 79 n 71 and 90 n 100 samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had an excess of so4 2 and hco3 over ca2 and mg2 which supported silicate mineral dissolution and ion exchange identification of dominance of ion exchange or reverse ion exchange can also be evaluated from the na versus cl plot fig 7c the plot also implies the identification of major sources of na in groundwater when the points in the plot lie above the 1 1 line it indicates na from ion exchange processes and silicate weathering reddy et al 2010 stallard and edmond 1983 the points on the 1 1 line indicates na from halite dissolution while points below the 1 1 line indicate na removal due to processes such as reverse ion exchange rajmohan and elango 2004 senthilkumar and elango 2013 in the study area about 57 n 44 63 n 50 62 n 28 86 n 88 61 n 55 and 42 n 47 sample points from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had an excess of na over cl indicating na release from silicate weathering and ion exchange mechanisms fig 7c sodium from halite dissolution was observed in only two samples from lakhimpur and one sample each from morigaon and sonitpur the saturation state of the mineral is studied in the further section the rest of the samples lie below the 1 1 line in the plot fig 7c the dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater of the study area can be assessed using the ca2 mg2 versus sample numbers fig 7d the values in the ratio i e ca2 mg2 less than or equal to one indicated sources from dolomite dissolution the ratio greater than one refers to calcite dissolution as the dominant source mayo and loucks 1995 while that greater than two refers to the sources of ca2 and mg2 to be silicate dissolution katz et al 1997 the plot indicated that the dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the study area was dolomite dissolution as 69 n 53 59 n 47 89 n 40 86 n 88 93 n 84 and 63 n 70 of the samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had ca2 mg2 less than or equal to one calcite dissolution served as the second dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater of the study area about 27 n 21 31 n 24 9 n 4 11 n 11 6 n 5 and 33 n 37 samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had ca2 mg2 greater than one saturation states of calcite and dolomite are studied in further section 3 5 mineral saturation states controlling groundwater hydrogeochemistry saturation states of minerals impart thermodynamic control on their dissolution or precipitation oversaturation leading to mineral precipitation results in a general lowering of elemental concentration such situations many times pull for dissolution of another mineral containing a common element in order to attain elemental equilibrium states equilibrium pulls between calcite and fluorite containing the common element ca is an example of such well known phenomenon chae et al 2006 edmunds and smedley 2013 gogoi et al 2021 handa 1975 saxena and ahmed 2001 elemental undersaturation is the most feasible drive for dissolution of its mineral phases in order to understand the role of saturation states on the ionic composition of groundwater si values of calcite dolomite gypsum and halite were calculated table 6 the results showed a dominant undersaturated condition for all the considered minerals saturation index values for calcite in the study ranged between 4 5 and 3 63 the most undersaturated condition for the mineral was calculated for jorhat while the most oversaturated value was found for lakhimpur amidst the dominant undersaturated condition oversaturation of calcite was found in 2 13 2 12 and 8 groundwater samples from nagaon jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar and sonitpur respectively oversaturated values for dolomite were found in 11 4 17 2 27 and 11 groundwater samples from nagaon morigaon jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar and sonitpur the si values of the mineral ranged between 8 62 and 8 1 the most undersaturation being in jorhat while the most oversaturated value was for lakhimpur undersaturated calcite and dolomite leading to their dissolution is hence the most dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater of the study area gypsum dissolution in groundwater is a common source of ca2 and so4 2 in groundwater the calculated si values for the mineral ranged between 4 36 and 3 53 the mineral was mostly undersaturated with only one sample each from jorhat and lakhimpur having oversaturated values halite is a common mineral source of na and cl specially near the coastal zones however in an inland region like the study area it is not a dominant source for the elements saturation state for the mineral is however entirely undersaturated in the study area a few samples from lakhimpur morigaon and sonitpur showing halite dissolution fig 7c may be due to the highly undersaturated state of the mineral geological abundance may however be a limiting factor for the mineral 3 6 uranium association with saturation states of the minerals the u in the groundwater of the study area is associated with the weathering of the geological strata its link with saturation state of common hydrogeology controlling minerals can therefore help detect the path of its release and mobilization the correlation matrix of u with the si values of the minerals table 7 showed that it had significant relationship with dolomite r 0 30 p 0 05 gypsum r 0 31 p 0 05 in morigaon and calcite r 0 22 p 0 05 dolomite r 0 26 p 0 05 in sivasagar the observation is supportive of the findings from the former relationship between higher u concentrations and carbonate water types there are reports about the association of u with dissolution of dolomite and gypsum in other sedimentary aquifers kabir et al 2014 paik et al 2007 correlation of u with such ca2 bearing minerals further implied the formation of calcium uranyl carbonates which render increased mobility of u in groundwater thereby reducing its adsorption efficiency fox et al 2006 nair and merkel 2011 it is hence revealed that desorption of u from ca2 bearing minerals triggered by mineral undersaturation is a dominant u mobilization mechanism in the study area tables 6 and 7 adoption of speciation modelling can further throw more insight into the predominant complex formations and their potential mobilizations the amount of release is however a function of abundance in the geological matrix 3 7 health risk estimation of uranium in groundwater cancer mortality and morbidity give the number of deaths and prevalence of unhealthy state respectively in a population because of cancer in the present study the ecr values for mortality and morbidity ranged from 0 to 14 14 10 6 and 0 to 21 86 10 6 respectively table 8 the highest value for ecr mortality and morbidity was observed in the nagaon district however the value at 10 6 indicates the population to be safe from radiological risk compared to the accepted permissible limit of 10 3 kim et al 2004 chemical risk assessment of u is performed by calculating ladd and hq values in the sampling locations ladd values in all the samples ranged from 0 to 0 27 μg 1kg 1day table 8 which is well below the recommended limit of 1 0 μg 1kg 1day aerb 2004 who 2011 hq values calculated using reference dose ranged from 0 to 0 44 table 8 is found to be well below the recommended value of hazard 1 0 as proposed by aerb aerb 2004 and who who 2011 this indicated the absence of toxicity risk due to u ingestion in groundwater the overall age dependent effective dose values due to ingestion of u through drinking water pathways ranged from 0 2 to 21 1 μsvy 1 table 9 which is well below the prescribed limit of 100 μsvy 1 who 2011 the highest effective dose value was observed in nagaon owing to the highest groundwater u concentration females during pregnancy and lactation had higher effective dose levels probably due to consumption of more water during that period sharma et al 2019 the effective dose values for females during lactation period ranged from 0 to 5 9 μsvy 1 in jorhat 0 to 8 1 μsvy 1 in lakhimpur 0 to 14 5 μsvy 1 in morigaon 0 2 to 21 1 μsvy 1 in nagaon 0 to 3 3 μsvy 1 sivasagar and 0 to 9 2 μsvy 1 in sonitpur district respectively male population had higher effective dose values compared to females due to more consumption of water patra et al 2013 yadav et al 2014 4 conclusion the river brahmaputra is considered as a life line by the people of assam which offers an extensive fertile plain along both its banks the present study on groundwater u in the floodplain is a new venture although its levels are found to be well within the prescribed permissible limits the ph condition in the floodplain varied from acidic to alkaline both reduced and oxic groundwater environments prevail in the region jorhat had the most reduced and nagaon the most oxic higher f levels above the prescribed limits were detected in the floodplain the highest prevalence was in sonitpur this fact leaves another scope for this study to unveil more of f contamination in the floodplain dominance of mg hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 revealed the occurrence both carbonate and silicate weathering processes which is further supported by the graphical plots of the major ions a comparative assessment showed silicate weathering and ion exchange mechanism to be dominant over carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange mechanism a dominant undersaturated condition prevails for calcite dolomite gypsum and halite minerals in the floodplain suggesting their significant role in associated elemental richness the u mobilization in the floodplain is revealed to be favoured by carbonate dissolution processes correlations of u with groundwater parameters at different depths further implied that shallow aquifers of the floodplain provide feasibility for the release of u from soluble uranyl carbonates adoption of laboratory experiments and speciation modelling will however be instrumental to unravel more of the release and mobilization mechanisms in the sedimentary floodplain the u health risk assessment implied its current absence among the floodplain population future assessment and monitoring are always advisable the work however leaves additional scope to carry out study on the health aspect of other elements like the f which is above the permissible limit in several places of the floodplain the work carried out in the extensive plain is thus insightful with its own advantages and limitations funding board of research in nuclear sciences brns department of atomic energy dae

11802,groundwater uranium u content and the major hydrogeochemical processes were evaluated for six districts of assam lying mostly on the central and northern region of the brahmaputra floodplain a total of 504 groundwater samples were collected using the grid sampling technique uranium concentrations analysed using led fluorimeter model lf 2a ranged from below detection limit bdl to 13 5 μgl 1 all the u concentrations were found to be well below the prescribed limits of aerb who and usepa the highest groundwater u was recorded in a sample from nagaon a central brahmaputra floodplain district the sem edx spectra of the sediment samples revealed geogenic presence of u in the floodplain a comparative assessment between the relationships of u with other groundwater parameters revealed that shallow aquifers provided more feasibility for elemental interactions and hence more mobility of u species the correlation statistics in shallow aquifers depicted the importance of alkalinity on u release and mobilization uranium release during weathering of the geological strata was signified by the relationship of u with ec tds and salinity the role played by ph and orp in dissolution of u in the floodplain was not strong the dominant water type in the study was mg hco3 which was associated with higher u concentration this revealed the positive role of carbonate dissolution towards u release in the floodplain hydrogeochemical investigation further implied for greater silicate weathering and ion exchange compared to that of carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes the calculated undersaturation of calcite dolomite and gypsum explained their role as source minerals in the floodplain uranium dissolution and mobilization was found to have positive association with carbonate weathering as depicted by its significant relationship with calcite dolomite and gypsum health risk both radiological and chemical relating to u ingestion through drinking water was absent within the floodplain graphical abstract image 1 keywords uranium hydrogeochemistry mineral saturation weathering health risk 1 introduction uranium is a ubiquitous radioactive trace element having an average concentration of about 2 4 μgkg 1 in the earth s crust concentration of u in the groundwater is a function of its bedrock abundance ph oxidation states and the presence of other species which are capable of forming complexes with u viz carbonates sulphates fluorides chlorides phosphates silicates etc langmuir 1997 osmond and ivanovich 1992 saliba silva et al 2017 assessing the value of these ions along with the surrounding hydrogeological environment is therefore insightful in understanding u release mechanisms naturally u is found in granites monazite lignites and phosphate rocks brindha et al 2011 rishi et al 2017 according to gascoyne 1992 the weathering of u bearing rocks at the earth s surface under oxic condition marks the start of u natural geochemical cycle from where its isotopes u 238 and u 235 are released in water maintained at a ratio of 137 88 1 in aqueous systems u mainly occurs in three valence states viz 4 5 and 6 however the valencies are a function of the oxidation state of the system anoxic water primarily has u in the 4 states concentration of u at this state is lesser in aqueous systems as the minerals formed are less soluble and tend to remain bound to organic materials wu et al 2014 oxic waters however have u as uranyl ions 6 state which readily form soluble complexes of carbonates and hydroxides in various stoichiometric order relating ph and co2 g partial pressure kumar et al 2014 the processes influencing the conversion of u iv in the geological matrix to mobile u vi in groundwater often serves as the main u mobilization mechanism for a particular geological stratum such processes may be natural or anthropogenic mediated banning et al 2017 coyte et al 2019 several studies have reported such instances of u mobilization in nitrate rich environments banning et al 2017 bone et al 2017 hydrogeochemical processes such as seasonal fluctuation of water table may have significant impact in such oxidative mobilization processes bone et al 2017 uranium distribution in the groundwater has been reported worldwide in countries viz usa hakonson hayes et al 2002 warner et al 2011 brazil campos et al 2011 china wang et al 2012 korea kim et al 2004 nigeria arabi et al 2013 italy cinti et al 2015 etc dissolved u in both ground and surface water has also been reported in the indian subcontinent high u in indian groundwater has mostly been associated with oxidizing conditions that influence u solubility subsurface lithology and aquifer hco3 levels which renders formations of the soluble uranyl carbonates coyte et al 2018 lapworth et al 2021 rishi et al 2017 saini and bajwa 2016 yadav et al 2020 studies on several himalayan rivers like the indus pande et al 1994 yamuna rengarajan et al 2006 alakanda bhagirathi sarin et al 1992 and ganga brahmaputra chabaux et al 2001 has revealed the presence of u in their waters such studies indicate towards the probability of u occurrence in the fluvial alluvium of india there are several reports on u contamination in the gangetic plains of india kumar et al 2018 richards et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 the brahmaputra river originating from the tibetan plateau goswami et al 2014 is known to be the highest sediment carrying river latrubesse 2008 and has created alluvial floodplains on both its bank by sediment deposition sarma and phukan 2004 the sources of dissolved u in its river water belong to the tethyan sedimentary series of the northern tibetan plateau where u concentration up to 2 6 μgl 1 has been reported chabaux et al 2001 the floodplain subjected to seasonal flooding may therefore have u contribution from the himalayan sedimentary sources further characterization of sediment composition and the source of the floodplain is however necessary to arrive at such conclusions groundwater u above permissible limits prescribed by the health organizations has been reported in several indian states including karnataka babu et al 2008 punjab kumar et al 2011 singh et al 2012 andhra pradesh brindha et al 2011 brindha and elango 2013 uttar pradesh kumari et al 2014 haryana duggal et al 2017 singh et al 2014 tamil nadu adithya et al 2017 and rajasthan mittal et al 2017 pant et al 2019 consumption of excess u contaminated water is often associated with several ailments studies reported more biochemical toxicity associated with its consumption rather than the assumed radiotoxicity milvy and cothern 1990 the kidney being the major excretory organ for the metal is more susceptible to nephrotoxic effects vesterbacka et al 2005 biotoxicity of the metal affecting kidney metabolism is well reported domingo 1995 kurttio et al 2002 along with inflicting fertility issues efsa 2009 retainment of u in the human body poses a risk of bone cancer lariviere et al 2007 naja and volesky 2009 the study on u content in the floodplain groundwater of assam is a sought after topic as very minimal information regarding the same is available prevalence of u in the soil matrix of assam has been reported das et al 2018 kakati et al 2013 however the groundwater contamination and mobilization aspect were missing talukdar et al 1983 had done some preliminary investigation on u in natural water sources of assam using fission track method where the values ranged from 0 08 to 5 32 μgl 1 recently saikia et al 2021 has reported u presence in groundwater of nalbari lower floodplain district of assam the novelty of the present study therefore lies in the first hand attempt to assess the u content in groundwater its probable mobilization mechanism and its possible health effects along with the hydrogeochemistry of the central and northern brahmaputra floodplain setting the objectives the present work is therefore designed a to investigate the occurrence and distribution of u in the floodplain b to evaluate the relationship of u with other groundwater parameters including mineral saturation states c to evaluate the favourable mobilization mechanism of u in the floodplain d to evaluate dominant hydrogeochemical processes in the floodplain and e to perform radiological and chemical toxicity of u among the population dependent on groundwater for drinking and everyday usage 2 methodology 2 1 study area and geology the study area includes six districts of assam viz jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar in the north and nagaon sonitpur morigaon in the central region of the brahmaputra floodplain fig 1 the total study area spreads from 27 2064 n to 26 0017 n latitudes and 92 3370 e to 94 6425 e longitudes geologically the region primarily comprises of the alluvial plains formed by sedimentary deposits of the brahmaputra river and its tributaries along with rocky terrains of himalayan foothills towards the north the extensions of the shillong plateau and naga patkai thrust lie on the south and south east of the study area newer alluviums are mostly concentrated in the river vicinity while the older alluvium and hilly terrains occur mostly on the extremes i e north and south of the floodplain table 1 fig 1 details about the aquifer characteristics and geology of the region are further discussed in table 2 and fig 2 2 2 sampling and analyses a total of 504 groundwater samples were collected in the year 2016 the samples were collected from a grid size of 6 5 km2 so as to uniformly cover maximum possible locations the samples were collected mainly from tube wells which were widely used by people for drinking depth of the tube wells ranged from 3 to 134 m in situ measurement of groundwater parameters such as ph temperature salinity electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do were done using a portable multiparameter probe hanna india model hi9828 the probe was calibrated using a quick calibration standard solution before sampling in the laboratory standard apha 1995 methodologies were followed for all the analyses all the reagents used during analyses were of analytical grade merck total hardness th ca2 and mg2 were estimated using edta titrimetric method total alkalinity was estimated by acid titration method using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators phenolphthalein alkalinity for all the samples was found to be zero which indicated either absence or below the detection limit of carbonate alkalinity this implied that total alkalinity was the bicarbonate alkalinity the argentometric method using k2cro4 indicator was used for cl estimation the f so4 2 po4 3 and no3 concentrations were measured by spadns colorimetric method turbidimetric method ascorbic acid method and uv screening method respectively using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1700 na and k concentrations were estimated using a flame photometer systronics flame photometer 128 all these samples were collected in polypropylene bottles of 500 ml capacity and filtered using 0 45micron filter paper statistical analyses were performed using spss 23 and the maps were prepared using arc gis 10 4 1 saturation states of the minerals calcite dolomite gypsum and halite were calculated using phreeqc software package parkhurst and appelo 1999 2 3 uranium estimation in groundwater samples for u analyses the groundwater samples were collected separately in pre acid cleaned polypropylene containers of 1 l capacity in the field the samples were filtered with 0 45micron filtration unit and 2 ml of conc hno3 was added to minimize u loss due to biochemical changes saikia et al 2021 the u measurement was completed within 48 h of collection using a led fluorimeter model lf 2a quantalase enterprises private limited indore india in the laboratory the instrument can measure u concentration from 0 5 to 1000 μgl 1 with an accuracy of 10 or 0 05 μgl 1 whichever is greater and repeatability of better than 5 this is achieved by averaging the measurements over 1280 pulses the reading time of the instrument was 1 s per sample the detailed optimization method and analyses protocol are given elsewhere rathore et al 2001 sahoo et al 2008 2009 this method gives reading close to that given by another sophisticated instrument such as icp ms rohit et al 2018 before analysis the instrument was calibrated with 500 μgl 1 standard u solution catalog no icp ms 66n 0 01x 1 accu std usa the samples were buffered using an inorganic complexing agent fluran sodium pyrophosphate sodium dihydrogen phosphate to enhance the fluorescence of uranyl ion in the sample matrix well calibrated analytical balance and micropipettes were used during the analyses to minimize any error uncalibrated fluorescence or count method was used for all the u analyses which display only the fluorescence from the water sample which is proportional to the u level this method is also effective against the quenching effect of matrix elements like ca fe mn and mg 2 4 uranium detection in sediments in order to detect the presence of u in the geological matrix of the brahmaputra floodplain six sediment samples was collected one from each of the studied districts from depths ranging from 0 to 30 cm the surface was cleaned of any anthropogenic input prior to sample collection a bamboo tool was used for sample collection to prevent any metal contamination the samples were dried crushed and sieved to a size of less than 2 mm and observed under scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray sem edx jeol japan jsm 6390lv for the semi quantitative analyses 2 5 radiological and chemical risk assessment of u in groundwater uranium is a carcinogenic toxic element usepa 1991 and is hazardous to human health both radiologically and chemically hence its determination in the groundwater sources becomes inevitable in the present work radiological and chemical risk has been evaluated separately chandramohan et al 2018 mehra et al 2017 the methodologies for calculation of the radiological and chemical toxicity due to u intake through drinking water are described below 2 5 1 methodology for radiological risk radiological risk

statistics of the groundwater parameters are shown in table 3 the ph of the samples in all the locations ranged from 5 8 to 8 5 indicating acidic to alkaline conditions in the aquifers only 7 of the samples have ph less than the lower limit 6 5 of the permissible range while the rest were found to be within the permissible limits who 2011 the orp values ranged from 110 mv to 254 mv with a mean of 46 5 mv it was observed that 74 of the samples in jorhat were found to be in reduced state while 90 of the samples in nagaon showed oxidized condition the tds values ranged from 15 to 675 mgl 1 and have a mean value of 157 2 mgl 1 only 2 samples were found to exceed the desirable limit of 600 mgl 1 who 2011 bicarbonate being the dominant anion its values ranged from 40 mgl 1 to 560 mgl 1 with a mean of 162 1 mgl 1 majority of the sampling locations have hco3 values exceeding the acceptable limit bis 2012 which were in the order 53 for morigaon 52 for nagaon 42 for jorhat 36 for sivasagar 19 for lakhimpur and 14 for sonitpur nine of the samples had ph between 8 3 and 8 5 which is also the indicator zone for carbonate species in natural water however at the excess of hco3 even in such a ph range detection of any co3 2 is not easily achievable hem 1985 this may render to the non detection of any co3 2 in the study area for all the locations f values ranged between bdl and 3 3 mgl 1 and had a mean value of 0 4 mgl 1 the highest f values were observed in sonitpur where 38 of the samples exceeded the permissible limit of 1 5 mgl 1 bis 2012 such a situation indicated concerning scenario for the population dependent on groundwater resources for drinking purpose the majority of the no3 values in the study were within the permissible limits bis 2012 except for one sample from lakhimpur 3 2 uranium distribution in the floodplain the u values in the samples varied from bdl to 3 8 μgl 1 for jorhat bdl to 5 2 μgl 1 for lakhimpur bdl to 9 3 μgl 1 for morigaon 0 1 to 13 5 μgl 1 for nagaon bdl to 2 1 μgl 1 for sivasagar and bdl to 5 9 μgl 1 for sonitpur table 3 all the measured u values were found to be within the recommended limits of 60 μgl 1 aerb 2004 and 30 μgl 1 usepa 2000 who 2011 the highest value of 13 5 μgl 1 was detected in a groundwater sample from nagaon where the estimated mean value for u concentration was 0 8 μgl 1 differences in u concentrations were observed among the districts of the same floodplain and hence their significance was further tested using anova statistics table 4 the result of the test implied the existence of a significant difference p 0 05 in the u distribution pattern between the different locations of the brahmaputra floodplain this may be attributed to the uniqueness of local hydrogeochemistry within the floodplain region possible difference in mineral weathering mineral availability in the geological strata groundwater flow pattern terrestrial slope contributing to the uniqueness of local hydrogeological environment may be the reasons behind such a significant difference in order to simplify the relative distribution pattern of u concentrations the values were classified into categories as shown in fig 3 overall 89 n 415 of the samples had u values in the range of less than 1 μgl 1 9 3 n 47 of the samples had values between 1 and 5 μgl 1 and 1 n 5 of the samples had values between 5 and 10 μgl 1 only one sample from nagaon had u concentration above 10 μgl 1 which is also the highest concentration value from this concentration distribution pattern it may be well assumed that u in the floodplain is under the safe margin health adversity related to u is however further studied in the later section due to non availability of lower threshold value of the metal to impose chemical toxicity uranium concentration as low as 0 1 mgkg 1 has the potential to inflict health adversity such as nephrotoxicity tanner 1978 presence of u in the geological matrix of the floodplain is further confirmed by the sem edx imageries fig 4 a f of the sediment samples collected from the floodplain districts the data showing the elemental composition of the samples is provided in the supplementary table the samples being representative its detection in sedimentary aquifers like the brahmaputra floodplain opens a new avenue for further source apportionment study similar presentation regarding the presence of u in the floodplain sediments were shown by das et al 2018 using sem edx spectra 3 3 relationship of u with other groundwater parameters the relationship between different groundwater parameters serves as a marker for important hydrogeochemical processes in an area the u values in groundwater depend on factors like oxidation states alkalinity and abundance of parameters with which it is capable of binding relationship exhibited by u with the groundwater parameters at different depths of the geological strata help to understand important hydrogeochemical aspect of the metal such as mobilization the correlation variations were hence examined at shallow 50 m and deeper 50 m aquifer levels it was observed that the groundwater samples from the north bank of the brahmaputra i e lakhimpur and sonitpur belonged to shallow aquifers the aquifer depth selection was however unintentional in the shallow aquifers u showed positive correlation with bicarbonate table 5 in jorhat r 0 28 p 0 05 lakhimpur r 0 31 p 0 01 morigaon r 0 49 p 0 01 nagaon r 0 30 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 27 p 0 05 indicating probable favourable conditions for formation of u soluble complexes several other studies showed similar results for u and bicarbonate indicating a significant role of bicarbonate in u mobilization keesari et al 2015 rishi et al 2017 although ph and orp play an important role in speciation of u however no major influence of the parameters was seen in the study area in both shallow and deeper aquifers table 5 positive correlation between u and depth was observed only in sivasagar r 0 34 p 0 01 in the shallow aquifer table 5 ec showed positive correlation with u table 5 in jorhat r 0 33 p 0 01 lakhimpur r 0 45 p 0 01 morigaon r 0 67 p 0 01 nagaon r 0 51 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 38 p 0 01 in the shallow aquifers similar trend for u and ec was reported in punjab rishi et al 2017 among the cations na in the shallow aquifers showed positive relationship with u in jorhat r 0 44 p 0 01 lakhimpur r 0 24 p 0 05 morigaon r 0 55 p 0 01 and sivasagar r 0 49 p 0 01 table 5 phosphate in the shallow aquifers showed positive relationship with u in jorhat r 0 26 p 0 05 and sivasagar r 0 57 p 0 01 table 5 pointing towards probable common sources in the tea cultivated districts it was observed that u exhibited most of the significant correlations in the shallow aquifers compared to that of the deeper aquifers table 5 such relationships revealed that the shallow aquifers provide more feasible environment for interaction of u with other groundwater parameters suggesting suitability for its mobilization mechanisms similar observation for favourable mobilization of u in shallow aquifers were observed by sahoo et al 2021 in punjab the probable factor for u mobilization was however the salt effect exhibited by interionic competition 3 4 evaluation of hydrogeochemical processes concentration of different major elements and their inter relationships often serve as a tool to understand the hydrogeochemical processes involved in controlling the chemistry of the aquifers facies in the groundwater system reflect the interaction between the mineral phase and its hydro phase often times groundwater flow pattern influence and contributes to its ionic distribution kumar and singh 2015 identification of dominant hydrogeochemical facies in a broader sense may sometimes however be difficult due to the involvement of individual hydrogeochemical facies of secondary recharges dano 2010 the piper plot is used as a tool for identification of the dominant hydrogeochemical facies of a study area the plot fig 5 in our study referred to mg hco3 to be the dominant water type about 61 7 n 311 of the total samples had mg hco3 as dominant water type morigaon showed the highest occurrence of this water type 82 2 followed by sivasagar 81 1 nagaon 66 7 lakhimpur 53 2 jorhat 49 3 and sonitpur 47 7 the other water types were ca hco3 19 2 na hco3 14 1 mg cl 2 k hco3 1 2 ca cl 1 na cl 0 6 and mg so4 0 2 the mg hco3 water type often has dolomite dissolution as its primary source equation 7 garrels 1976 7 camg co 3 2 2 h 2 co 2 ca 2 mg 2 4 hc o 3 1 dolomite dissolution the prevalence of na hco3 water type implied for a significant occurrence of silicate weathering and ionic exchange processes in the aquifers on the association of water types to u concentration it was revealed that five out of six samples having u values above 5 μgl 1 belonged to mghco3 water type while one sample had nahco3 water type this observation clearly indicated towards the favourable desorption of u during dolomite carbonate dissolution more insight into the dominant hydrogeochemical processes determining water types and their association with u desorption is provided in the later sections the gibb s plots gibbs 1970 prepared by plotting the ionic ratios of na k na k ca2 fig 6 a and cl cl hco3 fig 6b versus tds of groundwater provides three zones of dominant hydrogeochemical process viz evaporation weathering and rainfall dominance geographical location as such is one of the significant factors affecting groundwater quality beck et al 1985 the plots in this study indicated the dominant occurrence of rock weathering to primarily regulate the groundwater ionic chemistry information on the influence of climate on groundwater composition can also be extracted from the ec versus na cl plot fig 7 a the plot signifies the influence of evaporation on aquifer ionic composition jankowski and acworth 1997 which may have some effects in a sub tropical region like the study area in the plot dominance of evaporation is indicated by a parallel trend line which is achieved possibly due to the absence of mineral precipitation senthilkumar and elango 2013 an inclined trend line in the plot indicated the absence of influence of evaporation on groundwater composition implying occurrence of other hydrogeochemical processes like ionic exchanges prasanna et al 2011 an absence of evaporation was observed over groundwater ionic composition as indicated by inclined trendlines in all the locations an additional observation that can be reasoned from the plot is either increase or decrease of na cl with respect to ec decreasing trend in the plot explained the removal of na from groundwater implying the occurrence of reverse ion exchange processes rajmohan and elango 2004 zhu et al 2008 as observed for morigaon the rest of the locations showed an increasing trend indicating an excess of na possibly due to the occurrence of ion exchange processes intensity of occurrence of a particular weathering type often determines the concentration of the major ions silicate and carbonate weathering cover a broad spectrum of mineral weathering and primarily governs the concentration of major cations and anions the extent of such weathering processes can be evaluated using the so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 plot the plot is also helpful in analysing the cationic exchange type when the points in the plot lie above the 1 1 line it indicates excess of so4 2 and hco3 over ca2 and mg2 referring to dominant occurrence of silicate weathering and ion exchange processes datta and tyagi 1996 points below the 1 1 line in the plot refer to dominant occurrence of carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes having an excess of ca2 and mg2 concentration cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 the plot fig 7b prepared for the study area revealed the dominant occurrence of silicate weathering processes about 77 n 59 73 n 58 56 n 25 68 n 69 79 n 71 and 90 n 100 samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had an excess of so4 2 and hco3 over ca2 and mg2 which supported silicate mineral dissolution and ion exchange identification of dominance of ion exchange or reverse ion exchange can also be evaluated from the na versus cl plot fig 7c the plot also implies the identification of major sources of na in groundwater when the points in the plot lie above the 1 1 line it indicates na from ion exchange processes and silicate weathering reddy et al 2010 stallard and edmond 1983 the points on the 1 1 line indicates na from halite dissolution while points below the 1 1 line indicate na removal due to processes such as reverse ion exchange rajmohan and elango 2004 senthilkumar and elango 2013 in the study area about 57 n 44 63 n 50 62 n 28 86 n 88 61 n 55 and 42 n 47 sample points from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had an excess of na over cl indicating na release from silicate weathering and ion exchange mechanisms fig 7c sodium from halite dissolution was observed in only two samples from lakhimpur and one sample each from morigaon and sonitpur the saturation state of the mineral is studied in the further section the rest of the samples lie below the 1 1 line in the plot fig 7c the dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater of the study area can be assessed using the ca2 mg2 versus sample numbers fig 7d the values in the ratio i e ca2 mg2 less than or equal to one indicated sources from dolomite dissolution the ratio greater than one refers to calcite dissolution as the dominant source mayo and loucks 1995 while that greater than two refers to the sources of ca2 and mg2 to be silicate dissolution katz et al 1997 the plot indicated that the dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the study area was dolomite dissolution as 69 n 53 59 n 47 89 n 40 86 n 88 93 n 84 and 63 n 70 of the samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had ca2 mg2 less than or equal to one calcite dissolution served as the second dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater of the study area about 27 n 21 31 n 24 9 n 4 11 n 11 6 n 5 and 33 n 37 samples from jorhat lakhimpur morigaon nagaon sivasagar and sonitpur had ca2 mg2 greater than one saturation states of calcite and dolomite are studied in further section 3 5 mineral saturation states controlling groundwater hydrogeochemistry saturation states of minerals impart thermodynamic control on their dissolution or precipitation oversaturation leading to mineral precipitation results in a general lowering of elemental concentration such situations many times pull for dissolution of another mineral containing a common element in order to attain elemental equilibrium states equilibrium pulls between calcite and fluorite containing the common element ca is an example of such well known phenomenon chae et al 2006 edmunds and smedley 2013 gogoi et al 2021 handa 1975 saxena and ahmed 2001 elemental undersaturation is the most feasible drive for dissolution of its mineral phases in order to understand the role of saturation states on the ionic composition of groundwater si values of calcite dolomite gypsum and halite were calculated table 6 the results showed a dominant undersaturated condition for all the considered minerals saturation index values for calcite in the study ranged between 4 5 and 3 63 the most undersaturated condition for the mineral was calculated for jorhat while the most oversaturated value was found for lakhimpur amidst the dominant undersaturated condition oversaturation of calcite was found in 2 13 2 12 and 8 groundwater samples from nagaon jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar and sonitpur respectively oversaturated values for dolomite were found in 11 4 17 2 27 and 11 groundwater samples from nagaon morigaon jorhat lakhimpur sivasagar and sonitpur the si values of the mineral ranged between 8 62 and 8 1 the most undersaturation being in jorhat while the most oversaturated value was for lakhimpur undersaturated calcite and dolomite leading to their dissolution is hence the most dominant source of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater of the study area gypsum dissolution in groundwater is a common source of ca2 and so4 2 in groundwater the calculated si values for the mineral ranged between 4 36 and 3 53 the mineral was mostly undersaturated with only one sample each from jorhat and lakhimpur having oversaturated values halite is a common mineral source of na and cl specially near the coastal zones however in an inland region like the study area it is not a dominant source for the elements saturation state for the mineral is however entirely undersaturated in the study area a few samples from lakhimpur morigaon and sonitpur showing halite dissolution fig 7c may be due to the highly undersaturated state of the mineral geological abundance may however be a limiting factor for the mineral 3 6 uranium association with saturation states of the minerals the u in the groundwater of the study area is associated with the weathering of the geological strata its link with saturation state of common hydrogeology controlling minerals can therefore help detect the path of its release and mobilization the correlation matrix of u with the si values of the minerals table 7 showed that it had significant relationship with dolomite r 0 30 p 0 05 gypsum r 0 31 p 0 05 in morigaon and calcite r 0 22 p 0 05 dolomite r 0 26 p 0 05 in sivasagar the observation is supportive of the findings from the former relationship between higher u concentrations and carbonate water types there are reports about the association of u with dissolution of dolomite and gypsum in other sedimentary aquifers kabir et al 2014 paik et al 2007 correlation of u with such ca2 bearing minerals further implied the formation of calcium uranyl carbonates which render increased mobility of u in groundwater thereby reducing its adsorption efficiency fox et al 2006 nair and merkel 2011 it is hence revealed that desorption of u from ca2 bearing minerals triggered by mineral undersaturation is a dominant u mobilization mechanism in the study area tables 6 and 7 adoption of speciation modelling can further throw more insight into the predominant complex formations and their potential mobilizations the amount of release is however a function of abundance in the geological matrix 3 7 health risk estimation of uranium in groundwater cancer mortality and morbidity give the number of deaths and prevalence of unhealthy state respectively in a population because of cancer in the present study the ecr values for mortality and morbidity ranged from 0 to 14 14 10 6 and 0 to 21 86 10 6 respectively table 8 the highest value for ecr mortality and morbidity was observed in the nagaon district however the value at 10 6 indicates the population to be safe from radiological risk compared to the accepted permissible limit of 10 3 kim et al 2004 chemical risk assessment of u is performed by calculating ladd and hq values in the sampling locations ladd values in all the samples ranged from 0 to 0 27 μg 1kg 1day table 8 which is well below the recommended limit of 1 0 μg 1kg 1day aerb 2004 who 2011 hq values calculated using reference dose ranged from 0 to 0 44 table 8 is found to be well below the recommended value of hazard 1 0 as proposed by aerb aerb 2004 and who who 2011 this indicated the absence of toxicity risk due to u ingestion in groundwater the overall age dependent effective dose values due to ingestion of u through drinking water pathways ranged from 0 2 to 21 1 μsvy 1 table 9 which is well below the prescribed limit of 100 μsvy 1 who 2011 the highest effective dose value was observed in nagaon owing to the highest groundwater u concentration females during pregnancy and lactation had higher effective dose levels probably due to consumption of more water during that period sharma et al 2019 the effective dose values for females during lactation period ranged from 0 to 5 9 μsvy 1 in jorhat 0 to 8 1 μsvy 1 in lakhimpur 0 to 14 5 μsvy 1 in morigaon 0 2 to 21 1 μsvy 1 in nagaon 0 to 3 3 μsvy 1 sivasagar and 0 to 9 2 μsvy 1 in sonitpur district respectively male population had higher effective dose values compared to females due to more consumption of water patra et al 2013 yadav et al 2014 4 conclusion the river brahmaputra is considered as a life line by the people of assam which offers an extensive fertile plain along both its banks the present study on groundwater u in the floodplain is a new venture although its levels are found to be well within the prescribed permissible limits the ph condition in the floodplain varied from acidic to alkaline both reduced and oxic groundwater environments prevail in the region jorhat had the most reduced and nagaon the most oxic higher f levels above the prescribed limits were detected in the floodplain the highest prevalence was in sonitpur this fact leaves another scope for this study to unveil more of f contamination in the floodplain dominance of mg hco3 ca hco3 and na hco3 revealed the occurrence both carbonate and silicate weathering processes which is further supported by the graphical plots of the major ions a comparative assessment showed silicate weathering and ion exchange mechanism to be dominant over carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange mechanism a dominant undersaturated condition prevails for calcite dolomite gypsum and halite minerals in the floodplain suggesting their significant role in associated elemental richness the u mobilization in the floodplain is revealed to be favoured by carbonate dissolution processes correlations of u with groundwater parameters at different depths further implied that shallow aquifers of the floodplain provide feasibility for the release of u from soluble uranyl carbonates adoption of laboratory experiments and speciation modelling will however be instrumental to unravel more of the release and mobilization mechanisms in the sedimentary floodplain the u health risk assessment implied its current absence among the floodplain population future assessment and monitoring are always advisable the work however leaves additional scope to carry out study on the health aspect of other elements like the f which is above the permissible limit in several places of the floodplain the work carried out in the extensive plain is thus insightful with its own advantages and limitations funding board of research in nuclear sciences brns department of atomic energy dae

11803,groundwater circulation in fractured aquifer systems is a topic of worldwide interest as they are heterogeneous and peculiar environments in brazil little is known about the groundwater flow within fractured rocks this knowledge gap motivated the investigation of 1 the statistical variance of the exploited discharges and their relationship with the directions of geological lineaments 2 the analyzes of the relationship between of the groundwater flow with the different characteristics of the discontinuities and 3 the correlation between the acting stresses with the fracturing geometries that present groundwater flow to reach these objectives this paper is circumscribed within the following methods frequency graphs normality assumptions test non parametric homogeneity tests multiple correspondence analysis scanline profiles and in situ stress analysis this study was carried out in the serra geral fractured aquifer system in caxias do sul rio grande do sul brazil the results showed that most the exploited water wells are associated with the nw se and ne sw lineament directions there was a predominance of four sets of subvertical fractures s1 s2 s3 and s4 and one sub horizontal s5 sets of fractures s3 s4 and s5 showed the greatest persistence of fractures and presence of exudation the tension axes σ1 and σ3 were identified in the 310 113 141 and 218 020 051 directions respectively the groundwater circulation in sets of fractures s3 and s4 is related to tensions σ1 and σ3 and the most exploited lineament directions nw se and ne sw while s5 is correlated to tension σ2 and behaves as a facilitator of the groundwater circulation in the underground flow network graphical abstract image 1 keywords fractured aquifer groundwater flow sgas discontinuities paleo tension 1 introduction due to its singularity the hydraulic behavior of fractured aquifers requires great efforts to understand it it is difficult to interpret the hydraulic connectivity between the fractures however there are some intrinsic parameters to the rock fracturing that can represent the behavior of the groundwater flow in the fractures such as fracture density length geometry connectivity infill weathering as well as the effects of the in situ stress field coli and pinzani 2014 liu et al 2016 mortimer et al 2011a the circulation of groundwater in fractured rock has been studied worldwide and considerable progress has been made on understanding fracture aperture in this system akoachere and van tonder 2009 hakami 1995 kishida et al 2013 pan et al 2011 the spatial orientation of the fracture sets aperture spacing and absolute roughness of the planes are the main parameters of the discontinuities that influence the movement of groundwater flow azevedo and filho 1998 moreover renshaw 1996 indicated the density of fractures as one of the most important parameters to be considered however the density should be measured along with the aperture and spatial orientation liu et al 2016 indicated that the fracture length distribution is the most important parameter in calculating the permeability of fracture networks with the aperture being related to its fracture length even though the increase in normal fracture stress causes a decrease in hydraulic aperture cao et al 2016 roughness is considered another important parameter in the assessment of hydraulic conductivity in fractures barton et al 1985 cao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ni et al 2018 and the scale in which the hydraulic conductivity is measured deserves special attention when assessing the fracture network connectivity because such connectivity can occur from meters to kilometers hsieh and shapiro 1996 shapiro et al 2007 2015 tiedeman et al 1998 tiedeman and hsieh 2001 the relationship between the fracture permeability and the in situ stress field is another important factor in understanding groundwater flow behavior barton et al 1995 ferrill et al 1999 according to mortimer et al 2011b the in situ stress change alters the fracture geometry and the groundwater flow network connectivity in shallow fractures up to 200 m enabling the change in the magnitude heterogeneity and anisotropy of the groundwater storage permeability and groundwater flow pattern the effects of the in situ acting stress field unloading weathering and uplift change the original distribution of fracture densities and hydraulic apertures in shallow groundwater systems as they increase spatial heterogeneity mortimer et al 2011a other studies addressing hydromechanics in fractured rocks were also carried out by berkowitz 2002 earnest and boutt 2014 jing 2003 rouleau and galet 1987 and rutqvist and stephansson 2003 in brazil few are the studies on fractured aquifers that relate the circulation and the availability of groundwater to the fracture system fernandes et al 2011 2016 hausman 1966 1995 reginato and strieder 2006a regarding the groundwater flow in the fissured system some knowledge gaps are worth mentioning firstly there is no information about the statistical variance of the exploited discharges and their relationship with the directions of geological lineaments secondly little is known regarding the relationship between the groundwater flow with the different characteristics of the discontinuities finally the correlation between the acting stresses with the fracturing geometries that present groundwater flow is unknown this is also the case of the serra geral fractured aquifer system sgas southern brazil where there are few studies characterizing the underground water circulation which makes it an original investigation site motivated by these knowledge gaps this research focus on a portion of the sgas to investigate the variability of discharges in the main directions of the lineaments the second objective of this work is to analyze the correlation between groundwater flow and discontinuities addressing the following parameters fracture orientation persistence number of fracture sets spacing roughness aperture and water exudation finally this study aims to relate the effects of acting stresses with the preferential groundwater flow in the fractures 1 1 area of study and geological background the area of study is located in the metropolitan region of the city of caxias do sul 3900 km2 northeastern sector of the state of rio grande do sul southern brazil fig 1 i ii and iii this study site is in the geological framework of the paraná basin that holds the são bento group this group includes the sedimentary units of the guará and botucatu formations and the volcanic package of the serra geral formation which is related to the opening of the south atlantic the lithologies that constitute the volcanic package are represented by basalts gramado facies at the base of the sequence while in the upper portion rhyodacites rhyolites and dacites from the palmas and chapecó facies are identified bellieni et al 1984 1986 roisenberg and viero 2000 and vitrophyres from the várzea do cedro facies cprm 2011 fig 1iii the acid portion of volcanism in the serra geral formation occurs predominantly as volcaniclastic units related to ignimbrites models roisenberg and viero 2000 with local records of domes whose areal distribution is quite restricted presenting petrographic and geochemical patterns typical of an effusive eruptive style lima et al 2012 2018 the northeast region of rio grande do sul demonstrates the existence of six volcanic flows of basic rocks and three main ones of acid rocks reginato 2003 in the city of caxias do sul bressani et al 2004 characterized four acid type volcanic fluxes superimposed on gramado facies 1 2 structural background the tectonic history of the paraná basin is influenced by several orogenetic cycles that affected the two precambrian units of the sul rio grandense shield the rio de la plata craton and the dom feliciano belt picada 1972 observed that the geotectonic units of the sul rio grandense shield include the dorsal de canguçu n35 75e passo do marinheiro n5w and n15e açotéia piquiri n30e and northwest n65 75w fault systems according to nummer et al 2014 the first two systems are directional residual faults while the third is a graben type rift valley relevant studies in the paraná basin identified predominant lineament directions that refer to the structural context equivalent to n30 70e n30 60w nne and nnw fernandes et al 2011 fiume 2013 soares et al 2007 zalán et al 1990 the structural pattern of fracture direction recognized through the investigation of outcrops in the northeast region of rio grande do sul demonstrates predominant directions n70 90e and secondary directions n20 30w and n80 90w reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b in addition to transcurrent geological faults dextral and sinistral with preferred ne sw directions followed by nw se and e w orientations nummer et al 2014 in the same region two main tensional fields were observed the first with a horizontal σ1 compression direction of 82 orientation and a horizontal σ3 traction direction of 352 orientation while the second shows compression direction σ1 equal to 174 and traction direction 264 reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b in the region of caxias do sul the ne sw lineaments are predominant with the nw se and e w lineaments being less expressive betiollo 2006 in addition n40e oriented lineaments are related to the geological model of structural patterns of the dom feliciano mobile belt and with the ne sw fault system frasca and lisboa 1993 nummer et al 2014 part of the influence of these structural patterns are regionally represented by the canguçu dorsal fault system fig 1iii in which the caxias fault is inserted the caxias fault crosses the limits of the city of caxias do sul having a general n30e direction and an approximate length of 70 km this fault was described by lisboa et al 2003 who verified a drawdown of approximately 100 m between the lowered block to the west and the uplifted one to the east 1 3 hydrogeological background the regional hydrogeological context includes the guarani and serra geral aquifer systems the guarani aquifer system gas is a granular aquifer and regionally it suffers structural control through the main depocenters of the paraná basin regional and local faults reactivation of the arches and thermal uplifts lisboa et al 2003 and it is below the sgas sgas can be divided into porous unconfined and fractured aquifers the porous aquifer is located in the weathered layer over the volcanic rocks of the serra geral formation this aquifer has the following factors as its main constraints soil type and thickness topography lithology type composition and structuring of the rock and climate reginato 2003 the conceptual model indicates that water stored in this aquifer infiltrates and circulates through the fractures that act as water pathways to the saturated zone of the sgas bortolin 2018 hausman 1966 reginato 2003 however the conceptual model of the sgas is conditioned to the serra geral formation presenting water circulation in tectonic structures which may or may not be influenced by the primary structures the circulation and storage of groundwater in the rocks of the serra geral formation occur in fractures originating from horizontal disjunctions from contacts between volcanic flows and in vesicular and amygdaloid zones being the zones of vertical and subvertical open fractures which cross the different volcanic flows the path for water percolation to the saturation zone freitas 2016 reginato et al 2015 the sgas is divided into sgas i and sgas ii the latter is where caxias do sul is located on according to reginato 2003 this aquifer system has an average transmissivity t of 0 493 m2 h 1 and an average specific capacity q of 0 395 m3 h 1 m 1 this author also explains that the high variability found in the values of transmissivity and specific capacity is in accordance with the type of aquifer fractured reflecting strong anisotropy the hydrodynamic parameters observed by reginato 2003 show that most of the discharges analyzed in the sgas 72 1 have values below 10 m3 h 1 while 18 6 are between 10 and 20 m3 h 1 and only 9 3 presented values above 20 m3 h 1 de vargas et al 2018 obtained a similar groundwater exploitation in the city of caxias do sul 71 below 10 m3 h 1 18 between 10 and 20 m3 h 1 and 11 above 20 m3 h 1 2 methodology the methodological framework is divided into three investigative segments the first segment focus on the discharge of water wells in the metropolitan region of the city of caxias do sul while the second is related to the first fracture waterflow zone fwz of the water wells and the parameters described in the scanline profiles in quarry benches outcrops a b of fig 1a b the third segment corresponds to the analysis of the stress effects acting on groundwater flow outcrops a d of fig 1a d data corresponding to outcrop c were extracted from lazzari 2020 fracture orientations were collected in the field in clar s notation dip direction but were converted to strike plane direction in the scanline data analysis data from water wells such as discharge and altimetry of the first fwz were obtained from data made available from 333 water wells by the public water and wastewater service of caxias do sul samae and from 72 water wells by the groundwater information system siagas of the brazilian geological service water wells cprm 2009 2 1 first investigative segment water well discharge in this segment of the research the discharge values of 405 exploited water wells were correlated with the directions of 239 lineaments which cover an interval of 45 to each other n s 337 5 22 5 157 5 202 5 ne sw 22 5 67 5 202 5 247 5 e w 67 5 112 5 247 5 292 5 and nw se 292 5 337 5 112 5 157 5 this correlation was carried out on a scale of 1 30 000 selecting the water wells observed over the lineaments or in their zone of influence 300 m buffer using arcgis 10 7 1 software the lineaments were identified using the hillshade format of the digital terrain model topo to raster with an altimetric range of 5 m caxias do sul 2018 with 45 solar incidence azimuth directions in 0 45 90 and 135 at a scale of 1 30 000 and their length was calculated in the software arcgis 10 7 1 the direction frequencies and length of the lineaments were analyzed using a rosette diagram with petals of 7 5 using the rockworks 16 software otherwise the lineament lengths were classified into three sizes small 2 km medium 2 4 km and large 4 km tomasi and roisenberg 2019 statistical analysis of discharge rates was performed using frequency graphs assumption of normality test shapiro wilk with 95 confidence interval α 0 05 and homogeneity tests for non parametric data kruskal wallis and chi square considering ρ value 0 05 these tests were performed in the statistica tibco software the frequency graphs were segregated into 5 classes 5 5 01 10 10 01 15 15 01 20 and 20 m3 h 1 a detailed description of these statistical methods can be found in larson and farber 2010 and shapiro and wilk 1965 finally the null hypothesis test applying the non parametric methods was elaborated as follows ho the discharge variances of the four directions are homogeneous ρ 0 05 not rejected ha the discharge variances of the four directions are not homogeneous ρ 0 05 rejected 2 2 second investigative segment first fwz and scanline this step considered the most frequent altimetric ranges in relation to mean sea level in the first fwz of 259 water wells first fwz was selected from the public water and wastewater service samae of the city of caxias do sul where there is a municipal register of water wells these intervals were used as a reference for choosing outcrops a and b in these outcrops 10 scanline profiles were performed positioned longitudinally to the inactive extraction benches resulting in 119 measurements of fractures each profile considered the following parameters orientation persistence number of fracture sets mean density equation 1 mean spacing equation 2 roughness undulation filling material aperture state of alteration orientation of kinematic indicators and water exudation the systematic survey of these parameters was based on the field spreadsheet model by magalhães and cella 1998 and definitions of each parameter can be found in barton and choubey 1977 and priest and hudson 1981 the scanline extention depends upon the dimension of the observation wall and upon the occurrence of fractures and there is no single sampling procedure priest 1993 the scanline methodology is consolidated in the literature as it is possible to obtain detail in manda and mabee 2010 and priest 1993 the amplitude of the roughness was measured longitudinally in the direction of the dip of the fracture plane using a field profilometer thus subsidizing data to estimate the joint roughness coefficient jcr through the abacus of barton and bandis 1982 1 d fractures in se t i profile length giving in meters 2 sp spacing in se t i profile length giving in centimeters the data set corresponding to the parameters of the fractures evaluated in the scanlines outcrops a b was analyzed by descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis mca using the statistica tibco software in this statistical analysis the most relevant parameters to understand the water circulation in fractures were correlated to the same intervals applied to the directions of the lineaments 45 to each other on the other hand outcrops c and d were not included in this investigative segment because the scanline profiles did not consider the roughness parameter however the outcrops c and d were fundamental in the analysis of the third investigative segment which addresses the tensions acting in the evaluated region mca evaluates the degree of association between variables by using lines and columns in a multidimensional contigency table graphic representation of this table displays the dependence between the lines and columns being applied for individuals variables categories and categories individuals greenacre 1993 le roux and rouanet 2010 this statistical approach seeks the similarity among individuals with common characteristics respecting the euclidean space and the indicator matrix z with i rows and j1 j2 columns and is partitioned as z z1 z2 so that z z 1 t z 2 greenacre 1993 the mca methodology can be verified in detail in greenacre 1993 and le roux and rouanet 2010 2 3 third investigative segment active tension this segment addresses the identification of in situ stresses according to mioto et al 2018 the most common geological or geostructural techniques for stress determination are based on the analysis of striated planes of small faults measuring the attitude of the plane striation and the direction of movement of each plane stria pair the general principle is to start from the relative motion of each plane stria to deduce the shear stress orientation and determine the stress tensor arthaud 1969 was the pioneer in using the stereogram but the graphic technique established by angelier and mechler 1977 is the most used to obtain the σ1 σ2 and σ3 directions from this technique also known as straight dihedrals four dihedrals are defined for each fault of a population of discontinuities that were subjected alternately to shortening and stretching during the movement the spatial representation of the relationships between the attitudes of the geological structures present in the massif and the attitudes of the slopes was represented by the schmidt lambert diagram using the dips version 5 1 program to determine the paleo tension axes the wintensor software version 5 8 9 was used which allows the representation of the fault striation planes paleo tensions indicate the direction of movement in the projection and based on the criterion of straight dihedrals compressive and distensive define positions for the axes of the stress ellipsoid for the set of faults 3 results the results are analyzed following the sequence of the investigative segments described in the methodology sections 3 1 and 3 2 correspond to the first segment while sections 3 3 and 3 4 refer to the second section 3 5 is related to the third segment 3 1 association between discharges and geological lineaments the distribution of exploited water wells in relation to the lineaments and the study area shows a high concentration of water wells in the central southwest region where there is greater urbanization fig 2 a 239 lineaments associated with 405 exploited water wells were identified the rosette diagram fig 2b indicates that the large lineaments occur with highest incidence in the following order ne sw 54 nw se 32 e w 13 and n s 2 the directions of the medium sized lineaments are more relevant for ne sw 55 and nw se 35 while e w 5 and n s 5 are not expressive for the small lineaments however a change in dominance is observed nw se 49 ne sw 31 n s 14 and e w 7 the rosette diagram fig 2c shows the frequency of occurrence of the azimuths for the ne sw 101 nw se 99 n s 21 and e w 18 directions considering the different sizes for the same direction it is observed that the frequencies of the small lineaments are remarkably dominant in the n s 81 and nw se 60 directions while the ne sw shows a distribution uniform for the three sizes large 30 medium 34 and small 37 finally the e w frequency is more relevant for small 44 and large 39 sizes the waterwell discharge frequency analysis showed a higher incidence of cases in class 1 5 m3 h 1 representing 59 of the cases in the n s direction 55 in the e w 51 in the ne sw and 44 in the nw se the drastic drop in frequency is pronounced in the subsequent classes that present higher discharge rates in the n s and e w directions there is a relatively subtle decrease in frequency from class 1 to 4 in the ne sw and nw se directions class 5 demonstrates a slight increase in the frequency of discharge above 20 m3 h 1 representing 10 ne sw and 11 nw se of the cases fig 3 in most cases there is a decrease in the frequency of water wells as the discharge rates of class intervals increase the ne sw and nw se directions when compared to the n s and e w present a significantly higher number of occurrences of exploited water wells in all evaluated classes there is a highlight for class 5 20 m3 h 1 which shows 21 times more occurrences of water wells in the nw se direction than n s and 16 times more cases in the ne sw direction than n s this difference in occurrence between the n s direction and the ne sw and nw se directions tends to decrease as the discharge rate decreases from class 5 to 1 table 1 furthermore the difference in occurrences of water wells between the e w direction and the ne sw and nw se directions does not tend to decrease from class 5 to class 1 however a relevant increase in frequency is observed in classes 2 and 3 for nw se vs e w 12 3 and 9 7 times while for ne sw vs e w 9 3 times only in class 2 table 1 the nw se vs ne sw relationship did not show any relevant difference in the quantity of water wells observed in the five classes these observational data suggest greater groundwater flow and high discharge frequency in the nw se and ne sw directions the relationship between the discharge rates above 20 m³ h 1 with the size of the lineaments proved to be revealing the ne sw direction presented 16 lineaments with this discharge range being 47 medium size and 53 large size this trend of the higher percentage of water wells being in large scale and then medium sized lineaments is also identified for other discharge intervals 5 01 10 10 01 15 15 01 20 m³ h 1 except for 5 m³ h 1 which occur in greater percentage in the large and later small and medium 20 lineaments were identified in the nw se direction with water wells showing discharge above 20 m³ h 1 with 60 of these lineaments being small 30 medium and 10 large therefore most of these water wells nw se are associated with lineaments of up to 2 km in length the other discharge intervals also showed a trend towards higher percentages of water wells in small size lineaments 3 2 sample variance of discharges in all the discharge data a large interval between the minimum and maximum value is observed table 2 this difference is consistent with fractured aquifer systems due to heterogeneity and anisotropy reginato 2003 reginato et al 2015 reginato and strieder 2006a testing the assumption of normality and homogeneity of the discharge values considered the four directions of lineaments already worked on in the previous sections in the n s and e w directions the smallest sample groups were identified 27 and 29 water wells respectively the most representative groups were observed in the ne sw 155 water wells and nw se 194 water wells directions fig 4 shows that the four directions have similar average discharge and overlap between confidence intervals in addition to outliers in the n s ne sw and nw se directions these outliers can be indicative of the lack of normality of the sampled values which requires the verification of these values through an assumption of normality test the shapiro wilk assumption of normality test applied to the discharge values of the selected water wells showed positive asymmetry and significance value ρ 0 05 ρ 0 00 for the four directions this lack of normality of the data led to the application of non parametric methodologies to assess the homogeneity of the sample variance between the observed values the first tested methodology kruskal wallis showed ρ 0 05 table 2 the significance value ρ 0 05 indicates that the null hypothesis test was not rejected ho this result is reinforced by the chi square x2 method which also presented ρ 0 05 ho table 2 x2 3 6845 degree of freedom equal to 3 and critical value x2 o 7 815 both the kruskal wallis and the chi square methods show that the observed discharge variances in each direction are similar that is they have a similar dispersion in relation to the respective discharge average the overlapping of confidence intervals between the 4 directions fig 4 corroborates as an indication that there is no significant difference between the variances therefore these results of dispersive character with high and low discharge oscillations show a similar behavior of discharge heterogeneity in the serra geral aquifer system regardless of the lineament direction 3 3 analysis of scanline profiles the selection of outcrops a and b was based on the determination of the altimetry with the highest frequency of occurrence of the first fwz the analysis of this frequency considered the distribution of the selected water wells into two groups west and east from the caxias fault the west group 104 water wells showed 10 frequency classes with the highest frequencies observed between the 575 and 697 m altimetry fig 5 a the eastern group 155 water wells had 12 frequency classes the highest frequency values fig 5b were observed in classes 10 and 11 54 of cases which were located between 638 and 777 m there is an overlap between the altimetric values of the first fwz of the west classes 5 and 6 and east class 10 groups which marks a preferred altimetric range of the first fwz in the sgas however class 11 in the east group has a high frequency 40 cases while in a similar altimetric range the west group shows a drastic reduction this difference of approximately 80 m between class 6 western block and class 11 eastern block may be related to the drawdown of the west block of the caxias fault which was described by lisboa et al 2003 in the selected outcrops seven scanline profiles were performed a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 in outcrop a and three b1 b2 b3 in outcrop b these profiles ranged between 5 and 23 m in length and have n s ne sw and nw se directions fig 1a and b in outcrop a the altimetry ranged between 745 and 780 m while in outcrop b it ranged from 610 to 620 m in the entire scanline mapping four subvertical sets of fractures were identified set 1 s1 n s set 2 s2 e w set 3 s3 ne sw and set 4 s4 nw se in addition to these four sets sub horizontal fractures were identified as set 5 s5 among the 119 attitudes identified in the scanline profiles s1 is represented by 13 of the attitudes while the other sets are equivalent to s2 34 s3 12 s4 11 and s5 30 in the evaluated profiles scanline a2 stands out where the contact between the acid volcanic flows carijó and canyon was identified the first flow superimposed on the second fig 6 a contacts between volcanic flows are important features as they may be related to preferential water circulation as identified by fernandes et al 2016 and reginato et al 2015 another relevant point was observed in the a6 and b1 scanlines which showed striae of e w dextral shear movement fig 6b 3 3 1 density spacing and weathering parameters the analysis of mean density and mean spacing of subvertical fractures showed that outcrop a has greater density and smaller spacing than outcrop b for s1 and s2 table 3 s2 in scanline a5 showed a higher density of subvertical fractures 1 04 and frequency of association between discontinuities spacing 5 cm furthermore the determination of the mean density 0 36 and mean spacing 230 cm of fractures in s3 was only quantifiable in outcrop b while s4 was identified in outcrop a with an mean density of 0 36 and mean spacing of 192 cm table 3 both sets s3 and s4 presented the same mean fracture density value but with different mean spacing the s5 fractures revealed chaotic directions along the scanlines with this behavior being recurrent in most profiles despite a considerable part of the planes occurring in the ne sw and n s directions the highest mean density of these fractures was observed in outcrop a 0 42 as well as the highest number of associations between the discontinuities this chaotic scenario suggests that fracture directions follow the direction of volcanic flow and are together generated by cooling however in the a3 profile a greater number of sub horizontal n s fractures was observed reflecting the fracture density of 0 78 table 3 based on chaplow 1975 and nummer et al 2003 it is possible to classify the range of mean density values of subvertical and sub horizontal fractures identified in outcrops a and b as occasionally fractured the most advanced state of weathering identified in the fracture planes and in the rock was moderately altered in profiles a1 a2 a5 and a6 with most cases in s1 and s2 also in fig 7 a the change in the a6 profile can be seen in ocher color in an area with smaller spacing of subvertical fractures of s2 suggesting greater groundwater flow locally also in this area of fractures the dextral shear movement shown in fig 6b was identified however in the average of data from outcrops a and b s3 and s4 were classified as slightly altered or unchanged in addition filled fractures were observed in s1 24 s2 88 s3 43 and s4 46 quartz clay and oxides were identified as the most frequent fillings the first being identified in most cases in s2 fractures carbonate minerals filling the fracture planes of s2 and s3 have rarely been identified in relation to sub horizontal fractures figs 7b 10 of the s5 fractures n s and 9 of the remaining s5 chaotic fractures were filled 3 3 2 aperture persistence exudation and roughness parameters the parameters aperture persistence exudation and roughness are represented in fig 8 considering the data set of outcrops a and b fracture aperture 0 5 mm showed a high percentage of occurrence in all fracture sets s1 83 s2 78 s3 71 s4 85 and s5 56 also a relevant percentage of the aperture of fractures s5 32 between 0 5 and 0 99 mm was identified while the subvertical ones were less expressive s1 6 s2 5 s3 14 s4 15 fig 8a the subvertical structures s1 s2 and s3 represent 11 15 and 14 respectively of the aperture measurements in the range of 1 0 1 99 mm these fracture sets show a marked decrease in cases with an aperture 0 5 mm except for the s5 fractures which present approximately 1 3 of the measures with an aperture between 0 5 and 0 99 mm as the fracture persistence interval increases fig 8b s2 shows an increase in frequencies in its occurrence the interval 5 0 m represents 58 of the measurements similar behavior to s2 is identified in s4 which also demonstrates the trend of increasing cases towards the longest persistence interval 5 0 m 46 s3 shows an ascent and decreasing behavior with increasing fracture length being observed in the intervals 0 5 0 99 14 1 0 1 99 36 2 0 4 99 14 and 5 0 m 36 s1 and s5 have more uniform frequencies between the persistence intervals above 1 0 m with the interval 5 0 m with the highest percentage of measurements s1 38 and s5 35 fractures s1 61 s2 45 and s3 43 in the exudation parameter show the highest frequency values in the dry classification fig 8c these sets reveal a trend towards a reduction in cases as the proportions of water in the fractures increase s4 46 and s5 41 have the highest percentage of cases in the moist classification this classification also showed relevant values in the fractures of s3 36 and s2 35 the perspiration classification was identified with considerable frequency in s4 31 in contrast s5 portrays the same percentage of cases 24 for dry and dripping classifications the analysis of roughness indices jrc in the identified fractures sets fig 8d showed that in s3 57 and s5 32 index 4 is the most frequent s4 shows the highest frequency of cases for index 8 31 while s1 had the highest roughness indices 12 16 and 20 finally s2 showed a more uniform distribution of the jrc indices 3 4 multivariate statistics the multiple correspondence analysis between the scanline parameters showed that in outcrop b there is correspondence of the values of persistence 1 1 99 2 4 99 m and aperture 0 5 mm with fractures of s2 and s4 fig 9 a when the exudation parameter is entered the grouping of these parameters is maintained except for the aperture 0 5 mm also perspiration presents correspondence with s1 and persistence 5 m fig 9b the correspondences observed are well defined and show that the presence of water is linked to greater fracture lengths and not so much to fracture aperture in outcrop a a first correspondence group of s4 was observed with persistence 0 5 0 99 1 1 99 m and aperture 0 5 0 99 mm also a relationship was identified between persistence 2 4 99 m and aperture 0 5 mm fig 9c the insertion of the exudation parameter was not considered due to the low proportion of data therefore the joint analysis of data from outcrops a and b shows that the correlation between s4 and the persistence from 1 to 1 99 m remained as well as the persistence from 2 to 4 99 m with the aperture 0 5 mm fig 9d 3 5 structural conditioning this stage of the study considered outcrops a d fig 1a d respectively the dataset comprised a total of 205 attitudes where in general tectonic structures of the joints and fractures type predominate the stereogram with the isofrequency curves together with the tracing of the preferential planes of the sets of previously defined discontinuities show the predominance of three sets being the two sub verticals n s s1 and e w s2 and the one sub horizontal s5 and in a subordinate way the ne sw s3 and nw se s4 subvertical sets are observed fig 10 the poles corresponding to the planes of sets s1 s2 and s5 can be observed in shades of green and are marked by s1 s2 s5a and s5b demonstrating a fisher distribution with higher density of concentration of attitudes however the poles of planes s3 and s4 are represented by s3 and s4 showing a fisher distribution with lower density of concentration of attitudes the list of attitudes of the main planes of the discontinuity sets is contained in table 4 3 5 1 evaluation of paleo tensions in order to pursue the association between the characteristics of groundwater circulation in fractures exudation roughness aperture and persistence and the nature of stresses a systematic investigation of discontinuities associated with the identification of paleo tension indicators striae direction of displacement folds and veins in rocky outcrops was carried out the applied methodology allowed the identification of the tension axes σ1 σ2 and σ3 evidences for the elaboration of stress dihedral were identified in the four outcrops a d fig 1 a d respectively the folding features in the subvertical planes constituted by smooth to open folds are indicative of the action of early stages of deformation in the ductile state and are more frequent in the planes to the east at azimuths 32 148 and to the west between 246 and 341 however quartz veins are more abundant in the north 338 and 044 and south 146 and 242 quadrants the brittle shear stage is identified by fault features under the aspect of transcurrent friction striae in the striae from features such as steps of neo formed minerals and parabolic marks in general it was possible to define the predominance of the direction of dextral movement of the fault surfaces in the photographic image in fig 11 the surface of an outcrop fault plane located on outcrop d1 is identified in which a step like feature of neo formed minerals is observed showing a direction of dextral movement through this evidence stereograms of reconstruction of the paleo tension axes for each outcrop were produced fig 12 the definition of the positions of the compressive and distensive axes allowed the characterization of structures located in a favorable or unfavorable position for aperture that is respectively perpendicular to the regional σ1 and σ3 the main stresses are arranged on the compressive axis σ1 in the nw 310 se 113 141 and the distensible σ3 direction perpendicular to the σ1 with a smooth dip between 7 and 26 σ1 and between 5 and 18 σ3 the σ2 tension presents stress axes in a subvertical direction with dips between 61 and 81 and variable dip directions azimuths but with greater frequency along the ne sw axis it is also noted that the sub horizontal structures s5 are arranged perpendicularly to the stress axes σ2 the arrangement dip direction of these structures plays an important role in conditioning the direction of local and perhaps regional flow of groundwater the dips of low angle joints are generally in agreement with the vector of distensible tensions σ3 fig 13 represents an integrated model built from the disposition of the main stresses and the main types and characteristics of the expected structures thus considering the main stress axes defined for the dataset we have the following characteristics for each typology axis σ2 can be designed with an arrangement perpendicular to the plane formed by the main axes that is designed for the interior of the massif as a result they tend to form joint type structures that are arranged in planes parallel to the surface and because they are subjected to vertical confinement they are generated by stress relief caused by the deconfinement of the massif the analysis of paleo tensions shear and tractive fractures and the directions of the 5 fracture sets identified in the schmidt lambert diagram corroborate to frame the study area in the model of discontinuities formed in bands affected by non coaxial shear involving riedel fractures partition and other shear fractures magalhães and cella 1998 furthermore it is observed that the σ1 axis tractive fractures presents an oblique angle with shear fractures on average of 33 and consequently with rupture fractures of 57 the relationship of the attitudes of the main planes of the discontinuities sets is shown in table 5 based on the integrated statistical treatment of all structural discontinuities orientations five preferential fracture sets were defined four with subvertical dip angles and one with a sub horizontal arrangement 4 discussion the results show that there are four groups of lineament directions n s e w ne sw and nw se in the study area being the ne sw and nw se directions the most frequent ones and having the longest lineament lengths large and medium size in addition they are the directions with the greatest exploitation of underground water and the predominance of water wells with discharge above 20 m3 h 1 these observations corroborate with reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b who identified the same preferential directions and the predominance of discharge above 20 m3 h 1 for the ne sw and nw se lineaments in the sgas although the four directions of lineaments have similar discharge variances with high and low discharge oscillations portraying a heterogeneous environment the water well frequency graphs fig 5 show superior groundwater availability in all discharge ranges in the ne sw and nw se directions notably most of the exploited water wells in the nw se direction are positioned in small size lineaments this greater discharge may be related to s4 distensible fractures paleo tensions have a great influence on geological structures with preferential groundwater flow in the study region the horizontal principal stresses σ1 were identified as nw se 310 113 141 and σ3 as ne sw 218 020 051 thus originating distension structures parallel and subparallel to the plane of compression σ1 that is nw se 292 5 337 5 however the σ3 may be related to structures in agreement with the direction of the caxias fault and to the medium and large size ne sw 22 5 67 5 hydraulically exploitable lineaments distending structures tend to facilitate water circulation while structures perpendicular to σ1 tend to have reduced groundwater flow these trends were indicated by barton et al 1995 and finkbeiner et al 1997 and strengthened by ferrill et al 1999 on the other hand critically stressed shear fractures and potentially active faults in frictional equilibrium with the in situ stress can favor water transmissivity barton et al 1995 fractures resulting from σ1 paleo tension are related to s4 distensive while σ3 paleo tension can be correlated to s3 the analysis of both sets strengthens the trend of greater groundwater potential in the nw se and ne sw directions these two sets have the same fracture density value and similar percentages of cases for aperture with 0 5 0 99 mm range however s3 presents water exudation in 36 of the cases in addition s4 stands out in the aperture interval 1 0 1 99 mm and in the predominance of a low index 4 for roughness furthermore s4 presents a higher number of cases for the persistence parameter from 1 0 m still this fracture set stands out for the relevant presence of water observed in the exudation parameter 77 of cases despite a prevalence of the intermediate index 8 for roughness being identified it is possible that the larger fracture aperture offsets the plane s roughness index finally the multiple correspondence analysis related the persistence intervals between 1 0 and 5 0 m of the s4 with the presence of exudation that is there is a greater presence of water at longer fracture lengths this finding corroborates liu et al 2016 which describes persistence as a highly relevant parameter in the assessment of water circulation s1 fractures had a low percentage of cases with an aperture between 1 0 and 1 99 mm and most 83 were 0 5 mm in addition s1 has a high percentage of fractures classified as dry and has high roughness indices however the persistence parameter showed a higher number of cases from the 1 0 m to 5 m interval this scenario may be related to the fact that water circulation in a small aperture is more impacted by roughness ni et al 2018 s1 comprises the direction of the n s plane coinciding with the direction of n s lineaments these lineaments are almost entirely small and have few water wells with discharge rates greater than 5 m3 h 1 s2 presented a percentage similar to s1 for the aperture parameter in the range 1 0 1 99 mm in relation to persistence s2 had a greater number of cases in intervals higher than 2 m and the interval 2 4 99 m correlated with the exudation parameter moist regardless of this this set showed a high percentage of filled fracture by mineralization 88 quartz in most cases which can result in decreased permeability barton et al 1995 mineralization in the form of veins is a regional behavior identified by reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b still s2 is of the hybrid and shear type that presents an average angle of 33 with paleo tension σ1 and orthogonal geometry with s1 s2 coincides with the small and large e w lineaments which present few cases of water wells with a discharge rate greater than 5 m3 h 1 the σ2 stresses identified are related to sub horizontal structures s5 that may be playing an important role in conditioning the flow direction of groundwater this hypothesis can be supported by the fact that s5 is related to the prevalence of a low roughness index most apertures between 0 5 and 0 99 mm persistence above 1 0 m in 96 of cases the lowest percentage of filled fractures with mineralization and moist exudation 41 and dripping 24 categories the consistent presence of water aperture 5 mm low roughness and great persistence of fractures can play a preponderant role in the circulation of water in the s5 according to fernandes et al 2016 sub horizontal fractures with large extensions present the highest groundwater transmissivity in basaltic rocks of the serra geral formation 5 conclusions this research explored the relationship between circulation and groundwater potential in a portion of the sgas and the results demonstrated a relevant contribution to the knowledge of hydrogeology in fractured aquifers therefore three investigative segments were developed addressing the variance of discharges in relation to the directions of lineaments the influence of discontinuities and the stresses acting on the groundwater flow the first investigative segment showed that the ne sw and nw se geological lineaments directions are the most frequent and with the highest water discharge in the study area there is a greater circulation of water in the large lineaments in the ne sw direction while in the nw se direction the small lineaments present greater groundwater flow despite this distinct water discharge behavior the four analyzed directions of lineaments presented similar heterogeneity and anisotropy identified in the behavior of discharge variances the evaluation of the second investigative segment identified 4 sets of subvertical fractures s1 n s s2 e w s3 ne sw s4 nw se and 1 set of sub horizontal fractures s5 through these sets it was observed that the length density and aperture from 0 5 to 1 99 mm of the fractures are the parameters with the greatest association with water exudation the following factors were recognized in the third segment the main paleo tension directions compressive axis σ1 in the direction nw 310 se 113 141 distensive σ3 perpendicular to σ1 and the axis of stress σ2 in the subvertical direction the distribution of the paleo tension axes and the associated structural features corresponded to riedel s model through the convergence of the results obtained in all three investigative segments it is possible to indicate s3 s4 and s5 as the most favorable geological structures for groundwater flow s3 and s4 may be responsible for conducting deeper groundwater flows which cross the different volcanic flows the s3 is mainly related to the medium and large scale lineaments that reflect the σ3 and to the canguçu dorsal fault system s4 is connected in most cases to the small lineaments nw se that result from the σ1 paleo tension s5 is associated with stress σ2 and acts as a facilitator of water circulation at shallower levels and is probably responsible for the connectivity of the groundwater flow network the combination of different methodologies resulted in a robust analysis of groundwater behavior in the fractured rock of the sgas the effects of these important discoveries are directly related to the water availability of groundwater which based on this study will be better understood by stakeholders interested in planning and managing the use of this mineral good despite the knowledge acquired during the development and from the results of this research it would be enriching to have an investigation with geophysical logging in the water wells in the study area these logs could contribute to identify groundwater flow in hydraulically active fractures and in the fracture planes it could also aid identifying the directions and speed of vertical groundwater flow inside the water wells as well as visualizing the contacts between the different volcanic flows declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11803,groundwater circulation in fractured aquifer systems is a topic of worldwide interest as they are heterogeneous and peculiar environments in brazil little is known about the groundwater flow within fractured rocks this knowledge gap motivated the investigation of 1 the statistical variance of the exploited discharges and their relationship with the directions of geological lineaments 2 the analyzes of the relationship between of the groundwater flow with the different characteristics of the discontinuities and 3 the correlation between the acting stresses with the fracturing geometries that present groundwater flow to reach these objectives this paper is circumscribed within the following methods frequency graphs normality assumptions test non parametric homogeneity tests multiple correspondence analysis scanline profiles and in situ stress analysis this study was carried out in the serra geral fractured aquifer system in caxias do sul rio grande do sul brazil the results showed that most the exploited water wells are associated with the nw se and ne sw lineament directions there was a predominance of four sets of subvertical fractures s1 s2 s3 and s4 and one sub horizontal s5 sets of fractures s3 s4 and s5 showed the greatest persistence of fractures and presence of exudation the tension axes σ1 and σ3 were identified in the 310 113 141 and 218 020 051 directions respectively the groundwater circulation in sets of fractures s3 and s4 is related to tensions σ1 and σ3 and the most exploited lineament directions nw se and ne sw while s5 is correlated to tension σ2 and behaves as a facilitator of the groundwater circulation in the underground flow network graphical abstract image 1 keywords fractured aquifer groundwater flow sgas discontinuities paleo tension 1 introduction due to its singularity the hydraulic behavior of fractured aquifers requires great efforts to understand it it is difficult to interpret the hydraulic connectivity between the fractures however there are some intrinsic parameters to the rock fracturing that can represent the behavior of the groundwater flow in the fractures such as fracture density length geometry connectivity infill weathering as well as the effects of the in situ stress field coli and pinzani 2014 liu et al 2016 mortimer et al 2011a the circulation of groundwater in fractured rock has been studied worldwide and considerable progress has been made on understanding fracture aperture in this system akoachere and van tonder 2009 hakami 1995 kishida et al 2013 pan et al 2011 the spatial orientation of the fracture sets aperture spacing and absolute roughness of the planes are the main parameters of the discontinuities that influence the movement of groundwater flow azevedo and filho 1998 moreover renshaw 1996 indicated the density of fractures as one of the most important parameters to be considered however the density should be measured along with the aperture and spatial orientation liu et al 2016 indicated that the fracture length distribution is the most important parameter in calculating the permeability of fracture networks with the aperture being related to its fracture length even though the increase in normal fracture stress causes a decrease in hydraulic aperture cao et al 2016 roughness is considered another important parameter in the assessment of hydraulic conductivity in fractures barton et al 1985 cao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ni et al 2018 and the scale in which the hydraulic conductivity is measured deserves special attention when assessing the fracture network connectivity because such connectivity can occur from meters to kilometers hsieh and shapiro 1996 shapiro et al 2007 2015 tiedeman et al 1998 tiedeman and hsieh 2001 the relationship between the fracture permeability and the in situ stress field is another important factor in understanding groundwater flow behavior barton et al 1995 ferrill et al 1999 according to mortimer et al 2011b the in situ stress change alters the fracture geometry and the groundwater flow network connectivity in shallow fractures up to 200 m enabling the change in the magnitude heterogeneity and anisotropy of the groundwater storage permeability and groundwater flow pattern the effects of the in situ acting stress field unloading weathering and uplift change the original distribution of fracture densities and hydraulic apertures in shallow groundwater systems as they increase spatial heterogeneity mortimer et al 2011a other studies addressing hydromechanics in fractured rocks were also carried out by berkowitz 2002 earnest and boutt 2014 jing 2003 rouleau and galet 1987 and rutqvist and stephansson 2003 in brazil few are the studies on fractured aquifers that relate the circulation and the availability of groundwater to the fracture system fernandes et al 2011 2016 hausman 1966 1995 reginato and strieder 2006a regarding the groundwater flow in the fissured system some knowledge gaps are worth mentioning firstly there is no information about the statistical variance of the exploited discharges and their relationship with the directions of geological lineaments secondly little is known regarding the relationship between the groundwater flow with the different characteristics of the discontinuities finally the correlation between the acting stresses with the fracturing geometries that present groundwater flow is unknown this is also the case of the serra geral fractured aquifer system sgas southern brazil where there are few studies characterizing the underground water circulation which makes it an original investigation site motivated by these knowledge gaps this research focus on a portion of the sgas to investigate the variability of discharges in the main directions of the lineaments the second objective of this work is to analyze the correlation between groundwater flow and discontinuities addressing the following parameters fracture orientation persistence number of fracture sets spacing roughness aperture and water exudation finally this study aims to relate the effects of acting stresses with the preferential groundwater flow in the fractures 1 1 area of study and geological background the area of study is located in the metropolitan region of the city of caxias do sul 3900 km2 northeastern sector of the state of rio grande do sul southern brazil fig 1 i ii and iii this study site is in the geological framework of the paraná basin that holds the são bento group this group includes the sedimentary units of the guará and botucatu formations and the volcanic package of the serra geral formation which is related to the opening of the south atlantic the lithologies that constitute the volcanic package are represented by basalts gramado facies at the base of the sequence while in the upper portion rhyodacites rhyolites and dacites from the palmas and chapecó facies are identified bellieni et al 1984 1986 roisenberg and viero 2000 and vitrophyres from the várzea do cedro facies cprm 2011 fig 1iii the acid portion of volcanism in the serra geral formation occurs predominantly as volcaniclastic units related to ignimbrites models roisenberg and viero 2000 with local records of domes whose areal distribution is quite restricted presenting petrographic and geochemical patterns typical of an effusive eruptive style lima et al 2012 2018 the northeast region of rio grande do sul demonstrates the existence of six volcanic flows of basic rocks and three main ones of acid rocks reginato 2003 in the city of caxias do sul bressani et al 2004 characterized four acid type volcanic fluxes superimposed on gramado facies 1 2 structural background the tectonic history of the paraná basin is influenced by several orogenetic cycles that affected the two precambrian units of the sul rio grandense shield the rio de la plata craton and the dom feliciano belt picada 1972 observed that the geotectonic units of the sul rio grandense shield include the dorsal de canguçu n35 75e passo do marinheiro n5w and n15e açotéia piquiri n30e and northwest n65 75w fault systems according to nummer et al 2014 the first two systems are directional residual faults while the third is a graben type rift valley relevant studies in the paraná basin identified predominant lineament directions that refer to the structural context equivalent to n30 70e n30 60w nne and nnw fernandes et al 2011 fiume 2013 soares et al 2007 zalán et al 1990 the structural pattern of fracture direction recognized through the investigation of outcrops in the northeast region of rio grande do sul demonstrates predominant directions n70 90e and secondary directions n20 30w and n80 90w reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b in addition to transcurrent geological faults dextral and sinistral with preferred ne sw directions followed by nw se and e w orientations nummer et al 2014 in the same region two main tensional fields were observed the first with a horizontal σ1 compression direction of 82 orientation and a horizontal σ3 traction direction of 352 orientation while the second shows compression direction σ1 equal to 174 and traction direction 264 reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b in the region of caxias do sul the ne sw lineaments are predominant with the nw se and e w lineaments being less expressive betiollo 2006 in addition n40e oriented lineaments are related to the geological model of structural patterns of the dom feliciano mobile belt and with the ne sw fault system frasca and lisboa 1993 nummer et al 2014 part of the influence of these structural patterns are regionally represented by the canguçu dorsal fault system fig 1iii in which the caxias fault is inserted the caxias fault crosses the limits of the city of caxias do sul having a general n30e direction and an approximate length of 70 km this fault was described by lisboa et al 2003 who verified a drawdown of approximately 100 m between the lowered block to the west and the uplifted one to the east 1 3 hydrogeological background the regional hydrogeological context includes the guarani and serra geral aquifer systems the guarani aquifer system gas is a granular aquifer and regionally it suffers structural control through the main depocenters of the paraná basin regional and local faults reactivation of the arches and thermal uplifts lisboa et al 2003 and it is below the sgas sgas can be divided into porous unconfined and fractured aquifers the porous aquifer is located in the weathered layer over the volcanic rocks of the serra geral formation this aquifer has the following factors as its main constraints soil type and thickness topography lithology type composition and structuring of the rock and climate reginato 2003 the conceptual model indicates that water stored in this aquifer infiltrates and circulates through the fractures that act as water pathways to the saturated zone of the sgas bortolin 2018 hausman 1966 reginato 2003 however the conceptual model of the sgas is conditioned to the serra geral formation presenting water circulation in tectonic structures which may or may not be influenced by the primary structures the circulation and storage of groundwater in the rocks of the serra geral formation occur in fractures originating from horizontal disjunctions from contacts between volcanic flows and in vesicular and amygdaloid zones being the zones of vertical and subvertical open fractures which cross the different volcanic flows the path for water percolation to the saturation zone freitas 2016 reginato et al 2015 the sgas is divided into sgas i and sgas ii the latter is where caxias do sul is located on according to reginato 2003 this aquifer system has an average transmissivity t of 0 493 m2 h 1 and an average specific capacity q of 0 395 m3 h 1 m 1 this author also explains that the high variability found in the values of transmissivity and specific capacity is in accordance with the type of aquifer fractured reflecting strong anisotropy the hydrodynamic parameters observed by reginato 2003 show that most of the discharges analyzed in the sgas 72 1 have values below 10 m3 h 1 while 18 6 are between 10 and 20 m3 h 1 and only 9 3 presented values above 20 m3 h 1 de vargas et al 2018 obtained a similar groundwater exploitation in the city of caxias do sul 71 below 10 m3 h 1 18 between 10 and 20 m3 h 1 and 11 above 20 m3 h 1 2 methodology the methodological framework is divided into three investigative segments the first segment focus on the discharge of water wells in the metropolitan region of the city of caxias do sul while the second is related to the first fracture waterflow zone fwz of the water wells and the parameters described in the scanline profiles in quarry benches outcrops a b of fig 1a b the third segment corresponds to the analysis of the stress effects acting on groundwater flow outcrops a d of fig 1a d data corresponding to outcrop c were extracted from lazzari 2020 fracture orientations were collected in the field in clar s notation dip direction but were converted to strike plane direction in the scanline data analysis data from water wells such as discharge and altimetry of the first fwz were obtained from data made available from 333 water wells by the public water and wastewater service of caxias do sul samae and from 72 water wells by the groundwater information system siagas of the brazilian geological service water wells cprm 2009 2 1 first investigative segment water well discharge in this segment of the research the discharge values of 405 exploited water wells were correlated with the directions of 239 lineaments which cover an interval of 45 to each other n s 337 5 22 5 157 5 202 5 ne sw 22 5 67 5 202 5 247 5 e w 67 5 112 5 247 5 292 5 and nw se 292 5 337 5 112 5 157 5 this correlation was carried out on a scale of 1 30 000 selecting the water wells observed over the lineaments or in their zone of influence 300 m buffer using arcgis 10 7 1 software the lineaments were identified using the hillshade format of the digital terrain model topo to raster with an altimetric range of 5 m caxias do sul 2018 with 45 solar incidence azimuth directions in 0 45 90 and 135 at a scale of 1 30 000 and their length was calculated in the software arcgis 10 7 1 the direction frequencies and length of the lineaments were analyzed using a rosette diagram with petals of 7 5 using the rockworks 16 software otherwise the lineament lengths were classified into three sizes small 2 km medium 2 4 km and large 4 km tomasi and roisenberg 2019 statistical analysis of discharge rates was performed using frequency graphs assumption of normality test shapiro wilk with 95 confidence interval α 0 05 and homogeneity tests for non parametric data kruskal wallis and chi square considering ρ value 0 05 these tests were performed in the statistica tibco software the frequency graphs were segregated into 5 classes 5 5 01 10 10 01 15 15 01 20 and 20 m3 h 1 a detailed description of these statistical methods can be found in larson and farber 2010 and shapiro and wilk 1965 finally the null hypothesis test applying the non parametric methods was elaborated as follows ho the discharge variances of the four directions are homogeneous ρ 0 05 not rejected ha the discharge variances of the four directions are not homogeneous ρ 0 05 rejected 2 2 second investigative segment first fwz and scanline this step considered the most frequent altimetric ranges in relation to mean sea level in the first fwz of 259 water wells first fwz was selected from the public water and wastewater service samae of the city of caxias do sul where there is a municipal register of water wells these intervals were used as a reference for choosing outcrops a and b in these outcrops 10 scanline profiles were performed positioned longitudinally to the inactive extraction benches resulting in 119 measurements of fractures each profile considered the following parameters orientation persistence number of fracture sets mean density equation 1 mean spacing equation 2 roughness undulation filling material aperture state of alteration orientation of kinematic indicators and water exudation the systematic survey of these parameters was based on the field spreadsheet model by magalhães and cella 1998 and definitions of each parameter can be found in barton and choubey 1977 and priest and hudson 1981 the scanline extention depends upon the dimension of the observation wall and upon the occurrence of fractures and there is no single sampling procedure priest 1993 the scanline methodology is consolidated in the literature as it is possible to obtain detail in manda and mabee 2010 and priest 1993 the amplitude of the roughness was measured longitudinally in the direction of the dip of the fracture plane using a field profilometer thus subsidizing data to estimate the joint roughness coefficient jcr through the abacus of barton and bandis 1982 1 d fractures in se t i profile length giving in meters 2 sp spacing in se t i profile length giving in centimeters the data set corresponding to the parameters of the fractures evaluated in the scanlines outcrops a b was analyzed by descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis mca using the statistica tibco software in this statistical analysis the most relevant parameters to understand the water circulation in fractures were correlated to the same intervals applied to the directions of the lineaments 45 to each other on the other hand outcrops c and d were not included in this investigative segment because the scanline profiles did not consider the roughness parameter however the outcrops c and d were fundamental in the analysis of the third investigative segment which addresses the tensions acting in the evaluated region mca evaluates the degree of association between variables by using lines and columns in a multidimensional contigency table graphic representation of this table displays the dependence between the lines and columns being applied for individuals variables categories and categories individuals greenacre 1993 le roux and rouanet 2010 this statistical approach seeks the similarity among individuals with common characteristics respecting the euclidean space and the indicator matrix z with i rows and j1 j2 columns and is partitioned as z z1 z2 so that z z 1 t z 2 greenacre 1993 the mca methodology can be verified in detail in greenacre 1993 and le roux and rouanet 2010 2 3 third investigative segment active tension this segment addresses the identification of in situ stresses according to mioto et al 2018 the most common geological or geostructural techniques for stress determination are based on the analysis of striated planes of small faults measuring the attitude of the plane striation and the direction of movement of each plane stria pair the general principle is to start from the relative motion of each plane stria to deduce the shear stress orientation and determine the stress tensor arthaud 1969 was the pioneer in using the stereogram but the graphic technique established by angelier and mechler 1977 is the most used to obtain the σ1 σ2 and σ3 directions from this technique also known as straight dihedrals four dihedrals are defined for each fault of a population of discontinuities that were subjected alternately to shortening and stretching during the movement the spatial representation of the relationships between the attitudes of the geological structures present in the massif and the attitudes of the slopes was represented by the schmidt lambert diagram using the dips version 5 1 program to determine the paleo tension axes the wintensor software version 5 8 9 was used which allows the representation of the fault striation planes paleo tensions indicate the direction of movement in the projection and based on the criterion of straight dihedrals compressive and distensive define positions for the axes of the stress ellipsoid for the set of faults 3 results the results are analyzed following the sequence of the investigative segments described in the methodology sections 3 1 and 3 2 correspond to the first segment while sections 3 3 and 3 4 refer to the second section 3 5 is related to the third segment 3 1 association between discharges and geological lineaments the distribution of exploited water wells in relation to the lineaments and the study area shows a high concentration of water wells in the central southwest region where there is greater urbanization fig 2 a 239 lineaments associated with 405 exploited water wells were identified the rosette diagram fig 2b indicates that the large lineaments occur with highest incidence in the following order ne sw 54 nw se 32 e w 13 and n s 2 the directions of the medium sized lineaments are more relevant for ne sw 55 and nw se 35 while e w 5 and n s 5 are not expressive for the small lineaments however a change in dominance is observed nw se 49 ne sw 31 n s 14 and e w 7 the rosette diagram fig 2c shows the frequency of occurrence of the azimuths for the ne sw 101 nw se 99 n s 21 and e w 18 directions considering the different sizes for the same direction it is observed that the frequencies of the small lineaments are remarkably dominant in the n s 81 and nw se 60 directions while the ne sw shows a distribution uniform for the three sizes large 30 medium 34 and small 37 finally the e w frequency is more relevant for small 44 and large 39 sizes the waterwell discharge frequency analysis showed a higher incidence of cases in class 1 5 m3 h 1 representing 59 of the cases in the n s direction 55 in the e w 51 in the ne sw and 44 in the nw se the drastic drop in frequency is pronounced in the subsequent classes that present higher discharge rates in the n s and e w directions there is a relatively subtle decrease in frequency from class 1 to 4 in the ne sw and nw se directions class 5 demonstrates a slight increase in the frequency of discharge above 20 m3 h 1 representing 10 ne sw and 11 nw se of the cases fig 3 in most cases there is a decrease in the frequency of water wells as the discharge rates of class intervals increase the ne sw and nw se directions when compared to the n s and e w present a significantly higher number of occurrences of exploited water wells in all evaluated classes there is a highlight for class 5 20 m3 h 1 which shows 21 times more occurrences of water wells in the nw se direction than n s and 16 times more cases in the ne sw direction than n s this difference in occurrence between the n s direction and the ne sw and nw se directions tends to decrease as the discharge rate decreases from class 5 to 1 table 1 furthermore the difference in occurrences of water wells between the e w direction and the ne sw and nw se directions does not tend to decrease from class 5 to class 1 however a relevant increase in frequency is observed in classes 2 and 3 for nw se vs e w 12 3 and 9 7 times while for ne sw vs e w 9 3 times only in class 2 table 1 the nw se vs ne sw relationship did not show any relevant difference in the quantity of water wells observed in the five classes these observational data suggest greater groundwater flow and high discharge frequency in the nw se and ne sw directions the relationship between the discharge rates above 20 m³ h 1 with the size of the lineaments proved to be revealing the ne sw direction presented 16 lineaments with this discharge range being 47 medium size and 53 large size this trend of the higher percentage of water wells being in large scale and then medium sized lineaments is also identified for other discharge intervals 5 01 10 10 01 15 15 01 20 m³ h 1 except for 5 m³ h 1 which occur in greater percentage in the large and later small and medium 20 lineaments were identified in the nw se direction with water wells showing discharge above 20 m³ h 1 with 60 of these lineaments being small 30 medium and 10 large therefore most of these water wells nw se are associated with lineaments of up to 2 km in length the other discharge intervals also showed a trend towards higher percentages of water wells in small size lineaments 3 2 sample variance of discharges in all the discharge data a large interval between the minimum and maximum value is observed table 2 this difference is consistent with fractured aquifer systems due to heterogeneity and anisotropy reginato 2003 reginato et al 2015 reginato and strieder 2006a testing the assumption of normality and homogeneity of the discharge values considered the four directions of lineaments already worked on in the previous sections in the n s and e w directions the smallest sample groups were identified 27 and 29 water wells respectively the most representative groups were observed in the ne sw 155 water wells and nw se 194 water wells directions fig 4 shows that the four directions have similar average discharge and overlap between confidence intervals in addition to outliers in the n s ne sw and nw se directions these outliers can be indicative of the lack of normality of the sampled values which requires the verification of these values through an assumption of normality test the shapiro wilk assumption of normality test applied to the discharge values of the selected water wells showed positive asymmetry and significance value ρ 0 05 ρ 0 00 for the four directions this lack of normality of the data led to the application of non parametric methodologies to assess the homogeneity of the sample variance between the observed values the first tested methodology kruskal wallis showed ρ 0 05 table 2 the significance value ρ 0 05 indicates that the null hypothesis test was not rejected ho this result is reinforced by the chi square x2 method which also presented ρ 0 05 ho table 2 x2 3 6845 degree of freedom equal to 3 and critical value x2 o 7 815 both the kruskal wallis and the chi square methods show that the observed discharge variances in each direction are similar that is they have a similar dispersion in relation to the respective discharge average the overlapping of confidence intervals between the 4 directions fig 4 corroborates as an indication that there is no significant difference between the variances therefore these results of dispersive character with high and low discharge oscillations show a similar behavior of discharge heterogeneity in the serra geral aquifer system regardless of the lineament direction 3 3 analysis of scanline profiles the selection of outcrops a and b was based on the determination of the altimetry with the highest frequency of occurrence of the first fwz the analysis of this frequency considered the distribution of the selected water wells into two groups west and east from the caxias fault the west group 104 water wells showed 10 frequency classes with the highest frequencies observed between the 575 and 697 m altimetry fig 5 a the eastern group 155 water wells had 12 frequency classes the highest frequency values fig 5b were observed in classes 10 and 11 54 of cases which were located between 638 and 777 m there is an overlap between the altimetric values of the first fwz of the west classes 5 and 6 and east class 10 groups which marks a preferred altimetric range of the first fwz in the sgas however class 11 in the east group has a high frequency 40 cases while in a similar altimetric range the west group shows a drastic reduction this difference of approximately 80 m between class 6 western block and class 11 eastern block may be related to the drawdown of the west block of the caxias fault which was described by lisboa et al 2003 in the selected outcrops seven scanline profiles were performed a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 in outcrop a and three b1 b2 b3 in outcrop b these profiles ranged between 5 and 23 m in length and have n s ne sw and nw se directions fig 1a and b in outcrop a the altimetry ranged between 745 and 780 m while in outcrop b it ranged from 610 to 620 m in the entire scanline mapping four subvertical sets of fractures were identified set 1 s1 n s set 2 s2 e w set 3 s3 ne sw and set 4 s4 nw se in addition to these four sets sub horizontal fractures were identified as set 5 s5 among the 119 attitudes identified in the scanline profiles s1 is represented by 13 of the attitudes while the other sets are equivalent to s2 34 s3 12 s4 11 and s5 30 in the evaluated profiles scanline a2 stands out where the contact between the acid volcanic flows carijó and canyon was identified the first flow superimposed on the second fig 6 a contacts between volcanic flows are important features as they may be related to preferential water circulation as identified by fernandes et al 2016 and reginato et al 2015 another relevant point was observed in the a6 and b1 scanlines which showed striae of e w dextral shear movement fig 6b 3 3 1 density spacing and weathering parameters the analysis of mean density and mean spacing of subvertical fractures showed that outcrop a has greater density and smaller spacing than outcrop b for s1 and s2 table 3 s2 in scanline a5 showed a higher density of subvertical fractures 1 04 and frequency of association between discontinuities spacing 5 cm furthermore the determination of the mean density 0 36 and mean spacing 230 cm of fractures in s3 was only quantifiable in outcrop b while s4 was identified in outcrop a with an mean density of 0 36 and mean spacing of 192 cm table 3 both sets s3 and s4 presented the same mean fracture density value but with different mean spacing the s5 fractures revealed chaotic directions along the scanlines with this behavior being recurrent in most profiles despite a considerable part of the planes occurring in the ne sw and n s directions the highest mean density of these fractures was observed in outcrop a 0 42 as well as the highest number of associations between the discontinuities this chaotic scenario suggests that fracture directions follow the direction of volcanic flow and are together generated by cooling however in the a3 profile a greater number of sub horizontal n s fractures was observed reflecting the fracture density of 0 78 table 3 based on chaplow 1975 and nummer et al 2003 it is possible to classify the range of mean density values of subvertical and sub horizontal fractures identified in outcrops a and b as occasionally fractured the most advanced state of weathering identified in the fracture planes and in the rock was moderately altered in profiles a1 a2 a5 and a6 with most cases in s1 and s2 also in fig 7 a the change in the a6 profile can be seen in ocher color in an area with smaller spacing of subvertical fractures of s2 suggesting greater groundwater flow locally also in this area of fractures the dextral shear movement shown in fig 6b was identified however in the average of data from outcrops a and b s3 and s4 were classified as slightly altered or unchanged in addition filled fractures were observed in s1 24 s2 88 s3 43 and s4 46 quartz clay and oxides were identified as the most frequent fillings the first being identified in most cases in s2 fractures carbonate minerals filling the fracture planes of s2 and s3 have rarely been identified in relation to sub horizontal fractures figs 7b 10 of the s5 fractures n s and 9 of the remaining s5 chaotic fractures were filled 3 3 2 aperture persistence exudation and roughness parameters the parameters aperture persistence exudation and roughness are represented in fig 8 considering the data set of outcrops a and b fracture aperture 0 5 mm showed a high percentage of occurrence in all fracture sets s1 83 s2 78 s3 71 s4 85 and s5 56 also a relevant percentage of the aperture of fractures s5 32 between 0 5 and 0 99 mm was identified while the subvertical ones were less expressive s1 6 s2 5 s3 14 s4 15 fig 8a the subvertical structures s1 s2 and s3 represent 11 15 and 14 respectively of the aperture measurements in the range of 1 0 1 99 mm these fracture sets show a marked decrease in cases with an aperture 0 5 mm except for the s5 fractures which present approximately 1 3 of the measures with an aperture between 0 5 and 0 99 mm as the fracture persistence interval increases fig 8b s2 shows an increase in frequencies in its occurrence the interval 5 0 m represents 58 of the measurements similar behavior to s2 is identified in s4 which also demonstrates the trend of increasing cases towards the longest persistence interval 5 0 m 46 s3 shows an ascent and decreasing behavior with increasing fracture length being observed in the intervals 0 5 0 99 14 1 0 1 99 36 2 0 4 99 14 and 5 0 m 36 s1 and s5 have more uniform frequencies between the persistence intervals above 1 0 m with the interval 5 0 m with the highest percentage of measurements s1 38 and s5 35 fractures s1 61 s2 45 and s3 43 in the exudation parameter show the highest frequency values in the dry classification fig 8c these sets reveal a trend towards a reduction in cases as the proportions of water in the fractures increase s4 46 and s5 41 have the highest percentage of cases in the moist classification this classification also showed relevant values in the fractures of s3 36 and s2 35 the perspiration classification was identified with considerable frequency in s4 31 in contrast s5 portrays the same percentage of cases 24 for dry and dripping classifications the analysis of roughness indices jrc in the identified fractures sets fig 8d showed that in s3 57 and s5 32 index 4 is the most frequent s4 shows the highest frequency of cases for index 8 31 while s1 had the highest roughness indices 12 16 and 20 finally s2 showed a more uniform distribution of the jrc indices 3 4 multivariate statistics the multiple correspondence analysis between the scanline parameters showed that in outcrop b there is correspondence of the values of persistence 1 1 99 2 4 99 m and aperture 0 5 mm with fractures of s2 and s4 fig 9 a when the exudation parameter is entered the grouping of these parameters is maintained except for the aperture 0 5 mm also perspiration presents correspondence with s1 and persistence 5 m fig 9b the correspondences observed are well defined and show that the presence of water is linked to greater fracture lengths and not so much to fracture aperture in outcrop a a first correspondence group of s4 was observed with persistence 0 5 0 99 1 1 99 m and aperture 0 5 0 99 mm also a relationship was identified between persistence 2 4 99 m and aperture 0 5 mm fig 9c the insertion of the exudation parameter was not considered due to the low proportion of data therefore the joint analysis of data from outcrops a and b shows that the correlation between s4 and the persistence from 1 to 1 99 m remained as well as the persistence from 2 to 4 99 m with the aperture 0 5 mm fig 9d 3 5 structural conditioning this stage of the study considered outcrops a d fig 1a d respectively the dataset comprised a total of 205 attitudes where in general tectonic structures of the joints and fractures type predominate the stereogram with the isofrequency curves together with the tracing of the preferential planes of the sets of previously defined discontinuities show the predominance of three sets being the two sub verticals n s s1 and e w s2 and the one sub horizontal s5 and in a subordinate way the ne sw s3 and nw se s4 subvertical sets are observed fig 10 the poles corresponding to the planes of sets s1 s2 and s5 can be observed in shades of green and are marked by s1 s2 s5a and s5b demonstrating a fisher distribution with higher density of concentration of attitudes however the poles of planes s3 and s4 are represented by s3 and s4 showing a fisher distribution with lower density of concentration of attitudes the list of attitudes of the main planes of the discontinuity sets is contained in table 4 3 5 1 evaluation of paleo tensions in order to pursue the association between the characteristics of groundwater circulation in fractures exudation roughness aperture and persistence and the nature of stresses a systematic investigation of discontinuities associated with the identification of paleo tension indicators striae direction of displacement folds and veins in rocky outcrops was carried out the applied methodology allowed the identification of the tension axes σ1 σ2 and σ3 evidences for the elaboration of stress dihedral were identified in the four outcrops a d fig 1 a d respectively the folding features in the subvertical planes constituted by smooth to open folds are indicative of the action of early stages of deformation in the ductile state and are more frequent in the planes to the east at azimuths 32 148 and to the west between 246 and 341 however quartz veins are more abundant in the north 338 and 044 and south 146 and 242 quadrants the brittle shear stage is identified by fault features under the aspect of transcurrent friction striae in the striae from features such as steps of neo formed minerals and parabolic marks in general it was possible to define the predominance of the direction of dextral movement of the fault surfaces in the photographic image in fig 11 the surface of an outcrop fault plane located on outcrop d1 is identified in which a step like feature of neo formed minerals is observed showing a direction of dextral movement through this evidence stereograms of reconstruction of the paleo tension axes for each outcrop were produced fig 12 the definition of the positions of the compressive and distensive axes allowed the characterization of structures located in a favorable or unfavorable position for aperture that is respectively perpendicular to the regional σ1 and σ3 the main stresses are arranged on the compressive axis σ1 in the nw 310 se 113 141 and the distensible σ3 direction perpendicular to the σ1 with a smooth dip between 7 and 26 σ1 and between 5 and 18 σ3 the σ2 tension presents stress axes in a subvertical direction with dips between 61 and 81 and variable dip directions azimuths but with greater frequency along the ne sw axis it is also noted that the sub horizontal structures s5 are arranged perpendicularly to the stress axes σ2 the arrangement dip direction of these structures plays an important role in conditioning the direction of local and perhaps regional flow of groundwater the dips of low angle joints are generally in agreement with the vector of distensible tensions σ3 fig 13 represents an integrated model built from the disposition of the main stresses and the main types and characteristics of the expected structures thus considering the main stress axes defined for the dataset we have the following characteristics for each typology axis σ2 can be designed with an arrangement perpendicular to the plane formed by the main axes that is designed for the interior of the massif as a result they tend to form joint type structures that are arranged in planes parallel to the surface and because they are subjected to vertical confinement they are generated by stress relief caused by the deconfinement of the massif the analysis of paleo tensions shear and tractive fractures and the directions of the 5 fracture sets identified in the schmidt lambert diagram corroborate to frame the study area in the model of discontinuities formed in bands affected by non coaxial shear involving riedel fractures partition and other shear fractures magalhães and cella 1998 furthermore it is observed that the σ1 axis tractive fractures presents an oblique angle with shear fractures on average of 33 and consequently with rupture fractures of 57 the relationship of the attitudes of the main planes of the discontinuities sets is shown in table 5 based on the integrated statistical treatment of all structural discontinuities orientations five preferential fracture sets were defined four with subvertical dip angles and one with a sub horizontal arrangement 4 discussion the results show that there are four groups of lineament directions n s e w ne sw and nw se in the study area being the ne sw and nw se directions the most frequent ones and having the longest lineament lengths large and medium size in addition they are the directions with the greatest exploitation of underground water and the predominance of water wells with discharge above 20 m3 h 1 these observations corroborate with reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b who identified the same preferential directions and the predominance of discharge above 20 m3 h 1 for the ne sw and nw se lineaments in the sgas although the four directions of lineaments have similar discharge variances with high and low discharge oscillations portraying a heterogeneous environment the water well frequency graphs fig 5 show superior groundwater availability in all discharge ranges in the ne sw and nw se directions notably most of the exploited water wells in the nw se direction are positioned in small size lineaments this greater discharge may be related to s4 distensible fractures paleo tensions have a great influence on geological structures with preferential groundwater flow in the study region the horizontal principal stresses σ1 were identified as nw se 310 113 141 and σ3 as ne sw 218 020 051 thus originating distension structures parallel and subparallel to the plane of compression σ1 that is nw se 292 5 337 5 however the σ3 may be related to structures in agreement with the direction of the caxias fault and to the medium and large size ne sw 22 5 67 5 hydraulically exploitable lineaments distending structures tend to facilitate water circulation while structures perpendicular to σ1 tend to have reduced groundwater flow these trends were indicated by barton et al 1995 and finkbeiner et al 1997 and strengthened by ferrill et al 1999 on the other hand critically stressed shear fractures and potentially active faults in frictional equilibrium with the in situ stress can favor water transmissivity barton et al 1995 fractures resulting from σ1 paleo tension are related to s4 distensive while σ3 paleo tension can be correlated to s3 the analysis of both sets strengthens the trend of greater groundwater potential in the nw se and ne sw directions these two sets have the same fracture density value and similar percentages of cases for aperture with 0 5 0 99 mm range however s3 presents water exudation in 36 of the cases in addition s4 stands out in the aperture interval 1 0 1 99 mm and in the predominance of a low index 4 for roughness furthermore s4 presents a higher number of cases for the persistence parameter from 1 0 m still this fracture set stands out for the relevant presence of water observed in the exudation parameter 77 of cases despite a prevalence of the intermediate index 8 for roughness being identified it is possible that the larger fracture aperture offsets the plane s roughness index finally the multiple correspondence analysis related the persistence intervals between 1 0 and 5 0 m of the s4 with the presence of exudation that is there is a greater presence of water at longer fracture lengths this finding corroborates liu et al 2016 which describes persistence as a highly relevant parameter in the assessment of water circulation s1 fractures had a low percentage of cases with an aperture between 1 0 and 1 99 mm and most 83 were 0 5 mm in addition s1 has a high percentage of fractures classified as dry and has high roughness indices however the persistence parameter showed a higher number of cases from the 1 0 m to 5 m interval this scenario may be related to the fact that water circulation in a small aperture is more impacted by roughness ni et al 2018 s1 comprises the direction of the n s plane coinciding with the direction of n s lineaments these lineaments are almost entirely small and have few water wells with discharge rates greater than 5 m3 h 1 s2 presented a percentage similar to s1 for the aperture parameter in the range 1 0 1 99 mm in relation to persistence s2 had a greater number of cases in intervals higher than 2 m and the interval 2 4 99 m correlated with the exudation parameter moist regardless of this this set showed a high percentage of filled fracture by mineralization 88 quartz in most cases which can result in decreased permeability barton et al 1995 mineralization in the form of veins is a regional behavior identified by reginato and strieder 2006a 2006b still s2 is of the hybrid and shear type that presents an average angle of 33 with paleo tension σ1 and orthogonal geometry with s1 s2 coincides with the small and large e w lineaments which present few cases of water wells with a discharge rate greater than 5 m3 h 1 the σ2 stresses identified are related to sub horizontal structures s5 that may be playing an important role in conditioning the flow direction of groundwater this hypothesis can be supported by the fact that s5 is related to the prevalence of a low roughness index most apertures between 0 5 and 0 99 mm persistence above 1 0 m in 96 of cases the lowest percentage of filled fractures with mineralization and moist exudation 41 and dripping 24 categories the consistent presence of water aperture 5 mm low roughness and great persistence of fractures can play a preponderant role in the circulation of water in the s5 according to fernandes et al 2016 sub horizontal fractures with large extensions present the highest groundwater transmissivity in basaltic rocks of the serra geral formation 5 conclusions this research explored the relationship between circulation and groundwater potential in a portion of the sgas and the results demonstrated a relevant contribution to the knowledge of hydrogeology in fractured aquifers therefore three investigative segments were developed addressing the variance of discharges in relation to the directions of lineaments the influence of discontinuities and the stresses acting on the groundwater flow the first investigative segment showed that the ne sw and nw se geological lineaments directions are the most frequent and with the highest water discharge in the study area there is a greater circulation of water in the large lineaments in the ne sw direction while in the nw se direction the small lineaments present greater groundwater flow despite this distinct water discharge behavior the four analyzed directions of lineaments presented similar heterogeneity and anisotropy identified in the behavior of discharge variances the evaluation of the second investigative segment identified 4 sets of subvertical fractures s1 n s s2 e w s3 ne sw s4 nw se and 1 set of sub horizontal fractures s5 through these sets it was observed that the length density and aperture from 0 5 to 1 99 mm of the fractures are the parameters with the greatest association with water exudation the following factors were recognized in the third segment the main paleo tension directions compressive axis σ1 in the direction nw 310 se 113 141 distensive σ3 perpendicular to σ1 and the axis of stress σ2 in the subvertical direction the distribution of the paleo tension axes and the associated structural features corresponded to riedel s model through the convergence of the results obtained in all three investigative segments it is possible to indicate s3 s4 and s5 as the most favorable geological structures for groundwater flow s3 and s4 may be responsible for conducting deeper groundwater flows which cross the different volcanic flows the s3 is mainly related to the medium and large scale lineaments that reflect the σ3 and to the canguçu dorsal fault system s4 is connected in most cases to the small lineaments nw se that result from the σ1 paleo tension s5 is associated with stress σ2 and acts as a facilitator of water circulation at shallower levels and is probably responsible for the connectivity of the groundwater flow network the combination of different methodologies resulted in a robust analysis of groundwater behavior in the fractured rock of the sgas the effects of these important discoveries are directly related to the water availability of groundwater which based on this study will be better understood by stakeholders interested in planning and managing the use of this mineral good despite the knowledge acquired during the development and from the results of this research it would be enriching to have an investigation with geophysical logging in the water wells in the study area these logs could contribute to identify groundwater flow in hydraulically active fractures and in the fracture planes it could also aid identifying the directions and speed of vertical groundwater flow inside the water wells as well as visualizing the contacts between the different volcanic flows declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11804,health effect and future risk assessment have been evaluated for a year on a group of arsenicosis patients n 24 examining the impact of treated surface water with continuous consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs the daily dietary intake rate of arsenic through cooked rice is 5 50 μg kg bw day which is much higher than ptdi recommended value compared to cooked vegetables and treated drinking water the effect of acute toxicity showed a decreasing trend of 42 9 arsenic in urine n 24 after 6 months scalp hair n 19 and nail n 18 arsenic concentration showed a decreasing trend of 39 3 range 1 34 86 2 and 36 9 range 0 88 85 respectively after 12 months the body hair hand and leg and skin scale arsenic accumulation showed high and diverse distribution pattern excretion of arsenic through sweat was higher than urine with a mean concentration of 34 7 μg l range 4 76 65 μg l chronic arsenic exposure for a long period of time is the considerable pathway to severe dermatological skin manifestations in the arsenical patients one way anova tukey test interpretation showed a significant relationship between arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological

of the exposed individual goswami et al 2020 growing awareness on arsenic contamination in groundwater among the inhabitants in rural bengal has led to build up several mitigation strategies like boring of deep tube wells installation of arsenic removal plants arp and surface water treatment plants swtp to provide arsenic safe drinking water however due to its limited access the domestic shallow tube well water mostly contaminated with arsenic is still used for cooking and sometimes even for drinking apart from other household purposes like washing bathing etc moreover use of arsenic

discussion 3 1 groundwater arsenic contamination scenario in the studied area arsenic contamination scenario in different available water sources from the studied area has been shown in table 1 domestic shallow tube well water n 24 samples showed a mean arsenic concentration of 328 245 μg l ranging from 28 to 887 μg l which was much higher than the who recommended value of 10 μg l boring of deep tube wells by local government through gram panchayet cluster of villages level and icds integrated child development services to supplement treated drinking water showed the mean arsenic concentration of 4 5 3 08 μg l range 3 11 4 μg l n 9 and 7 47 7 56 μg l range 3 16 2 μg l n 3 respectively the treated surface water n 24 mainly used for drinking by the studied populations was safe with respect to arsenic concentration 3 μg l in drinking water presence of higher concentration of arsenic in domestic tube well water was reported earlier from the two studied villages of gaighata block namely mathpara 615 μg l and eithbhata 301 μg l respectively joardar et al 2021b consumption of drinking water from domestic shallow tube wells depth range 7 87 26 m is a common practice for the rural population in west bengal 3 2 contribution of arsenic through drinking water and foodstuffs to the daily dietary intakes the different dietary foodstuffs for the studied population include rice and vegetables table 2 the mean arsenic concentration contributed by the raw rice and raw vegetables is 528 236 μg kg range 172 1057 μg kg and 214 92 μg kg range 91 1 469 μg kg respectively in a similar way the cooked rice and vegetables which are consumed on a daily basis by the population contribute mean arsenic concentration of 440 263 μg kg range 119 1054 μg kg and 54 5 63 9 μg kg range 5 61 257 μg kg respectively among all food crops arsenic uptake in rice is substantially high because of the toxic arsenic arsenite species under paddy soil conditions hussain et al 2021 arsenic accumulation in cooked rice depends on the arsenic concentration in water used for cooking apart from rice grain arsenic concentration rice variety and also that a threshold value exists for cooking water arsenic concentration above which arsenic percolates in the cooked rice chowdhury et al 2020 during cooking arsenic flows from water to rice with increasing cooking water arsenic concentration and also cooking with low to moderate arsenic contaminated water leads to lower contribution of the toxic element in its cooked form raab et al 2009 daily dietary consumption rate of drinking water raw rice grain raw vegetables cooked rice and cooked vegetables by individual patients n 24 along with their body weights have been shown in supplementary table s2 a pie chart has been shown to observe the contributions of treated drinking water arsenic safe and cooked foodstuffs rice and vegetables to daily dietary intake rates of arsenic μg kg bw day for the studied population which has been evaluated following the equations mentioned in joardar et al 2021b supplementary fig s1 treated drinking water cooked rice and cooked vegetables curry of mixed raw vegetables contributed 0 18 4 91 range 1 29 12 5 and 0 52 range 0 03 2 50 μg kg bw day of arsenic respectively cooked rice itself contributed considerably higher value compared to the recommended provisional tolerable dietary intake ptdi value of arsenic 3 0 μg kg bw day who 2011 water from domestic tube well consumed by the same studied population n 24 for a prolonged period contributed much higher value of daily dietary intake mean 19 4 μg kg bw day range 1 32 56 2 μg kg bw day n 24 and played a major role behind the chronic arsenic exposure of the patients in rural bengal intake of arsenic contaminated dietary components leads to an additional entry of arsenic posing future risk to the population considering consumption of arsenic safe drinking water for time being halder et al 2013 3 3 factors dependable for health risk analysis of the patients 3 3 1 acute exposure rate from the body system urinary arsenic is considered as the primary biomarker to measure the rate of acute arsenic toxicity watanabe et al 2001 table 3 showed the urinary arsenic concentration of the 24 arsenicosis patients monitored for a period of 6 months a notable decrease in urinary arsenic concentration has been observed from the 1st month mean 8 06 4 71 μg l range 3 22 9 μg l to 6th month mean 4 60 2 42 μg l range 3 13 6 μg l the mean decrease percentage observed in urinary arsenic concentration for 24 patients after a period of 6 months is 42 9 table 3 a distribution pattern of urinary arsenic concentration of the patients n 24 for each month for a period of 6 months has been plotted in fig 1 a the median urinary arsenic concentration showed a lower value in the 6th month 3 44 compared to the 1st month 7 19 a decreasing trend of 52 2 in the median value of urinary arsenic concentration has been observed after a period of 6 months of this study this observation justifies that the studied arsenicosis patients had been consuming treated drinking water for past two years which contains arsenic within the recommended value a two year study report on impact of safe drinking water on arsenicosis patients n 8 showed a decreasing trend 84 6 75 3 90 2 in urinary arsenic concentration mandal et al 1998 joardar et al 2021b reported the presence of lower level arsenic in urine samples from the inhabitants consuming arsenic safe drinking water in gaighata block a mean decreasing trend of 39 2 range 0 75 83 1 n 21 of urinary arsenic concentration has been observed after a period of 6 months in this study whereas three arsenicosis patients showed an increased percentage of urinary arsenic concentration mean 43 1 range 26 1 59 8 the consumption of arsenic through dietary foodstuffs especially rice grain the staple crop might be responsible behind the increased amount of urinary arsenic concentration meharg et al 2014 wei et al 2014 3 3 2 chronic exposure through biological tissues scalp hair and nail evaluation of hair and nail arsenic is the paramount approach to determine the chronic arsenic exposure rate brima et al 2006 samanta et al 2004 hair and nail tissues accumulate significantly high amount of arsenic due to the presence of keratin proteins gault et al 2008 the mean arsenic concentration in hair samples collected from the patients n 24 decreased from 3848 μg kg range 430 12 800 μg kg at 1st month to 2242 μg kg range 150 6740 μg kg after 12 months table 3 similarly for the nail samples the mean arsenic concentration decreased from 3278 μg kg range 550 9140 μg kg at 1st month to 1940 μg kg range 140 7050 μg kg after 12 months this decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation clearly describes that the exposed population consumed treated water arsenic safe for past few years the maximum hair arsenic concentration observed among the group decreased by 41 7 while that of nail decreased by 40 8 at the end of 12 months table 3 a distribution pattern of hair and nail arsenic concentrations of the patients n 14 24 for each month total period of 12 months has been plotted fig 1b it has been clearly observed that the median arsenic concentration for both hair and nail of the 12th month was lower than that of the 1stmonth this observable fact can be attributed to drinking of treated water for a period of past few years containing arsenic within the permissible limit a decrease trend of 24 and 30 median hair and nail arsenic concentrations have been observed respectively after 12 months of study distribution of arsenic concentrations in hair and nail samples during two intervals 1st and 12th month has been shown in fig 2 a and b respectively exceptionally the hair arsenic concentration for the patient number 1 3 14 15 and 23 showed an increasing trend from 1100 to 1130 μg kg 2570 6330 μg kg 1150 1200 μg kg 440 840 μg kg and 1960 2130 μg kg respectively after a period of 12 months fig 2a similarly after an interval of 12 months the nail arsenic concentration for the patient number 8 14 17 18 22 and 23 showed an increasing trend from 3050 to 3220 μg kg 2150 2270 μg kg 960 1480 μg kg 3060 3880 μg kg 580 770 μg kg and 1110 1390 μg kg respectively fig 2b this increasing trend of arsenic accumulation in few specific cases might be due to the consumption of arsenic contaminated foodstuffs within the study period samanta et al 2004 reported that the existence of elevated levels of toxic elements like as mn pb and ni in the biological tissues hair and nail was due to its individual exposure through drinking water and foodstuffs however an overall declining trend of the arsenic concentration in the biological tissues was observed for the maximum number of arsenicosis patients percentage of increase or decrease in arsenic concentrations of biomarkers hair nail during the intervals 1st and 12th month has been shown in fig 2c a substantial decreasing trend in hair and nail arsenic concentrations has been observed in majority cases a decreasing trend of 39 3 range 1 34 86 2 of arsenic was observed in hair of the patients n 19 after 12 months in a similar way the nail arsenic showed a decreasing trend of 36 9 range 0 88 85 n 18 a two year study report on the inhabitants n 17 aged 70 years from five arsenic affected families in arsenic prone area of west bengal india highlighted a significant decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation in hair 65 5 range 2 12 96 3 and nail 69 6 range 13 5 87 1 respectively mandal et al 1998 from the group arsenicosis patients n 8 showed severe arsenical skin manifestations and also a noteworthy declining trend in hair 59 5 range 2 12 81 7 and nail 75 7 range 46 3 87 1 arsenic concentration mandal et al 1998 remarkably for few arsenicosis patients the hair and nail arsenic concentrations showed an increasing trend of arsenic in particular hair n 5 and nail n 6 of the patients showed an increased arsenic concentration of 24 4 range 2 65 59 4 and 18 6 range 5 27 35 1 respectively mandal et al 1998 it can be stated that apart from drinking treated arsenic safe water the population presently could not prevent the consumption of arsenic through contaminated foodstuffs rice vegetables and occasionally through contaminated water used for drinking and cooking several studies reported that inorganic arsenic is considered as predominating species present in rice halder et al 2014 contributed consistently to arsenic biomarkers among individuals not exposed to contaminated water davis et al 2017 meharg et al 2014 fig 3 a represented a heat map to show the arsenic distribution pattern between intervals 1 month 12 months for 4 patients selected from the studied group the colour bars in the heat map indicated the progressive change in arsenic concentrations of hair and nail for the patients n 4 being monitored for a period of 12 months the dark blue colour indicates low concentration while dark red signifies high concentration of arsenic accumulation in hair and nail samples of the patients in the case of hair samples an initial decrease in arsenic concentrations has been observed after drinking treated water for a certain period of time however in the fourth month a drastic increase in hair arsenic concentration was observed for all the four patients this contribution of arsenic might be due to occasionally intake of contaminated drinking water from domestic tube well and consumption of contaminated foodstuffs for a quite longer period after the first fourth months the hair arsenic concentration showed a varying trend which is evident from the heat map however in the final 12th month the hair arsenic concentration showed lower accumulation than the initial hair arsenic of 1st month for 3 patients exceptionally patient number 15 showed a drastic increase in arsenic concentration of the final 840 μg kg month from its initial 440 μg kg stage however comparing with the final concentrations of the other patients patient 15 showed its final 12th month hair concentration in lower range so it is indicated in blue colour the scenario of arsenic concentrations in the nail samples is shown in a different heat map fig 3b with exceptional observation for patient 4 patient 4 showed a drastic increase in nail arsenic concentration in the 3rd month and it remained quite high for the next four months although a decrease was observed in the 6th 8th 9th and 12thmonth respectively the nail arsenic concentration showed a varying trend for the initial months however finally it showed lower arsenic deposition in the 12thmonth the other three patients number 9 12 and 15 showed very high nail arsenic concentrations for the first three months however eventually the concentration decreased to a value less than the initial 1st month concentration however in case of patient number 12 the percentage decrease in nail arsenic concentration from the 1st to 12th month was very low compared to rest of the patients n 3 the percentage increase or decrease in hair and nail arsenic concentration of 4 patients for month wise interval has been plotted between each consecutive month 11 month wise intervals fig 3c and d negative percentage decrease value indicates an increase in arsenic concentration of hair and nail samples in this study among 4 patients three of them patient number 4 9 and 12 showed a decreasing trend of hair arsenic concentration from 3840 to 2290 μg kg 5370 to 740 μg kg and 7140 to 5390 μg kg respectively after 12 months whereas patient number 15 showed an increased arsenic concentration from 440 to 840 μg kg after a period of 12 months similarly nail arsenic concentration showed a significant decreasing trend from 5540 to 1140 μg kg 8270 to 4070 μg kg 8350 to 7050 μg kg and 9140 to 1370 μg kg respectively for all the studied four patients after 12 months overall a decreasing percentage in hair and nail arsenic has been observed after 12 months for patient number 4 9 and 12 as 40 6 and 79 4 86 2 and 50 7 24 5 and 15 6 respectively exceptionally patient number 15 showed increased percentage in hair 90 9 and decreased percentage in nail 85 arsenic concentrations after 12 months this variation of arsenic accumulation in hair and nail samples for all the four patients is not only due to drinking of treated water but also attributed to arsenic exposure through contaminated foodstuffs i e rice and vegetables on a daily basis for rural population for the severely arsenic exposed population drinking arsenic safe water might be responsible for observing a monotonous decreasing trend in hair and nail arsenic concentrations 3 3 2 1 arsenic deposition in different kinds of body hair scalp hand and leg of arsenicosis patients among the studied population a limited number of patients number 2 3 9 15 21 and 22 were examined to estimate the arsenic accumulation in different kinds of body hair scalp hand and leg supplementary table s3 the mean arsenic concentration in the body hair showed a variation in distribution pattern in the case of patient number 2 3 9 and 15 the maximum arsenic deposition has been observed in the leg hair mean 6710 μg kg range 3268 11 578 μg kg compared to scalp hair mean 3133 μg kg range 1057 7123 μg kg and hand hair mean 4297 μg kg range 2140 8208 μg kg whereas patient number 21 and 22 showed lower deposition in leg hair mean 1389 μg kg range 500 2278 μg kg compared to scalp hair mean 1868 μg kg range 708 3028 μg kg that means a substantial amount of arsenic is excreted through different kinds of body hair hand and leg other than its deposition in scalp hair and all these values are much higher compared to the normal level of arsenic in hair i e 80 250 μg kg arnold et al 1990 it has been reported earlier that continuous deposition of arsenic occurs in hair present in different parts all over the body althausen and gunther 1929 3 3 2 2 arsenic release through skin scale and body fluid sweat of arsenicosis patients this study was performed to assess the concentration of toxic element preferentially excreted through skin scale and body fluid sweat supplementary table s3 the skin scales collected from the limited number of patients number 3 6 12 21 and 22 in two intervals showed high arsenic accumulation mean 1188 μg kg range 136 2730 μg kg roychowdhury 2010 reported that the mean arsenic concentration in skin scales of few arsenicosis patients n 6 from bishnupur and teghoria of gaighata block was 4176 μg kg range 1410 9650 μg kg a similar study from bangladesh showed arsenic in skin scale ranging from 280 to 23 500 μg kg karim 2000 sweating can be referred as a probable mode for elimination of the toxic element from the human body genuis et al 2011 sheng et al 2016 sweat analysis for arsenic elimination from the body is considered as an additional way for monitoring the bioaccumulation of toxic element in humans sears et al 2012 sweat excreted from the human body can be categorized under external biological samples for arsenic estimation arsenic excretion through sweat samples of patient number 9 15 21 and 22 showed a mean value of 37 7 54 3 37 7 and 9 13 μg l respectively collected in two intervals the excretion of arsenic through sweat is higher than urine for the studied population the lower level of urinary arsenic might be due to consumption of arsenic safe drinking water by the studied population urinary arsenic is a good biomarker of recent exposure to arsenic li et al 2011 and approximately 60 75 of ingested arsenic is excreted through urine within a few days vahter 1994 whereas sweating deserves high consideration for toxic element detoxification as rural people regularly undergoes exercise due to their occupational activities exercise in daily life promotes sweating and thereby eliminates toxic substances sheng et al 2016 few reports have examined the levels of toxic elements in body fluids like sweat from the arsenic exposed populations thus enabling to study the efficiency of toxic element elimination through sweat genuis et al 2011 hoshi et al 2001 moreover external contamination caused due to use of arsenic contaminated water for different human activities might contribute an increased level of arsenic in sweat samples 3 3 3 dermatological manifestations of the arsenicosis patients severe arsenical skin manifestations like keratosis spotted and diffuse melanosis spotted and diffuse whole body melanosis bowen s carcinoma and conjunctivitis have been observed in the studied patients field visit programs were conducted for 3 days with medical team assistants along with a dermatologist for the dermatological study detecting patients with severe dermatological manifestations prevalence of dermatological manifestations and arsenical skin lesions of few of the patients have been shown in fig 4 a and b distribution of different kinds of arsenical features including the severity level of arsenic exposure has been noticed among the studied patients supplementary table s1 approximately 62 5 58 3 50 and 33 3 of the studied population n 24 have been suffering from diffuse melanosis on trunk diffuse keratosis on palm diffuse keratosis on sole and whole body melanosis respectively presence of bowen s 37 5 and carcinoma 8 33 indicated the severity of arsenic exposure among the studied population two of the arsenicosis patients namely p2 and p23 suffering from severe arsenic toxicity died in 2020 fig 4b and supplementary table s1 roychowdhury 2010 reported the existence of arsenical patients n 104 suffering from severe dermatological symptoms in gaighata block the exposure rate of arsenic particularly depends on its duration and cancer is usually caused depending on its long term chronic exposure vázquez et al 2016 the severe health hazards specifically depend on the methylation of arsenic which is triggered by dose mode and type of arsenic and especially nutritional status of the arsenic exposed inhabitants goswami et al 2020 it has been revealed that chronic exposure to arsenic toxicity results in a characteristic pattern of dermatological effects in human body that rises with the whole body pigmentation melanosis to keratosis hyperkeratosis spotted or diffuse nrc 2001 maximum body burden with respect to chronic arsenic toxicity has been reported in the populace from extremely high mathpara and highly eithbhata arsenic exposed areas of the block joardar et al 2021b 3 3 4 relation between arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological manifestations one way anova tukey test has been performed at 95 confidence level to evaluate the relationship among arsenic intakes domestic tube well water cooked rice and cooked vegetables arsenic excretes through biological tissues and dermatological manifestations dm of the patients the arsenic concentration in dietary intakes is considered as the dependent variable whereas biological tissues scalp hair and nail and dermatological manifestations dm are taken as independent variable respectively alternate h1 hypothesis denotes the means of dependent and independent variables are different whereas null h0 hypothesis denotes for the means of all the variables are equal the respective fcal value against the fcritical value along with the p value has been shown in table 4 alternate h1 hypothesis is accepted in all the studied groups as their fcal values are higher than the fcritical values the studied groups showed that the difference of the means is significant at the 0 05 level which denotes significant relationship within the arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological manifestations dm respectively as a result it can be said that apart from ingestion of higher level of arsenic through domestic tube well water for prolonged period consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs on a daily basis contribute significantly to the health exposure exposure to arsenic toxicity through dietary foodstuffs leads to chronic and severe health hazards martinez et al 2011 melkonian et al 2013 3 3 5 differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through biomarkers for the studied male and female patients lmm linear mixed models has been used to estimate the temporal trend of arsenic levels in different biomarkers considering each patient as a random variable to account for the variability which is a distinctive constant for every individual there was no sex specific difference in as content in urine across the 6 months however the temporal trend shows significant difference between each month p 0 05 fig 5 a these findings corroborate with several reports on study groups using safe drinking water which showed decrease in urine arsenic metabolites within a short time period buchet et al 1981 mandal et al 1998 tam et al 1979 hair and nail arsenic levels indicate that the population are having higher body burden in case of biological tissues hair and nail differential temporal trend of arsenic accumulation was observed across all the time points 12 months the temporal pattern across all time points for both male and female have been shown for hair and nail arsenic concentrations in fig 5b and c respectively a significant declining trend in hair arsenic concentration has been observed during the 2nd p 0 0001 and 3rd p 0 0003 month respectively fig 5b however a sudden burst in hair arsenic abundance was observed in the 4th month p 2 34 10 6 followed by a significant decline throughout the 6th p 0 0419 8th p 0 0160 9th p 0 0114 10th p 0 0204 11th p 0 0023 and 12th p 0 0012 months in hair slightly higher variability has been observed compared to nail which might be due to adherence of arsenic to hair during bathing with contaminated water and total removal of absorbed arsenic on the surface of hair prior to analysis is inadvertently not accomplished mandal et al 1998 whereas the temporal trend across 12 time points for nail arsenic concentration showed a significant increase in the 2nd p 0 0103 3rd p 0 0276 and 4th p 0 0105 month respectively following an overall declining trend from 5th month onwards fig 5c the overall trend indicates that arsenic concentrations in different tissues significantly decrease with time these observations further support the model that under controlled environment arsenic is usually excreted through physiological processes from the body system mandal et al 1998 a significant p 1 78 10 9 increase in present body weight estimated mean weight gain of 1 1 kg was observed for both male mean 53 3 kg n 15 and female mean 55 7 kg n 7 arsenicosis patients from the studied population when compared to their respective previous body weights male mean 52 2 kg n 15 and female mean 53 5 kg n 7 fig 5d this observation focuses that the studied male and female patients are presently aware of the severe arsenical body burden and undergoing a proper maintained nutritional diet mainly arsenic treated drinking water on a daily basis 4 risk thermometer based on the arsenic toxicity exposure level through dietary intake the risk thermometer classifies the class of risk among the exposed population through consumption of different dietary intakes according to the risk thermometer sand et al 2015a the risk class samoe along with their respective concern level through consumption of arsenic contaminated water treated drinking water and foodstuffs both raw and cooked rice and vegetables has been shown in table 5 supplementary fig s2a represents the risk thermometer of all the dietary intakes in comparison to reference thermometer with samoe risk class and concern level values the treated drinking water showed concern level with low to moderate risk class 3 whereas for arsenic contaminated water the risk class was 5 high in the case of cooked dietary intakes the risk thermometer showed the high concern level class 5 for rice and low to moderate risk of suffering class 3 for vegetables hence the future risk of suffering from arsenic toxicity still persists for the exposed patients through consumption of contaminated rice compared to vegetables and treated drinking water 5 health risk assessment through consumption of different dietary intakes highlighting future cancer risk for the patients the cancer and non cancer health risk assessment has been performed to evaluate the risk in the patients through dietary intakes table 5 the evaluation showed the probability of future cancer risk factors of the patients being exposed to arsenic toxicity through consumption of safe drinking water and contaminated dietary foodstuffs described in section 2 6 2 the domestic shallow water arsenic contaminated which was previously consumed for a long period of time showed highest cancer 2 7 10 2 and non cancer 60 6 risk among the patients and these values are much higher compared to the treated water 2 10 4 0 54 respectively which is presently used for drinking the threshold level for cancer and non cancer risk caused due to arsenic toxicity is 1 10 6 acceptable range for lifetime cancer risk 10 6 to 10 4 and hq value becomes 1 respectively usepa 2005 the cooked rice contributed high cancer 6 8 10 3 and non cancer risk 15 1 compared to the cooked vegetables 7 10 4 1 54 respectively moreover the health risk is higher through ingestion of cooked rice compared to treated drinking water and vegetables an unacceptable non carcinogenic risk exists for the studied patients through dietary intakes as hq value is greater than 1 in all cases other than treated drinking water the observed hq value reveals that the patients are prone to numerous future health risks due to intake of arsenic contaminated rice overall the order of cancer and non cancer risk through daily dietary intakes is as cooked rice cooked vegetables treated drinking water consumption of arsenic through dietary foodstuffs rice and vegetables might be responsible for future health risk factor with respect to arsenic toxicity for the patients the cancer and non cancer risk for all the individuals through consumption of treated drinking water and cooked foodstuffs like rice and vegetables crosses the respective threshold level of arsenic in each case supplementary fig s2b higher cancer and non cancer risk have been reported among the inhabitants from arsenic exposed areas of west bengal india and bangladesh through ingestion of rice and other dietary foodstuffs islam et al 2017 joardar et al 2021a b 6 conclusion in rural bengal proper supply of treated water among the arsenicosis patients is providing better understanding to overcome this severe arsenic crisis the background arsenic concentration of domestic shallow groundwater and dermatological skin manifestations clearly distinguished that the studied patients have been exposed to severe arsenic toxicity for a long period of time consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs on a daily basis poses potential future health risk the studied population is presently consuming treated arsenic safe drinking water which is being reflected through their urinary arsenic concentrations a decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation in biological tissues hair and nail has been observed for the arsenicosis patients in one year health exposure study statistical modelling estimated differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through different biomarkers urine hair and nail for both the male and female individuals the risk thermometer categorized higher future risk through rice cooked compared to vegetables cooked and treated water for studied exposed population the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk of arsenic is high through consumption of cooked rice and vegetables compared to treated drinking water a detailed study on arsenic speciation in foodstuffs and human biological samples is essential to provide deeper insight of health toxicity and future health risk assessment supplement of arsenic safe water through a proper watershed management using rainwater harvesting and treated surface water is required for drinking and irrigational purposes to restrict its entry in food chain system healthy nutritional food is further recommended for the endangered population to

11804,health effect and future risk assessment have been evaluated for a year on a group of arsenicosis patients n 24 examining the impact of treated surface water with continuous consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs the daily dietary intake rate of arsenic through cooked rice is 5 50 μg kg bw day which is much higher than ptdi recommended value compared to cooked vegetables and treated drinking water the effect of acute toxicity showed a decreasing trend of 42 9 arsenic in urine n 24 after 6 months scalp hair n 19 and nail n 18 arsenic concentration showed a decreasing trend of 39 3 range 1 34 86 2 and 36 9 range 0 88 85 respectively after 12 months the body hair hand and leg and skin scale arsenic accumulation showed high and diverse distribution pattern excretion of arsenic through sweat was higher than urine with a mean concentration of 34 7 μg l range 4 76 65 μg l chronic arsenic exposure for a long period of time is the considerable pathway to severe dermatological skin manifestations in the arsenical patients one way anova tukey test interpretation showed a significant relationship between arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological manifestations within the studied groups linear mixed modelling showed differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through biomarkers for both studied male and female patients the samoe value for treated drinking water and cooked vegetables showed low to moderate concern level class 3 whereas high concern level class 5 was observed for cooked rice the future cancer and non cancerous risk predominantly exists through consumption of rice compared to vegetables and treated drinking water supplementation of arsenic safe drinking water and nutritional food is highly recommended for the arsenic patients to fight against the devastating arsenic calamity graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenicosis patients treated drinking water arsenic contaminated foodstuffs acute and chronic

kidney liver lungs and skin chakraborti et al 2015 rehman et al 2020 methylation of arsenic is mainly dependent on its dosage form and mode of its exposure along with the nutritional background status of the exposed individual goswami et al 2020 growing awareness on arsenic contamination in groundwater among the inhabitants in rural bengal has led to build up several mitigation strategies like boring of deep tube wells installation of arsenic removal plants arp and surface water treatment plants swtp to provide arsenic safe drinking water however due to its limited access the domestic shallow tube well water mostly contaminated with arsenic is still used for cooking and sometimes even for drinking apart from other household purposes like washing bathing etc moreover use of arsenic contaminated groundwater for irrigational purposes aggravates the problem with its entry in food chain chowdhury et al 2018 so this work has been planned to analyse the effect of awareness programmes on severe arsenic calamity and also to observe the trend of arsenical body burden in arsenicosis patients who are exposed to treated drinking water for the last two years the present study attempts to investigate the longitudinal health effect and future risk of arsenicosis patients n 24 who are consuming treated drinking water along with continuous intake of contaminated dietary foodstuffs rice and vegetables on a daily basis from an arsenic endemic area of west bengal india the trend of arsenical body burden has been measured for a year to analyse the acute and chronic effect of arsenic toxicity through arsenic accumulation in urine and biological tissues scalp hair and nail for a period of 6 and 12 months respectively to focus on chronic exposure level and elimination rate from human body system body fluid sweat and body hair hand and leg arsenic depositions have been analyzed statistical interpretation has been performed to correlate among the arsenic intakes and arsenic excretes through deposition in biological tissues as well as dermatological manifestations of the studied group lmm linear mixed models estimated differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through

drinking water arsenic contaminated foodstuffs have been assessed through application of severity adjusted margin of exposure samoe value in risk thermometer future health risk assessment has been carried out for the arsenicosis patients to highlight the risk of cancer and non cancer through consumption of treated drinking water and arsenic contaminated foodstuffs this study has great importance in providing a clear picture on health effect of arsenicosis patients exposed to treated drinking water for last two years and potential future health risk through consumption of arsenic contaminated foodstuffs mainly locally grown rice and vegetables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study population and area a group of arsenicosis patients aged 42 75 years including 17 males and 7 females supplementary table s1 from two severely arsenic exposed villages namely bishnupur mathpara 22 54 11 17 n 88 47 30 97 e and teghoria eithbhata 22 54 19 13 n 88 47 51 12 e situated in sutia gram

addition of 0 1 v v concentrated nitric acid as preservative parboiled rice raw and cooked raw vegetables and cooked vegetable samples were collected in sterilized zip lock packets from domestic level and stored in the laboratory refrigerator at 4 c prior to arsenic analysis biomarkers of arsenic urine scalp hair and nail samples were collected from the arsenicosis patients with one month interval for a period of 6 and 12 months respectively to evaluate the body burden of arsenic toxicity acute and chronic body hair hand leg hair skin scales and sweat samples were also collected from a limited number of arsenicosis patients due to non availability with one month interval from the studied area spot urine samples were collected in sterile bottles placed in an ice cooled box and stored at 20 c until arsenic estimation biological tissue hair nail and skin scales samples were directly collected from the patients and stored in sterile zip locks at room temperature prior to acid digestion followed by arsenic estimation sweat samples were collected without addition of preservative and stored directly into 20 ml sterile bottle genuis et al 2011 sheng et al 2016 during transportation water and sweat samples were placed in an ice cooled box and stored at 4 c in the laboratory refrigerator prior to arsenic estimation detailed information of sample collection preservation storage and

discussion 3 1 groundwater arsenic contamination scenario in the studied area arsenic contamination scenario in different available water sources from the studied area has been shown in table 1 domestic shallow tube well water n 24 samples showed a mean arsenic concentration of 328 245 μg l ranging from 28 to 887 μg l which was much higher than the who recommended value of 10 μg l boring of deep tube wells by local government through gram panchayet cluster of villages level and icds integrated child development services to supplement treated drinking water showed the mean arsenic concentration of 4 5 3 08 μg l range 3 11 4 μg l n 9 and 7 47 7 56 μg l range 3 16 2 μg l n 3 respectively the treated surface water n 24 mainly used for drinking by the studied populations was safe with respect to arsenic concentration 3 μg l in drinking water presence of higher concentration of arsenic in domestic tube well water was reported earlier from the two studied villages of gaighata block namely mathpara 615 μg l and eithbhata 301 μg l respectively joardar et al 2021b consumption of drinking water from domestic shallow tube wells depth range 7 87 26 m is a common practice for the rural population in west bengal 3 2 contribution of arsenic through drinking water and foodstuffs to the daily dietary intakes the different dietary foodstuffs for the studied population include rice and vegetables table 2 the mean arsenic concentration contributed by the raw rice and raw vegetables is 528 236 μg kg range 172 1057 μg kg and 214 92 μg kg range 91 1 469 μg kg respectively in a similar way the cooked rice and vegetables which are consumed on a daily basis by the population contribute mean arsenic concentration of 440 263 μg kg range 119 1054 μg kg and 54 5 63 9 μg kg range 5 61 257 μg kg respectively among all food crops arsenic uptake in rice is substantially high because of the toxic arsenic arsenite species under paddy soil conditions hussain et al 2021 arsenic accumulation in cooked rice depends on the arsenic concentration in water used for cooking apart from rice grain arsenic concentration rice variety and also that a threshold value exists for cooking water arsenic concentration above which arsenic percolates in the cooked rice chowdhury et al 2020 during cooking arsenic flows from water to rice with increasing cooking water arsenic concentration and also cooking with low to moderate arsenic contaminated water leads to lower contribution of the toxic element in its cooked form raab et al 2009 daily dietary consumption rate of drinking water raw rice grain raw vegetables cooked rice and cooked vegetables by individual patients n 24 along with their body weights have been shown in supplementary table s2 a pie chart has been shown to observe the contributions of treated drinking water arsenic safe and cooked foodstuffs rice and vegetables to daily dietary intake rates of arsenic μg kg bw day for the studied population which has been evaluated following the equations mentioned in joardar et al 2021b supplementary fig s1 treated drinking water cooked rice and cooked vegetables curry of mixed raw vegetables contributed 0 18 4 91 range 1 29 12 5 and 0 52 range 0 03 2 50 μg kg bw day of arsenic respectively cooked rice itself contributed considerably higher value compared to the recommended provisional tolerable dietary intake ptdi value of arsenic 3 0 μg kg bw day who 2011 water from domestic tube well consumed by the same studied population n 24 for a prolonged period contributed much higher value of daily dietary intake mean 19 4 μg kg bw day range 1 32 56 2 μg kg bw day n 24 and played a major role behind the chronic arsenic exposure of the patients in rural bengal intake of arsenic contaminated dietary components leads to an additional entry of arsenic posing future risk to the population considering consumption of arsenic safe drinking water for time being halder et al 2013 3 3 factors dependable for health risk analysis of the patients 3 3 1 acute exposure rate from the body system urinary arsenic is considered as the primary biomarker to measure the rate of acute arsenic toxicity watanabe et al 2001 table 3 showed the urinary arsenic concentration of the 24 arsenicosis patients monitored for a period of 6 months a notable decrease in urinary arsenic concentration has been observed from the 1st month mean 8 06 4 71 μg l range 3 22 9 μg l to 6th month mean 4 60 2 42 μg l range 3 13 6 μg l the mean decrease percentage observed in urinary arsenic concentration for 24 patients after a period of 6 months is 42 9 table 3 a distribution pattern of urinary arsenic concentration of the patients n 24 for each month for a period of 6 months has been plotted in fig 1 a the median urinary arsenic concentration showed a lower value in the 6th month 3 44 compared to the 1st month 7 19 a decreasing trend of 52 2 in the median value of urinary arsenic concentration has been observed after a period of 6 months of this study this observation justifies that the studied arsenicosis patients had been consuming treated drinking water for past two years which contains arsenic within the recommended value a two year study report on impact of safe drinking water on arsenicosis patients n 8 showed a decreasing trend 84 6 75 3 90 2 in urinary arsenic concentration mandal et al 1998 joardar et al 2021b reported the presence of lower level arsenic in urine samples from the inhabitants consuming arsenic safe drinking water in gaighata block a mean decreasing trend of 39 2 range 0 75 83 1 n 21 of urinary arsenic concentration has been observed after a period of 6 months in this study whereas three arsenicosis patients showed an increased percentage of urinary arsenic concentration mean 43 1 range 26 1 59 8 the consumption of arsenic through dietary foodstuffs especially rice grain the staple crop might be responsible behind the increased amount of urinary arsenic concentration meharg et al 2014 wei et al 2014 3 3 2 chronic exposure through biological tissues scalp hair and nail evaluation of hair and nail arsenic is the paramount approach to determine the chronic arsenic exposure rate brima et al 2006 samanta et al 2004 hair and nail tissues accumulate significantly high amount of arsenic due to the presence of keratin proteins gault et al 2008 the mean arsenic concentration in hair samples collected from the patients n 24 decreased from 3848 μg kg range 430 12 800 μg kg at 1st month to 2242 μg kg range 150 6740 μg kg after 12 months table 3 similarly for the nail samples the mean arsenic concentration decreased from 3278 μg kg range 550 9140 μg kg at 1st month to 1940 μg kg range 140 7050 μg kg after 12 months this decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation clearly describes that the exposed population consumed treated water arsenic safe for past few years the maximum hair arsenic concentration observed among the group decreased by 41 7 while that of nail decreased by 40 8 at the end of 12 months table 3 a distribution pattern of hair and nail arsenic concentrations of the patients n 14 24 for each month total period of 12 months has been plotted fig 1b it has been clearly observed that the median arsenic concentration for both hair and nail of the 12th month was lower than that of the 1stmonth this observable fact can be attributed to drinking of treated water for a period of past few years containing arsenic within the permissible limit a decrease trend of 24 and 30 median hair and nail arsenic concentrations have been observed respectively after 12 months of study distribution of arsenic concentrations in hair and nail samples during two intervals 1st and 12th month has been shown in fig 2 a and b respectively exceptionally the hair arsenic concentration for the patient number 1 3 14 15 and 23 showed an increasing trend from 1100 to 1130 μg kg 2570 6330 μg kg 1150 1200 μg kg 440 840 μg kg and 1960 2130 μg kg respectively after a period of 12 months fig 2a similarly after an interval of 12 months the nail arsenic concentration for the patient number 8 14 17 18 22 and 23 showed an increasing trend from 3050 to 3220 μg kg 2150 2270 μg kg 960 1480 μg kg 3060 3880 μg kg 580 770 μg kg and 1110 1390 μg kg respectively fig 2b this increasing trend of arsenic accumulation in few specific cases might be due to the consumption of arsenic contaminated foodstuffs within the study period samanta et al 2004 reported that the existence of elevated levels of toxic elements like as mn pb and ni in the biological tissues hair and nail was due to its individual exposure through drinking water and foodstuffs however an overall declining trend of the arsenic concentration in the biological tissues was observed for the maximum number of arsenicosis patients percentage of increase or decrease in arsenic concentrations of biomarkers hair nail during the intervals 1st and 12th month has been shown in fig 2c a substantial decreasing trend in hair and nail arsenic concentrations has been observed in majority cases a decreasing trend of 39 3 range 1 34 86 2 of arsenic was observed in hair of the patients n 19 after 12 months in a similar way the nail arsenic showed a decreasing trend of 36 9 range 0 88 85 n 18 a two year study report on the inhabitants n 17 aged 70 years from five arsenic affected families in arsenic prone area of west bengal india highlighted a significant decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation in hair 65 5 range 2 12 96 3 and nail 69 6 range 13 5 87 1 respectively mandal et al 1998 from the group arsenicosis patients n 8 showed severe arsenical skin manifestations and also a noteworthy declining trend in hair 59 5 range 2 12 81 7 and nail 75 7 range 46 3 87 1 arsenic concentration mandal et al 1998 remarkably for few arsenicosis patients the hair and nail arsenic concentrations showed an increasing trend of arsenic in particular hair n 5 and nail n 6 of the patients showed an increased arsenic concentration of 24 4 range 2 65 59 4 and 18 6 range 5 27 35 1 respectively mandal et al 1998 it can be stated that apart from drinking treated arsenic safe water the population presently could not prevent the consumption of arsenic through contaminated foodstuffs rice vegetables and occasionally through contaminated water used for drinking and cooking several studies reported that inorganic arsenic is considered as predominating species present in rice halder et al 2014 contributed consistently to arsenic biomarkers among individuals not exposed to contaminated water davis et al 2017 meharg et al 2014 fig 3 a represented a heat map to show the arsenic distribution pattern between intervals 1 month 12 months for 4 patients selected from the studied group the colour bars in the heat map indicated the progressive change in arsenic concentrations of hair and nail for the patients n 4 being monitored for a period of 12 months the dark blue colour indicates low concentration while dark red signifies high concentration of arsenic accumulation in hair and nail samples of the patients in the case of hair samples an initial decrease in arsenic concentrations has been observed after drinking treated water for a certain period of time however in the fourth month a drastic increase in hair arsenic concentration was observed for all the four patients this contribution of arsenic might be due to occasionally intake of contaminated drinking water from domestic tube well and consumption of contaminated foodstuffs for a quite longer period after the first fourth months the hair arsenic concentration showed a varying trend which is evident from the heat map however in the final 12th month the hair arsenic concentration showed lower accumulation than the initial hair arsenic of 1st month for 3 patients exceptionally patient number 15 showed a drastic increase in arsenic concentration of the final 840 μg kg month from its initial 440 μg kg stage however comparing with the final concentrations of the other patients patient 15 showed its final 12th month hair concentration in lower range so it is indicated in blue colour the scenario of arsenic concentrations in the nail samples is shown in a different heat map fig 3b with exceptional observation for patient 4 patient 4 showed a drastic increase in nail arsenic concentration in the 3rd month and it remained quite high for the next four months although a decrease was observed in the 6th 8th 9th and 12thmonth respectively the nail arsenic concentration showed a varying trend for the initial months however finally it showed lower arsenic deposition in the 12thmonth the other three patients number 9 12 and 15 showed very high nail arsenic concentrations for the first three months however eventually the concentration decreased to a value less than the initial 1st month concentration however in case of patient number 12 the percentage decrease in nail arsenic concentration from the 1st to 12th month was very low compared to rest of the patients n 3 the percentage increase or decrease in hair and nail arsenic concentration of 4 patients for month wise interval has been plotted between each consecutive month 11 month wise intervals fig 3c and d negative percentage decrease value indicates an increase in arsenic concentration of hair and nail samples in this study among 4 patients three of them patient number 4 9 and 12 showed a decreasing trend of hair arsenic concentration from 3840 to 2290 μg kg 5370 to 740 μg kg and 7140 to 5390 μg kg respectively after 12 months whereas patient number 15 showed an increased arsenic concentration from 440 to 840 μg kg after a period of 12 months similarly nail arsenic concentration showed a significant decreasing trend from 5540 to 1140 μg kg 8270 to 4070 μg kg 8350 to 7050 μg kg and 9140 to 1370 μg kg respectively for all the studied four patients after 12 months overall a decreasing percentage in hair and nail arsenic has been observed after 12 months for patient number 4 9 and 12 as 40 6 and 79 4 86 2 and 50 7 24 5 and 15 6 respectively exceptionally patient number 15 showed increased percentage in hair 90 9 and decreased percentage in nail 85 arsenic concentrations after 12 months this variation of arsenic accumulation in hair and nail samples for all the four patients is not only due to drinking of treated water but also attributed to arsenic exposure through contaminated foodstuffs i e rice and vegetables on a daily basis for rural population for the severely arsenic exposed population drinking arsenic safe water might be responsible for observing a monotonous decreasing trend in hair and nail arsenic concentrations 3 3 2 1 arsenic deposition in different kinds of body hair scalp hand and leg of arsenicosis patients among the studied population a limited number of patients number 2 3 9 15 21 and 22 were examined to estimate the arsenic accumulation in different kinds of body hair scalp hand and leg supplementary table s3 the mean arsenic concentration in the body hair showed a variation in distribution pattern in the case of patient number 2 3 9 and 15 the maximum arsenic deposition has been observed in the leg hair mean 6710 μg kg range 3268 11 578 μg kg compared to scalp hair mean 3133 μg kg range 1057 7123 μg kg and hand hair mean 4297 μg kg range 2140 8208 μg kg whereas patient number 21 and 22 showed lower deposition in leg hair mean 1389 μg kg range 500 2278 μg kg compared to scalp hair mean 1868 μg kg range 708 3028 μg kg that means a substantial amount of arsenic is excreted through different kinds of body hair hand and leg other than its deposition in scalp hair and all these values are much higher compared to the normal level of arsenic in hair i e 80 250 μg kg arnold et al 1990 it has been reported earlier that continuous deposition of arsenic occurs in hair present in different parts all over the body althausen and gunther 1929 3 3 2 2 arsenic release through skin scale and body fluid sweat of arsenicosis patients this study was performed to assess the concentration of toxic element preferentially excreted through skin scale and body fluid sweat supplementary table s3 the skin scales collected from the limited number of patients number 3 6 12 21 and 22 in two intervals showed high arsenic accumulation mean 1188 μg kg range 136 2730 μg kg roychowdhury 2010 reported that the mean arsenic concentration in skin scales of few arsenicosis patients n 6 from bishnupur and teghoria of gaighata block was 4176 μg kg range 1410 9650 μg kg a similar study from bangladesh showed arsenic in skin scale ranging from 280 to 23 500 μg kg karim 2000 sweating can be referred as a probable mode for elimination of the toxic element from the human body genuis et al 2011 sheng et al 2016 sweat analysis for arsenic elimination from the body is considered as an additional way for monitoring the bioaccumulation of toxic element in humans sears et al 2012 sweat excreted from the human body can be categorized under external biological samples for arsenic estimation arsenic excretion through sweat samples of patient number 9 15 21 and 22 showed a mean value of 37 7 54 3 37 7 and 9 13 μg l respectively collected in two intervals the excretion of arsenic through sweat is higher than urine for the studied population the lower level of urinary arsenic might be due to consumption of arsenic safe drinking water by the studied population urinary arsenic is a good biomarker of recent exposure to arsenic li et al 2011 and approximately 60 75 of ingested arsenic is excreted through urine within a few days vahter 1994 whereas sweating deserves high consideration for toxic element detoxification as rural people regularly undergoes exercise due to their occupational activities exercise in daily life promotes sweating and thereby eliminates toxic substances sheng et al 2016 few reports have examined the levels of toxic elements in body fluids like sweat from the arsenic exposed populations thus enabling to study the efficiency of toxic element elimination through sweat genuis et al 2011 hoshi et al 2001 moreover external contamination caused due to use of arsenic contaminated water for different human activities might contribute an increased level of arsenic in sweat samples 3 3 3 dermatological manifestations of the arsenicosis patients severe arsenical skin manifestations like keratosis spotted and diffuse melanosis spotted and diffuse whole body melanosis bowen s carcinoma and conjunctivitis have been observed in the studied patients field visit programs were conducted for 3 days with medical team assistants along with a dermatologist for the dermatological study detecting patients with severe dermatological manifestations prevalence of dermatological manifestations and arsenical skin lesions of few of the patients have been shown in fig 4 a and b distribution of different kinds of arsenical features including the severity level of arsenic exposure has been noticed among the studied patients supplementary table s1 approximately 62 5 58 3 50 and 33 3 of the studied population n 24 have been suffering from diffuse melanosis on trunk diffuse keratosis on palm diffuse keratosis on sole and whole body melanosis respectively presence of bowen s 37 5 and carcinoma 8 33 indicated the severity of arsenic exposure among the studied population two of the arsenicosis patients namely p2 and p23 suffering from severe arsenic toxicity died in 2020 fig 4b and supplementary table s1 roychowdhury 2010 reported the existence of arsenical patients n 104 suffering from severe dermatological symptoms in gaighata block the exposure rate of arsenic particularly depends on its duration and cancer is usually caused depending on its long term chronic exposure vázquez et al 2016 the severe health hazards specifically depend on the methylation of arsenic which is triggered by dose mode and type of arsenic and especially nutritional status of the arsenic exposed inhabitants goswami et al 2020 it has been revealed that chronic exposure to arsenic toxicity results in a characteristic pattern of dermatological effects in human body that rises with the whole body pigmentation melanosis to keratosis hyperkeratosis spotted or diffuse nrc 2001 maximum body burden with respect to chronic arsenic toxicity has been reported in the populace from extremely high mathpara and highly eithbhata arsenic exposed areas of the block joardar et al 2021b 3 3 4 relation between arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological manifestations one way anova tukey test has been performed at 95 confidence level to evaluate the relationship among arsenic intakes domestic tube well water cooked rice and cooked vegetables arsenic excretes through biological tissues and dermatological manifestations dm of the patients the arsenic concentration in dietary intakes is considered as the dependent variable whereas biological tissues scalp hair and nail and dermatological manifestations dm are taken as independent variable respectively alternate h1 hypothesis denotes the means of dependent and independent variables are different whereas null h0 hypothesis denotes for the means of all the variables are equal the respective fcal value against the fcritical value along with the p value has been shown in table 4 alternate h1 hypothesis is accepted in all the studied groups as their fcal values are higher than the fcritical values the studied groups showed that the difference of the means is significant at the 0 05 level which denotes significant relationship within the arsenic intakes biological tissues and dermatological manifestations dm respectively as a result it can be said that apart from ingestion of higher level of arsenic through domestic tube well water for prolonged period consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs on a daily basis contribute significantly to the health exposure exposure to arsenic toxicity through dietary foodstuffs leads to chronic and severe health hazards martinez et al 2011 melkonian et al 2013 3 3 5 differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through biomarkers for the studied male and female patients lmm linear mixed models has been used to estimate the temporal trend of arsenic levels in different biomarkers considering each patient as a random variable to account for the variability which is a distinctive constant for every individual there was no sex specific difference in as content in urine across the 6 months however the temporal trend shows significant difference between each month p 0 05 fig 5 a these findings corroborate with several reports on study groups using safe drinking water which showed decrease in urine arsenic metabolites within a short time period buchet et al 1981 mandal et al 1998 tam et al 1979 hair and nail arsenic levels indicate that the population are having higher body burden in case of biological tissues hair and nail differential temporal trend of arsenic accumulation was observed across all the time points 12 months the temporal pattern across all time points for both male and female have been shown for hair and nail arsenic concentrations in fig 5b and c respectively a significant declining trend in hair arsenic concentration has been observed during the 2nd p 0 0001 and 3rd p 0 0003 month respectively fig 5b however a sudden burst in hair arsenic abundance was observed in the 4th month p 2 34 10 6 followed by a significant decline throughout the 6th p 0 0419 8th p 0 0160 9th p 0 0114 10th p 0 0204 11th p 0 0023 and 12th p 0 0012 months in hair slightly higher variability has been observed compared to nail which might be due to adherence of arsenic to hair during bathing with contaminated water and total removal of absorbed arsenic on the surface of hair prior to analysis is inadvertently not accomplished mandal et al 1998 whereas the temporal trend across 12 time points for nail arsenic concentration showed a significant increase in the 2nd p 0 0103 3rd p 0 0276 and 4th p 0 0105 month respectively following an overall declining trend from 5th month onwards fig 5c the overall trend indicates that arsenic concentrations in different tissues significantly decrease with time these observations further support the model that under controlled environment arsenic is usually excreted through physiological processes from the body system mandal et al 1998 a significant p 1 78 10 9 increase in present body weight estimated mean weight gain of 1 1 kg was observed for both male mean 53 3 kg n 15 and female mean 55 7 kg n 7 arsenicosis patients from the studied population when compared to their respective previous body weights male mean 52 2 kg n 15 and female mean 53 5 kg n 7 fig 5d this observation focuses that the studied male and female patients are presently aware of the severe arsenical body burden and undergoing a proper maintained nutritional diet mainly arsenic treated drinking water on a daily basis 4 risk thermometer based on the arsenic toxicity exposure level through dietary intake the risk thermometer classifies the class of risk among the exposed population through consumption of different dietary intakes according to the risk thermometer sand et al 2015a the risk class samoe along with their respective concern level through consumption of arsenic contaminated water treated drinking water and foodstuffs both raw and cooked rice and vegetables has been shown in table 5 supplementary fig s2a represents the risk thermometer of all the dietary intakes in comparison to reference thermometer with samoe risk class and concern level values the treated drinking water showed concern level with low to moderate risk class 3 whereas for arsenic contaminated water the risk class was 5 high in the case of cooked dietary intakes the risk thermometer showed the high concern level class 5 for rice and low to moderate risk of suffering class 3 for vegetables hence the future risk of suffering from arsenic toxicity still persists for the exposed patients through consumption of contaminated rice compared to vegetables and treated drinking water 5 health risk assessment through consumption of different dietary intakes highlighting future cancer risk for the patients the cancer and non cancer health risk assessment has been performed to evaluate the risk in the patients through dietary intakes table 5 the evaluation showed the probability of future cancer risk factors of the patients being exposed to arsenic toxicity through consumption of safe drinking water and contaminated dietary foodstuffs described in section 2 6 2 the domestic shallow water arsenic contaminated which was previously consumed for a long period of time showed highest cancer 2 7 10 2 and non cancer 60 6 risk among the patients and these values are much higher compared to the treated water 2 10 4 0 54 respectively which is presently used for drinking the threshold level for cancer and non cancer risk caused due to arsenic toxicity is 1 10 6 acceptable range for lifetime cancer risk 10 6 to 10 4 and hq value becomes 1 respectively usepa 2005 the cooked rice contributed high cancer 6 8 10 3 and non cancer risk 15 1 compared to the cooked vegetables 7 10 4 1 54 respectively moreover the health risk is higher through ingestion of cooked rice compared to treated drinking water and vegetables an unacceptable non carcinogenic risk exists for the studied patients through dietary intakes as hq value is greater than 1 in all cases other than treated drinking water the observed hq value reveals that the patients are prone to numerous future health risks due to intake of arsenic contaminated rice overall the order of cancer and non cancer risk through daily dietary intakes is as cooked rice cooked vegetables treated drinking water consumption of arsenic through dietary foodstuffs rice and vegetables might be responsible for future health risk factor with respect to arsenic toxicity for the patients the cancer and non cancer risk for all the individuals through consumption of treated drinking water and cooked foodstuffs like rice and vegetables crosses the respective threshold level of arsenic in each case supplementary fig s2b higher cancer and non cancer risk have been reported among the inhabitants from arsenic exposed areas of west bengal india and bangladesh through ingestion of rice and other dietary foodstuffs islam et al 2017 joardar et al 2021a b 6 conclusion in rural bengal proper supply of treated water among the arsenicosis patients is providing better understanding to overcome this severe arsenic crisis the background arsenic concentration of domestic shallow groundwater and dermatological skin manifestations clearly distinguished that the studied patients have been exposed to severe arsenic toxicity for a long period of time consumption of arsenic contaminated dietary foodstuffs on a daily basis poses potential future health risk the studied population is presently consuming treated arsenic safe drinking water which is being reflected through their urinary arsenic concentrations a decreasing trend of arsenic accumulation in biological tissues hair and nail has been observed for the arsenicosis patients in one year health exposure study statistical modelling estimated differential temporal trends of arsenic levels through different biomarkers urine hair and nail for both the male and female individuals the risk thermometer categorized higher future risk through rice cooked compared to vegetables cooked and treated water for studied exposed population the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk of arsenic is high through consumption of cooked rice and vegetables compared to treated drinking water a detailed study on arsenic speciation in foodstuffs and human biological samples is essential to provide deeper insight of health toxicity and future health risk assessment supplement of arsenic safe water through a proper watershed management using rainwater harvesting and treated surface water is required for drinking and irrigational purposes to restrict its entry in food chain system healthy nutritional food is further recommended for the endangered population to fight against the devastating calamity of arsenic ethics approval health guideline for human experiment has been followed and all procedures performed in this study involving human participants were
