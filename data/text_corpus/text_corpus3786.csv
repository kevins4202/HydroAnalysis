18930,pre oxidation is effective in enhancing sludge dewaterability different types and doses of oxidants are used to improve sludge dewaterability in pre oxidation rapid evaluation of the sludge dewaterability is vital for optimizing the type and dose of oxidants in pre oxidation it normally takes more time to evaluate sludge dewaterability by measuring typical indicators such as specific resistance to filtration srf content of bound water and composition of eps this study presented a rapid parameter oxidation reduction potential orp to correlate it with the dewaterability of pre

wastewater treatment process membrane bioreactor can be an alternative way for treating waste activated sludge sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 currently the wastewater treatment plants are facing a big challenge with regards to management of waste activated sludge due to its increased production dewatering is effective in sludge reduction and subsequent disposal shi et al 2015 pre oxidation was a crucial and determining step in enhancing sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2016 wherein it caused destruction solubilization or reduction of highly hydrated biopolymers thus bound water could be converted to free water yu et al 2016 degree of pre oxidation is critical for sludge dewatering insufficient oxidation cannot effectively convert bound water to free water while excessive oxidation can significantly disintegrate sludge flocs and cause difficulty in subsequent filtration chen et al 2016 the effectiveness of pre oxidation depends on various factors including oxidant dose ph oxidation time sludge type sludge concentration and activators e g thermal guan et al 2012 alkali li et al 2017 photocatalysts zhou et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2019 yang et al 2019 and transition metals anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 however it is difficult to determine exactly which oxidant and at what concentration could yield a favorable degree of pre oxidation because the results in related literature were obtained using different methods wu et al 2014 zhen et al 2012a lack of an effective method is the main difficulty in evaluating the dewaterability of pre oxidized sludge samples for example typical tests of specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst are inappropriate to fully characterize the sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation as they are empirical tools for engineering practices herwijin 1996 some studies used contents of extracellular polymeric substance eps to indicate the dewaterability of pre oxidized sludge samples chen et al 2016 however eps extraction typically takes hours or days others used bound water content as an indicator of dewaterability jin et al 2015 however the experimental errors were common problems for its measurement raynaud et al 2012 furthermore the indiscernible relationship was reported between bound water content and sludge dewaterability vaxelaire and cézac 2004 therefore a better indicator is of needs to rapidly evaluate the effects of pre oxidation on sludge dewaterability oxidation reduction potential orp is a widely used parameter for on line monitoring of characteristics reflecting many chemical and biological oxidation processes khanal and huang 2003 yu et al 2013 monitored the orp values in electro fenton process and found that orp values correlated well with concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fe ii and fe iii khanal and huang 2003 regulated oxygen dose for sulfide oxidation using orp as a controlling parameter kishida et al 2003 detected the end points of anoxic and oxic phases based on orp value during the oxidation reactions murugesan et al 2014 observed a relative increased orp value in anaerobically digested sewage sludge samples with better dewaterability however the correlation between orp values and sludge dewaterability was not the focus in their studies this study was aimed at studying the correlation between orp values and sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation fig 1 shows the flowchart of this study briefly changes of orp values versus time and sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation were investigated relationships between the changes in orp values and sludge physicochemical properties such as eps contents particle sizes zeta potential cell lysis degree and fe ii fe iii contents were then evaluated by pearson s correlation test and a multiple linear regression model finally the dewaterability of the sludge conditioned by pre oxidation combined with fe iii coagulation process in laboratory scale was evaluated to explore the role of a suitable degree of pre oxidation as indicated by orp values in sludge dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics and chemicals the secondary sludge after thickening was used as raw sludge rs and it was collected from a local water reclamation plant wuhan china the primary characteristics of the rs are listed in table 1 before use it was kept at 4 c experiments

0 5 and 0 6 mmol g volatile solids vs were added into the rs 200 ml for conditioning using a 500 ml beaker then the sludge samples were conditioned at room temperature for 20 min at 350 revolutions per minute rpm by a magnetic stirrer c mag hs 7 control ika germany the rs was used as the control after different treatments samples were collected for the measurements of cst srf particle size zeta potential eps extraction and fe iii fe ii content each experiment was conducted in triplicates 2 3 laboratory scale dewatering experiments different doses of oxone 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mmol g vs were added to the rs at 150 rpm for 20 min followed by a coagulation process with 0 81 mmol fe iii g vs at 100 rpm for 15 min and the entire conditioning time was 35 min yu et al 2016 the set up of the laboratory scale diaphragm filter press system is shown in fig s1 following the dewatering procedures in yu et al 2016 the water content of the dewatered cake was measured by drying at 105 c in an oven until the weight became constant 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 orp measurement orp was measured by an orp electrode mtc301 hach instrument co ltd usa the probe is a digital electrode with a refillable ag agcl reference and a built in temperature sensor orp redox standard solution samples apure kuosi electronic co ltd shanghai china were used to calibrate the orp probe a stirring speed of 350 rpm was selected for the orp measurements fig s2 in this study δorp was referred to the difference between the orp values at 0 5 min and at 0 min δorp orpt 0 5 min orpt 0 min 2 4 2 sludge characteristics the standard methods were used to determine total solids ts and vs of sludge samples apha 2005 zeta potential and particle size were measured with a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 particle analyzer and a malvern 2000 mastersizer malvern instruments ltd uk respectively following methods described in xiong et al 2018 the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii in the sludge samples were determined and the detailed procedures are shown in the text s1 of supplementary material 2 4 3 sludge dewaterability the cst was measured with a 304 m instrument triton uk srf was determined according to detailed procedures described in liu et al 2012 2 4 4 extraction and determination of eps different fractions of eps in sludge were extracted using a thermal method li and yang 2007 with details can be found in the text s2 of supplementary material toc concentrations were measured with a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany the proteins in different eps solutions were quantified by a lowry protein assay kit thermofisher uk le et al 2016 an fp 650 fluorescence spectrophotometer was employed to obtain three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra jasco hitachi japan fluorescence regional integration technique was further used to analyze the eem data as follows tyrosine like proteins region i tryptophan like protein region ii fulvic acid like materials region iii microbial by product like materials region iv and humic acid like organic compounds region v chen et al 2003 with details can be found in the text s2 of supplementary material and table s1 the molecular weights of the eps samples were measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent technologies usa and details can be found in the text s2 of supplementary material 2 4 5 the lactate dehydrogenase ldh test as a cytoplasmic enzyme ldh is stable in all intact cells it can be released when damage of the plasma membrane occurs zheng et al 2011 presence of dead or plasma membrane damaged cells would enhance ldh enzyme activity gu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 the ldh enzyme activity was tested with a cytotoxicity detection kit c0016 beyotime applied science co shanghai china according to the manufacture s instruction the relative ldh release defined as the measured ldh intensity of the pre oxidized sludge sample divided by the ldh intensity of the rs was an indicator of the cell permeability of the pre oxidized sludge samples he et al 2017 2 4 6 statistical analysis to examine the linear correlations between δorp and the key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability the pearson s correlation coefficient r was calculated by spss 19 0 software a multiple linear regression model equation was further developed between δorp values and the main factors affecting sludge dewaterability using sas 8 0 software the regression coefficient the difference between the experimental and predicted values and p values of all estimated coefficients were calculated to test the reliability of the established model and the detailed procedure can be found in xiao et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 the profiles of orp values during pre oxidation changes of orp values versus time in the sludge samples pretreated by different doses of oxone are shown in fig 2 a the orp value of the rs was around 208 mv indicating a reductive environment in the waste activated sludge wu et al 2014 after addition of oxone the orp values increased rapidly and the highest orp value was achieved at only about 0 5 min indicating a strong oxidizing environment thereafter the orp values decreased gradually and stayed relatively constant till the end this may be because the orp values can be influenced by the concentrations of oxidants and reductants in pre oxidation tang et al 2012 δorp values are shown in fig 2b it is also noted that a higher oxone dose would result in a higher δorp value of the pre oxidized sludge samples δorp value increased from 22 mv for the rs to 118 mv with an oxone dose of 0 1 mmol g vs and further to 461 mv with an oxone dose of 0 6 mmol g vs to further evaluate pre oxidation for enhancing sludge dewaterability the following studies focused on exploring the relationship between the δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability 3 2 correlation between δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability 3 2 1 correlation between δorp values and cst srf for the rs with a δorp value of 22 mv the values of cst and srf were 386 2 s and 1 89 1013 m kg respectively table 1 after adding different doses of oxone changes of cst and srf of the pre oxidized sludge samples at different δorp values are shown in fig 3 when the value of δorp increased up to 118 mv with an oxone dose of 0 1 mmol g vs cst and srf decreased to 289 6 s and 1 48 1013 m kg respectively fig 3 these results indicated an improved sludge dewaterability when compared with the rs possibly owing to the oxone oxidation activated by the indigenous iron in the rs the degradation of the hydrophilic eps and the shift of bound water to free water zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2016 when the oxone dose increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol g vs with the corresponding δorp increased from 118 to 461 mv the cst and srf values increased continuously which indicates the deterioration of sludge dewaterability at higher δorp values it was found that δorp showed a strong and positive correlation with srf r 0 89 p 0 05 fig 3 indicating the feasibility of using the δorp value to evaluate srf of the pre oxidized sludge samples however the δorp value failed to evaluate cst values as indicated by the indiscernible correlation p 0 05 fig 3 the inconsistency of using δorp to evaluate the cst and srf values can be explained with the different measuring principles of these two indexes the cst measures the time of free water flowing between two electrodes in a filter paper wong et al 2015 when the oxidation disintegrated sludge flocs and microbial cells the released water might be absorbed into the polymeric compounds which could affect the results of cst measurement lee et al 2016 chen et al 1996 also pointed out that the direct use of cst failed to characterize the dewaterability of sludge containing much bound water in comparison srf measures the hydraulic resistance of water from cake solids when it moves in the porous filter cake which is independent of the dewatering method used neyens and baeyens 2003a wong et al 2015 3 2 2 correlation between δorp values and zeta potential particle size the zeta potential of the rs δorp 22 mv was 14 0 1 1 mv table 1 owing to ionization of functional groups e g cooh and nh2 in the protein liu et al 2016 changes of zeta potential of the pre oxidized sludge samples are shown in fig 4 when the δorp value of the pre oxidized sludge increased from 118 to 461 mv the zeta potential increased slightly this might be related with the oxidation reaction between oxone and indigenous iron contained in the sludge zhou et al 2015 when the δorp value increased from 118 to 461 mv the concentrations of fe iii in the sludge filtrate and sludge cake both increased table s2 yu et al 2013 also reported that orp profiles showed high correlations with the trends of fe iii during electro fenton process the increase of fe iii might contribute to the increase of zeta potential as the positive charge of fe iii could decrease electrostatic repulsive interaction through electrostatic neutralization he et al 2015 a strong and positive relationship r 0 86 p 0 05 was found between the δorp value and the zeta potential fig 4 it was similar to the results of he et al 2015 who also found that higher orp values of sludge samples could result in less negative zeta potential values the dewaterability is also affected by sludge particle size neyens and baeyens 2003b the results in fig 5 and table s3 indicate that the median particle sizes d50 of sludge samples treated by different doses of oxone were all smaller than that of the rs the d50 decreased from 50 94 μm the rs to 50 08 μm the sludge samples treated by oxone at a dose of 0 6 mmol g vs with a δorp value of 461 mv the δorp value showed strong and negative correlations with particle sizes of d3 d6 d10 d16 d25 and d50 table s3 suggesting that the strong oxidation effects might result in a higher disintegration degree of sludge flocs meanwhile niu et al 2016 also found that sludge floc sizes decreased effectively with increasing oxone dose 3 2 3 correlation between δorp values and the properties of eps as shown in fig 6 a and b organic compounds were predominant in tb eps frølund et al 1995 when the δorp value increased from 118 to 461 mv with the increasing of oxone dose from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol g vs the concentrations of toc and protein increased in the layers of both s eps and lb eps however they showed a decreasing trend in tb eps this was because the breakup of insoluble cells and organic compounds may be diffused from the layer of tb eps to the layers of s eps and lb eps with increasing oxidation chen et al 2016 niu et al 2016 pearson s correlation results further indicated that δorp values showed strong and positive correlations with the toc contents in s eps and lb eps fig 4c and d which was supported by ye et al 2012 who also found that organic compounds in tb eps were dispersed into lb eps during sludge treatment with potassium ferrate table 2 shows the changes of 3d eem fluorescence intensities of different eps layers in the pre oxidized samples intensities of microbial byproduct like materials and humic acid like substances dominated in eps and the results were supported by the findings of other studies xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 compared with the rs when the oxone dose increased to 0 2 mmol g vs with the increased δorp value of 298 mv the intensities of tryptophan like proteins tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like materials and microbial byproduct like materials all increased in the layers of s eps and lb eps but decreased in the layer of tb eps the results suggested that with oxone treatment sludge flocs can be significantly disintegrated and tryptophan like proteins tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like materials and microbial byproduct like materials in the tb eps layer might be shifted to the lb eps and s eps layers meanwhile while continuously increasing the δorp value till 461 mv decreases of the above four types of organic compounds were observed in all the eps fractions possibly due to the mineralization effect as it might be more pronounced than the solubilization of organic compounds with the over dose of oxone min et al 2016 the findings of niu et al 2016 further supported this result that the fluorescence intensities of protein like components and humic like components increased initially and then decreased with increasing oxone dose moreover the trend of humic acid like substances was a bit different from the aforementioned four types of organic compounds humic acid like substances increased significantly in all fractions of eps at higher δorp values this might be related to the cell lysis induced by excessive oxidation fig 7 shows the results of the relative ldh releases when the δorp value was 387 mv higher values of the relative ldh release were observed and the relative rdh release ratio was 1 thus indicating the possible cell lysis niu et al 2016 the trend of the relative ldh release fig 7 was consistent with the concentrations of humic acid like substances in tb eps table 2 therefore possibly resulted in the indiscernible improvement of sludge dewaterability when the δorp value was 387 mv the improvement of sludge dewaterability caused by the released bound water might not compensate the deterioration in sludge dewaterability induced by excessive release of hydrophilic organic compounds during cell lysis at a higher δorp value therefore the optimal pre oxidation was proposed at a δorp value of near 387 mv at an oxone dose of 0 4 mmol g vs further studies indicated that δorp values showed strong negative correlations with contents of tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps fig 8 δorp value showed higher correlation coefficients with tryptophan like substances and microbial byproduct like materials than tyrosine like proteins the findings were consistent with niu et al 2016 who reported that tryptophan like substances and microbial byproduct like materials in s eps showed a positive correlation with oxone dose and transferred from tb eps to s eps with oxone added the increased oxidation degree indicated by increased δorp values might result in decreases of these hydrated biopolymers thus improving sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2014 as shown in figs s3 s5 the peaks of organic compounds in three fractions of eps could be divided into two mw ranges 104 da or 104 da the results of the integration of the peak area are shown in table 3 compared with the rs the integrated peak areas of organic compounds with mw 104 da decreased in tb eps and increased in lb eps figs s4 s5 these findings suggest that the increased organic compounds in lb eps were mainly biopolymers with mw 104 da and a shift of these low mw organic compounds mw 104 da could be observed from the tb eps layer to the lb eps layer with pre oxidation as the δorp value increased table 3 interestingly it should also be noted that the integrated peak areas of organic compounds with mw 104 da in lb eps and tb eps increased at higher δorp values i e 387 mv table 3 which suggests that a certain part of eps that was tightly bound to cells might have been shifted to the lb eps and tb eps fractions lee et al 2016 with a strong gel like and compact structure tb eps existed in the inner flocs through strong interactions it was reported to correlate with sludge dewaterability especially in an oxidation process wherein the powerful oxidizing radicals could strongly penetrate into cell walls resulting in breaking up the sludge floc and releasing bound water in tb eps into free water zhen et al 2012b the indiscernible enhancement of sludge dewaterability at higher δorp values might be related to the presence of organic compounds with mw 104 da in tb eps deduced from the results presented in tables 2 and 3 these compounds might be humic like substances and they contained functional groups i e nh2 nh and c o which showed high affinities towards water molecules through hydrogen bonds hudson et al 2007 aquino et al 2011 3 2 4 linear regression model of relationship between δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability as mentioned above δorp values showed positive correlations with srf toc in s eps and toc in lb eps zeta potential and contents of fe iii in sludge cake while it was negatively correlated with tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps and the particle sizes d3 d6 d10 d16 d25 and d50 a multiple linear regression model was developed to further illustrate the statistical relationship between δorp values and the above key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability as presented in eq 1 1 δorp 0 24 tb toc 74 34 fe ii 531 14 d50 0 62 d90 where tb toc is the content of toc in tb eps mg l fe ii is the content of fe ii in sludge filtrate mg l d50 and d90 denote 50 and 90 of the tested particles were the stated size μm respectively however the p values of evaluation parameters in eq 1 were 0 05 indicating the statistical insignificance at 95 confidence level hence the equation was modified by a step wise selection method without the intercept item with noint function as shown in eq 2 2 δorp 571 35 srf 0 88 tb toc 0 42 lb protein 18 16 d6 where lb protein denotes the content of protein in lb eps mg l d6 denotes 6 of the tested particles were the stated size μm as shown in eq 2 r2 of 98 56 indicates that the experimental data fits the predicted data well fig s6 moreover the evaluation parameters were significant since p 0 05 the model was feasible and followed a normal probability distribution as the residuals of the model were random and independently distributed fig s7 in eq 2 δorp value can be well predicted from sludge physicochemical properties a higher δorp value and the related higher dose of oxone could result in increased srf values less protein in lb eps less toc in tb eps and smaller sludge particle sizes in general δorp values showed strong correlations with sludge physicochemical properties hence rapid determination of the orp change in 0 5 min of a given pre oxidation process for sludge dewaterability would enable decision makers and engineers to properly estimate the oxidant dose for enhancement of sludge dewaterability 3 3 laboratory scale dewatering experiments to verify the above proposed general method using orp to correlate with the dewatering performance of the sludge conditioned by pre oxidation combined with coagulation dewatering experiments in laboratory scale were further conducted fig 9 presents the water content of the sludge cake treated by pre oxidation combined with coagulation compared with pre oxidation alone for the sludge samples conditioned with oxone alone δorp values 461 mv the changes of sludge dewaterability was indiscernible when conditioned by 0 81 mmol fe iii g vs the water content of the sludge cake significantly decreased from 90 32 wt rs to 72 51 wt and it further decreased to 66 08 wt when the δorp values were around 387 mv with the addition of oxone it indicates that a proper pre oxidation degree would be beneficial for sludge dewaterability in the combined pre oxidation and coagulation process however when the δorp value continuously increased from 387 to 461 mv the water content of the sludge cake increased from 66 08 to 70 35 wt indicating that excessive pre oxidation might disintegrate sludge flocs and these increased small size particles might bind the porous structure in filtering process thus causing difficulty in sludge dewatering dogan and sanin 2009 in general in the oxone pre oxidation treatment and fe iii coagulation conditioning system the optimal pre oxidation was found to be at the δorp value of 387 mv with 0 4 mmol oxone g vs it is consistent with the results of changes of eps properties at various pre oxidation extent table 2 similar trend of a suitable pre oxidation was also obtained in the sludge treated with various doses of h2o2 combined with fe iii coagulation conditioning system text s3 of supplementary material the optimal pre oxidation was found to be at the δorp value of 187 mv with 0 2 mmol h2o2 g vs fig s8 the difference in the optimal δorp values for these two oxidants can be related with the different oxidation capacities of oxone and h2o2 the proposed mechanism for the effect of pre oxidation on sludge dewatering is shown in fig 10 during pre oxidation a lower δorp value associated with an insufficient pre oxidation degree cannot effectively disintegrate the sludge flocs and convert bound water to free water a suitable δorp value can decrease the sludge particle sizes and the sludge particles agglomerate together to larger dense particles with less bond water after coagulation through electrostatic neutralization of fe iii a higher δorp value indicates an excessive pre oxidation which can result in cell lysis and release of intracellular organic matter such as humic acid like substances with mw 104 da in tb eps and the increasing amounts of small sizes of sludge particles can cause difficulty in subsequent filtration this study reported the feasibility of using δorp to correlate with parameters reflecting sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation other parameters such as ph and alkalinity have been also used as indicators of some operational processes under variations of chemical oxygen demand ammonium and hydraulic retention time li et al 2007 tanwar et al 2008 in this study the ph values of pre oxidized sludge samples were in range of 5 00 6 80 however if the oxidation process would cause extreme phs the feasibility of this orp tool would need to be further studied alkalinity is a good indication of the changes of ammonium and nitrate in nitrification denitrification process tanwar et al 2008 the feasibility of using alkalinity to reflect sludge dewaterability during the pre oxidation process remains less clear and the measurement of alkalinity was time consuming thus making real time assessment difficult li et al 2007 in the future work further comparison of orp and alkalinity as well as ph as indicators of the effects of pre oxidation on sludge dewaterability need to be conducted moreover a protocol based on the δorp tool will be developed for different types of oxidants besides oxone and h2o2 to further optimize the type and the dose of oxidants on sludge dewaterability 4 conclusions the results of this study indicated that the δorp values correlated well with the physicochemical parameters which were responsible for dewaterability of the pre oxidized sludge a multiple linear regression model has been established to indicate the relationship the results showed that oxone pre oxidation induced by the indigenous iron at an appropriate orp value could improve sludge dewaterability however at higher orp values e g over dose of oxone excessive pre oxidation was observed which might result in cell lysis and releases of humic acid like substances with mw 104 da in tb eps followed by increasing amounts of small sludge particles furthermore the results of the dewatering experiments in laboratory scale indicated an optimal pre oxidation with δorp values of 387 mv in an oxone pre oxidation combined with fe iii coagulation composite conditioning system this study demonstrated the feasibility of using δorp as a rapid evaluation tool for sludge dewaterability acknowledgments this study was funded by national key research and development program of china 2018yfd1100604 the national natural science

18930,pre oxidation is effective in enhancing sludge dewaterability different types and doses of oxidants are used to improve sludge dewaterability in pre oxidation rapid evaluation of the sludge dewaterability is vital for optimizing the type and dose of oxidants in pre oxidation it normally takes more time to evaluate sludge dewaterability by measuring typical indicators such as specific

challenge with regards to management of waste activated sludge due to its increased production dewatering is effective in sludge reduction and subsequent disposal shi et al 2015 pre oxidation was a crucial and determining step in enhancing sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2016 wherein it caused destruction solubilization or reduction of highly hydrated biopolymers thus bound water could be converted to free water yu et al 2016 degree of pre oxidation is critical for sludge dewatering insufficient oxidation cannot effectively convert bound water to free water while excessive oxidation

example typical tests of specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst are inappropriate to fully characterize the sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation as they are empirical tools for engineering practices herwijin 1996 some studies used contents of extracellular polymeric substance eps to indicate the dewaterability of pre oxidized sludge samples chen et al 2016 however eps extraction typically takes hours or days others used bound water content as an indicator of dewaterability jin et al 2015 however the experimental errors were common problems for its measurement raynaud et al 2012 furthermore the indiscernible relationship was reported between bound water content and sludge dewaterability vaxelaire and cézac 2004 therefore a better indicator is of needs to rapidly evaluate the effects of pre oxidation on sludge dewaterability oxidation reduction potential orp is a widely used parameter for on line monitoring of characteristics reflecting many chemical and biological oxidation processes khanal and huang 2003 yu et al 2013 monitored the orp values in electro fenton process and found that orp values correlated well with concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fe ii and fe iii khanal and huang 2003 regulated oxygen dose for sulfide oxidation using orp as a controlling parameter kishida et al 2003 detected the end points of anoxic and oxic phases based on orp value during the oxidation reactions murugesan et al 2014 observed a relative increased orp value in anaerobically digested sewage sludge samples with better dewaterability however the correlation between orp values and sludge dewaterability was not the focus in their studies this study was aimed at studying the correlation between orp values and sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation fig 1 shows the flowchart of this study briefly changes of orp values versus time and sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation were investigated relationships between the changes in orp values and sludge physicochemical properties such as eps contents particle sizes zeta potential cell lysis degree and fe ii fe iii contents were then evaluated by pearson s correlation test and a multiple linear regression model finally the dewaterability of the sludge conditioned by pre oxidation combined with fe iii coagulation process in laboratory scale was evaluated to explore the role of a suitable degree of pre oxidation as indicated by orp values in sludge dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics and chemicals the secondary sludge after thickening was used as raw sludge rs and it was collected from a local water reclamation plant wuhan china the primary characteristics of the rs are listed in table 1 before use it was kept at 4 c experiments

per minute rpm by a magnetic stirrer c mag hs 7 control ika germany the rs was used as the control after different treatments samples were collected for the measurements of cst srf particle size zeta potential eps extraction and fe iii fe ii content each experiment was conducted in triplicates 2 3 laboratory scale dewatering experiments different doses of oxone 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 mmol g vs were added to the rs at 150 rpm for 20 min followed by a coagulation process with 0 81 mmol fe iii g vs at 100 rpm for 15 min and the entire conditioning time was 35 min yu et al 2016 the set up of the laboratory scale diaphragm filter press system is shown in fig s1 following the dewatering procedures in yu et al 2016 the water content of the dewatered cake was measured by drying at 105 c in an oven until the weight became constant 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 orp measurement orp was measured by an orp electrode mtc301 hach instrument co ltd usa the probe is a digital electrode with a refillable ag agcl reference and a built in temperature sensor orp redox standard solution samples apure kuosi electronic co ltd shanghai china were used to calibrate the orp probe a stirring speed of 350 rpm was selected for the orp measurements fig s2 in this study δorp was referred to the difference between the orp values at 0 5 min and at 0 min δorp orpt 0 5 min orpt 0 min 2 4 2 sludge characteristics the standard methods were used to determine total solids ts and vs of sludge samples apha 2005 zeta potential and particle size were measured with a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 particle analyzer and a malvern 2000 mastersizer malvern instruments ltd uk respectively following methods described in xiong et al 2018 the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii in the sludge samples were determined and the detailed procedures are shown in the text s1 of supplementary material 2 4 3 sludge dewaterability the cst was measured with a 304 m instrument triton uk srf was determined according to detailed procedures described in liu et al 2012 2 4 4 extraction and determination of eps different fractions of eps in sludge were extracted using a thermal method li and yang 2007 with

quantified by a lowry protein assay kit thermofisher uk le et al 2016 an fp 650 fluorescence spectrophotometer was employed to obtain three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra jasco hitachi japan fluorescence regional integration technique was further used to analyze the eem data as follows tyrosine like proteins region i tryptophan like protein region ii fulvic acid like

supplementary material 2 4 5 the lactate dehydrogenase ldh test as a cytoplasmic enzyme ldh is stable in all intact cells it can be released when damage of the plasma membrane occurs zheng et al 2011 presence of dead or plasma membrane damaged cells would enhance ldh enzyme activity gu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 the ldh enzyme activity was tested with a cytotoxicity detection kit c0016 beyotime applied science co shanghai china according to the manufacture s instruction the relative ldh release defined as the measured ldh intensity of the pre oxidized sludge sample divided by the ldh intensity of the rs was an indicator of the cell permeability of the pre oxidized sludge samples he et al 2017 2 4 6 statistical analysis to examine the linear correlations between δorp and the key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability the pearson s correlation coefficient r was calculated by spss 19 0 software a multiple linear regression model equation was further developed between δorp values and the main factors affecting sludge dewaterability using sas 8 0 software the regression coefficient the difference between the experimental and predicted values and p values of all estimated coefficients were calculated to test the reliability of the established model and the detailed procedure can be found in xiao et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 the profiles of orp values during pre oxidation changes of orp values versus time in the sludge samples pretreated by different doses of oxone are shown in fig 2 a the orp value of the rs was around 208 mv indicating a reductive environment in the waste activated sludge wu et al 2014 after addition of oxone the orp values increased rapidly and the highest orp value was achieved at only about 0 5 min indicating a strong oxidizing environment thereafter the orp values decreased gradually and stayed relatively constant till the end this may be because the orp values can be influenced by the concentrations of oxidants and reductants in pre oxidation tang et al 2012 δorp values are shown in fig 2b it is also noted that a higher oxone dose would result in a higher δorp value of the pre oxidized sludge samples δorp value increased from 22 mv for the rs to 118 mv with an oxone dose of 0 1 mmol g vs and further to 461 mv with an oxone dose of 0 6 mmol g vs to further evaluate pre oxidation for enhancing sludge dewaterability the following studies focused on exploring the relationship between the δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability 3 2 correlation between δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability 3 2 1 correlation between δorp values and cst srf for the rs with a δorp value of 22 mv the values of cst and srf were 386 2 s and 1 89 1013 m kg respectively table 1 after adding different doses of oxone changes of cst and srf of the pre oxidized sludge samples at different δorp values are shown in fig 3 when the value of δorp increased up to 118 mv with an oxone dose of 0 1 mmol g vs cst and srf decreased to 289 6 s and 1 48 1013 m kg respectively fig 3 these results indicated an improved sludge dewaterability when compared with the rs possibly owing to the oxone oxidation activated by the indigenous iron in the rs the degradation of the hydrophilic eps and the shift of bound water to free water zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2016 when the oxone dose increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol g vs with the corresponding δorp increased from 118 to 461 mv the cst and srf values increased continuously which indicates the deterioration of sludge dewaterability at higher δorp values it was found that δorp showed a strong and positive correlation with srf r 0 89 p 0 05 fig 3 indicating the feasibility of using the δorp value to evaluate srf of the pre oxidized sludge samples however the δorp value failed to evaluate cst values as indicated by the indiscernible correlation p 0 05 fig 3 the inconsistency of using δorp to evaluate the cst and srf values can be explained with the different measuring principles of these two indexes the cst measures the time of free water flowing between two electrodes in a filter paper wong et al 2015 when the oxidation disintegrated sludge flocs and microbial cells the released water might be absorbed into the polymeric compounds which could affect the results of cst measurement lee et al 2016 chen et al 1996 also pointed out that the direct use of cst failed to characterize the dewaterability of sludge containing much bound water in comparison srf measures the hydraulic resistance of water from cake solids when it moves in the porous filter cake which is independent of the dewatering method used neyens and baeyens 2003a wong et al 2015 3 2 2 correlation between δorp values and zeta potential particle size the zeta potential of the rs δorp 22 mv was 14 0 1 1 mv table 1 owing to ionization of functional groups e g cooh and nh2 in the protein liu et al 2016 changes of zeta potential of the pre oxidized sludge samples are shown in fig 4 when the δorp value of the pre oxidized sludge increased from 118 to 461 mv the zeta potential increased slightly this might be related with the oxidation reaction between oxone and indigenous iron contained in the sludge zhou et al 2015 when the δorp value increased from 118 to 461 mv the concentrations of fe iii in the sludge filtrate and sludge cake both increased table s2 yu et al 2013 also reported that orp profiles showed high correlations with the trends of fe iii during electro fenton process the increase of fe iii might contribute to the increase of zeta potential as the positive charge of fe iii could decrease electrostatic repulsive interaction through electrostatic neutralization he et al 2015 a strong and positive relationship r 0 86 p 0 05 was found between the δorp value and the zeta potential fig 4 it was similar to the results of he et al 2015 who also found that higher orp values of sludge samples could result in less negative zeta potential values the dewaterability is also affected by sludge particle size neyens and baeyens 2003b the results in fig 5 and table s3 indicate that the median particle sizes d50 of sludge samples treated by different doses of oxone were all smaller than that of the rs the d50 decreased from 50 94 μm the rs to 50 08 μm the sludge samples treated by oxone at a dose of 0 6 mmol g vs with a δorp value of 461 mv the δorp value showed strong and negative correlations with particle sizes of d3 d6 d10 d16 d25 and d50 table s3 suggesting that the strong oxidation effects might result in a higher disintegration degree of sludge flocs meanwhile niu et al 2016 also found that sludge floc sizes decreased effectively with increasing oxone dose 3 2 3 correlation between δorp values and the properties of eps as shown in fig 6 a and b organic compounds were predominant in tb eps frølund et al 1995 when the δorp value increased from 118 to 461 mv with the increasing of oxone dose from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol g vs the concentrations of toc and protein increased in the layers of both s eps and lb eps however they showed a decreasing trend in tb eps this was because the breakup of insoluble cells and organic compounds may be diffused from the layer of tb eps to the layers of s eps and lb eps with increasing oxidation chen et al 2016 niu et al 2016 pearson s correlation results further indicated that δorp values showed strong and positive correlations with the toc contents in s eps and lb eps fig 4c and d which was supported by ye et al 2012 who also found that organic compounds in tb eps were dispersed into lb eps during sludge treatment with potassium ferrate table 2 shows the changes of 3d eem fluorescence intensities of different eps layers in the pre oxidized samples intensities of microbial byproduct like materials and humic acid like substances dominated in eps and the results were supported by the findings of other studies xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 compared with the rs when the oxone dose increased to 0 2 mmol g vs with the increased δorp value of 298 mv the intensities of tryptophan like proteins tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like materials and microbial byproduct like materials all increased in the layers of s eps and lb eps but decreased in the layer of tb eps the results suggested that with oxone treatment sludge flocs can be significantly disintegrated and tryptophan like proteins tyrosine like proteins fulvic acid like materials and microbial byproduct like materials in the tb eps layer might be shifted to the lb eps and s eps layers meanwhile while continuously increasing the δorp value till 461 mv decreases of the above four types of organic compounds were observed in all the eps fractions possibly due to the mineralization effect as it might be more pronounced than the solubilization of organic compounds with the over dose of oxone min et al 2016 the findings of niu et al 2016 further supported this result that the fluorescence intensities of protein like components and humic like components increased initially and then decreased with increasing oxone dose moreover the trend of humic acid like substances was a bit different from the aforementioned four types of organic compounds humic acid like substances increased significantly in all fractions of eps at higher δorp values this might be related to the cell lysis induced by excessive oxidation fig 7 shows the results of the relative ldh releases when the δorp value was 387 mv higher values of the relative ldh release were observed and the relative rdh release ratio was 1 thus indicating the possible cell lysis niu et al 2016 the trend of the relative ldh release fig 7 was consistent with the concentrations of humic acid like substances in tb eps table 2 therefore possibly resulted in the indiscernible improvement of sludge dewaterability when the δorp value was 387 mv the improvement of sludge dewaterability caused by the released bound water might not compensate the deterioration in sludge dewaterability induced by excessive release of hydrophilic organic compounds during cell lysis at a higher δorp value therefore the optimal pre oxidation was proposed at a δorp value of near 387 mv at an oxone dose of 0 4 mmol g vs further studies indicated that δorp values showed strong negative correlations with contents of tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps fig 8 δorp value showed higher correlation coefficients with tryptophan like substances and microbial byproduct like materials than tyrosine like proteins the findings were consistent with niu et al 2016 who reported that tryptophan like substances and microbial byproduct like materials in s eps showed a positive correlation with oxone dose and transferred from tb eps to s eps with oxone added the increased oxidation degree indicated by increased δorp values might result in decreases of these hydrated biopolymers thus improving sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2014 as shown in figs s3 s5 the peaks of organic compounds in three fractions of eps could be divided into two mw ranges 104 da or 104 da the results of the integration of the peak area are shown in table 3 compared with the rs the integrated peak areas of organic compounds with mw 104 da decreased in tb eps and increased in lb eps figs s4 s5 these findings suggest that the increased organic compounds in lb eps were mainly biopolymers with mw 104 da and a shift of these low mw organic compounds mw 104 da could be observed from the tb eps layer to the lb eps layer with pre oxidation as the δorp value increased table 3 interestingly it should also be noted that the integrated peak areas of organic compounds with mw 104 da in lb eps and tb eps increased at higher δorp values i e 387 mv table 3 which suggests that a certain part of eps that was tightly bound to cells might have been shifted to the lb eps and tb eps fractions lee et al 2016 with a strong gel like and compact structure tb eps existed in the inner flocs through strong interactions it was reported to correlate with sludge dewaterability especially in an oxidation process wherein the powerful oxidizing radicals could strongly penetrate into cell walls resulting in breaking up the sludge floc and releasing bound water in tb eps into free water zhen et al 2012b the indiscernible enhancement of sludge dewaterability at higher δorp values might be related to the presence of organic compounds with mw 104 da in tb eps deduced from the results presented in tables 2 and 3 these compounds might be humic like substances and they contained functional groups i e nh2 nh and c o which showed high affinities towards water molecules through hydrogen bonds hudson et al 2007 aquino et al 2011 3 2 4 linear regression model of relationship between δorp values and key factors affecting sludge dewaterability as mentioned above δorp values showed positive correlations with srf toc in s eps and toc in lb eps zeta potential and contents of fe iii in sludge cake while it was negatively correlated with tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps and the particle sizes d3 d6 d10 d16 d25 and d50 a multiple linear regression model was developed to further illustrate the statistical relationship between δorp values and the above key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability as presented in eq 1 1 δorp 0 24 tb toc 74 34 fe ii 531 14 d50 0 62 d90 where tb toc is the content of toc in tb eps mg l fe ii is the content of fe ii in sludge filtrate mg l d50 and d90 denote 50 and 90 of the tested particles were the stated size μm respectively however the p values of evaluation parameters in eq 1 were 0 05 indicating the statistical insignificance at 95 confidence level hence the equation was modified by a step wise selection method without the intercept item with noint function as shown in eq 2 2 δorp 571 35 srf 0 88 tb toc 0 42 lb protein 18 16 d6 where lb protein denotes the content of protein in lb eps mg l d6 denotes 6 of the tested particles were the stated size μm as shown in eq 2 r2 of 98 56 indicates that the experimental data fits the predicted data well fig s6 moreover the evaluation parameters were significant since p 0 05 the model was feasible and followed a normal probability distribution as the residuals of the model were random and independently distributed fig s7 in eq 2 δorp value can be well predicted from sludge physicochemical properties a higher δorp value and the related higher dose of oxone could result in increased srf values less protein in lb eps less toc in tb eps and smaller sludge particle sizes in general δorp values showed strong correlations with sludge physicochemical properties hence rapid determination of the orp change in 0 5 min of a given pre oxidation process for sludge dewaterability would enable decision makers and engineers to properly estimate the oxidant dose for enhancement of sludge dewaterability 3 3 laboratory scale dewatering experiments to verify the above proposed general method using orp to correlate with the dewatering performance of the sludge conditioned by pre oxidation combined with coagulation dewatering experiments in laboratory scale were further conducted fig 9 presents the water content of the sludge cake treated by pre oxidation combined with coagulation compared with pre oxidation alone for the sludge samples conditioned with oxone alone δorp values 461 mv the changes of sludge dewaterability was indiscernible when conditioned by 0 81 mmol fe iii g vs the water content of the sludge cake significantly decreased from 90 32 wt rs to 72 51 wt and it further decreased to 66 08 wt when the δorp values were around 387 mv with the addition of oxone it indicates that a proper pre oxidation degree would be beneficial for sludge dewaterability in the combined pre oxidation and coagulation process however when the δorp value continuously increased from 387 to 461 mv the water content of the sludge cake increased from 66 08 to 70 35 wt indicating that excessive pre oxidation might disintegrate sludge flocs and these increased small size particles might bind the porous structure in filtering process thus causing difficulty in sludge dewatering dogan and sanin 2009 in general in the oxone pre oxidation treatment and fe iii coagulation conditioning system the optimal pre oxidation was found to be at the δorp value of 387 mv with 0 4 mmol oxone g vs it is consistent with the results of changes of eps properties at various pre oxidation extent table 2 similar trend of a suitable pre oxidation was also obtained in the sludge treated with various doses of h2o2 combined with fe iii coagulation conditioning system text s3 of supplementary material the optimal pre oxidation was found to be at the δorp value of 187 mv with 0 2 mmol h2o2 g vs fig s8 the difference in the optimal δorp values for these two oxidants can be related with the different oxidation capacities of oxone and h2o2 the proposed mechanism for the effect of pre oxidation on sludge dewatering is shown in fig 10 during pre oxidation a lower δorp value associated with an insufficient pre oxidation degree cannot effectively disintegrate the sludge flocs and convert bound water to free water a suitable δorp value can decrease the sludge particle sizes and the sludge particles agglomerate together to larger dense particles with less bond water after coagulation through electrostatic neutralization of fe iii a higher δorp value indicates an excessive pre oxidation which can result in cell lysis and release of intracellular organic matter such as humic acid like substances with mw 104 da in tb eps and the increasing amounts of small sizes of sludge particles can cause difficulty in subsequent filtration this study reported the feasibility of using δorp to correlate with parameters reflecting sludge dewaterability during pre oxidation other parameters such as ph and alkalinity have been also used as indicators of some operational processes under variations of chemical oxygen demand ammonium and hydraulic retention time li et al 2007 tanwar et al 2008 in this study the ph values of pre oxidized sludge samples were in range of 5 00 6 80 however if the oxidation process would cause extreme phs the feasibility of this orp tool would need to be further studied alkalinity is a good indication of the changes of ammonium and nitrate in nitrification denitrification process tanwar et al 2008 the feasibility of using alkalinity to reflect sludge dewaterability during the pre oxidation process remains less clear and the measurement of alkalinity was time consuming thus making real time assessment difficult li et al 2007 in the future work further comparison of orp and alkalinity as well as ph as indicators of the effects of pre oxidation on sludge dewaterability need to be conducted moreover a protocol based on the δorp tool will be developed for different types of oxidants besides oxone and h2o2 to further optimize the type and the dose of oxidants on sludge dewaterability 4 conclusions the results of this study indicated that the δorp values correlated well with the physicochemical parameters which were responsible for dewaterability of the pre oxidized sludge a multiple linear regression model has been established to indicate the relationship the results showed that oxone pre oxidation induced by the indigenous iron at an appropriate orp value could improve sludge dewaterability however at higher orp values e g over dose of oxone excessive pre oxidation was observed which might result in cell lysis and releases of humic acid like substances with mw 104 da in tb eps followed by increasing amounts of small sludge particles furthermore the results of the dewatering experiments in laboratory scale indicated an optimal pre oxidation with δorp values of 387 mv in an oxone pre oxidation combined with fe iii coagulation composite conditioning system this study demonstrated the feasibility of using δorp as a rapid evaluation tool for sludge dewaterability acknowledgments this study was funded by national key research and development program of china 2018yfd1100604 the national natural science

18931,evaluating the activity of extracellular and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities is essential to improve our fundamental understanding of micropollutant removal during wastewater treatment to study biotransformations with respect to enzyme biogeography we developed a method to separate soluble extracellular extracellular polymeric substance eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and assessed the protease and peptidase activity of the resulting enzyme pools we also evaluated the biotransformation of six antibiotics amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin daptomycin linezolid and vancomycin in each enzyme pool because we expect that the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance within wastewater microbial communities and in downstream environments our results demonstrated that biotransformation rate constants varied among the tested antibiotics and that the observed rank order was consistent across three wastewater treatment plants importantly many of the observed biotransformations eliminated the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity furthermore we found that β lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis were catalyzed by enzymes extracted from the eps while none of the tested antibiotics were biotransformed by soluble extracellular enzymes finally our results demonstrated that the number of enzyme catalyzed antibiotic transformations was larger for intracellular than for extracellular enzymes together this study provides novel insights on the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities and can be used to inform pathway prediction or the development of biodegradable chemicals graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment micropollutant biotransformation enzymatic activity antibiotics enzyme extraction 1 introduction current wastewater treatment processes often fail at completely removing anthropogenic organic chemicals that occur at trace concentrations falås et al 2016 joss et al 2005 r loos et al 2013 as a result these chemicals referred to as micropollutants are discharged into the environment where some of them negatively affect ecosystem and human health boxall 2004 schwarzenbach et al 2006 several previous studies have demonstrated that wastewater microbial communities can biotransform some types of micropollutants for example the biotransformation pathways of a set of amide and amine containing micropollutants has been previously reported gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010a other studies in which biotransformation analyses were combined with the characterization of the microbial community i e metagenomics and metatranscriptomics provided valuable insights into how microbial community structure and gene expression patterns determine the biotransformation of certain micropollutants helbling et al 2011 johnson et al 2015 men et al 2017 wolff et al 2018 others have explored the activity of enzymes extracted from wastewater microbial communities as a means to link observed biotransformations to specific enzymes krah et al 2016 these studies have improved our fundamental understanding of micropollutant biotransformations and have enabled more robust predictions of how micropollutants may be biotransformed during wastewater treatment wicker et al 2016 despite the insights provided by these and other studies our understanding of the metabolic potential of wastewater microbial communities is still limited for example studies on the kinetics and pathways of micropollutant biotransformations have been limited to a rather small set of chemicals furthermore the role of extracellular enzymes in the biotransformation of micropollutants during biological wastewater treatment remains completely unknown this is of relevance because cellular uptake of large and ionized micropollutants may be limited gulde et al 2014 and extracellular biotransformations may thus contribute significantly to the fate of these micropollutants during wastewater treatment additionally we anticipate that extracellular metabolism is less complex and more conserved across different wastewater treatment plants wwtps than intracellular metabolism therefore consideration for the biogeography i e extracellular or intracellular of micropollutant biotransformations might also improve our ability to predict micropollutant biotransformations during wastewater treatment previous studies on the biogeography of enzyme catalyzed reactions performed by wastewater microbial communities solely focused on the turnover of biomacromolecules such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids frølund et al 1995 y li and chrost 2006 for example a previous study reported that the majority of active extracellular hydrolases are bound to the extracellular polymeric substance eps of wastewater biofilms frølund et al 1995 while such studies have offered initial insights into the extracellular metabolic activity of wastewater microbial communities the contribution of extracellular enzymes e g hydrolases to the transformation of micropollutants remains unexplored one class of micropollutants of concern are antibiotics klein et al 2018 pepper et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 their incomplete removal during biological wastewater treatment is one cause for the selection of antibiotic resistant microorganisms in both wwtps and downstream environments baquero et al 2008 czekalski et al 2012 lapara et al 2011 michael et al 2013 uyaguari et al 2011 watkinson et al 2009 the occurrence of antibiotics in natural and engineered systems has furthermore been shown to affect the functioning of these systems by influencing microbial community structure klaus kümmerer 2009 y zhang et al 2013 therefore the biotransformation of antibiotics during wastewater treatment is essential to limit the proliferation of antibiotic resistance andrä et al 2018 we anticipate that the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance specifically we expect that the selection pressure will be lowest for antibiotics for which the functional group that imparts the antibiotic activity is rapidly biotransformed by extracellular enzymes the importance of the biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations is supported by the recent finding that antibiotic sensitive microorganisms were protected from an antibiotic when they grew in proximity to microorganisms that degraded the respective antibiotic extracellularly frost et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to i develop a method to extract soluble eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and ii assess the kinetics and pathways of antibiotic biotransformations in the resulting enzyme pools we selected six amide containing antibiotics amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin daptomycin linezolid and vancomycin and anticipated amide hydrolysis a slow process at environmental conditions when not catalyzed tebes stevens et al 2017 by extracellular proteases and peptidases to be a likely biotransformation in parallel to antibiotic biotransformations we measured protease and peptidase activities in each of the extracted enzyme pools with high throughput assays based on fluorogenic probes we compared the results of the activity assays and the antibiotic biotransformation experiments to determine whether protease and peptidase activity were useful surrogates for predicting micropollutant biotransformation rates together our study provides novel insights on the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 antibiotics and additional chemicals information on general chemicals and

concentration and protease peptidase activity measurements all of the experiments described in this section were performed directly after enzyme extraction i e 5 h after sample collection at the treatment plants we determined protein concentrations of enzyme extracts with the pierce bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit thermo fisher 23225 according to the manufacturer s instructions in brief we added 150 μl of enzyme extract or protein standard bovine serum albumin final concentration range 1 200 mg l and 150 μl of freshly prepared working reagent to a well of a transparent 96 well microplate millipore sigma cls3997 we used a plate reader tecan infinite m200 pro to measure the absorbance at 562 nm of the resulting solutions for protease activity measurements we used the enzcheck protease assay kit thermo fisher e6638 which is based on fluorogenic casein substrate and buffer solutions were prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions we then added 100 μl of enzyme extract and 100 μl of freshly prepared working solution to a well of a black 96 well microplate millipore sigma cls3991 proteolytic reactions resulted in the production of fluorescently labeled peptides which we detected by periodic fluorescence measurements in the plate reader excitation at 485 nm emission detected at 530 nm measurement interval 3 min because there is no standard for the fluorescently labeled peptides we normalized the measured fluorescence intensities based on a substrate incubation in milli q water which was run on the same plate to correct for non enzymatic hydrolysis we subtracted hydrolysis rates in milli q water from hydrolysis rates in enzyme pools for peptidase activity measurements we used the fluorogenic probe l lysine 7 amido 4 methylcoumarin l

series in milli q water final concentration range l amc 0 05 40 μm amc 0 01 10 μm then we mixed 100 μl of enzyme extract and 100 μl of the l amc or amc solutions in a well of a black 96 well

were 2 5 v v 2 4 antibiotic biotransformation experiments biotransformation experiments were started immediately after enzyme extraction i e 3 h after sample collection at the wwtps we spiked an aqueous solution containing all tested antibiotics to triplicate bioreactors containing the four enzyme pools twelve total bioreactors per wwtp to a resulting target concentration for all antibiotics of 100 μg l we note that this solution additionally contained 100 μg l of atenolol as a positive control and 100 μg l bacitracin which is not discussed in the study due to analytical problems to control for non enzymatic removal processes such as the adsorption of antibiotics to sludge we performed triplicate incubations with enzyme pools that had been autoclaved twice 4 h apart at 120 c and 1 3 bar for 20 min twelve total control reactors per wwtp amsco lg 250 autoclave steris gulde et al 2014 incubations were run in loosely capped 100 ml glass bottles at room temperature and horizontal shaking at 180 rpm innova 2000 new brunswick scientific samples of 1 ml were collected at 5 min 2 h 6 h 18 h and 42 h after spiking the antibiotics and were immediately transferred onto ice we note that we deliberately chose not to subject samples to heat or acid treatment in order to prevent non enzymatic transformations after a centrifugation 15 800 g 2 min eppendorf 5424r the supernatants were transferred into 2 ml amber glass vials and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 5 sample analysis of antibiotic biotransformation experiment to quantify antibiotic concentrations and to identify transformation products we used reversed phase liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo scientific coupled to high resolution quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry qexactive thermo scientific as previously described helbling et al 2010b pochodylo and helbling 2016 briefly we injected 20 μl of the samples that were stored in the temperature controlled 4 c compartments of the autosampler during the analysis for sample separation we ran a gradient of lc ms grade water omnisolv 58201 solvent a and methanol omnisolv 58215 solvent b both containing 0 1 v v formic acid over an xbridge c18 column

acquisitions scan range 120 1200 m z resolution 70 000 in electrospray ionization positive negative switch mode for absolute quantification of target analytes we analyzed matrix matched calibrations concentration range 2 100 μg l and calculated concentrations based on peak areas obtained with xcalibur quanbrowser thermo scientific version 3 1 assuming first order kinetics for all antibiotics biotransformations helbling et al 2010a we derived rate constants of enzymatic antibiotic transformations k enz based on the following equation 1 c t 2 c t 1 e k e n z k a b i o t t 2 t 1 where c t 1 and c t 2 are the concentrations of the antibiotic k abiot is the rate constant derived from the autoclaved control experiment and t 1 and t 2 represent subsequent time points during the incubation we derived k abiot and k enz k abiot by a linear regression fit of the logarithm of the antibiotic concentration versus time from autoclaved k enz 0 and biological incubation experiments respectively 2 6 transformation product analysis we used the eawag pathway prediction system eawag pps http eawag bbd ethz ch predict gao et al 2009 to predict biotransformation products for the studied antibiotics we allowed prediction of three consecutive reactions except for daptomycin and vancomycin for which we allowed only two consecutive reactions to limit combinatorial explosion and included all biotransformation likelihoods then we converted the resulting list of smiles strings into a list of molecular formulas and used envimass version 4 1 m loos 2018 to screen the acquired hrms data for the exact masses of the predicted transformation products kern et al 2009 all ms features i e picked peaks with an accurate mass within 5 ppm of the predicted exact mass of a transformation product for which the intensity was greater than 1e5 and greater than 10 fold the intensity in the blank sample i e milli q water were considered ms features of interest subsequently we used xcalibur qualbrowser thermo scientific version 3 1 to manually verify that the features showed distinct chromatographic peaks and that the measured isotope patterns matched the patterns predicted for the respective molecular formula for all features that fulfilled these criteria we created a processing method in xcalibur quanbrowser and plotted progress curves of peak areas features for which peak areas changed over time were considered transformation product candidates for these candidates we acquired data dependent ms ms scans resolution 17 500 and compared the results of these scans with the results of an in silico fragmentation performed with mass frontier version 7 0 all proposed transformation product structures are assigned a confidence level as has become convention in the field of non target analysis schymanski et al 2014 we note that we expanded the definition of confidence level 3 to include structures that are likely because of the experimental context i e anticipated transformation product structures resulting from spiked compounds with known structures even though diagnostic ms ms data was not available additionally we introduced confidence level 3 for transformation product structures for which no alternative structure is likely 3 results and discussion 3 1 development and optimization of enzyme extraction method to investigate biotransformations mediated by wastewater enzymes with respect to biogeography we first developed and optimized a method to separate wastewater enzymes into different pools our goal was to separate soluble extracellular enzymes and eps bound enzymes from intracellular enzymes to meet this goal we combined components of previously established extraction methods for wastewater biofilms frølund et al 1995 gessesse et al 2003 jorand et al 1995 krah et al 2016 and evaluated the extraction protocols with respect to protein concentration protease activity and atp concentration an indicator of cell lysis yu et al 2017 based on the data provided in table s3 and fig s2 we considered the extraction method depicted in scheme 1 to be the most suitable for this study 3 2 protein concentration protease activity and peptidase activity to generally characterize the enzyme pools resulting from this extraction we measured protein concentration protease activity on casein and peptidase activity on l lysine 7 amido 4 methylcoumarin l amc using fluorescence or absorbance based high throughput assays for all wwtps our measurements were reproducible and showed that protein concentration protease activity and peptidase activity all decreased in the order pool ii pool iii pool iv fig 1 our results therefore demonstrated that each enzyme pool can catalyze hydrolytic reactions to some extent with respect to extracellular enzymes our results are consistent with previous studies on wastewater microbial enzymes that reported a higher hydrolytic activity in extracts containing eps bound enzymes as compared to extracts containing soluble extracellular enzymes only frølund et al 1995 y li and chrost 2006 nevertheless it remains unknown whether these extracellular hydrolases contribute to the biotransformation of micropollutants 3 3 kinetics of antibiotic biotransformations to assess the kinetics of the biotransformation of the six antibiotics in each of the enzyme pools we estimated biotransformation rate constants using equation 1 for enzyme pool i our data demonstrated that the rate of biotransformation varied among the tested antibiotics fig 2 amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin were completely biotransformed within 20 h of incubation with the intact wastewater microbial communities pool i from all three wwtps while fast biotransformation of amoxicillin and ampicillin is in agreement with previously reported removal efficiencies during biological wastewater treatment li and zhang 2011 watkinson et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge the biotransformation of daptomycin by wastewater microbial communities has not been studied before the remaining antibiotics i e clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin were biotransformed at relatively lower rates this finding is in agreement with previous studies reporting only partial removal of these antibiotics during biological wastewater treatment kulkarni et al 2017 li and zhang 2011 ooi et al 2017 we note that the concentration of vancomycin readily decreased during its incubation in autoclaved enzyme pool i presumably due to sorption fig s5 s7 which hindered the biotransformation analysis of this compound for enzyme pool ii i e the extract containing intracellular and extracellular enzymes we observed the transformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin by pool ii enzymes from all treatment plants fig 2 interestingly the biotransformations of amoxicillin and ampicillin were faster in pool ii than in pool i i e the intact microbial community we explain this observation by a better accessibility of these antibiotics to the extracted enzymes e g when cellular uptake is the rate limiting step during a biotransformation on the contrary the biotransformation of daptomycin was slower in enzyme pool ii than in pool i this observation suggests that the biotransformation of daptomycin is partially mediated by enzymes that depend on intact cells or by enzymes whose function was disturbed by the extraction agents e g surfactant or cation exchange resins these reasons might also explain why the remaining antibiotics i e clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin which were all transformed by enzymes in pool i were not transformed by enzymes in pool ii with respect to extracellular enzymes we found that amoxicillin and ampicillin were transformed by eps bound extracellular enzymes i e pool iii from all wwtps while daptomycin was transformed by pool iii enzymes from wwtp 2 the remaining antibiotics were not biotransformed by enzymes in pool iii the observation that the biotransformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin was faster in pool ii than in pool iii indicated that the enzymes that catalyze these biotransformations occur extra and intracellularly finally our experiments with enzyme pool iv demonstrated that none of the antibiotics were significantly transformed by soluble enzymes pool iv derived from any of the wwtps the differences in enzymatic biotransformation rate constants across the tested antibiotics highlight the importance of assessing the biodegradability of antibiotics by wastewater microbial communities when selecting antibiotics for use in medicine andrä et al 2018 we expect that the selection pressure for antibiotic resistance genes in wwtps and downstream environments will be lower for the antibiotics that were readily biotransformed i e ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin than for the antibiotics that were biotransformed more slowly furthermore we expect that the contribution of extracellular enzymes to the biotransformation of ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin further reduces the pressure for resistance selection against these antibiotics comparing trends in biotransformation rate constants in enzyme pool i across wwtps we found that the rank order of the antibiotics remained the same across the three wwtps fig 2 suggesting that the transformation preference of the wastewater microbial communities with respect to the tested antibiotics is similar across different municipal wwtps however we also observed that the magnitude of the rate constants of some biotransformations after normalization for biological activity i e atp concentration table s2 significantly differed across wwtps for example clindamycin biotransformation in enzyme pool i was faster for wwtp 2 than for wwtp 1 and wwtp 3 t test p values 0 001 additionally we observed that daptomycin biotransformation in pool ii and amoxicillin and ampicillin biotransformation in pool iii was faster for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 than for wwtp 3 p values 0 02 these differences are noteworthy because they might help identifying the enzymes and microorganisms involved in these biotransformations information that is critical for the engineering of wastewater microbial communities to more readily biotransform the respective antibiotics to assess whether rapid enzyme activity assays might be useful to predict antibiotic biotransformation rates during wastewater treatment we compared trends in antibiotic biotransformation rate constants across treatment plants with the results of the protease and peptidase assays fig 1 interestingly we did not find any matching trends the trend observed for the biotransformation of amoxicillin and ampicillin by enzymes in pool iii i e wwtp 1 wwtp 2 wwtp 3 fig 2 even correlated negatively with the trend measured for protease activity in the same extracts i e wwtp 3 wwtp 2 wwtp 1 fig 1b these findings suggest that the enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of antibiotics were different from the enzymes assessed with the peptidase and protease assays 3 4 pathways of antibiotic biotransformations to obtain mechanistic insights into the biotransformations catalyzed by intracellular and extracellular enzymes we examined the transformation products formed during the incubations of antibiotics with enzyme pools i and iii these enzyme pools were selected as they demonstrated the highest enzyme activities among intracellular pool i and extracellular pool iii enzyme pools we used the eawag pathway prediction system to predict the structures of plausible transformation products and envimass to screen the acquired hrms data for predicted transformation products gao et al 2009 m loos 2018 molecular formulas retention times theoretical and measured masses biotransformation rules and levels of identification confidence for the resulting transformation products are shown in table 1 in enzyme pool i we discovered transformation products for all tested antibiotics except for vancomycin table 1 figs s9 s11 we assume that the sorption of vancomycin to components of the wastewater matrix as well as its poor ionization efficiency explain why we did not detect any transformation products for this antibiotic more importantly however the transformation products detected for the remaining five antibiotics revealed a diverse set of enzyme catalyzed reactions including amide hydrolysis aldehyde oxidation oxidative removal of an organic substituent from an amine and sulfide oxidation in the following paragraphs we briefly describe the detected biotransformations for each antibiotic and discuss the detected transformation products with respect to antibiotic activity for amoxicillin and ampicillin we identified β lactam hydrolysis as a biotransformation pathway fig 3 s12 and s13 this finding is consistent with studies in which β lactam hydrolysis products of amoxicillin were detected in the effluent of wwtps lamm et al 2009 pérez parada et al 2011 and with studies in which the transcription of β lactamase genes by wastewater microorganisms has been detected ju et al 2018 for both amoxicillin and ampicillin we identified the penicilloic acid form amo tp 384 1 and amp tp 368 1 the diketopiperazine form amo tp 366 and amp tp 350 as well as amo tp 384 2 and amp tp 368 2 which had the same accurate masses as amo tp 384 1 and amp tp 368 1 respectively but different retention times we note that these isobaric transformation product pairs were not clearly distinguishable based on the collected ms ms spectra but the progress curves fig 3 and s9 s11 suggest that amo tp 384 2 and amp tp 368 2 are products of the hydrolysis of the diketopiperazine containing intermediates figs s12 and s13 in addition we detected ms features that suggested the aromatic oxygenation of amoxicillin amo tp 430 and the oxidative removal of the primary amine of ampicillin amp tp 367 as additional biotransformations most importantly all transformation products except for the low intensity product amo tp 430 lacked the β lactam moiety that is crucial for the antibiotic action of this class of antibiotics i e inhibition of transpeptidases important for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall tipper 1985 for clindamycin we observed the oxidation of the thioether i e cli tp 441 followed by the hydrolysis of the secondary amide cli tp 288 fig s14 the occurrence of cli tp 441 is supported by previous studies in which the transformation of clindamycin in moving bed biofilm reactors was assessed ooi et al 2017 while cli tp 288 has to the best of our knowledge not been documented before interestingly thioether oxidation of clindamycin has been shown to strongly reduce its capability to inhibit ribosomal translocation the mode of action of clindamycin brodasky et al 1977 wilson 2014 for daptomycin we detected three biotransformations 1 amide hydrolysis resulting in the removal of the lipid tail product dap tp 733 2 hydrolysis of an additional secondary amide dap tp 640 and 3 hydroxylation of an aliphatic carbon dap tp 818 fig s15 the formation of dap tp 733 and dap tp 640 are supported by previous work in which the biodegradation of daptomycin by isolated actinomycetes was studied d costa et al 2012 as the fatty acid tail is critical for the antibiotic activity of daptomycin taylor and palmer 2016 these two products are expected to have reduced antibiotic activity our experiments demonstrated that the three transformation products detected for daptomycin are further transformed figs s5 s7 however we did not detect additional transformation products possibly due to multiple co occurring downstream reactions e g hydrolyses resulting in a diverse set of transformation products with concentrations below the limit of detection for linezolid we observed secondary amide hydrolysis i e lin tp 296 followed by the oxidative transformation of the resulting primary amine into a carboxylate i e lin tp 311 fig s16 in addition we detected a transformation product i e lin tp 386 that might result from the oxidative removal of an organic substituent from the carbamate nitrogen and a simultaneous dioxygenation of the aromatic ring due to a lack of information on the functional groups that impart antibiotic activity to linezolid it is unknown whether these changes to the chemical structure of linezolid affect its capacity to block the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis the mode of action of this antibiotic livermore 2003 taken together we identified biotransformation pathways that resulted in the elimination of the functional group associated with antibiotic activity for amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin and daptomycin this is an important finding with respect to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes and adds relevance to the kinetic results discussed above additionally our results showed that besides the transformation kinetics fig 2 also the biotransformation pathways were in general well conserved across the three wwtps table 1 however the production rates of some transformation products differed across wwtps for example the formation rate of cli tp 441 decreased in the following order wwtp 3 wwtp 2 wwtp 1 figs s9 11 while cli tp 288 was formed more rapidly by the microbial community in wwtp 2 as compared to wwtp 1 and wwtp 3 together these data support the finding that the rate constant of the biotransformation of clindamycin was highest for wwtp 2 finally it is noteworthy that we did not detect any products indicative of the hydrolysis of 1 the secondary amide bond in amoxicillin and ampicillin and 2 the oxazolidine ring in linezolid a finding that highlights the specificity of amidases derived from wastewater microbial communities analyzing products of the antibiotic biotransformations by enzymes in pool iii revealed that β lactam hydrolysis of amoxicillin and ampicillin and amide hydrolysis of daptomycin resulting in the removal of its lipid tail i e dap tp 733 were catalyzed by extracellular enzymes table 1 and s9 s11 this is important as we expect that these extracellular biotransformations result in reduced selection pressure for resistance genes against these antibiotics a closer look at the progress curves of ampicillin and its transformation products in enzyme pools i and iii derived from wwtp 2 revealed that while the formation of amp tp 368 1 and its subsequent transformation into amp tp 368 2 occurred in both pools the concentration decrease of amp tp 368 2 after 20 h of incubation was only detected in pool i fig 3 a this observation indicates that amp tp 368 2 is further transformed into an unknown transformation product presumably by intracellular enzymes finally we note that the remaining biotransformations listed in table 1 were not observed in enzyme pool iii which suggests that they depend on intracellular enzymes together these results demonstrated that the metabolic potential with respect to the transformation of the tested antibiotics is lower for extracellular than for intracellular enzymes 3 5 implications while the results from our experiments support the hypothesis that intracellular metabolism is more complex than extracellular metabolism our data do not allow a final conclusion as to whether extracellular biotransformations are more conserved across wwtps than intracellular biotransformations to answer this question a larger number of biotransformations needs to be compared across wwtps despite the relatively low number of extracellularly catalyzed antibiotics biotransformations detected here it is noteworthy that we measured substantial protease activity in enzyme pool iv among all wwtps it is thus possible if not likely that amides in chemicals other than the ones studied here can be hydrolyzed by soluble extracellular wastewater enzymes a desirable attribute for antibiotics and other chemicals that induce undesirable effects in the environment haernvall et al 2017 helfrich et al 2018 lam and crawford 2018 niu et al 2018 with respect to antibiotics we anticipate that the fast biotransformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin by intact wastewater microbial communities derived from all wwtps i e 10 of the spiked amounts remained at the 6 h sampling time point which is in the order of the hydraulic retention times of the sampled aeration tanks see table s2 reduces the selection pressure of resistance genes against these antibiotics in wwtps and downstream environments this effect might be enhanced by the finding that the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity of these three antibiotics were also biotransformed by extracellular enzymes for the more slowly biotransformed antibiotics we expect that their slow removal results in a higher selection pressure for resistance against these antibiotics however our results revealed that the biotransformation rates of some of these antibiotics and the rates of specific biotransformations differed across wwtps the identification of microbial taxa and functional traits responsible for these biotransformations might create opportunities to engineer wastewater microbial communities to improve removal efficiencies for persistent antibiotics and other micropollutants 4 conclusions we developed and optimized a method to reproducibly extract extracellular i e soluble and eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities measures of protease and peptidase activity demonstrate that there is biotransformation potential among soluble enzymes eps bound enzymes and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities a more systematic assessment of the specificity of these enzymes will create opportunities for the design of more readily degradable chemicals and improve our ability to predict the biotransformation of chemicals during biological wastewater treatment the biotransformation rate constants of six antibiotics during their incubation with intact wastewater microbial communities were variable ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin were readily biotransformed while clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin were biotransformed more slowly both kinetics and pathways of antibiotics biotransformations were mostly reproducible across three wwtps suggesting that the activity of wastewater enzymes with respect to the biotransformation of the studied compounds is similar across wwtps our results suggest that the metabolic potential is smaller for extracellular enzymes than for intracellular enzymes while β lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis i e amide hydrolysis resulting in the removal of the lipid tail were the only biotransformations that were catalyzed by extracted extracellular enzymes we observed a wider set of biotransformations that were mediated by enzymes in intact wastewater microbial communities the observation that β lactam and peptide based antibiotics can be biotransformed extracellularly might be significant with respect to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes within

18931,evaluating the activity of extracellular and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities is essential to improve our fundamental understanding of micropollutant removal during wastewater treatment to study biotransformations with respect to enzyme biogeography we developed a method to separate soluble extracellular extracellular polymeric substance eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and assessed the protease and peptidase activity of the resulting enzyme pools we also evaluated the biotransformation of six antibiotics amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin daptomycin linezolid and vancomycin in each enzyme pool because we expect that the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance within wastewater microbial communities and in downstream environments our results demonstrated that biotransformation rate constants varied among the tested antibiotics and that the observed rank order was consistent across three wastewater treatment plants importantly many of the observed biotransformations eliminated the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity furthermore we found that β lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis were catalyzed by enzymes extracted from the eps while none of the tested antibiotics were biotransformed by soluble extracellular enzymes finally our results demonstrated that the number of enzyme catalyzed antibiotic transformations was larger for intracellular than for extracellular enzymes together this study provides novel insights on the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities and can be used to inform pathway prediction or the development of biodegradable chemicals graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment micropollutant biotransformation enzymatic activity antibiotics enzyme extraction 1 introduction current wastewater treatment processes often fail at completely removing anthropogenic organic chemicals that occur at trace concentrations falås et al 2016 joss et al 2005 r loos et al 2013 as a result these chemicals referred to as micropollutants are discharged into the environment where some of them negatively affect ecosystem and human health boxall 2004 schwarzenbach et al 2006 several previous studies have demonstrated that wastewater microbial communities can biotransform some types of micropollutants for example the biotransformation pathways of a set of amide and amine containing micropollutants has been previously reported gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010a other studies in which biotransformation analyses were combined with the characterization of the microbial community i e metagenomics and metatranscriptomics provided valuable insights into how microbial community structure and gene expression patterns determine the biotransformation of certain micropollutants helbling et al 2011 johnson et al 2015 men et al 2017 wolff et al 2018 others have explored the activity of enzymes extracted from wastewater microbial communities as a means to link observed biotransformations to specific enzymes krah et al 2016 these studies have improved our fundamental understanding of micropollutant biotransformations and have enabled more robust predictions of how micropollutants may be biotransformed during wastewater treatment wicker et al 2016 despite the insights provided by these and other studies our understanding of the metabolic potential of wastewater microbial communities is still limited for example studies on the kinetics and pathways of micropollutant biotransformations have been limited to a rather small set of chemicals furthermore the role of extracellular enzymes in the biotransformation of micropollutants during biological wastewater treatment remains completely unknown this is of relevance because cellular uptake of large and ionized micropollutants may be limited gulde et al 2014 and extracellular biotransformations may thus contribute significantly to the fate of these micropollutants during wastewater treatment additionally we anticipate that extracellular metabolism is less complex and more conserved across different wastewater treatment plants wwtps than intracellular metabolism therefore consideration for the biogeography i e extracellular or intracellular of micropollutant biotransformations might also improve our ability to predict micropollutant biotransformations during wastewater treatment previous studies on the biogeography of enzyme catalyzed reactions performed by wastewater microbial communities solely focused on the turnover of biomacromolecules such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids frølund et al 1995 y li and chrost 2006 for example a previous study reported that the majority of active extracellular hydrolases are bound to the extracellular polymeric substance eps of wastewater biofilms frølund et al 1995 while such studies have offered initial insights into the extracellular metabolic activity of wastewater microbial communities the contribution of extracellular enzymes e g hydrolases to the transformation of micropollutants remains unexplored one class of micropollutants of concern are antibiotics klein et al 2018 pepper et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 their incomplete removal during biological wastewater treatment is one cause for the selection of antibiotic resistant microorganisms in both wwtps and downstream environments baquero et al 2008 czekalski et al 2012 lapara et al 2011 michael et al 2013 uyaguari et al 2011 watkinson et al 2009 the occurrence of antibiotics in natural and engineered systems has furthermore been shown to affect the functioning of these systems by influencing microbial community structure klaus kümmerer 2009 y zhang et al 2013 therefore the biotransformation of antibiotics during wastewater treatment is essential to limit the proliferation of antibiotic resistance andrä et al 2018 we anticipate that the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance specifically we expect that the selection pressure will be lowest for antibiotics for which the functional group that imparts the antibiotic activity is rapidly biotransformed by extracellular enzymes the importance of the biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations is supported by the recent finding that antibiotic sensitive microorganisms were protected from an antibiotic when they grew in proximity to microorganisms that degraded the respective antibiotic extracellularly frost et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to i develop a method to extract soluble eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and ii assess the kinetics and pathways of antibiotic biotransformations in the resulting enzyme pools we selected six amide containing antibiotics amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin daptomycin linezolid and vancomycin and anticipated amide hydrolysis a slow process at environmental conditions when not catalyzed tebes stevens et al 2017 by extracellular proteases and peptidases to be a likely biotransformation in parallel to antibiotic biotransformations we measured protease and peptidase activities in each of the extracted enzyme pools with high throughput assays based on fluorogenic probes we compared the results of the activity assays and the antibiotic biotransformation experiments to determine whether protease and peptidase activity were useful surrogates for predicting micropollutant biotransformation rates together our study provides novel insights on the kinetics pathways and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 antibiotics and additional chemicals information on general chemicals and

concentration and protease peptidase activity measurements all of the experiments described in this section were performed directly after enzyme extraction i e 5 h after sample collection at the treatment plants we determined protein concentrations of enzyme extracts with the pierce bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit thermo fisher 23225 according to the manufacturer s instructions in brief we added 150 μl of enzyme extract or protein standard bovine serum albumin final concentration range 1 200 mg l and 150 μl of freshly prepared working reagent to a well of a transparent 96 well microplate millipore sigma cls3997 we used a plate reader tecan infinite m200 pro to measure the absorbance at 562 nm of the resulting solutions for protease activity measurements we used the enzcheck protease assay kit thermo fisher e6638 which is based on fluorogenic casein substrate and buffer solutions were prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions we then added 100 μl of enzyme extract and 100 μl of freshly prepared working solution to a well of a black 96 well microplate millipore sigma cls3991 proteolytic reactions resulted in the production of fluorescently labeled peptides which we detected by periodic fluorescence measurements in the plate reader excitation at 485 nm emission detected at 530 nm measurement interval 3 min because there is no standard for the fluorescently labeled peptides we normalized the measured fluorescence intensities based on a substrate incubation in milli q water which was run on the same plate to correct for non enzymatic hydrolysis we subtracted hydrolysis rates in milli q water from hydrolysis rates in enzyme pools for peptidase activity measurements we used the fluorogenic probe l lysine 7 amido 4 methylcoumarin l

series in milli q water final concentration range l amc 0 05 40 μm amc 0 01 10 μm then we mixed 100 μl of enzyme extract and 100 μl of the l amc or amc solutions in a well of a black 96 well

were 2 5 v v 2 4 antibiotic biotransformation experiments biotransformation experiments were started immediately after enzyme extraction i e 3 h after sample collection at the wwtps we spiked an aqueous solution containing all tested antibiotics to triplicate bioreactors containing the four enzyme pools twelve total bioreactors per wwtp to a resulting target concentration for all antibiotics of 100 μg l we note that this solution additionally contained 100 μg l of atenolol as a positive control and 100 μg l bacitracin which is not discussed in the study due to analytical problems to control for non enzymatic removal processes such as the adsorption of antibiotics to sludge we performed triplicate incubations with enzyme pools that had been autoclaved twice 4 h apart at 120 c and 1 3 bar for 20 min twelve total control reactors per wwtp amsco lg 250 autoclave steris gulde et al 2014 incubations were run in loosely capped 100 ml glass bottles at room temperature and horizontal shaking at 180 rpm innova 2000 new brunswick scientific samples of 1 ml were collected at 5 min 2 h 6 h 18 h and 42 h after spiking the antibiotics and were immediately transferred onto ice we note that we deliberately chose not to subject samples to heat or acid treatment in order to prevent non enzymatic transformations after a centrifugation 15 800 g 2 min eppendorf 5424r the supernatants were transferred into 2 ml amber glass vials and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 5 sample analysis of antibiotic biotransformation experiment to quantify antibiotic concentrations and to identify transformation products we used reversed phase liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo scientific coupled to high resolution quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry qexactive thermo scientific as previously described helbling et al 2010b pochodylo and helbling 2016 briefly we injected 20 μl of the samples that were stored in the temperature controlled 4 c compartments of the autosampler during the analysis for sample separation we ran a gradient of lc ms grade water omnisolv 58201 solvent a and methanol omnisolv 58215 solvent b both containing 0 1 v v formic acid over an xbridge c18 column

acquisitions scan range 120 1200 m z resolution 70 000 in electrospray ionization positive negative switch mode for absolute quantification of target analytes we analyzed matrix matched calibrations concentration range 2 100 μg l and calculated concentrations based on peak areas obtained with xcalibur quanbrowser thermo scientific version 3 1 assuming first order kinetics for all antibiotics biotransformations helbling et al 2010a we derived rate constants of enzymatic antibiotic transformations k enz based on the following equation 1 c t 2 c t 1 e k e n z k a b i o t t 2 t 1 where c t 1 and c t 2 are the concentrations of the antibiotic k abiot is the rate constant derived from the autoclaved control experiment and t 1 and t 2 represent subsequent time points during the incubation we derived k abiot and k enz k abiot by a linear regression fit of the logarithm of the antibiotic concentration versus time from autoclaved k enz 0 and biological incubation experiments respectively 2 6 transformation product analysis we used the eawag pathway prediction system eawag pps http eawag bbd ethz ch predict gao et al 2009 to predict biotransformation products for the studied antibiotics we allowed prediction of three consecutive reactions except for daptomycin and vancomycin for which we allowed only two consecutive reactions to limit combinatorial explosion and included all biotransformation likelihoods then we converted the resulting list of smiles strings into a list of molecular formulas and used envimass version 4 1 m loos 2018 to screen the acquired hrms data for the exact masses of the predicted transformation products kern et al 2009 all ms features i e picked peaks with an accurate mass within 5 ppm of the predicted exact mass of a transformation product for which the intensity was greater than 1e5 and greater than 10 fold the intensity in the blank sample i e milli q water were considered ms features of interest subsequently we used xcalibur qualbrowser thermo scientific version 3 1 to manually verify that the features showed distinct chromatographic peaks and that the measured isotope patterns matched the patterns predicted for the respective molecular formula for all features that fulfilled these criteria we created a processing method in xcalibur quanbrowser and plotted progress curves of peak areas features for which peak areas changed over time were considered transformation product candidates for these candidates we acquired data dependent ms ms scans resolution 17 500 and compared the results of these scans with the results of an in silico fragmentation performed with mass frontier version 7 0 all proposed transformation product structures are assigned a confidence level as has become convention in the field of non target analysis schymanski et al 2014 we note that we expanded the definition of confidence level 3 to include structures that are likely because of the experimental context i e anticipated transformation product structures resulting from spiked compounds with known structures even though diagnostic ms ms data was not available additionally we introduced confidence level 3 for transformation product structures for which no alternative structure is likely 3 results and discussion 3 1 development and optimization of enzyme extraction method to investigate biotransformations mediated by wastewater enzymes with respect to biogeography we first developed and optimized a method to separate wastewater enzymes into different pools our goal was to separate soluble extracellular enzymes and eps bound enzymes from intracellular enzymes to meet this goal we combined components of previously established extraction methods for wastewater biofilms frølund et al 1995 gessesse et al 2003 jorand et al 1995 krah et al 2016 and evaluated the extraction protocols with respect to protein concentration protease activity and atp concentration an indicator of cell lysis yu et al 2017 based on the data provided in table s3 and fig s2 we considered the extraction method depicted in scheme 1 to be the most suitable for this study 3 2 protein concentration protease activity and peptidase activity to generally characterize the enzyme pools resulting from this extraction we measured protein concentration protease activity on casein and peptidase activity on l lysine 7 amido 4 methylcoumarin l amc using fluorescence or absorbance based high throughput assays for all wwtps our measurements were reproducible and showed that protein concentration protease activity and peptidase activity all decreased in the order pool ii pool iii pool iv fig 1 our results therefore demonstrated that each enzyme pool can catalyze hydrolytic reactions to some extent with respect to extracellular enzymes our results are consistent with previous studies on wastewater microbial enzymes that reported a higher hydrolytic activity in extracts containing eps bound enzymes as compared to extracts containing soluble extracellular enzymes only frølund et al 1995 y li and chrost 2006 nevertheless it remains unknown whether these extracellular hydrolases contribute to the biotransformation of micropollutants 3 3 kinetics of antibiotic biotransformations to assess the kinetics of the biotransformation of the six antibiotics in each of the enzyme pools we estimated biotransformation rate constants using equation 1 for enzyme pool i our data demonstrated that the rate of biotransformation varied among the tested antibiotics fig 2 amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin were completely biotransformed within 20 h of incubation with the intact wastewater microbial communities pool i from all three wwtps while fast biotransformation of amoxicillin and ampicillin is in agreement with previously reported removal efficiencies during biological wastewater treatment li and zhang 2011 watkinson et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge the biotransformation of daptomycin by wastewater microbial communities has not been studied before the remaining antibiotics i e clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin were biotransformed at relatively lower rates this finding is in agreement with previous studies reporting only partial removal of these antibiotics during biological wastewater treatment kulkarni et al 2017 li and zhang 2011 ooi et al 2017 we note that the concentration of vancomycin readily decreased during its incubation in autoclaved enzyme pool i presumably due to sorption fig s5 s7 which hindered the biotransformation analysis of this compound for enzyme pool ii i e the extract containing intracellular and extracellular enzymes we observed the transformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin by pool ii enzymes from all treatment plants fig 2 interestingly the biotransformations of amoxicillin and ampicillin were faster in pool ii than in pool i i e the intact microbial community we explain this observation by a better accessibility of these antibiotics to the extracted enzymes e g when cellular uptake is the rate limiting step during a biotransformation on the contrary the biotransformation of daptomycin was slower in enzyme pool ii than in pool i this observation suggests that the biotransformation of daptomycin is partially mediated by enzymes that depend on intact cells or by enzymes whose function was disturbed by the extraction agents e g surfactant or cation exchange resins these reasons might also explain why the remaining antibiotics i e clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin which were all transformed by enzymes in pool i were not transformed by enzymes in pool ii with respect to extracellular enzymes we found that amoxicillin and ampicillin were transformed by eps bound extracellular enzymes i e pool iii from all wwtps while daptomycin was transformed by pool iii enzymes from wwtp 2 the remaining antibiotics were not biotransformed by enzymes in pool iii the observation that the biotransformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin was faster in pool ii than in pool iii indicated that the enzymes that catalyze these biotransformations occur extra and intracellularly finally our experiments with enzyme pool iv demonstrated that none of the antibiotics were significantly transformed by soluble enzymes pool iv derived from any of the wwtps the differences in enzymatic biotransformation rate constants across the tested antibiotics highlight the importance of assessing the biodegradability of antibiotics by wastewater microbial communities when selecting antibiotics for use in medicine andrä et al 2018 we expect that the selection pressure for antibiotic resistance genes in wwtps and downstream environments will be lower for the antibiotics that were readily biotransformed i e ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin than for the antibiotics that were biotransformed more slowly furthermore we expect that the contribution of extracellular enzymes to the biotransformation of ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin further reduces the pressure for resistance selection against these antibiotics comparing trends in biotransformation rate constants in enzyme pool i across wwtps we found that the rank order of the antibiotics remained the same across the three wwtps fig 2 suggesting that the transformation preference of the wastewater microbial communities with respect to the tested antibiotics is similar across different municipal wwtps however we also observed that the magnitude of the rate constants of some biotransformations after normalization for biological activity i e atp concentration table s2 significantly differed across wwtps for example clindamycin biotransformation in enzyme pool i was faster for wwtp 2 than for wwtp 1 and wwtp 3 t test p values 0 001 additionally we observed that daptomycin biotransformation in pool ii and amoxicillin and ampicillin biotransformation in pool iii was faster for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 than for wwtp 3 p values 0 02 these differences are noteworthy because they might help identifying the enzymes and microorganisms involved in these biotransformations information that is critical for the engineering of wastewater microbial communities to more readily biotransform the respective antibiotics to assess whether rapid enzyme activity assays might be useful to predict antibiotic biotransformation rates during wastewater treatment we compared trends in antibiotic biotransformation rate constants across treatment plants with the results of the protease and peptidase assays fig 1 interestingly we did not find any matching trends the trend observed for the biotransformation of amoxicillin and ampicillin by enzymes in pool iii i e wwtp 1 wwtp 2 wwtp 3 fig 2 even correlated negatively with the trend measured for protease activity in the same extracts i e wwtp 3 wwtp 2 wwtp 1 fig 1b these findings suggest that the enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of antibiotics were different from the enzymes assessed with the peptidase and protease assays 3 4 pathways of antibiotic biotransformations to obtain mechanistic insights into the biotransformations catalyzed by intracellular and extracellular enzymes we examined the transformation products formed during the incubations of antibiotics with enzyme pools i and iii these enzyme pools were selected as they demonstrated the highest enzyme activities among intracellular pool i and extracellular pool iii enzyme pools we used the eawag pathway prediction system to predict the structures of plausible transformation products and envimass to screen the acquired hrms data for predicted transformation products gao et al 2009 m loos 2018 molecular formulas retention times theoretical and measured masses biotransformation rules and levels of identification confidence for the resulting transformation products are shown in table 1 in enzyme pool i we discovered transformation products for all tested antibiotics except for vancomycin table 1 figs s9 s11 we assume that the sorption of vancomycin to components of the wastewater matrix as well as its poor ionization efficiency explain why we did not detect any transformation products for this antibiotic more importantly however the transformation products detected for the remaining five antibiotics revealed a diverse set of enzyme catalyzed reactions including amide hydrolysis aldehyde oxidation oxidative removal of an organic substituent from an amine and sulfide oxidation in the following paragraphs we briefly describe the detected biotransformations for each antibiotic and discuss the detected transformation products with respect to antibiotic activity for amoxicillin and ampicillin we identified β lactam hydrolysis as a biotransformation pathway fig 3 s12 and s13 this finding is consistent with studies in which β lactam hydrolysis products of amoxicillin were detected in the effluent of wwtps lamm et al 2009 pérez parada et al 2011 and with studies in which the transcription of β lactamase genes by wastewater microorganisms has been detected ju et al 2018 for both amoxicillin and ampicillin we identified the penicilloic acid form amo tp 384 1 and amp tp 368 1 the diketopiperazine form amo tp 366 and amp tp 350 as well as amo tp 384 2 and amp tp 368 2 which had the same accurate masses as amo tp 384 1 and amp tp 368 1 respectively but different retention times we note that these isobaric transformation product pairs were not clearly distinguishable based on the collected ms ms spectra but the progress curves fig 3 and s9 s11 suggest that amo tp 384 2 and amp tp 368 2 are products of the hydrolysis of the diketopiperazine containing intermediates figs s12 and s13 in addition we detected ms features that suggested the aromatic oxygenation of amoxicillin amo tp 430 and the oxidative removal of the primary amine of ampicillin amp tp 367 as additional biotransformations most importantly all transformation products except for the low intensity product amo tp 430 lacked the β lactam moiety that is crucial for the antibiotic action of this class of antibiotics i e inhibition of transpeptidases important for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall tipper 1985 for clindamycin we observed the oxidation of the thioether i e cli tp 441 followed by the hydrolysis of the secondary amide cli tp 288 fig s14 the occurrence of cli tp 441 is supported by previous studies in which the transformation of clindamycin in moving bed biofilm reactors was assessed ooi et al 2017 while cli tp 288 has to the best of our knowledge not been documented before interestingly thioether oxidation of clindamycin has been shown to strongly reduce its capability to inhibit ribosomal translocation the mode of action of clindamycin brodasky et al 1977 wilson 2014 for daptomycin we detected three biotransformations 1 amide hydrolysis resulting in the removal of the lipid tail product dap tp 733 2 hydrolysis of an additional secondary amide dap tp 640 and 3 hydroxylation of an aliphatic carbon dap tp 818 fig s15 the formation of dap tp 733 and dap tp 640 are supported by previous work in which the biodegradation of daptomycin by isolated actinomycetes was studied d costa et al 2012 as the fatty acid tail is critical for the antibiotic activity of daptomycin taylor and palmer 2016 these two products are expected to have reduced antibiotic activity our experiments demonstrated that the three transformation products detected for daptomycin are further transformed figs s5 s7 however we did not detect additional transformation products possibly due to multiple co occurring downstream reactions e g hydrolyses resulting in a diverse set of transformation products with concentrations below the limit of detection for linezolid we observed secondary amide hydrolysis i e lin tp 296 followed by the oxidative transformation of the resulting primary amine into a carboxylate i e lin tp 311 fig s16 in addition we detected a transformation product i e lin tp 386 that might result from the oxidative removal of an organic substituent from the carbamate nitrogen and a simultaneous dioxygenation of the aromatic ring due to a lack of information on the functional groups that impart antibiotic activity to linezolid it is unknown whether these changes to the chemical structure of linezolid affect its capacity to block the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis the mode of action of this antibiotic livermore 2003 taken together we identified biotransformation pathways that resulted in the elimination of the functional group associated with antibiotic activity for amoxicillin ampicillin clindamycin and daptomycin this is an important finding with respect to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes and adds relevance to the kinetic results discussed above additionally our results showed that besides the transformation kinetics fig 2 also the biotransformation pathways were in general well conserved across the three wwtps table 1 however the production rates of some transformation products differed across wwtps for example the formation rate of cli tp 441 decreased in the following order wwtp 3 wwtp 2 wwtp 1 figs s9 11 while cli tp 288 was formed more rapidly by the microbial community in wwtp 2 as compared to wwtp 1 and wwtp 3 together these data support the finding that the rate constant of the biotransformation of clindamycin was highest for wwtp 2 finally it is noteworthy that we did not detect any products indicative of the hydrolysis of 1 the secondary amide bond in amoxicillin and ampicillin and 2 the oxazolidine ring in linezolid a finding that highlights the specificity of amidases derived from wastewater microbial communities analyzing products of the antibiotic biotransformations by enzymes in pool iii revealed that β lactam hydrolysis of amoxicillin and ampicillin and amide hydrolysis of daptomycin resulting in the removal of its lipid tail i e dap tp 733 were catalyzed by extracellular enzymes table 1 and s9 s11 this is important as we expect that these extracellular biotransformations result in reduced selection pressure for resistance genes against these antibiotics a closer look at the progress curves of ampicillin and its transformation products in enzyme pools i and iii derived from wwtp 2 revealed that while the formation of amp tp 368 1 and its subsequent transformation into amp tp 368 2 occurred in both pools the concentration decrease of amp tp 368 2 after 20 h of incubation was only detected in pool i fig 3 a this observation indicates that amp tp 368 2 is further transformed into an unknown transformation product presumably by intracellular enzymes finally we note that the remaining biotransformations listed in table 1 were not observed in enzyme pool iii which suggests that they depend on intracellular enzymes together these results demonstrated that the metabolic potential with respect to the transformation of the tested antibiotics is lower for extracellular than for intracellular enzymes 3 5 implications while the results from our experiments support the hypothesis that intracellular metabolism is more complex than extracellular metabolism our data do not allow a final conclusion as to whether extracellular biotransformations are more conserved across wwtps than intracellular biotransformations to answer this question a larger number of biotransformations needs to be compared across wwtps despite the relatively low number of extracellularly catalyzed antibiotics biotransformations detected here it is noteworthy that we measured substantial protease activity in enzyme pool iv among all wwtps it is thus possible if not likely that amides in chemicals other than the ones studied here can be hydrolyzed by soluble extracellular wastewater enzymes a desirable attribute for antibiotics and other chemicals that induce undesirable effects in the environment haernvall et al 2017 helfrich et al 2018 lam and crawford 2018 niu et al 2018 with respect to antibiotics we anticipate that the fast biotransformation of amoxicillin ampicillin and daptomycin by intact wastewater microbial communities derived from all wwtps i e 10 of the spiked amounts remained at the 6 h sampling time point which is in the order of the hydraulic retention times of the sampled aeration tanks see table s2 reduces the selection pressure of resistance genes against these antibiotics in wwtps and downstream environments this effect might be enhanced by the finding that the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity of these three antibiotics were also biotransformed by extracellular enzymes for the more slowly biotransformed antibiotics we expect that their slow removal results in a higher selection pressure for resistance against these antibiotics however our results revealed that the biotransformation rates of some of these antibiotics and the rates of specific biotransformations differed across wwtps the identification of microbial taxa and functional traits responsible for these biotransformations might create opportunities to engineer wastewater microbial communities to improve removal efficiencies for persistent antibiotics and other micropollutants 4 conclusions we developed and optimized a method to reproducibly extract extracellular i e soluble and eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities measures of protease and peptidase activity demonstrate that there is biotransformation potential among soluble enzymes eps bound enzymes and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities a more systematic assessment of the specificity of these enzymes will create opportunities for the design of more readily degradable chemicals and improve our ability to predict the biotransformation of chemicals during biological wastewater treatment the biotransformation rate constants of six antibiotics during their incubation with intact wastewater microbial communities were variable ampicillin amoxicillin and daptomycin were readily biotransformed while clindamycin linezolid and vancomycin were biotransformed more slowly both kinetics and pathways of antibiotics biotransformations were mostly reproducible across three wwtps suggesting that the activity of wastewater enzymes with respect to the biotransformation of the studied compounds is similar across wwtps our results suggest that the metabolic potential is smaller for extracellular enzymes than for intracellular enzymes while β lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis i e amide hydrolysis resulting in the removal of the lipid tail were the only biotransformations that were catalyzed by extracted extracellular enzymes we observed a wider set of biotransformations that were mediated by enzymes in intact wastewater microbial communities the observation that β lactam and peptide based antibiotics can be biotransformed extracellularly might be significant with respect to the selection of antibiotic resistance genes within

18932,disinfection processes were applied in reclaimed water plant to eliminate pathogens and control the related health risk during water reuse however extra problems might emerge such as the released free endotoxins from the ruptured cell wall of gram negative bacteria endotoxins can induce lung inflammatory responses after inhalation which has been neglected in the water quality regulation and the removal of endotoxin was not under consideration in the process of reclamation in the present study two well known disinfection processes chlorination and combined uv chlorine uv cl2 were performed to test the removal efficiency of endotoxin activity as well as the inflammation inducing ability in the pure lps solution uv cl2 treatment significantly reduced both endotoxin activity and lung inflammation responses with better oxidizability of the generated hydroxyl radical however its performance on bacteria liquid and real secondary effluent was more complicated the cell wall bound lps have lower endotoxin activities and inflammation inducing ability immediately after the cell wall was destroyed the bound lps were released to the solution to be free lps which dramatically increased both the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of the water when these free endotoxins were continuously oxidized the endotoxin activity and inflammatory response decreased again but not to the background level therefore the inflammation inducing ability of reclaimed water could not be removed efficiently these results suggest that in spite of its high oxidability uv cl2 treatment is not capable of removing the endotoxin based toxicity and other technologies are necessary to control endotoxin levels in reclaimed water graphical abstract image 1 keywords endotoxin reclaimed water chlorination uv inflammation 1 introduction wastewater reclamation is widely used around the world to cope with the scarcity of traditional water resource and at least 60 countries are practicing various types of water reuse angelakis and gikas 2014 an important step of reclamation is disinfection which is intended to eliminate the pathogens in the wastewater as much as possible the key issue derived from the prevalence of reclaimed water is the related health risk however most studies of the health risks from the application of reclaimed water considered that incidental oral ingestion is the major exposure route who 2006 this is partially reasonable but the exposure route is tightly related to the endpoint of reuse for example when the water is used for car wash garden irrigation or road clean the major route of exposure is inhalation rather than ingestion furthermore what little research on the inhalation exposure of reclaimed water there is has focused on vocs while the inhalation risk from endotoxin has been largely ignored endotoxin also known as lps lipopolysaccharide is a component of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria the endotoxin exposure events in drinking water have been reported early in 1976 some fever cases after exposure to humidifiers and in a sauna were unexplained kohler et al 1976 metzger et al 1976 pickering et al 1976 rylander et al 1978 first demonstrated that the o antigen antibodies in patients were elevated which indicated the etiologic role of the endotoxins the earliest confirmed human exposure event was the bathing fever in finland aro et al 1980 one hundred of 1000 inhabitants in tampere got symptoms such as cough chills breathing difficulties fever muscle pain and joint ache muittari et al 1980 found that the total inhaled endotoxin dose of the patients was 1 0 4 0 μg after the outbreak the previously affected individuals were challenged of contaminated tap water all of them developed a fever with coughing and breath shortness within 4 h anderson et al 2007 other occupational exposure with drinking water aerosolized facility was also reported rylander and haglind 1984 mcgregor et al 1993 the median value of endotoxin activity in reclaimed water was 422 eu ml huang et al 2013 which were comparable to contaminated drinking water however the inhalation risks of reclaimed water were not well studied yet two forms of lps are present naturally the bound endotoxin attached to the cell wall and the free endotoxin released from the cell both forms have biological activities and can induce immune responses after contact with the host despite substantial lps were maintained on the bacteria only very weak endotoxin activity can be detected xue et al 2016 the process of disinfection can break the bacterial cell wall that results in the immediate release of the endotoxin and the endotoxin activity levels in the water increases significantly rezaee et al 2008 huang et al 2011 consequently the performance of disinfection might lead to the generation of a potential risk from free endotoxin which could be considered as a novel disinfection byproduct there were many studies investigating the endotoxin activity removal capacity of various disinfection processes table s1 in brief chlorination was not very effective in synthetic lps solution and the removal rate was around 1 3 1 4 eu mlh anderson et al 2003a while in drinking water disinfection the chlorination may even increase the endotoxin activities sometimes gehr et al 2008 this endotoxin activity increase was also observed by huang et al 2011 and zhang et al 2016 in lps solutions similar to chlorination neither chloramine nor potassium permanganate treatments could effectively remove endotoxin activity anderson et al 2003a furthermore the majority of lps light absorption is lower than 225 nm so that uv254 from low vapour pressure mercury lamp could not affect lps activity very much gehr et al 2008 medium pressure mercury lamp emitting light over a broad range of wavelengths from approximately 185 to 1 400 nm could not remove endotoxin activity significantly either within the recommended uv dose 50 100 mj cm2 for drinking water anderson et al 2003b ozone had relatively better removal efficiency gehr et al 2008 but the most effective treatment is advanced oxidation with the presence of hydroxyl radical the removal efficiency of which can be up to 80 oh et al 2014 however all the mentioned studies targeted on the removal effects in pure lps synthetic solution or the clean drinking water the reclaimed water is much more complicated since it contains more bacteria and other unknown contaminates that can react with the disinfectant the removal of endotoxin activity then contains at least two steps the break of cell bound endotoxin to generate free endotoxin which may increase the endotoxin activity and the oxidation of lps which may reduce the endotoxin activity zhang et al 2016 chlorination was reported to be almost ineffective on the endotoxin removal in secondary effluent huang et al 2011 what s more in abovementioned studies only endotoxin activities were determined mostly by a standard limulus amebocyte lysate assay lal assay the removal of related toxicity was ignored the activity data obtained from the lal assay was not necessarily relevant to the degree of adverse effects caused by the endotoxins which was proved by the inconsistency between lal assay and the toxicity test such as the chicken embryo lethal dose and rabbit pyrogenicity tests takayama et al 1984 recently one report found that an increase of endotoxin activity after chlorination was along with the reduction of inflammation in lung via inhalation zhang et al 2016 these evidences imply that the determination of endotoxin activity level in water alone was not adequate to indicate the health risk that might exist after the exposure of reclaimed water whether the advanced oxidation can remove the toxicity induced by endotoxins remains unclear in the present study two typical disinfection processes chlorination and combined uv cl2 were applied to investigate their endotoxin activity removal efficiencies as well as the toxicity removal in pure lps solution typical gram negative strain solutions and whole secondary effluent the possible mechanisms were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 animals all the mice used were icr imprinting control region male mice 8 9 weeks old and purchased from the vital river company beijing china the mice were kept in the center of biomedical analysis tsinghua university animal maintenance and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of tsinghua university which is a branch of beijing animal care and use committee all experiments were reviewed and approved by the iacuc permit no 16 ly1 and all efforts had been made to minimize the suffering of the test animals 2 2 inhalation exposure hope med 8050 dynamic inhalation system was used for the animal exposure detailed performance can be found in a previous study xue et al 2016 briefly the water sample was nebulized to form a 50 humidity increase in the chamber and the mice were exposure for 6 h 2 3 water sample preparation lps synthetic solution commercialized pure lps were purchased from sigma aldrich l2637 from e coli o55b5 the endotoxin powder was dissolved in deionized water to form the stock solution 25 μg ml the endotoxin activity of which is about 200000 eu ml the working solution was prepared by spiking the stocking solution into pyrogen free water to obtain the lps solution with endotoxin activity level about 2000eu ml the endotoxin activities were determined by a standard limulus amebocyte lysate assay xiamen houshiji ltd china following the manufacturer s instructions bacteria solution two gram negative bacteria strains enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 isolated from a secondary effluent were tested the detailed information of which was described in a previous study xue et al 2016 after 16 h of cultivation in luria bertani medium at 37 c the bacteria were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min to remove the medium and washed 3 times by ultrapure water to eliminate the free endotoxin residue finally the bacteria cells were

sample was collected from a sewage treatment plant in beijing on 6th aug 2015 the reason for not choosing the reclaimed water with tertiary treatment was that the water might have too low endotoxin level to induce acute responses but a previous study already demonstrated that even a mbr reclaimed water with a low endotoxin level unable to induce acute inflammation still could cause serious lung damage in a subchronic exposure xue et al 2018 the secondary effluent could be a close mimic of the deeply treated reclaimed water for urban use the water quality was listed at table 1 the detection

lps aggregates was estimated by zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter usa methylene blue method was used to determine the hydroxyl radical yield during the process of uv cl2 treatment in short 10 mm of methylene blue was prepared as the storage solution and a standard concentration curve was obtained from 0 1 μm to 20 μm at od 660 nm the acquired equation was calculated as y 0 0685x 0 0188 where y is the od660 and x is the concentration of methylene blue μm before the treatment 200 μl of methylene blue storage solution was added into 400 ml of disinfected liquid and the final concentration of methylene blue was 5 μmol l after the treatment the od 660 of the mixture was tested to calculate the reduction of methylene blue which represents the hydroxyl radical yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of uv cl2 combined treatment on pure lps according to a previous work chlorination per se cannot remove the endotoxin activity effectively zhang et al 2016 however the inflammation inducing ability of pure lps was significantly reduced by chlorine within 10 min longer treatment of 4 h could not further decreased the inflammatory response which indicates that the reaction almost finished in 10 min and the chlorine could only remove part of the inflammation inducing ability about 40 the potential different result of combined uv cl2 treatment compared with chlorination is due to the different oxidative reactions as previously reported the main reaction happened in the chlorine treatment was chlorination zhang et al 2016 li et al 2016 shang et al 2014 while the uv cl2 can generate hydroxyl radical from hypochloric acid which represses chlorination and improves dehydrogenation li et al 2016 watts and linden 2007 the reaction time effect of uv cl2 treatment was firstly tested the generation of hydroxyl radical was measured by the methylene blue method which was nearly saturated within 10 min fig s1 and the reaction between oh and lps should be faster than that between chlorine and lps therefore the reaction time was set to 10 min it was surprising that unlike the inconsistence between the rising endotoxin activity and the falling inflammation after chlorination zhang et al 2016 the combined uv cl2 decreased the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability simultaneously fig 1 this suggests that different reaction happened during the combined treatment process to confirm the above observations uv chlorine single treatment and combined uv cl2 treatment were compared at the same time fig 2 as expected chlorine alone slightly increased the endotoxin activity of reference lps which was consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2016 the uv alone cannot significantly remove either the endotoxin activity fig 2a or the inflammation inducing ability fig 2b the lps contains a lot of saccharide rings and lipid backbone but no aromatic ring thus there is no potential uv254 absorption chemical group in the molecule and then it is reasonable that the endotoxin was undisturbed by uv irradiation however uv cl2 combined treatment could significantly reduce the endotoxin activity in the in vivo inflammation tests uv did not show obvious effects the combined treatment showed much better removal efficiency than chlorine alone fig 2b one similar observation was that uv cl2 could not completely remove the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability either the possible reason might be that the oh generated by uv cl2 was not enough though the chlorine was more than enough the cumulative oh yield within 10 min was calculated as 87 μg l with 5 mg l initial chlorine fig s1 in this test the lps concentration was 192 μg l and the lps contains about 55 of carbon zhang et al 2016 therefore the molar ratio between hydroxyl radical and carbon was about 0 58 1 whether the oh was enough to react with every lps molecule depended on the number of active sites on lps molecule which is relatively difficult to determine however when 20 mg l chlorine was combined with uv which was supposed to generate more oh within the treatment time fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 it was still unable to improve the removal efficiency fig 2 these results implied that the incomplete removal of the activity and toxicity of endotoxin was unlikely due to quantity of oh the hydroxyl radical has stronger oxidation ability which can react with alkanes while chlorine usually cannot the alkane chains called lipid a form hydrophobic core in lps aggregates which are responsible for the immune recognition other than monomers mueller et al 2004 thus the reaction with oh may significantly disturb the stability of lps aggregates this hypothesis was then proved by the average diameter measurement of lps aggregates after uv cl2 which dropped dramatically from 51 7 nm to 1 5 nm fig 3 the lipid a is also responsible for most of the toxicity of lps liebers et al 2008 the relief of inflammation after uv cl2 treatment might also be due to the oxidation of lipid a itself 3 2 disinfection effects of cl and uv cl2 on bacteria solutions it was confirmed that the inflammation inducing ability of bound lps on bacterial surface is much lower than that of free lps in the solution xue et al 2016 the chlorination can release the bound lps to be free lps which was proved by the increase of endotoxin activity after disinfection huang et al 2011 to test the possible different effects on live bacteria of uv cl2 treatment two gram negative bacteria isolated from secondary effluent enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 were applied the detailed information of which can be found in the previous study xue et al 2016 for chlorine alone the initial concentration of bacteria x4 is 2 55 107 cfu ml and is 4 106 cfu ml for x5 and the corresponding endotoxin activity were 154 eu ml and 26 eu ml respectively after 1 min of contact the endotoxin level of both x4 and x5 increased dramatically as expected fig 4 a then x5 kept nearly unchanged but x4 continued to increase slowly which indicates that two bacteria might have different lps this difference was more obvious in the uv cl2 treatment fig 4b the x5 had extremely fast reaction within 15 s while the endotoxin activity of x4 increased slowly in the whole 10 min this might be due to the different releasing rate of lps from various bacterial wall the possible reason is that the initial cell number of x4 was much higher than that of x5 more cells consumed more oh resulting in a lower hydroxyl radical to lps molar ratio then the removal of endotoxin activity was delayed another reason could be that different bacteria have different type and quantity of extracellular polymeric substances eps yu et al 2017 2018 which can react with oxidants to protect the cell wall bridier et al 2011 this protective effect should be more obvious when more hydroxyl radials with stronger oxidability and shorter half life react with the eps whether the eps of x4 is more sensitive to hydroxyl radical than that of x5 or x4 just has more eps needs further study it should be noted that both treatments were able to completely inactivate the bacteria within 1 min of contact which suggests the disinfection worked well after the treatments the bacterial solutions were also exposed to mice to determine the inflammation induction in lung and the pmn percentages in the lavage were concluded in fig 5 for bacterial solutions without treatment the endotoxin activity level was relatively low fig 4 mainly because the endotoxin existed as cell wall bound state thus the acute inflammatory responses were also relatively weak about 36 5 for x4 and 7 9 for x5 fig 5a after 1 min of chlorination the endotoxin levels surged and the pmn in both bacteria exposed lung was significantly raised this first stage mainly represented the release of endotoxin from cell wall and then the inflammatory responses declined slowly in the second stage but still maintained at a high level after 1h of chlorination fig 5a in this stage the release of bound endotoxin should be much weaker and the oxidation of free endotoxin continued the chlorine s capability of removing inflammation inducing ability of the free endotoxin was consistent with the observation of zhang et al 2016 in case of combined uv cl2 treatment the inflammatory responses changed similarly as the trends of endotoxin activities for x4 the average inflammation level increased slowly and had no sign of decline fig 5b which resembled the mild and continuous increase of endotoxin activity fig 4b since the pmn was already very high the slope of inflammation increase was small in the later stage the inflammatory response of x5 was elevated immediately within 15 s after the treatment and dropped back to a relatively low level in 10 min fig 5b which also resembled the pattern of endotoxin activity fig 4b these results further demonstrate that the reactions between the cell wall bound lps and hydroxyl radical are different for the two strains the main difference between chlorination and uv cl2 treatment on these two bacteria is the consistence between the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability chlorination can cause the increment of endotoxin activity but decrease the inflammation inducing ability while uv cl2 treatment or hydroxyl radical results in consistent changing pattern of these two measurements in another words the lal assay may still be competent to estimate the toxicity removal of the combined uv cl2 treatment both of the endotoxin activity and toxicity of x4 were hardly removed by oh besides the higher cell number and possible different eps of x4 another reason might be the insufficient oh quantity the selected highest 20 mg l chlorine seems not enough to reduce the endotoxin activity and toxicity however the contact time of 10 min was estimated by uv plus 5 mg l chlorine when 20 mg l chlorine was applied the oh generation would be more continuous longer treatment or high chlorine concentration may exhibit better removal of both endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of strain x4 though it would be too costly in the real operation 3 3 the removal efficiency of two processes on actual secondary effluent sample a secondary effluent table 1 was collected to further compare the removal of endotoxin activity and toxicity by two disinfection treatments 10 mg l chlorine was applied since it was the most common used in wastewater treatment plant it is interesting to know what the effects of disinfection on endotoxin are in the real plant both disinfections worked well with the bacterial inactivation rates higher than 99 9 within 1 min of contact fig s2 for chlorination the endotoxin activity in water experienced a sharp rise and followed by a slow decrease fig 6 a however the inflammatory response went up slowly this could be explained by the different effects of chlorination on free endotoxin and alive bacteria the quick removing of inflammation inducing ability of the free endotoxin zhang et al 2016 counteracted the rapid toxicity elevation of the cell wall bound endotoxin from the bacteria fig 5a which slowed down the increase of inflammatory response in the first 15 min moreover the dissolved organics which can react with chlorine could also reduce the reaction rate wang et al 2017 after that the pmn in lavage decreased slowly as expected since the chlorination on both free and bound endotoxin exhibited a moderate decline in the long time treatment the effects of uv cl2 on the endotoxin activity and inflammatory response were very similar which was consistent with the results on free endotoxin fig 1 and bound endotoxin figs 4b and 5b the difference of uv cl2 compared with chlorination was that the increase and decrease of both the endotoxin activity and inflammation were relatively faster fig 6b this is reasonable because the hydroxyl radical can react with organics much faster than the chlorine both treatments could not significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability and insufficient disinfection could even increase the toxicity of the water one interesting finding from all the above results is that the lal assay can be used to estimate the toxicity removal of the reclaimed water after combined uv cl2 treatment however the discrepancy between the lal assay based endotoxin activity and immune cell based inflammatory response have been well discussed in the previous studies first the intrinsic structure diversity of lps from different bacteria strains can cause the inconsistency between endotoxin activity and inflammation ohkouchi et al 2012 the expression of endotoxic activity depends on a unique primary structure and a peculiar endotoxic conformation rietschel et al 1994 second the presence of some chelators or detergents like triton x 100 tween 20 bovine serum albumin can generate a masking effect which makes the lal assay unable to detect endotoxin or a low detection efficiency schwarz et al 2017 while the toxicity of endotoxin was unchanged the detergent in the municipal wastewater of many countries is about several mg l othman et al 2009 the removal efficiency 93 99 of anionic surfactants is usually higher than that of the nonionic surfactants 67 90 in the wastewater treatment plant with traditional activated sludge process othman et al 2009 thus the highest estimated surfactant concentration is mg l level however the masking effect was often observed at a very high concentration of the detergents like 500 mg l and usually did not affect the endotoxin toxicity schwarz et al 2017 therefore it is unlikely to have interference from the detergents in this study third the increment of endotoxin activity and reduction of endotoxin toxicity were observed simultaneously after chlorination zhang et al 2016 and ozonation ren et al 2019 which might be explained by the decrease of aggregate size the reason for the nonmonotonic changes of both endotoxin activity and toxicity might be the existence of optimal endotoxin aggregate sizes for lal assay and in vivo inflammation test and it is very likely the optimal sizes for these two tests are different all the information above cannot explained why the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability were so consistent after combined uv cl2 treatment in the reference lps pure isolates and reclaimed water one possibility is that the reaction sites of hydroxyl radical on lps are important for both tests probably on lipid a which is responsible for both the activation of the innate immune response and the factor c binding of lal system tan et al 2000 4 conclusions this work found that the combined uv cl2 treatment has better removal efficiency of endotoxin activity and toxicity compared with chlorination both chlorination and combined uv cl2 treatment cannot significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability of the reclaimed water but may increase the toxicity with insufficient treatment uv cl2 can simultaneously remove the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of free endotoxin cell wall bound

18932,disinfection processes were applied in reclaimed water plant to eliminate pathogens and control the related health risk during water reuse however extra problems might emerge such as the released free endotoxins from the ruptured cell wall of gram negative bacteria endotoxins can induce lung inflammatory responses after inhalation which has been neglected in the water quality regulation and the removal of endotoxin was not under consideration in the process of reclamation in the present study two well known disinfection processes chlorination and combined uv chlorine uv cl2 were performed to test the removal efficiency of endotoxin activity as well as the inflammation inducing ability in the pure lps solution uv cl2 treatment significantly reduced both endotoxin activity and lung inflammation responses with better oxidizability of the generated hydroxyl radical however its performance on bacteria liquid and real secondary effluent was more complicated the cell wall bound lps have lower endotoxin activities and inflammation inducing ability immediately after the cell wall was destroyed the bound lps were released to the solution to be free lps which dramatically increased both the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of the water when these free endotoxins were continuously oxidized the endotoxin activity and inflammatory response decreased again but not to the background level therefore the inflammation inducing ability of reclaimed water could not be removed efficiently these results suggest that in spite of its high oxidability uv cl2 treatment is not capable of removing the endotoxin based toxicity and other technologies are necessary to control endotoxin levels in reclaimed water graphical abstract image 1 keywords endotoxin reclaimed water chlorination uv inflammation 1 introduction wastewater reclamation is widely used around the world to cope with the scarcity of traditional water resource and at least 60 countries are practicing various types of water reuse angelakis and gikas 2014 an important step of reclamation is disinfection which is intended to eliminate the pathogens in the wastewater as much as possible the key issue derived from the prevalence of reclaimed water is the related health risk however most studies of the health risks from the application of reclaimed water considered that incidental oral ingestion is the major exposure route who 2006 this is partially reasonable but the exposure route is tightly related to the endpoint of reuse for example when the water is used for car wash garden irrigation or road clean the major route of exposure is inhalation rather than ingestion furthermore what little research on the inhalation exposure of reclaimed water there is has focused on vocs while the inhalation risk from endotoxin has been largely ignored endotoxin also known as lps lipopolysaccharide is a component of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria the endotoxin exposure events in drinking water have been reported early in 1976 some fever cases after exposure to humidifiers and in a sauna were unexplained kohler et al 1976 metzger et al 1976 pickering et al 1976 rylander et al 1978 first demonstrated that the o antigen antibodies in patients were elevated which indicated the etiologic role of the endotoxins the earliest confirmed human exposure event was the bathing fever in finland aro et al 1980 one hundred of 1000 inhabitants in tampere got symptoms such as cough chills breathing difficulties fever muscle pain and joint ache muittari et al 1980 found that the total inhaled endotoxin dose of the patients was 1 0 4 0 μg after the outbreak the previously affected individuals were challenged of contaminated tap water all of them developed a fever with coughing and breath shortness within 4 h anderson et al 2007 other occupational exposure with drinking water aerosolized facility was also reported rylander and haglind 1984 mcgregor et al 1993 the median value of endotoxin activity in reclaimed water was 422 eu ml huang et al 2013 which were comparable to contaminated drinking water however the inhalation risks of reclaimed water were not well studied yet two forms of lps are present naturally the bound endotoxin attached to the cell wall and the free endotoxin released from the cell both forms have biological activities and can induce immune responses after contact with the host despite substantial lps were maintained on the bacteria only very weak endotoxin activity can be detected xue et al 2016 the process of disinfection can break the bacterial cell wall that results in the immediate release of the endotoxin and the endotoxin activity levels in the water increases significantly rezaee et al 2008 huang et al 2011 consequently the performance of disinfection might lead to the generation of a potential risk from free endotoxin which could be considered as a novel disinfection byproduct there were many studies investigating the endotoxin activity removal capacity of various disinfection processes table s1 in brief chlorination was not very effective in synthetic lps solution and the removal rate was around 1 3 1 4 eu mlh anderson et al 2003a while in drinking water disinfection the chlorination may even increase the endotoxin activities sometimes gehr et al 2008 this endotoxin activity increase was also observed by huang et al 2011 and zhang et al 2016 in lps solutions similar to chlorination neither chloramine nor potassium permanganate treatments could effectively remove endotoxin activity anderson et al 2003a furthermore the majority of lps light absorption is lower than 225 nm so that uv254 from low vapour pressure mercury lamp could not affect lps activity very much gehr et al 2008 medium pressure mercury lamp emitting light over a broad range of wavelengths from approximately 185 to 1 400 nm could not remove endotoxin activity significantly either within the recommended uv dose 50 100 mj cm2 for drinking water anderson et al 2003b ozone had relatively better removal efficiency gehr et al 2008 but the most effective treatment is advanced oxidation with the presence of hydroxyl radical the removal efficiency of which can be up to 80 oh et al 2014 however all the mentioned studies targeted on the removal effects in pure lps synthetic solution or the clean drinking water the reclaimed water is much more complicated since it contains more bacteria and other unknown contaminates that can react with the disinfectant the removal of endotoxin activity then contains at least two steps the break of cell bound endotoxin to generate free endotoxin which may increase the endotoxin activity and the oxidation of lps which may reduce the endotoxin activity zhang et al 2016 chlorination was reported to be almost ineffective on the endotoxin removal in secondary effluent huang et al 2011 what s more in abovementioned studies only endotoxin activities were determined mostly by a standard limulus amebocyte lysate assay lal assay the removal of related toxicity was ignored the activity data obtained from the lal assay was not necessarily relevant to the degree of adverse effects caused by the endotoxins which was proved by the inconsistency between lal assay and the toxicity test such as the chicken embryo lethal dose and rabbit pyrogenicity tests takayama et al 1984 recently one report found that an increase of endotoxin activity after chlorination was along with the reduction of inflammation in lung via inhalation zhang et al 2016 these evidences imply that the determination of endotoxin activity level in water alone was not adequate to indicate the health risk that might exist after the exposure of reclaimed water whether the advanced oxidation can remove the toxicity induced by endotoxins remains unclear in the present study two typical disinfection processes chlorination and combined uv cl2 were applied to investigate their endotoxin activity removal efficiencies as well as the toxicity removal in pure lps solution typical gram negative strain solutions and whole secondary effluent the possible mechanisms were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 animals all the mice used were icr imprinting control region male mice 8 9 weeks old and purchased from the vital river company beijing china the mice were kept in the center of

of the test animals 2 2 inhalation exposure hope med 8050 dynamic inhalation system was used for the animal exposure detailed performance can be found in a previous study xue et al 2016 briefly the water sample was nebulized to form a 50 humidity increase in the chamber and the mice were exposure for 6 h 2 3 water sample preparation lps synthetic solution commercialized pure lps were purchased from sigma aldrich l2637 from e coli o55b5 the endotoxin powder was dissolved in deionized water to form the stock solution 25 μg ml the endotoxin activity of which is about 200000 eu ml the working solution was prepared by spiking the stocking solution into pyrogen free water to obtain the lps solution with endotoxin activity level about 2000eu ml the endotoxin activities were determined by a standard limulus amebocyte lysate assay xiamen houshiji ltd china following the manufacturer s instructions bacteria solution two gram negative bacteria strains enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 isolated from a secondary effluent were tested the detailed information of which was described in a previous study xue et al 2016 after 16 h of cultivation in luria bertani medium at 37 c the bacteria were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min to remove the medium and washed 3 times by ultrapure water to eliminate the free endotoxin residue finally the bacteria cells were resuspended in ultrapure water according to the desired concentrations and the exposure of animals was performed within 2 h after the solution were prepared reclaimed water sample a secondary effluent sample was collected from a sewage treatment plant in beijing on 6th aug 2015 the reason for not choosing the reclaimed water with tertiary treatment was that the water might have too low endotoxin

the acute inflammatory responses were also relatively weak about 36 5 for x4 and 7 9 for x5 fig 5a after 1 min of chlorination the endotoxin levels surged and the pmn in both bacteria exposed lung was significantly raised this first stage mainly represented the release of endotoxin from cell wall and then the inflammatory responses declined slowly in the second stage but still maintained at a high level after 1h of chlorination fig 5a in this stage the release of bound endotoxin should be much weaker and the oxidation of free endotoxin continued the chlorine s capability of removing inflammation inducing ability of the free endotoxin was consistent with the observation of zhang et al 2016 in case of combined uv cl2 treatment the inflammatory responses changed similarly as the trends of endotoxin activities for x4 the average inflammation level increased slowly and had no sign of decline fig 5b which resembled the mild and continuous increase of endotoxin activity fig 4b since the pmn was already very high the slope of inflammation increase was small in the later stage the inflammatory response of x5 was elevated immediately within 15 s after the treatment and dropped back to a relatively low level in 10 min fig 5b which also resembled the pattern of endotoxin activity fig 4b these results further demonstrate that the reactions between the cell wall bound lps and hydroxyl radical are different for the two strains the main difference between chlorination and uv cl2 treatment on these two bacteria is the consistence between the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability chlorination can cause the increment of endotoxin activity but decrease the inflammation inducing ability while uv cl2 treatment or hydroxyl radical results in consistent changing pattern of these two measurements in another words the lal assay may still be competent to estimate the toxicity removal of the combined uv cl2 treatment both of the endotoxin activity and toxicity of x4 were hardly removed by oh besides the higher cell number and possible different eps of x4 another reason might be the insufficient oh quantity the selected highest 20 mg l chlorine seems not enough to reduce the endotoxin activity and toxicity however the contact time of 10 min was estimated by uv plus 5 mg l chlorine when 20 mg l chlorine was applied the oh generation would be more continuous longer treatment or high chlorine concentration may exhibit better removal of both endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of strain x4 though it would be too costly in the real operation 3 3 the removal efficiency of two processes on actual secondary effluent sample a secondary effluent table 1 was collected to further compare the removal of endotoxin activity and toxicity by two disinfection treatments 10 mg l chlorine was applied since it was the most common used in wastewater treatment plant it is interesting to know what the effects of disinfection on endotoxin are in the real plant both disinfections worked well with the bacterial inactivation rates higher than 99 9 within 1 min of contact fig s2 for chlorination the endotoxin activity in water experienced a sharp rise and followed by a slow decrease fig 6 a however the inflammatory response went up slowly this could be explained by the different effects of chlorination on free endotoxin and alive bacteria the quick removing of inflammation inducing ability of the free endotoxin zhang et al 2016 counteracted the rapid toxicity elevation of the cell wall bound endotoxin from the bacteria fig 5a which slowed down the increase of inflammatory response in the first 15 min moreover the dissolved organics which can react with chlorine could also reduce the reaction rate wang et al 2017 after that the pmn in lavage decreased slowly as expected since the chlorination on both free and bound endotoxin exhibited a moderate decline in the long time treatment the effects of uv cl2 on the endotoxin activity and inflammatory response were very similar which was consistent with the results on free endotoxin fig 1 and bound endotoxin figs 4b and 5b the difference of uv cl2 compared with chlorination was that the increase and decrease of both the endotoxin activity and inflammation were relatively faster fig 6b this is reasonable because the hydroxyl radical can react with organics much faster than the chlorine both treatments could not significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability and insufficient disinfection could even increase the toxicity of the water one interesting finding from all the above results is that the lal assay can be used to estimate the toxicity removal of the reclaimed water after combined uv cl2 treatment however the discrepancy between the lal assay based endotoxin activity and immune cell based inflammatory response have been well discussed in the previous studies first the intrinsic structure diversity of lps from different bacteria strains can cause the inconsistency between endotoxin activity and inflammation ohkouchi et al 2012 the expression of endotoxic activity depends on a unique primary structure and a peculiar endotoxic conformation rietschel et al 1994 second the presence of some chelators or detergents like triton x 100 tween 20 bovine serum albumin can generate a masking effect which makes the lal assay unable to detect endotoxin or a low detection efficiency schwarz et al 2017 while the toxicity of endotoxin was unchanged the detergent in the municipal wastewater of many countries is about several mg l othman et al 2009 the removal efficiency 93 99 of anionic surfactants is usually higher than that of the nonionic surfactants 67 90 in the wastewater treatment plant with traditional activated sludge process othman et al 2009 thus the highest estimated surfactant concentration is mg l level however the masking effect was often observed at a very high concentration of the detergents like 500 mg l and usually did not affect the endotoxin toxicity schwarz et al 2017 therefore it is unlikely to have interference from the detergents in this study third the increment of endotoxin activity and reduction of endotoxin toxicity were observed simultaneously after chlorination zhang et al 2016 and ozonation ren et al 2019 which might be explained by the decrease of aggregate size the reason for the nonmonotonic changes of both endotoxin activity and toxicity might be the existence of optimal endotoxin aggregate sizes for lal assay and in vivo inflammation test and it is very likely the optimal sizes for these two tests are different all the information above cannot explained why the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability were so consistent after combined uv cl2 treatment in the reference lps pure isolates and reclaimed water one possibility is that the reaction sites of hydroxyl radical on lps are important for both tests probably on lipid a which is responsible for both the activation of the innate immune response and the factor c binding of lal system tan et al 2000 4 conclusions this work found that the combined uv cl2 treatment has better removal efficiency of endotoxin activity and toxicity compared with chlorination both chlorination and combined uv cl2 treatment cannot significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability of the reclaimed water but may increase the toxicity with insufficient treatment uv cl2 can simultaneously remove the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of free endotoxin cell wall bound

18933,the mechanism of removal of humic acid phosphate and kaolin particles by coagulation with alum and pacl or adsorption by their pre formed precipitates was investigated and it was found that the coagulation mechanisms for monomeric al at neutral ph and polymeric al13 at alkaline ph were very similar the removal of phosphate and humic acid by coagulation with alum or pacl did not change with stirring time between 1 min and 15 min independent of the dose and species of coagulants however for adsorption of these impurities by pre formed precipitates the results were significantly different both al3 and nano sized al13 could precipitate and form aggregates at ph 7 and ph 9 respectively and their precipitates became less active fewer binding sites on the surface of precipitate with the increase of shear time or shear rates before adsorbing pollutants thus although the total surface area increased the average size of flocs became smaller at higher applied shear rates or longer shear time the removal efficiency of humic acid and phosphate decreased also from the mw distributions it was confirmed that less humic acid was removed by the adsorption on alum precipitate pre formed with longer shear time chemical groups oh2and oh on the surface of precipitate determined the removal efficiency of phosphate and humic acid and the activity of precipitate become lower as a result of higher applied shear and longer shear time this is confirmed be due to some crystallization of the amorphous precipitate forming inactivated hydroxyl when kaolin was added 10 min after the alum or pacl precipitate formed the precipitates captured kaolin particles only on their surface whereas when alum was added to kaolin suspensions particles were trapped within the growing flocs when alum kaolin flocs were broken at high shear rate re growth of flocs decreased with increasing shear time but after a short breakage period long aging of broken flocs had little effect on floc regrowth graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation phosphate humic acid kaolin floc breakage active bonds 1 introduction some pollutants in surface water such as particles organic matter and phosphorus should be removed during water treatment to obtain clean water organic matter such as humic acid can form disinfection by products during water disinfection phosphorus is widely used in agriculture and industry but due to its role in eutrophication it is important to control the amounts of phosphorus in the water current methods for removal of phosphorus organic matter in the surface water by chemical methods can be divided into two categories namely 1 sorption by suitable adsorbents 2 chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation many materials have been used as adsorbents for removal of phosphate and organic matter in previous work such as iron oxide tailings zeng et al 2004 and aluminum oxide hydroxide tanada et al 2003 with different coagulants such as iron or aluminum salts humic acid can be removed either by complexation with the coagulant or by precipitation and adsorption dennett et al 1996 krasner and amy 1995 besides coagulation electrocoagulation process can significantly remove phosphate from aqueous solutions bektas et al 2004 vasudevan et al 2008 also alum together with polyelectrolytes as coagulant aids yielded a significant improvement in phosphate removal compared with alum alone ozacar and sengil 2003 specific chemical interactions are important in the removal of phosphate whether by chemical precipitation or sorption by suitable adsorbents surface complexation type sorption reactions are the primary fixation mechanism for phosphate by various al fe hydroxide surfaces davis and gloor 1981 rafati et al 2012 song et al 2011 remarkable sorption capacity of ferric precipitates to phosphate is due to the fact that active surface sites are more easily obtained on the ferric oxides oxyhydroxides formed in situ kralchevska et al 2016 tian et al 2018 surface complexation was the primary mechanism for phosphate removal fang et al 2017 the electrostatic attraction and inner sphere complexation between la oh 3 and p via ligand exchange were also identified as the sorption mechanisms of la oh 3 fe3o4 4 1 on phosphate wu et al 2017 during the adsorption process the ph changes significantly indicating an anion oh exchange reaction song et al 2011 several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction between nom and hydrolyzed coagulant species charge neutralization is thought to occur at low ph as suggested by stoichiometric relationships between the coagulant demand and the concentration of dissolved organic matter or destabilization upon overdosing liu et al 2009 narkis and rebhun 1977 xu et al 2011 whereas under conditions favorable to metal hydroxide precipitation physical entrapment and or adsorption of organic matter onto the freshly formed precipitate are assumed to play a major role in nom removal bose and reckhow 2007 some substance significantly decreased the aggregation of performed protein zhao et al 2015 the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation process depended on the ph and the removal rate of humic acid is higher in acidic solution patel sorrentino et al 2002 besides nom removal by coagulation can be achieved at lower mixing intensity thereby reducing energy consumption vadasarukkai and gagnon 2017 however particles incorporated within hydroxide flocs does not seem to affect the floc properties such as size and strength yu et al 2015 although the coagulation mechanisms of al3 and pacl25 al13 are different they may be similar at different ph values phosphate removal from solutions by sorption to al oh 3 is known to decrease with al oh 3 aging as the surface area of amorphous and or crystalline al oh 3 decreases over time berkowitz et al 2005 2006 with the transformation of amorphous al oh 3 to gibbsite as shown by previous research de vicente et al 2008 aged al oh 3 precipitate loses 75 of the maximum adsorption capacity for phosphate and repeated dosing of smaller al aliquots may be more efficient than adding a single high dose to remove phosphate changes in aluminum hydroxide during ageing probably through the process of crystallization need to be investigated for further exploration of the removal mechanism of organic matter and phosphate as the floc is consisted of thousands of precipitated nanoscale particles yu et al 2018 the coagulation efficiency is determined by the aggregation process between precipitated nanoparticles the stability of colloid may be attributed to the different surface charge and concentration of natural organic matter nom jung et al 2018 nano cu was generally unstable except in waters with high organic content also nom inhibited the aggregation of bare agnps yin et al 2015 the aggregation and dispersion of agnps was highly dependent on the mw of m f nom yin et al 2015 large polymers are typically used to prove nanoparticle aggregation jones et al 2016 compared to bicarbonate phosphate has a net stabilizing effect on oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles li et al 2016 or nano cuo conway et al 2015 which can be attributed to surface based functional adsorption or reversed surface charge polarity until now the effects of changes on the surface of precipitate on coagulation efficiency aggregation and adsorption of pollutants such as ha phosphate and particulate matter have not been fully explored therefore the removal mechanism of phosphate and humic acid through coagulation or adsorption by alum or pacl precipitate was investigated in this paper focusing on the variation of the surface of precipitate the surface activity of the formed precipitate after different shear times and different applied shear force was explored although there may be several factors which regulate the binding of polar organic compounds and phosphate to the oxide surface the present work will focus on the influence of coagulant species applied shear and ph on the adsorption behavior of dissolved organic matter phosphate and clay particles to explore the chemical interactions of alum pacl precipitate with ha and phosphate as well as the coagulation behavior of alum and pacl precipitate 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 synthetic raw water and coagulant

alkali titration method at room temperature yu et al 2011 with a final oh al ratio 2 5 this sample is designated pacl25 the sample after aging for one week was analyzed using the ferron method as described before yu et al 2011 and shown to contain more than 90 al13 stock phosphorus phosphate was prepared at a concentration of 500 mg l calculated as p in di water with sodium dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate nah2po4 2h2o five grams of humic acid sodium salt ha aldrich cat h1 675 2 was dissolved in deionized di water with ph adjusted to 7 and mixed by a magnetic stirrer for 24 h the solution was diluted to 1 l in a measuring flask and stored in the dark kaolin powder was purchased from aldrich company usa and all the other reagents used in this study were analytical grade 2 2 jar test jar test equipment was a flocculator zr4 2 shenzhen zhongrun china which enabled mixing rates and times to be preset for the flocculation tests the stock phosphorus humic acid or kaolin was diluted in di water 1000 ml with 5 mm nahco3 in a 1 2 l beaker to give test solution with a phosphorus concentration of 0 5 mg l 5 mg l for humic acid or 50 mg l kaolin firstly the stirrer was set at 200 rpm corresponding to a shear rate of around 184 s 1 and a certain dose of alum was added the rapid mix rate of 200 rpm was maintained for 1 min and then reduced to 50 rpm 23 s 1 for 10 min or more to allow floc growth to occur for the adsorption experiments with alum or pacl25 precipitate the di water with 5 mm nahco3 was mixed with 0 1 mm alum pacl25 fixed at the desired ph stirring at 100 rpm or 400 rpm for 0 min 1 min 2 min 5 min 10 min and 15 min then phosphate 0 5 mg l as p or humic acid 5 mg l or kaolin 50 mg l with same ph was added followed by 50 rpm for 10 min and then the residual phosphorus and humic acid was measured during the jar tests the ph of final solution was maintained at 7 0 alum or 9 0 pacl25 by prior addition of a predetermined amount of 0 1 m hcl or naoh the temperature was maintained at 25 1 c for the crystallization test alum precipitate was prepared at a concentration of 0 01 m with naoh to make the ph near 7 four samples precipitates were mixed rapidly at a speed of 600 rpm for 1min and stirred for 0 h 2 h 24 h at the same speed respectively and the fourth was settled for 24 h without further stirring after stirring and sedimentation samples of the four precipitates were taken by the hollow glass tubes transferred to filter papers air dried for 5 h coated by gold and imaged by scanning electron microscopy sem some of the precipitates were filtered by flat sheet pvdf mf membrane with pore size of 0 45 μm these samples after freeze drying were analyzed by thermo gravimetric differential scanning calorimeter tg dsc sta449c netzsch germany x ray diffraction analyzer and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir 2 3 measurements of floc and water quality a laser diffraction instrument malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern united kingdom and a pda 3000 rank brothers ltd uk were used to measure the floc size or relative floc size dynamically as the coagulation flocculation process proceeded in the jar test details are given in our

japan characterization was used to determine the structure of the flocs precipitates 3 results 3 1 zeta potential and coagulation kinetics the variations of zeta potential of alum and pacl25 flocs precipitates with changing ph are presented in figure s1 a generally the surface charge of oxides is ph dependent changing from positive to negative with increasing ph for alum the zeta potential increased as the ph increased from 3 to 6 and then decreased becoming negative above ph 8 it has been shown that polymeric al species gradually increase and formed unstable al13 or even al30 at ph near 5 5 zhao et al 2009 which induces higher zeta potential while with the increase of ph value the unstable al13 or even al30 decomposed and formed more oh on it resulting in a significant decrease of zeta potential zeta potential of pacl25 pre formed al13 7 maintained at about 25 mv when the ph increased from 3 to 6 the stable al13 7 did not release h and then decreased as ph increased further as a consequence of the deprotonation of al13 7 to less positive species such as al13 5 al13 3 and al13 when the ph was elevated furrer et al 1992 zeta potential of phosphate 0 5 mg l coagulated over a range of alum and pacl25 concentrations at a final ph of 7 and 9 respectively was explored figure s1b it is shown that the alum phosphate flocs are negatively charged at low alum dose and that charge reversal occurs at around 0 2 mm al at higher dose the zeta potential increases slightly zeta potentials for pacl25 phosphate flocs at ph 9 are slightly lower than that of alum with same dose and it increased as the dose of pacl25 increased 3 2 effect of mixing conditions on the removal of humic acid and phosphate the addition of alum and pacl25 to water containing phosphate and humic acid can reduce the concentrations of these pollutants during floc formation in this work the effects of coagulant dose and flocculation time on the removal of organic matter and phosphate were investigated through coagulation and adsorption on pre formed precipitate in the experiments on phosphate removal the doses of alum and pacl25 here were in the range of 0 0 3 mm fig 1 a and the removal efficiencies increased with coagulant addition to the maximum 95 the removal efficiency of phosphate was significantly higher for alum than for pacl25 under low dose conditions a higher dose was needed for pacl25 0 3 mm compared with alum 0 15 mm to achieve the highest phosphate removal efficiency 95 from the zeta potential results figure s1b it is unlikely that the lower removal efficiency of phosphate by pacl25 was determined by the charge of the coagulant charge neutralization but probably by the numbers and species of chemical groups on the surface of the coagulant precipitate the removal efficiency of phosphate by coagulation with alum or pacl25 did not change as the flocculation time increased from 1 min to 15 min fig 1b independent on the doses and species of coagulants although the precipitate formed with different al coagulants can adsorb phosphate the mechanism has not yet been fully explored the removal of phosphate by pre formed precipitates of alum and pacl25 0 05 mm at different stirring rates and times at ph 7 and ph 9 are shown in fig 1c and d for alum precipitate the removal of phosphate decreased significantly with increase of stirring time during the formation of alum precipitate before the phosphate was added 15 min of stirring of the precipitate reduced the removal of phosphate by 10 15 independent of the stirring rate 100 rpm or 400 rpm also the removal efficiency of phosphate is lower at 400 rpm than that at 100 rpm at 0 05 mm alum when the stirring time for the precipitate was less than 15 min these results suggest that the number of active binding sites on the precipitate surface decreased significantly at higher shear rate 400 rpm especially at the early stage such as in the first minute it is well known that during the coagulation process stirring causes breakage and partial re formation of flocs which is probably the reason for the decrease in the removal of phosphate removal therefore although the size of flocs became smaller at higher applied shear or longer shear time fig 1e and f and the surface area would increase the adsorption capacity of flocs decreases comparing with alum the phosphate removal by pacl25 was slightly different fig 1d there was less effect on the difference of phosphate removal by the stirring rate between 100 rpm and 400 rpm and at the same time the removal efficiency of phosphate decreased with the increase of stirring time of precipitate before adsorption but only slightly the smaller decrease of active sites on the surface of pacl25 precipitate in high stirring rate and long stirring time is probably related to the smaller surface concentration of active sites on the surface of pacl25 precipitate the removal efficiency of humic acid by the precipitates with different stirring rates and time before adsorption was also compared fig 2 it is shown that the removal efficiency of humic acid decreased significantly as the stirring time of alum precipitate increased fig 2a removal efficiency was reduced more than 15 in 15 s and then gradually decreased in the next 20 min the result further confirmed that the number of active sites on the precipitate surface decreased as the shear time increased before adsorbing ha compared with 100 rpm the removal efficiency of ha by alum precipitate at 400 rpm was much lower at the same shear time the size of hydroxide precipitate formed at 100 rpm was nearly 5 times higher than that formed at 400 rpm fig 1e while the removal efficiency of humic acid was 5 lower at 400 rpm fig 2b also for the precipitate of pacl25 the removal efficiency of humic acid at ph 9 with different stirring times before the addition of ha was very similar to that of alum at ph 7 as shown in figure s1a the zeta potential of pacl25 precipitate was nearly zero at ph 9 so that aggregates could form and humic acid could be adsorbed in much the same way as with alum at ph 7 therefore the mechanisms of these two coagulants reacting with humic acid are probably similar when both species of precipitates formed before adsorbing humic acid it seemed that freshly precipitated hydroxide was able to adsorb or remove more humic acid than precipitates which were sheared especially for higher shear rate and longer time while in the coagulation process very small precipitates can be formed in less than 1 s amirtharajah and mills 1982 rapidly adsorbing humic acid and aggregating into flocs like phosphate due to high shear rates or long shear time although the total surface area of alum pacl25 precipitate increased the precipitates with fewer active surface groups adsorbed less humic acid given that results for alum at ph 7 and pacl25 at 9 are very similar the chemical surface of pacl25precipitateat around ph 9 is probably similar to that of alum at ph 7 but with fewer active surface sites the results of molecular weight distribution further confirmed that coagulation could remove most organic matter ha while the removal efficiency of ha by the pre formed precipitate before adding ha significantly decreased with longer shear time fig 2c also the removal of humic acid by alum was compared and it was found that flocculation time does not change the removal efficiency of humic acid except for about the first minute which is probably the time required for complete ha adsorption 3 3 mechanism of alum crystallization process to further investigate the differences of preformed alum precipitates caused by stirring the precipitates of alum formed with different stirring times were examined fig 3 the differences of sem figures between precipitates samples stirred settled with different time were significant fig 3a d the state of precipitates samples settled for 24 h s24h and without stirring m0h have the structure of aggregated nanoparticles fig 3a and b there were differences between these two samples since the size of the nanoparticles of m0h was greater than that of the s24h as aged flocs may have undergone some crystallization although it still appears to be amorphous in comparison precipitates stirred for 2 h m2h or 24 h m24h hours showed some degree of crystallization fig 3c and d losing the nanoparticles structure the tga results gave further support for crystallization process for the four kinds of precipitates these had significantly different dehydration behavior with the increase of temperature fig 3e m2h and m24h showed obvious dehydration process at 250 c to 300 c and m24h dehydration was more pronounced mass fell by 22 besides the peak for m2h at 265 c and the peak for m24 h at about 280 c in the dtg pattern fig 3f were evident which further showed the difference of the structure of aged precipitate and these were the consequences of crystallization by contrast m0h showed no sharp fall in mass at temperature near 275 c but dehydrated gradually with the increase of temperature from 50 c to 250 c showing that there was no evident crystallization amorphous structure strekopytov and exley 2006 however a small peak for s24h appeared in the dtg pattern around 250 c suggesting that this sample began to crystallize the xrd patterns confirmed the above conclusions fig 3g it can be seen that the patterns for m2h and m24h corresponded to the peak distribution diagram of boehmite bai et al 2014 and m24h seems to be a little more significant the peak for s24 h at the corresponding position appeared and was not intense which was consistent with the previous conclusion proving that aluminum hydroxide was in the process of crystallization during ageing as shown by the tga result m0h has no peak at all consistent with the amorphous structure of newly formed precipitate ftir results further confirmed the above results there were four peaks near 3500 cm 1 3431 cm 1 3457 cm 1 3546 cm 1 3654 cm 1 on the spectrogram of m2h and m24h corresponding to oh stretching vibration ingramjones et al 1996 while m0h and s24h had only large smooth peaks which were probably the result of overlapping peaks of many different hydroxyl functional groups it is assumed that crystallization of alum precipitate is a process of dehydration the active hydroxyl groups dehydrated and new kind of hydroxyl like groups were formed giving peaks in the ftir spectra near 1000 cm 1 the two peaks of m2h and m24h corresponded to the bending vibration of aloh liu et al 2017 while s24h had the corresponding peaks at 1060 cm 1 the peaks at 713 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching modes of alo6 gao et al 2012 it is assumed that the crystallization process caused by ageing was different from that caused by mixing it can be seen that with the increase of mixing time the strength of peaks increased probably because the aloal bond formed after hydroxyl group reacted as a result of dehydration which increased the number of alo bonds 3 4 characteristics of alum and pacl25 precipitate flocs formation with kaolin by alum or pacl25 with different addition strategies at ph 7 or ph 9 respectively was continuously monitored fig 4 a and b when monomeric al alum was added together with kaolin at ph 7 some al oh2 6 n oh n 3 n species adsorbed on the surface of kaolin particles directly while the remainder or their micro aggregates precipitated nanoparticles connected to the al oh2 6 n oh n 3 n absorbed on the surface of kaolin causing the surface of kaolin to be fully covered with alum precipitates nanoparticles duan and gregory 2003 then the flocculation process started a rapid rise in flocculation index fi value related to floc size occurred and the fi value reached a plateau within minutes fig 4a in this case the kaolin particles are uniformly distributed throughout the flocs fig 4c this gives the flocs a relatively high light scattering coefficient and hence a high fi value yu et al 2015 in the process of adding kaolin 10 min after alum precipitated formed the fi value changed only slightly in the process of alum precipitation before kaolin was added but the aggregation occurred in this process after kaolin particles were added the fi value increased slowly and the plateau fi value was considerably lower in comparison with that when kaolin and alum were added together fig 4a this does not mean that the flocs were smaller in the case of delayed kaolin addition but that the kaolin particles are mainly attached to the surface of the formed hydroxide floc giving a low scattering coefficient and hence a low fi value gregory 2009 this concept is confirmed by the images of flocs shown in fig 4c and d it is clear that flocs are of similar size in both cases very similar behavior was found for flocculation of kaolin by pacl25 fig 4b e and 4f from these results it can be seen that the coagulation mechanism of monomeric al at ph 7 was quite similar to that of polymeric al13 at ph 9 3 5 floc breakage and re growth in order to further investigate the reason for the decreased activity of precipitates by stirring the formed flocs were exposed to high stirring speed 200 rpm with different duration 1 or 10 min and re growth at 50 rpm in some cases the flocs were stirred at high rate for 1 min and were kept for 9 min or 24 h prior to the regrowth at 50 rpm fig 5 after fi value was stabilized the stirring rate increased from 50 to 200 rpm this resulted in immediate and rapid reduction of fi indicating significant floc breakage when the stirring rate was returned to 50 rpm the flocs began to re grow but the fi value was only partially restored for the flocs with 10 min breakage fi value dropped rapidly and then gradually decreased the re grown flocs showed a noticeably lower fi value than in the case of the short breakage time when the stirring rate was restored to 50 rpm yu et al 2011 to investigate whether precipitation aging or rapid stirring led to a decline in regrowth capacity flocs after 1 min breakage and 9 min of stabilization without stirring were stirred at 50 rpm in this case the fi value recovered to the same value as the case with 1 min breakage time indicating that aging in static state will not further lose the regrowth potential of flocs even after 24 h aging of settled flocs followed by stirring at 50 rpm it was found that the fi recovered to the same value as the sample with 1 min breakage thus it seems that some binding groups on the floc surface with other flocs are lost by high speed stirring rather than by long term aging in a static state at least for 24 h in order to further explore the decrease of activity of precipitate surface in the high applied shear process ph value of alum precipitate suspension was continuously measured with different initial ph values fig 5b the ph value of all al3 precipitates with initial ph from 6 to 8 decreased over time which meant that oh in the solution would be adsorbed on the precipitate surface during the stirring process as there are only two types of chemical groups oh2 and oh on the surface of precipitate oh2 is probably replaced by oh from the solution during the stirring process causing lower activity fig 5c shows the effect of ph on floc regrowth after breakage in this case an experiment like that of fig 5a was carried out with alum kaolin flocs grown at 50 rpm and ph 7 then broken for 1 min at 200 rpm and finally regrown at 50 rpm however during the breakage phase the ph was reduced to 5 and this gave a significant improvement in the extent of regrowth 4 mechanism a fast destabilization process within 1 s for coagulant occurs after the hydrolyzed coagulant is added to aqueous suspensions at around neutral ph amirtharajah and mills 1982 the newly formed precipitate nanoparticles bind together and eventually aggregate to form amorphous flocs which grow to a limiting size under given shear conditions the size of precipitate flocs may decrease slightly as the flocculation time increases because of some floc breakage also the size of precipitate flocs decreased with the increase of applied shear for both conditions although the total surface area of precipitates increased as their average size decreased the removal efficiency of humic acid phosphate declined previous research also found that smaller dosing of al aliquots with more frequent addition may be more efficient than adding a single large dose to remove po4 3 by previous researcher de vicente et al 2008 and the mechanism has not been explored yet however from this work the surface of precipitates flocs probably became less active as the shear rate and time increased which meant that the chemical groups on the precipitate surface became less able to bind humic acid and phosphate while for pacl25 each al octahedron on al13 exposes one water molecule to the solution that can deprotonate at ph 6 phillips et al 2000 and giving less positive species such as al13 5 al13 3 and al13 when the ph was raised furrer et al 1992 the decrease of its zeta potential to near 0 mv at ph 9 means that al13 could aggregate and form large precipitates therefore the coagulation mechanism of pacl25 at ph 9 is very similar to that of alum at ph 7 the forms of phosphate at ph between 5 and 9 are h2po4 and hpo4 2 the surface of precipitate particles have water and hydroxyl groups in the inner coordination spheres of the metal ions rustad and casey 2006 these types of group can form hydrogen bonds giving oh oh2 bridges between al iii or al13 sites and release water to give μ oh bonds fig 6 1 al μh3o2 al al μoh al h2o if these bonds play a part in the aggregation of precipitate particles it may be that after breakage they do not readily re form and that there is some loss of active binding sites at the ph value of fig 5b the number of oh2 groups on the precipitate surface decreased during the coagulation and breakage process being replaced by oh fig 6b forming a more crystalline precipitate this process probably caused lower removal efficiency of phosphate and humic acid by the adsorption on precipitate qualls et al 2009 hypothesize that phosphate could be adsorbed to the terminal hydroxyl groups on a polynuclear fe or al colloid effectively blocking the adsorption sites while in our work it seems that phosphate was adsorbed on a polynuclear al colloid by removing oh2 groups like the reaction of formula 2 the reaction process was not probably through hydrogen bonds between aloh and hop or op but by aloh2 and hop 2 aloh2 ohp al μh3o2 p al μoh p h2o at low ph the dominant chemical groups on the surface of aluminum oxide hydroxide should be oh2 which is more active towards phosphate as ph increased oh increased and oh2 decreased and lower removal of phosphate as ph increased indicates that oh2 was more active than oh for pacl25 the chemical groups on its precipitate surface are the same as that of alum precipitate except the number of active groups was less than for alum as shown by the different removal efficiency for phosphate therefore considering the active groups on alum and pacl25 precipitates gives a better understanding of the removal of humic acid and phosphate by these coagulants 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this work are 1 the coagulation mechanisms for monomeric al at neutral ph and polymeric al13 at alkaline ph were found to be very similar and both precipitates could aggregate into micro flocs or flocs precipitate for kaolin particles also the removal efficiency of phosphate or humic acid by coagulating with alum or pacl25 did not change with time between 1 min and 15 min 2 the removal of humic acid and phosphate by the adsorption on al precipitates at higher applied shear was 5 10 lower than that at lower applied shear which meant that higher applied shear decreases the activity of precipitate surface and reduces their adsorption or complexation the crystallization of the precipitate during stirring would limit the access of humic acid and phosphate into the pores and hence reduce the adsorption 3 in the process of crystallization during ageing alum precipitate is still amorphous in 24 h the precipitate after stirring for 2 h or 24 h showed the peak distribution of boehmite in xrd diagram and this further confirmed significant crystallization process during stirring the surface oh2 groups on al3 or al13 precipitates were replaced by the oh groups during stirring giving lower activity of the precipitate surface and hence less adsorption of humic acid and phosphate conflicts of interest the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgements this work was supported by national natural

18933,the mechanism of removal of humic acid phosphate and kaolin particles by coagulation with alum and pacl or adsorption by their pre formed precipitates was investigated and it was found that the coagulation mechanisms for monomeric al at neutral ph and polymeric al13 at alkaline ph were very similar the removal of phosphate and humic acid by coagulation with alum or pacl did not change with stirring time between 1 min and 15 min independent of the dose and species of coagulants however for adsorption of these impurities by pre formed precipitates the results were significantly different both al3 and nano sized al13 could precipitate and form aggregates at ph 7 and ph 9 respectively and their precipitates became less active fewer binding sites on the surface of precipitate with the increase of shear time or shear rates before adsorbing pollutants thus although the total surface area increased the average size of flocs became smaller at higher applied shear rates or longer shear time the removal efficiency of humic acid and phosphate decreased also from the mw distributions it was confirmed that less humic acid was removed by the adsorption on alum precipitate pre formed with longer shear time chemical groups oh2and oh on the surface of precipitate determined the removal efficiency of phosphate and humic acid and the activity of precipitate become lower as a result of higher applied shear and longer shear time this is confirmed be due to some crystallization of the amorphous precipitate forming inactivated hydroxyl when kaolin was added 10 min after the alum or pacl precipitate formed the precipitates captured kaolin particles only on their surface whereas when alum was added to kaolin suspensions particles were trapped within the growing flocs when alum kaolin flocs were broken at high shear rate re growth of flocs decreased with increasing shear time but after a short breakage period long aging of broken flocs had little effect on floc regrowth graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation phosphate humic acid kaolin floc breakage active bonds 1 introduction some pollutants in surface water such as particles organic matter and phosphorus should be removed during water treatment to obtain clean water organic matter such as humic acid can form disinfection by products during water disinfection phosphorus is widely used in agriculture and industry but due to its role in eutrophication it is important to control the amounts of phosphorus in the water current methods for removal of phosphorus organic matter in the surface water by chemical methods can be divided into two categories namely 1 sorption by suitable adsorbents 2 chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation many materials have been used as adsorbents for removal of phosphate and organic matter in previous work such as iron oxide tailings zeng et al 2004 and aluminum oxide hydroxide tanada et al 2003 with different coagulants such as iron or aluminum salts humic acid can be removed either by complexation with the coagulant or by precipitation and adsorption dennett et al 1996 krasner and amy 1995 besides coagulation electrocoagulation process can significantly remove phosphate from aqueous solutions bektas et al 2004 vasudevan et al 2008 also alum together with polyelectrolytes as coagulant aids yielded a significant improvement in phosphate removal compared with alum alone ozacar and sengil 2003 specific chemical interactions are important in the removal of phosphate whether by chemical precipitation or sorption by suitable adsorbents surface complexation type sorption reactions are the primary fixation mechanism for phosphate by various al fe hydroxide surfaces davis and gloor 1981 rafati et al 2012 song et al 2011 remarkable sorption capacity of ferric precipitates to phosphate is due to the fact that active surface sites are more easily obtained on the ferric oxides oxyhydroxides formed in situ kralchevska et al 2016 tian et al 2018 surface complexation was the primary mechanism for phosphate removal fang et al 2017 the electrostatic attraction and inner sphere complexation between la oh 3 and p via ligand exchange were also identified as the sorption mechanisms of la oh 3 fe3o4 4 1 on phosphate wu et al 2017 during the adsorption process the ph changes significantly indicating an anion oh exchange reaction song et al 2011 several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction between nom and hydrolyzed coagulant species charge neutralization is thought to occur at low ph as suggested by stoichiometric relationships between the coagulant demand and the concentration of dissolved organic matter or destabilization upon overdosing liu et al 2009 narkis and rebhun 1977 xu et al 2011 whereas under conditions favorable to metal hydroxide precipitation physical entrapment and or adsorption of organic matter onto the freshly formed precipitate are assumed to play a major role in nom removal bose and reckhow 2007 some substance significantly decreased the aggregation of performed protein zhao et al 2015 the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation process depended on the ph and the removal rate of humic acid is higher in acidic solution patel sorrentino et al 2002 besides nom removal by coagulation can be achieved at lower mixing intensity thereby reducing energy consumption vadasarukkai and gagnon 2017 however particles incorporated within hydroxide flocs does not seem to affect the floc properties such as size and strength yu et al 2015 although the coagulation mechanisms of al3 and pacl25 al13 are different they may be similar at different ph values phosphate removal from solutions by sorption to al oh 3 is known to decrease with al oh 3 aging as the surface area of amorphous and or crystalline al oh 3 decreases over time berkowitz et al 2005 2006 with the transformation of amorphous al oh 3 to gibbsite as shown by previous research de vicente et al 2008 aged al oh 3 precipitate loses 75 of the maximum adsorption capacity for phosphate and repeated dosing of smaller al aliquots may be more efficient than adding a single high dose to remove phosphate changes in aluminum hydroxide during ageing probably through the process of crystallization need to be investigated for further exploration of the removal mechanism of organic matter and phosphate as the floc is consisted of thousands of precipitated nanoscale particles yu et al 2018 the coagulation efficiency is determined by the aggregation process between precipitated nanoparticles the stability of colloid may be attributed to the different surface charge and concentration of natural organic matter nom jung et al 2018 nano cu was generally unstable except in waters with high organic content also nom inhibited the aggregation of bare agnps yin et al 2015 the aggregation and dispersion of agnps was highly dependent on the mw of m f nom yin et al 2015 large polymers are typically used to prove nanoparticle aggregation jones et al 2016 compared to bicarbonate phosphate has a net stabilizing effect on oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles li et al 2016 or nano cuo conway et al 2015 which can be attributed to surface based functional adsorption or reversed surface charge polarity until now the effects of changes on the surface of precipitate on coagulation efficiency aggregation and adsorption of pollutants such as ha phosphate and particulate matter have not been fully explored therefore the removal mechanism of phosphate and humic acid through coagulation or adsorption by alum or pacl precipitate was investigated in this paper focusing on the variation of the surface of precipitate the surface activity of the formed precipitate after different shear times and different applied shear force was explored although there may be several factors which regulate the binding of polar organic compounds and phosphate to the oxide surface the present work will focus on the influence of coagulant species applied shear and ph on the adsorption behavior of dissolved organic matter phosphate and clay particles to explore the chemical interactions of alum pacl precipitate with ha and phosphate as well as the coagulation behavior of alum and pacl precipitate 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 synthetic raw water and coagulant

diluted in di water 1000 ml with 5 mm nahco3 in a 1 2 l beaker to give test solution with a phosphorus concentration of 0 5 mg l 5 mg l for humic acid or 50 mg l kaolin firstly the stirrer was set at 200 rpm corresponding to a shear rate of around 184 s 1 and a certain dose of alum was added the rapid mix rate of 200 rpm was maintained for 1 min and then reduced to 50 rpm 23 s 1 for 10 min or more to allow floc growth to occur for the adsorption experiments with alum or pacl25 precipitate the di water with 5 mm nahco3 was mixed with 0 1 mm alum pacl25 fixed at the desired ph stirring at 100 rpm

japan characterization was used to determine the structure of the flocs precipitates 3 results 3 1 zeta potential and coagulation kinetics the variations of zeta potential of alum and pacl25 flocs precipitates with changing ph are presented in figure s1 a generally the surface charge of oxides is ph dependent changing from positive to negative with increasing ph for alum the zeta potential increased as the ph increased from 3 to 6 and then decreased becoming negative above ph 8 it has been shown that polymeric al species gradually increase and formed unstable al13 or even al30 at ph near 5 5 zhao et al 2009 which induces higher zeta potential while with the increase of ph value the unstable al13 or even al30 decomposed and formed more oh on it resulting in a significant decrease of zeta potential zeta potential of pacl25 pre formed al13 7 maintained at about 25 mv when the ph increased from 3 to 6 the stable al13 7 did not release h and then decreased as ph increased further as a consequence of the deprotonation of al13 7 to less positive species such as al13 5 al13 3 and al13 when the ph was elevated furrer et al 1992 zeta potential of phosphate 0 5 mg l coagulated over a range of alum and pacl25 concentrations at a final ph of 7 and 9 respectively was explored figure s1b it is shown that the alum phosphate flocs are negatively charged at low alum dose and that charge reversal occurs at around 0 2 mm al at higher dose the zeta potential increases slightly zeta potentials for pacl25 phosphate flocs at ph 9 are slightly lower than that of alum with same dose and it increased as the dose of pacl25 increased 3 2 effect of mixing conditions on the removal of humic acid and phosphate the addition of alum and pacl25 to water containing phosphate and humic acid can reduce the concentrations of these pollutants during floc formation in this work the effects of coagulant dose and flocculation time on the removal of organic matter and phosphate were investigated through coagulation and adsorption on pre formed precipitate in the experiments on phosphate removal the doses of alum and pacl25 here were in the range of 0 0 3 mm fig 1 a and the removal efficiencies increased with coagulant addition to the maximum 95 the removal efficiency of phosphate was significantly higher for alum than for pacl25 under low dose conditions a higher dose was needed for pacl25 0 3 mm compared with alum 0 15 mm to achieve the highest phosphate removal efficiency 95 from the zeta potential results figure s1b it is unlikely that the lower removal efficiency of phosphate by pacl25 was determined by the charge of the coagulant charge neutralization but probably by the numbers and species of chemical groups on the surface of the coagulant precipitate the removal efficiency of phosphate by coagulation with alum or pacl25 did not change as the flocculation time increased from 1 min to 15 min fig 1b independent on the doses and species of coagulants although the precipitate formed with different al coagulants can adsorb phosphate the mechanism has not yet been fully explored the removal of phosphate by pre formed precipitates of alum and pacl25 0 05 mm at different stirring rates and times at ph 7 and ph 9 are shown in fig 1c and d for alum precipitate the removal of phosphate decreased significantly with increase of stirring time during the formation of alum precipitate before the phosphate was added 15 min of stirring of the precipitate reduced the removal of phosphate by 10 15 independent of the stirring rate 100 rpm or 400 rpm also the removal efficiency of phosphate is lower at 400 rpm than that at 100 rpm at 0 05 mm alum when the stirring time for the precipitate was less than 15 min these results suggest that the number of active binding sites on the precipitate surface decreased significantly at higher shear rate 400 rpm especially at the early stage such as in the first minute it is well known that during the coagulation process stirring causes breakage and partial re formation of flocs which is probably the reason for the decrease in the removal of phosphate removal therefore although the size of flocs became smaller at higher applied shear or longer shear time fig 1e and f and the surface area would increase the adsorption capacity of flocs decreases comparing with alum the phosphate removal by pacl25 was slightly different fig 1d there was less effect on the difference of phosphate removal by the stirring rate between 100 rpm and 400 rpm and at the same time the removal efficiency of phosphate decreased with the increase of stirring time of precipitate before adsorption but only slightly the smaller decrease of active sites on the surface of pacl25 precipitate in high stirring rate and long stirring time is probably related to the smaller surface concentration of active sites on the surface of pacl25 precipitate the removal efficiency of humic acid by the precipitates with different stirring rates and time before adsorption was also compared fig 2 it is shown that the removal efficiency of humic acid decreased significantly as the stirring time of alum precipitate increased fig 2a removal efficiency was reduced more than 15 in 15 s and then gradually decreased in the next 20 min the result further confirmed that the number of active sites on the precipitate surface decreased as the shear time increased before adsorbing ha compared with 100 rpm the removal efficiency of ha by alum precipitate at 400 rpm was much lower at the same shear time the size of hydroxide precipitate formed at 100 rpm was nearly 5 times higher than that formed at 400 rpm fig 1e while the removal efficiency of humic acid was 5 lower at 400 rpm fig 2b also for the precipitate of pacl25 the removal efficiency of humic acid at ph 9 with different stirring times before the addition of ha was very similar to that of alum at ph 7 as shown in figure s1a the zeta potential of pacl25 precipitate was nearly zero at ph 9 so that aggregates could form and humic acid could be adsorbed in much the same way as with alum at ph 7 therefore the mechanisms of these two coagulants reacting with humic acid are probably similar when both species of precipitates formed before adsorbing humic acid it seemed that freshly precipitated hydroxide was able to adsorb or remove more humic acid than precipitates which were sheared especially for higher shear rate and longer time while in the coagulation process very small precipitates can be formed in less than 1 s amirtharajah and mills 1982 rapidly adsorbing humic acid and aggregating into flocs like phosphate due to high shear rates or long shear time although the total surface area of alum pacl25 precipitate increased the precipitates with fewer active surface groups adsorbed less humic acid given that results for alum at ph 7 and pacl25 at 9 are very similar the chemical surface of pacl25precipitateat around ph 9 is probably similar to that of alum at ph 7 but with fewer active surface sites the results of molecular weight distribution further confirmed that coagulation could remove most organic matter ha while the removal efficiency of ha by the pre formed precipitate before adding ha significantly decreased with longer shear time fig 2c also the removal of humic acid by alum was compared and it was found that flocculation time does not change the removal efficiency of humic acid except for about the first minute which is probably the time required for complete ha adsorption 3 3 mechanism of alum crystallization process to further investigate the differences of preformed alum precipitates caused by stirring the precipitates of alum formed with different stirring times were examined fig 3 the differences of sem figures between precipitates samples stirred settled with different time were significant fig 3a d the state of precipitates samples settled for 24 h s24h and without stirring m0h have the structure of aggregated nanoparticles fig 3a and b there were differences between these two samples since the size of the nanoparticles of m0h was greater than that of the s24h as aged flocs may have undergone some crystallization although it still appears to be amorphous in comparison precipitates stirred for 2 h m2h or 24 h m24h hours showed some degree of crystallization fig 3c and d losing the nanoparticles structure the tga results gave further support for crystallization process for the four kinds of precipitates these had significantly different dehydration behavior with the increase of temperature fig 3e m2h and m24h showed obvious dehydration process at 250 c to 300 c and m24h dehydration was more pronounced mass fell by 22 besides the peak for m2h at 265 c and the peak for m24 h at about 280 c in the dtg pattern fig 3f were evident which further showed the difference of the structure of aged precipitate and these were the consequences of crystallization by contrast m0h showed no sharp fall in mass at temperature near 275 c but dehydrated gradually with the increase of temperature from 50 c to 250 c showing that there was no evident crystallization amorphous structure strekopytov and exley 2006 however a small peak for s24h appeared in the dtg pattern around 250 c suggesting that this sample began to crystallize the xrd patterns confirmed the above conclusions fig 3g it can be seen that the patterns for m2h and m24h corresponded to the peak distribution diagram of boehmite bai et al 2014 and m24h seems to be a little more significant the peak for s24 h at the corresponding position appeared and was not intense which was consistent with the previous conclusion proving that aluminum hydroxide was in the process of crystallization during ageing as shown by the tga result m0h has no peak at all consistent with the amorphous structure of newly formed precipitate ftir results further confirmed the above results there were four peaks near 3500 cm 1 3431 cm 1 3457 cm 1 3546 cm 1 3654 cm 1 on the spectrogram of m2h and m24h corresponding to oh stretching vibration ingramjones et al 1996 while m0h and s24h had only large smooth peaks which were probably the result of overlapping peaks of many different hydroxyl functional groups it is assumed that crystallization of alum precipitate is a process of dehydration the active hydroxyl groups dehydrated and new kind of hydroxyl like groups were formed giving peaks in the ftir spectra near 1000 cm 1 the two peaks of m2h and m24h corresponded to the bending vibration of aloh liu et al 2017 while s24h had the corresponding peaks at 1060 cm 1 the peaks at 713 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching modes of alo6 gao et al 2012 it is assumed that the crystallization process caused by ageing was different from that caused by mixing it can be seen that with the increase of mixing time the strength of peaks increased probably because the aloal bond formed after hydroxyl group reacted as a result of dehydration which increased the number of alo bonds 3 4 characteristics of alum and pacl25 precipitate flocs formation with kaolin by alum or pacl25 with different addition strategies at ph 7 or ph 9 respectively was continuously monitored fig 4 a and b when monomeric al alum was added together with kaolin at ph 7 some al oh2 6 n oh n 3 n species adsorbed on the surface of kaolin particles directly while the remainder or their micro aggregates precipitated nanoparticles connected to the al oh2 6 n oh n 3 n absorbed on the surface of kaolin causing the surface of kaolin to be fully covered with alum precipitates nanoparticles duan and gregory 2003 then the flocculation process started a rapid rise in flocculation index fi value related to floc size occurred and the fi value reached a plateau within minutes fig 4a in this case the kaolin particles are uniformly distributed throughout the flocs fig 4c this gives the flocs a relatively high light scattering coefficient and hence a high fi value yu et al 2015 in the process of adding kaolin 10 min after alum precipitated formed the fi value changed only slightly in the process of alum precipitation before kaolin was added but the aggregation occurred in this process after kaolin particles were added the fi value increased slowly and the plateau fi value was considerably lower in comparison with that when kaolin and alum were added together fig 4a this does not mean that the flocs were smaller in the case of delayed kaolin addition but that the kaolin particles are mainly attached to the surface of the formed hydroxide floc giving a low scattering coefficient and hence a low fi value gregory 2009 this concept is confirmed by the images of flocs shown in fig 4c and d it is clear that flocs are of similar size in both cases very similar behavior was found for flocculation of kaolin by pacl25 fig 4b e and 4f from these results it can be seen that the coagulation mechanism of monomeric al at ph 7 was quite similar to that of polymeric al13 at ph 9 3 5 floc breakage and re growth in order to further investigate the reason for the decreased activity of precipitates by stirring the formed flocs were exposed to high stirring speed 200 rpm with different duration 1 or 10 min and re growth at 50 rpm in some cases the flocs were stirred at high rate for 1 min and were kept for 9 min or 24 h prior to the regrowth at 50 rpm fig 5 after fi value was stabilized the stirring rate increased from 50 to 200 rpm this resulted in immediate and rapid reduction of fi indicating significant floc breakage when the stirring rate was returned to 50 rpm the flocs began to re grow but the fi value was only partially restored for the flocs with 10 min breakage fi value dropped rapidly and then gradually decreased the re grown flocs showed a noticeably lower fi value than in the case of the short breakage time when the stirring rate was restored to 50 rpm yu et al 2011 to investigate whether precipitation aging or rapid stirring led to a decline in regrowth capacity flocs after 1 min breakage and 9 min of stabilization without stirring were stirred at 50 rpm in this case the fi value recovered to the same value as the case with 1 min breakage time indicating that aging in static state will not further lose the regrowth potential of flocs even after 24 h aging of settled flocs followed by stirring at 50 rpm it was found that the fi recovered to the same value as the sample with 1 min breakage thus it seems that some binding groups on the floc surface with other flocs are lost by high speed stirring rather than by long term aging in a static state at least for 24 h in order to further explore the decrease of activity of precipitate surface in the high applied shear process ph value of alum precipitate suspension was continuously measured with different initial ph values fig 5b the ph value of all al3 precipitates with initial ph from 6 to 8 decreased over time which meant that oh in the solution would be adsorbed on the precipitate surface during the stirring process as there are only two types of chemical groups oh2 and oh on the surface of precipitate oh2 is probably replaced by oh from the solution during the stirring process causing lower activity fig 5c shows the effect of ph on floc regrowth after breakage in this case an experiment like that of fig 5a was carried out with alum kaolin flocs grown at 50 rpm and ph 7 then broken for 1 min at 200 rpm and finally regrown at 50 rpm however during the breakage phase the ph was reduced to 5 and this gave a significant improvement in the extent of regrowth 4 mechanism a fast destabilization process within 1 s for coagulant occurs after the hydrolyzed coagulant is added to aqueous suspensions at around neutral ph amirtharajah and mills 1982 the newly formed precipitate nanoparticles bind together and eventually aggregate to form amorphous flocs which grow to a limiting size under given shear conditions the size of precipitate flocs may decrease slightly as the flocculation time increases because of some floc breakage also the size of precipitate flocs decreased with the increase of applied shear for both conditions although the total surface area of precipitates increased as their average size decreased the removal efficiency of humic acid phosphate declined previous research also found that smaller dosing of al aliquots with more frequent addition may be more efficient than adding a single large dose to remove po4 3 by previous researcher de vicente et al 2008 and the mechanism has not been explored yet however from this work the surface of precipitates flocs probably became less active as the shear rate and time increased which meant that the chemical groups on the precipitate surface became less able to bind humic acid and phosphate while for pacl25 each al octahedron on al13 exposes one water molecule to the solution that can deprotonate at ph 6 phillips et al 2000 and giving less positive species such as al13 5 al13 3 and al13 when the ph was raised furrer et al 1992 the decrease of its zeta potential to near 0 mv at ph 9 means that al13 could aggregate and form large precipitates therefore the coagulation mechanism of pacl25 at ph 9 is very similar to that of alum at ph 7 the forms of phosphate at ph between 5 and 9 are h2po4 and hpo4 2 the surface of precipitate particles have water and hydroxyl groups in the inner coordination spheres of the metal ions rustad and casey 2006 these types of group can form hydrogen bonds giving oh oh2 bridges between al iii or al13 sites and release water to give μ oh bonds fig 6 1 al μh3o2 al al μoh al h2o if these bonds play a part in the aggregation of precipitate particles it may be that after breakage they do not readily re form and that there is some loss of active binding sites at the ph value of fig 5b the number of oh2 groups on the precipitate surface decreased during the coagulation and breakage process being replaced by oh fig 6b forming a more crystalline precipitate this process probably caused lower removal efficiency of phosphate and humic acid by the adsorption on precipitate qualls et al 2009 hypothesize that phosphate could be adsorbed to the terminal hydroxyl groups on a polynuclear fe or al colloid effectively blocking the adsorption sites while in our work it seems that phosphate was adsorbed on a polynuclear al colloid by removing oh2 groups like the reaction of formula 2 the reaction process was not probably through hydrogen bonds between aloh and hop or op but by aloh2 and hop 2 aloh2 ohp al μh3o2 p al μoh p h2o at low ph the dominant chemical groups on the surface of aluminum oxide hydroxide should be oh2 which is more active towards phosphate as ph increased oh increased and oh2 decreased and lower removal of phosphate as ph increased indicates that oh2 was more active than oh for pacl25 the chemical groups on its precipitate surface are the same as that of alum precipitate except the number of active groups was less than for alum as shown by the different removal efficiency for phosphate therefore considering the active groups on alum and pacl25 precipitates gives a better understanding of the removal of humic acid and phosphate by these coagulants 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this work are 1 the coagulation mechanisms for monomeric al at neutral ph and polymeric al13 at alkaline ph were found to be very similar and both precipitates could aggregate into micro flocs or flocs precipitate for kaolin particles also the removal efficiency of phosphate or humic acid by coagulating with alum or pacl25 did not change with time between 1 min and 15 min 2 the removal of humic acid and phosphate by the adsorption on al precipitates at higher applied shear was 5 10 lower than that at lower applied shear which meant that higher applied shear decreases the activity of precipitate surface and reduces their adsorption or complexation the crystallization of the precipitate during stirring would limit the access of humic acid and phosphate into the pores and hence reduce the adsorption 3 in the process of crystallization during ageing alum precipitate is still amorphous in 24 h the precipitate after stirring for 2 h or 24 h showed the peak distribution of boehmite in xrd diagram and this further confirmed significant crystallization process during stirring the surface oh2 groups on al3 or al13 precipitates were replaced by the oh groups during stirring giving lower activity of the precipitate surface and hence less adsorption of humic acid and phosphate conflicts of interest the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgements this work was supported by national natural

18934,cationic polyacrylamide a flocculation powder widely used in wastewater pretreatment and sludge dewatering was highly accumulated in waste activated sludge however its effect on short chain fatty acids scfas accumulation from anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge has not been investigated this work therefore aims to deeply unveil how cationic polyacrylamide affects scfas production through both long term and batch tests using either real waste activated sludge or synthetic wastewaters as fermentation substrates experimental results showed that the presence of cationic polyacrylamide not only significantly decreased the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of individual scfa the concentration of scfas decreased from 3374 7 to 2391 7 mg cod l with cationic polyacrylamide level increasing from 0 to 12 g kg of total suspended solids whereas the corresponding percentage of acetic acid increased from 45 2 to 55 5 the mechanism studies revealed that although cationic polyacrylamide could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation cationic polyacrylamide and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited all the sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes to some extents as a result the accumulation of scfas in the cationic polyacrylamide added systems decreased rather than increased however the inhibition to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to acidogenesis leading to an increase of acetic acid to total scfas it was further found that cationic polyacrylamide had stronger ability to adhere to protein molecules surface which inhibited the bioconversion of proteins more severely illumina miseq sequencing analyses showed that cationic polyacrylamide decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords cationic polyacrylamide waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation short chain fatty acids 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is widely applied worldwide owing to its effectiveness in nutrient removal but huge amounts of waste activated sludge was are produced which is a big problem faced by wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowadays liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2019 on one hand was would readily cause secondary pollution if it is treated and disposed inappropriately on the other hand was also contains high levels of biodegradable organic substrates such as proteins and carbohydrates making it a plentiful inexpensive bioenergy source liu et al 2019 rao et al 2018 anaerobic fermentation is a promising method for was treatment since it converts organic substrates in was to valuable bioproducts such as hydrogen and short chain fatty acids scfas chen et al 2007 feng et al 2009 yuan et al 2006 among those bioproducts scfas has drawn more and more attention this is because scfas can be used as the external carbon source for biological nutrient removal or the raw substrate for biodegradable plastic such as polyhydroxyalkanoates synthesis liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 thus many efforts were performed to promote scfas production from was such as pretreating was via thermal alkaline ultrasonic and microwave methods controlling operating conditions of fermentation reactors and optimizing the characteristics of fermented sludge chen et al 2007 liu et al 2014 wei et al 2017 for example both laboratory and pilot scale tests demonstrated that alkaline fermentation condition especially ph 10 was effective in improving the accumulation of scfas li et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 as a byproduct of wastewater treatment was not only collects various organics but also concentrates a large number of pollutants present in wastewaters and biological chemical additives added during wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering processes luo et al 2016 wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 it is well known that anaerobic fermentation includes several biological processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis with a variety of microorganisms such as bacillus sp and clostridium sp being involved appels et al 2008 omar et al 2018 these concentrated pollutants and additives might affect these biological processes making the production of scfas full of uncertainties luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 the impacts of the concentrated pollutants and additives on scfas production therefore require to be assessed cationic polyacrylamide cpam a linear water soluble and high molecular polymeric compound with cationic charges can effectively enhance solid liquid separation through charge neutralization and interparticle bridging and is widely used worldwide campos et al 2008 dai et al 2014 in wwtps cpam is usually used in chemically enhanced primary sedimentation leading to cpam accumulation in was furthermore in small scale wwtps where anaerobically fermenting or digesting was in situ is not economically feasible and in some developing counties such as china where 80 of the wwtps are not configured with anaerobic fermenters or digesters was is required to be dewatered firstly and then gathered together for further treatment dai et al 2014 wong et al 2006 as cpam is substantially added into was during dewatering process cpam contents in such sludge are inevitably high according to our survey cpam level in dewatered sludge was in the range of 2 5 10 g kg dry sludge campos et al 2008 chu et al 2003 due to high concentrations of cpam in was several efforts were carried out in the past to assess the impact of cpam on sludge anaerobic digestion for example chu et al reported that compared with the control the presence of 15 and 40 g cpam kg tss reduced 22 and 37 in methane yield from anaerobic digestion respectively chu et al 2003 2005 the increased size of sludge flocs caused by particle aggregation which limited the disintegration rate of was was considered the main reason for the deterioration of methane production chu et al 2005 campos et al found that cpam induced an indirect inhibitory to methanogenic microbes due to particle aggregation campos et al 2008 wang et al 2018b further elucidated that apart from particle aggregation the degradation products of cpam such as polyacrylic acid acrylamide and acrylic acid negatively affected methanogenesis process in addition recent studies showed that cpam could be biodegraded and consumed as carbon sources to produce scfas by several anaerobes with the optimal condition being at ph 9 and 200 mg cod l of pam dai et al 2014 2015 it was documented that cpam could be anaerobically degraded by some anaerobes even under alkaline conditions with the degradation pathway being summarized in fig 1 bao et al 2010 dai et al 2014 2015 sang et al 2015 long chain cpam was first transformed into short chain cpam by ectoenzymes and then the short chain cpam was degraded to acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid the generated polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid were further bio converted to acetyl coa and pyruvic acid which could be finally converted to scfas such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and valeric acid despite these significant advances no information is currently available on how cpam affects anaerobic fermentation of was for the accumulation of scfas the objective of this study is therefore to reveal the effect of cpam on scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was firstly scfas accumulation from alkaline fermentation ph 10 of was in the presence of cpam at different levels 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss was compared as ph 10 was proven to be the most suitable ph for scfas accumulation li et al 2011 then the mechanisms of how cpam affects scfa production were explored this work deepens our understanding regarding the impact of cpam on anaerobic fermentation of was and the findings obtained might be helpful for engineers to develop strategies to mitigate cpam s negative impact in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and cpam the was used in the following fermentation tests was collected from the secondary settler of a wwtp in changsha china where wastewater pretreatment using cpam was not conducted before use the raw sludge was stored at 4 c for 24 h and screened with a 1 mm sieve to remove impurities the main characteristics of was are as follows ph 6 9 0 1 total suspended solids tss 25040 585 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 16850 320 mg l

nitrogen nh4 n 24 4 4 mg l and soluble phosphate po4 3 p 6 7 0 6 mg l the cationic pam used in this study was purchased from chongqing reagent company which had a molecular weight of 6 8 million da with a 30 charge density and with a residual acrylamide content less than 10 mg kg bovine serum albumin bsa was used as the model protein compound with average molecular weight 67000 sigma aldrich dextran was used as the model polysaccharide compound with average molecular weight 23800 sigma aldrich l alanine was used as the model amino acid compound and glucose was utilized as the model monosaccharide compound sigma aldrich 2 2 effect of cpam on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation the fermentation experiments were carried out in 5 replicate long term semi continuous reactors and each had a working volume of 1 l first a total volume of 4 l was was divided equally into the 5 reactors then different volumes of flocculant solution 0 3 w w were added into those reactors to achieve the predetermined dosage at the beginning of the experiment followed by 200 rpm of stirring for 5 min and 50 rpm for 20 min at room temperature the predetermined dosages of cpam addition were 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss respectively afterwards each reactor was diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l flocculated sludge the fermentation ph was controlled at 10 b y adding 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with an automatic titrator according to the previous results luo et al 2016 the sludge retention time in all fermentation reactors was controlled at 8 days by daily withdrawing 125 ml fermentation mixture from each reactor and replenishing the same volume of flocculated sludges containing the corresponding concentrations of cpam with the organic loading rate olr in each reactor being 2 504 g tss l d all the reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm with medium temperature of 35 1 c the data were collected and analyzed when all the fermentation reactors reached relatively stable 60 d the analyzed items included the concentrations of proteins carbohydrates scfas h2 vss and the major intermediates of cpam biodegradation such as polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid besides the analyses of microbial community and key enzyme activities in the control and 12 g kg cpam added reactor were also conducted after stable operation 2 3 investigations on the mechanism of how cpam affects scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation 2 3 1 scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of cpam two replicate reactors with a liquid volume of 1 l each were carried out in this batch experiment to assess the potential contribution of cpam degradation to scfas accumulation in the anaerobic fermentation process each reactor received 80 ml fermentation mixture as inocula withdrawn from the semi continuous reactor fed with 12 g kg tss cpam added sludge operated above before use the inocula were centrifuged 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with milli q water and then resuspended in milli q water to 80 ml one reactor was fed with 0 244 g cpam the amount of cpam is equally to that in the 12 g kg tss cpam added sludge while the other reactor received no cpam and was set as the control afterwards both reactors were diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l the fermentation ph was controlled at 10 b y adding 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with an automatic titrator in the entire fermentation period the reactors were capped sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 35 1 c for 16 days 2 3 2 effect of cpam on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis processes the following batch test was performed in eight replicate reactors with working volume of 1 0 l each to assess the effects of cpam on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis processes using model compounds as fermentation substrates the selection of the model compounds e g bsa dextran and l alanine was based on the references angelidaki et al 2004a 2004b duan et al 2016 luo et al 2016 eight reactors were divided into four groups test i test ii test iii and test iv with two in each the two reactors in each test were inoculated with 80 ml of sludge mixture and added with different concentrations of cpam i e 0 and 244 mg l and substrate after that each reactor was filled with mineral medium to a total volume of 1 0 l the experimental parameters and conditions are detailed in table 1 the sludge mixtures as inocula were withdrawn from the semi continuous reactor fed with cpam added sludge all the tests were operated the same as described in section 2 2 except that the model compounds instead of real was were used as the fermentation substrates all the tests lasted for 3 d during which the variations of the added substrates in each fermenter were measured daily 2 3 3 characterization of the interaction between organic matters and cpam to further clarify the interaction between organic matters and cpam fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed using bas and dextran as the model protein and carbohydrate respectively four beakers were operated and each received 200 ml of milli q water these beakers were fed with 1 2 g bsa 0 3 g dextran 1 2 g bsa 0 05 g cpam or 0 3 g dextran 0 05 g cpam all of the beakers were stirred at 200 rpm for 5 min and 50 rpm for 20 min at room temperature afterwards the turbid liquids were lyophilized and grounded into a powder ftir using kbr as a solid diluent was used to analyze the vibrational features of these four samples ftir spectra were acquired by transmission in the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 using an avatar 360 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 2 3 4 effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid on was anaerobic fermentation polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid are thought as the main degradation metabolites that might affect was anaerobic alkaline fermentation five groups group i group ii group iii group iv and group v were conducted to assess the effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid the concentrations of them were obtained from the semi continuous reactor fed with sludge with 12 g kg tss cpam on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis respectively with the operational process being detailed in supporting information 2 4 microbial communities analysis the samples were collected in the control and 12 g kg tss cpam added long term semi continuous reactors after stable operation the collected samples were first centrifuged for 5

sulfuric method and lowry folin method respectively liu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b 2018c the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan was applied to characterize the changes of extracellular polymeric substances according to the method reported previously liu et al 2018b 2019 an agilent 6890 gc agilent usa with a flame ionization detector and a dbwaxtre column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm was utilized to analyze the composition of scfas and the method was detailed in our previous study liu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 hydrogen and methane fractions in gas samples were determined by use of a gastight syringe to inject 0 2 ml of the samples into a gas chromatograph gc 112a china and the collection and measurement procedures were detailed in our previous publication xu et al 2018a wang et al 2017 for determining the activity of key enzymes 25 ml sludge mixture was taken out from the reactors cleaned using 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 sonicated at 20kha at 4 c for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min to remove the waste debris the extracts were kept on the ice before analyzing the relative activities of protease and α glucosidase were measured according to the methods reported previously liu et al 2015 the acetate kinase ak and butyrate kinase bk were analyzed using the method reported by xu et al with potassium acetate and sodium butyrate as the substrate respectively xu et al 2018b the relative activity of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase codh was assayed as previously described luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 enzyme activity for the extracted samples was expressed as un mg vss for measuring the concentrations of cpam acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid the digestion mixture was firstly centrifuged at 10000 rpm and 4 c for 5 min and then filtered by filterable membrane 0 45 μm the filtrate was prepared for further testing the filter residue was first frozen at 20 c and dried for 24 h by freezer dryer and then the dried sludge sample was extracted in a reciprocal shaker for 30 min 25 c 600 rpm followed by centrifugation 10000 rpm 4 c 15 min the supernatant was prepared for further testing quantification of acrylic acid was performed using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 usa according to the published method czech et al 2008 the concentration of cpam was measured by the starch cadmium iodine method dai et al 2015 while the quantification of polyacrylic acid was performed using high performance size exclusion chromatography waters 1515 usa according to the method documented previously cotte et al 2017 dowling et al 2011 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance anova with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cpam on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation after operation for about 60 days the concentration and composition of scfas in all the long term reactors did not change significantly with time p 0 05 the scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of cpam at different levels is shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2a that the accumulation of scfas was largely affected by cpam when cpam content in was was respectively 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss the accumulation of scfas was 3374 7 113 2 3092 2 120 4 2786 9 108 8 2391 7 96 2 and 1935 1 77 5 mg cod l respectively with an increase of cpam content from 0 to 24 g kg tss the scfas accumulation linearly decreased r2 0 9412 fig s1 statistical analyses further indicated that compared with the control the presence of cpam at any level investigated in this work caused significant decreases in the accumulation of total scfas table s1 fig 2b shows the effect of cpam on scfas compositions acetic propionic iso valeric and n butyric acids were the major scfas in all the fermenters the presence of 3 g cpam kg tss resulted in significant variations in the yields of propionic iso valeric and n valeric acids while the addition of cpam at other levels caused variations in all the individual scfa yield table s1 with an increase of cpam content the percentages of acetic acid and butyric acids increased whereas the fractions of propionic and iso valeric acids decreased fig 2b for example with an increase of cpam addition from 0 to 24 g kg the percentage of acetic acid increased from 45 2 to 55 5 whereas the percentage of propionic acid decreased from 21 6 to 12 2 in the following text the details of how cpam affects the scfas accumulation and composition were explored 3 2 contribution of cpam biodegradation to scfas production cpam was measured to be biodegraded in the long term fermenters fig s2 in the batch fermenter fed with 0 244 g cpam cpam degradation was also observed for example the initial concentration of cpam was 244 15 6 mg l while its concentration decreased significantly to 90 3 6 2 mg l on 8 d of the fermentation time with its metabolic products polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid being 75 2 5 5 and 33 6 2 2 mg l respectively fig s3a this suggested that the degradation efficiency of cpam reached 62 1 previous investigations verified that scfas could be produced from the degradation of cpam dai et al 2014 2015 thus one might want to know the contribution of the scfa produced from cpam degradation to the total scfa accumulation it was found that after 8 d fermentation the concentration of total scfas in the cpam degradation fermenter was only 49 2 2 5 mg cod l fig s3b which accounted for merely 1 5 of the total scfas from the relevant semi continuous fermenter the facts indicated that the contribution of cpam biodegradation to total scfas accumulation could be negligible though a significant level of cpam was degraded in the anaerobic fermentation process 3 3 effect of cpam on each step involved in scfas accumulation during sludge anaerobic fermentation scfas are important intermediates during was anaerobic fermentation if the steps of solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis involved in sludge fermentation are affected scfas accumulation and their composition will be affected inevitably it is well known that was is enfolded by extracellular polymeric substances which are mainly composed of solid state proteins and carbohydrates xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2018a and the extent of was solubilization is generally evaluated by the released organics and vss reduction chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it was found that with an increase of cpam content both the soluble protein or carbohydrate concentration and vss reduction ratio decreased obviously fig s4 in addition eem spectra analysis showed that the fermenter with higher cpam addition exhibited lower fluorescence intensity in the fermentation liquor fig s5 suggesting that lower soluble polymeric substances was available in the liquor phase in the cpam added fermenters all the results indicated that the addition of cpam restrained solubilization of was which was in accord with the data reported previously chu et al 2005 wang et al 2018b due to the reduction of was solubilization the amounts of substances provided for scfa producers decreased which was one reason for cpam reducing scfas accumulation the specific degradation rate of model compounds measured in the batch tests i e test i test ii test iii and test iv in section 2 3 2 are shown in table 2 the addition of cpam brought negative impacts on the degradation or consumption rate of all the model substrates employed in this work it was found that the degradation or consumption rate without cpam addition was 1 240 0 05 g l d in bsa 0 465 0 02 g l d in dextran 1 369 0 05 g l d in l alanine 0 369 0 01 g l d in glucose 0 576 0 02 g l d in butyrate and 4 637 0 10 ml l d in hydrogen when 12 g kg tss cpam was added the corresponding degradation or consumption rate decreased to 0 736 0 04 0 402 0 02 1 114 0 04 0 275 0 02 and 0 501 0 02 g l d and 4 232 0 12 ml l d respectively table 2 these results indicated that the addition of cpam inhibited the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis which was another reason for cpam reducing scfa production it can be also seen that the inhibition extent of cpam to the degradation of these compounds was different for example 12 g kg tss cpam inhibited bsa degradation by 40 6 from 1 240 to 0 736 g l d but only 8 7 of hydrogen consumption from 4 637 to 4 232 ml l d was inhibited at the same level of cpam suggesting that the inhibition of cpam to homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to hydrolysis this different inhibition might cause variations in the fraction of scfa as shown in fig 2b the reason for this inhibition was probably due to the suppression of cpam or its degradation intermediates to the key enzymes it can be found that the relative activities of protease α glucosidase acetate kinase butyrate kinase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase which are the key enzymes responsible for hydrolysis acetogenesis acidification or homoacetogenesis in the long term fermenter with 12 g kg cpam addition were lower than those in the control fermenter without cpam addition fig 3 the interactions of covalent bond and sweep flocculation between cpam and the enzymes might be the reasons for the suppression of cpam to the key enzymes dai et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018b besides some ectoenzymes available in the fermenters could be used for degradation of both organics and cpam due to the similar functional groups between them such as carboxylate group and amide group dai et al 2015 liu et al 2015 thus an alternative explanation for this inhibition might be owing to the competition by cpam degradation for the ectoenzymes available this competition might result in low degradation rates of substances in fermentation process which was also reported previously dai et al 2014 2015 also from table 2 it can be seen that 12 g kg tss cpam addition inhibited the degradation rates of bsa and dextran by 40 6 and 25 5 respectively this suggested that the degradation of proteins was inhibited more seriously than that of carbohydrates previous studies reported that carbon rich substrates significantly enhanced butyrate and ethanol accumulation while protein rich substrates substantially benefited propionate and valerate generation during anaerobic fermentation feng et al 2009 ma et al 2017 this different inhibition might be responsible for the variation in scfa composition fig 4 presents the ftir spectra of the samples with the addition of bsa dextran bsa cpam or dextran cpam the ftir spectrum of bsa showed a broad band centered around 3298 cm 1 due to nh stretching of secondary amides and it shifted to 3359 cm 1 after bonding with cpam this shift indicated that the nh stretching vibration of secondary amides needed more energy in the presence of cpam it was reported that the nh group of bsa molecules became more stable after bonding with cpam which was probably attributed to the electrostatic interaction dai et al 2017 xu et al 2017 similarly the band at 1392 cm 1 due to symmetric stretching of carboxylate group was shifted to 1399 cm 1 in the presence of cpam suggesting that the carboxylate group in bas was changed due to the steric effect caused by carboxylate group in cpam the peaks at 2962 cm 1 1663 cm 1 1542 cm 1 and 1245 cm 1 represent the ch stretching vibrations of the alkyl groups amide i band c o stretching in secondary amide nh bending motion and cn stretching of conh group and amide iii band cn stretching respectively shifted to lower vibration frequencies 2951 cm 1 1653 cm 1 1533 cm 1 and 1238 cm 1 respectively indicating that hydrogen bonding were involved in the interaction between the bsa and cpam dai et al 2015 santhiya et al 2000 xu et al 2017 apart from the changes discussed above it could also be observed that the relative transmittance of the bands of 1542 cm 1 1392 cm 1 and 1245 cm 1 increased after bonding with cpam which further demonstrated that the functional groups of protein molecules were largely influenced by cpam the ftir spectra of dextran and dextran cpam are displayed in fig 4b which shows little difference except for the peak at 1355 cm 1 and 1160 cm 1 the peaks at 1355 cm 1 and 1160 cm 1 in the spectrum of the dextran sample which were respectively due to the in plane deformation of oh groups and the c o stretching were shifted to lower vibration frequencies in the presence of cpam 1346 cm 1 and 1155 cm 1 respectively suggesting that hydrogen bonding may be involved in the interaction between dextran and cpam clearly the changes on bsa interacted with cpam were more observable than those on dextran interacted with cpam which indicated that cpam had stronger ability to adhere to proteins than carbohydrates resulting in much severer inhibition to the degradation of proteins than that to carbohydrates table 2 3 4 effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid on was anaerobic fermentation in this work it was measured that the concentrations of cpam polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid in the semi continuous reactor fed with sludge with 12 g kg tss cpam were 64 9 4 2 82 7 5 2 and 39 1 3 6 mg l respectively fig s2 according to mass balance analysis the two metabolites accounted for 49 9 of the initial cpam thus the potential impacts of these metabolites at the relevant concentrations on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis were evaluated with the corresponding results being shown in table s2 it can be seen that cpam and polyacrylic acid at the relevant levels inhibited all the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes significantly p 0 05 while acrylic acid at 39 1 mg l did not significantly affect all these processes p 0 05 these results suggested that the degradation metabolites of cpam could inhibit the performance of sludge anaerobic fermentation and polyacrylic acid was the major inhibitor the inhibitions of cpam and its main metabolites on each process of anaerobic fermentation were further assessed by the inhibition constant ks i which was obtained from eq 3 ks i of acrylic acid to all the processes was much higher than that of either cpam or polyacrylic acid confirming again that acrylic acid did not affect anaerobic fermentation table 3 ks i of cpam or polyacrylic acid to the degradation of bsa was lower than that to the degradations of other substrates table 3 this suggested that hydrolysis was more sensitive to these inhibitors than other bioprocesses during sludge alkaline fermentation for glucose the inhibition constant of either polyacrylic acid 562 8 mg l or acrylic acid 1163 8 mg l was greater than that of cpam 520 3 mg l indicating that cpam s toxicity to acidogenesis was higher than its major metabolites at the same concentration 3 5 effect of cpam on microbial community and the activities of key enzymes during was anaerobic fermentation the structure of the microbial community and the abundance of functional microbes are relevant to the performance of was anaerobic fermentation thus the microbial communities between the control and the cpam added fermenter were compared by using the illumina miseq 16s rrna genes sequencing strategy venn analysis showed that the number of operational taxonomic units otus in the control was higher than that in the cpam added fermenter 1861 versus 1446 with 1032 otus shared by the two fermenters fig s7 the facts suggested that the presence of cpam reduced the microbial diversity most of microorganisms in the control and the cpam added fermenters were found to be affiliated into four phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig s8 some microbes belonged to these phyla were reported to have the ability to degrade lots of complex organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides to produce scfas under anaerobic conditions lu et al 2012 nelson et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 however the abundance of them changed between the control and the cpam added fermenter the abundance of bacteroidetes the dominant bacteria possessing the ability of producing lytic enzymes during anaerobic degradation of organic matters increased in the presence of cpam 26 4 versus 17 9 in the control which might be the response to particle aggregation of sludge caused by cpam wang et al 2017 the population of another dominant phylum proteobacteria which was demonstrated to produce scfas reduced in the cpam added fermenter 10 2 versus 14 9 in the control luo et al 2016 further exploration at genus level found that the abundances of microbes relevant to scfas production such as proteiniborus sp klebsiella sp tissierella sp and proteiniclasticum sp were the predominant microorganisms duan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 accounting for more than 60 of the total microbes in both the fermenters fig 5 klebsiella sp which was reported to be seriously inhibited by some polymerized pollutants such as vinyl polymer decreased in the presence of cpam 9 2 versus 12 8 in the control lou et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 besides the above predominant scfas producers other microorganisms were also detected to vary with cpam the amounts of petrimonas sp macellibacteroides sp sedimentibacter sp and syntrophomonas sp which were reported to be able to degrade some refractory organics or contaminants with scfas especially acetic acid as their major products such as cellulose aniline and polyacrylic acid increased in the cpam added fermenter suggesting that all of them might be potential microbes for the degradation of cpam luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 based on the results of the number of otus and the distributions of microbial populations between the control and the cpam added fermenter it could be stated that the microbial diversity and the abundances of functional microbes were affected by cpam 3 6 overall understanding of inhibition mechanism of cpam and implications for sludge treatments this work for the first time reveals the details of how the presence of cpam affects anaerobic production of scfas from was at ph 10 which fills this gap in knowledge fig 6 shows the schematic diagram of cpam s effect on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation cpam could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation cpam and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited all the sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes to some extents however the inhibition to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to acidogenesis owing to the competition by cpam degradation for the ectoenzymes available the degradation rates of substances in fermentation process were lowered cpam adhered to the surface of protein molecules stronger than that of carbohydrates which inhibited the bioconversion of proteins more severely resulting in the variation of scfas production the inhibition kinetics analysis indicated that the hydrolysis especially the hydrolysis of proteins was more sensitive to cpam and its main metabolites than other bioprocesses during sludge alkaline fermentation moreover cpam decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas accumulation additionally the findings obtained in this work might deepen our understanding regarding the impact of cpam on anaerobic fermentation of was and might be helpful for engineers to develop strategies to mitigate cpam s negative impact in the future owing to the high efficiency of cpam in enhancing solid liquid separation its use was extensive but its impact was overlooked previously in field situations although it s physical enmeshment was reported before the toxicity of cpam to the bio processes of anaerobic fermentation was not well recognized which would require to be considered in the future manipulation of sludge fermention or even in the future operation of wwtps or else the residual cpam and its degradation metabolites after anaerobic fermentation might inevitably enter into the environment which brings risks to natural organisms and other biological processes chang et al 2001 wong et al 2006 moreover when the produced scfas from cpam added was were employed as external carbon source in the biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtps the low production and different composition of individual scfas caused by cpam also needed to be taken consideration chen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 4 conclusion this present study evaluated the effect of cpam on scfas accumulation from anaerobic fermentation of was and revealed the underlying mechanisms of cpam affecting scfas production the conclusions of this research are as follows 1 the presence of cpam not only significantly decreased the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of individual scfas 2 cpam could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation but its contribution to scfas accumulation could be ignored 3 although cpam and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited to some extents to sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes their inhibitions to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis were slighter than those to acidogenesis 4 cpam decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas

18934,cationic polyacrylamide a flocculation powder widely used in wastewater pretreatment and sludge dewatering was highly accumulated in waste activated sludge however its effect on short chain fatty acids scfas accumulation from anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge has not been investigated this work therefore aims to deeply unveil how cationic polyacrylamide affects scfas production through both long term and batch tests using either real waste activated sludge or synthetic wastewaters as fermentation substrates experimental results showed that the presence of cationic polyacrylamide not only significantly decreased the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of individual scfa the concentration of scfas decreased from 3374 7 to 2391 7 mg cod l with cationic polyacrylamide level increasing from 0 to 12 g kg of total suspended solids whereas the corresponding percentage of acetic acid increased from 45 2 to 55 5 the mechanism studies revealed that although cationic polyacrylamide could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation cationic polyacrylamide and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited all the sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes to some extents as a result the accumulation of scfas in the cationic polyacrylamide added systems decreased rather than increased however the inhibition to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to acidogenesis leading to an increase of acetic acid to total scfas it was further found that cationic polyacrylamide had stronger ability to adhere to protein molecules surface which inhibited the bioconversion of proteins more severely illumina miseq sequencing analyses showed that cationic polyacrylamide decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords cationic polyacrylamide waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation short chain fatty acids 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is widely applied worldwide owing to its effectiveness in nutrient removal but huge amounts of waste activated sludge was are produced which is a big problem faced by wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowadays liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2019 on one hand was would readily cause secondary pollution if it is treated and disposed inappropriately on the other hand was also contains high levels of biodegradable organic substrates such as proteins and carbohydrates making it a plentiful inexpensive bioenergy source liu et al 2019 rao et al 2018 anaerobic fermentation is a promising method for was treatment since it converts organic substrates in was to valuable bioproducts such as hydrogen and short chain fatty acids scfas chen et al 2007 feng et al 2009 yuan et al 2006 among those bioproducts scfas has drawn more and more attention this is because scfas can be used as the external carbon source for biological nutrient removal or the raw substrate for biodegradable plastic such as polyhydroxyalkanoates synthesis liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 thus many efforts were performed to promote scfas production from was such as pretreating was via thermal alkaline ultrasonic and microwave methods controlling operating conditions of fermentation reactors and optimizing the characteristics of fermented sludge chen et al 2007 liu et al 2014 wei et al 2017 for example both laboratory and pilot scale tests demonstrated that alkaline fermentation condition especially ph 10 was effective in improving the accumulation of scfas li et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 as a byproduct of wastewater treatment was not only collects various organics but also concentrates a large number of pollutants present in wastewaters and biological chemical additives added during wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering processes luo et al 2016 wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 it is well known that anaerobic fermentation includes several biological processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis with a variety of microorganisms such as bacillus sp and clostridium sp being involved appels et al 2008 omar et al 2018 these concentrated pollutants and additives might affect these biological processes making the production of scfas full of uncertainties luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 the impacts of the concentrated pollutants and additives on scfas production therefore require to be assessed cationic polyacrylamide cpam a linear water soluble and high molecular polymeric compound with cationic charges can effectively enhance solid liquid separation through charge neutralization and interparticle bridging and is widely used worldwide campos et al 2008 dai et al 2014 in wwtps cpam is usually used in chemically enhanced primary sedimentation leading to cpam accumulation in was furthermore in small scale wwtps where anaerobically fermenting or digesting was in situ is not economically feasible and in some developing counties such as china where 80 of the wwtps are not configured with anaerobic fermenters or digesters was is required to be dewatered firstly and then gathered together for further treatment dai et al 2014 wong et al 2006 as cpam is substantially added into was during dewatering process cpam contents in such sludge are inevitably high according to our survey cpam level in dewatered sludge was in the range of 2 5 10 g kg dry sludge campos et al 2008 chu et al 2003 due to high concentrations of cpam in was several efforts were carried out in the past to assess the impact of cpam on sludge anaerobic digestion for example chu et al reported that compared with the control the presence of 15 and 40 g cpam kg tss reduced 22 and 37 in methane yield from anaerobic digestion respectively chu et al 2003 2005 the increased size of sludge flocs caused by particle aggregation which limited the disintegration rate of was was considered the main reason for the deterioration of methane production chu et al 2005 campos et al found that cpam induced an indirect inhibitory to methanogenic microbes due to particle aggregation campos et al 2008 wang et al 2018b further elucidated that apart from particle aggregation the degradation products of cpam such as polyacrylic acid acrylamide and acrylic acid negatively affected methanogenesis process in addition recent studies showed that cpam could be biodegraded and consumed as carbon sources to produce scfas by several anaerobes with the optimal condition being at ph 9 and 200 mg cod l of pam dai et al 2014 2015 it was documented that cpam could be anaerobically degraded by some anaerobes even under alkaline conditions with the degradation pathway being summarized in fig 1 bao et al 2010 dai et al 2014 2015 sang et al 2015 long chain cpam was first transformed into short chain cpam by ectoenzymes and then the short chain cpam was degraded to acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid the generated polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid were further bio converted to acetyl coa and pyruvic acid which could be finally converted to scfas such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and valeric acid despite these significant advances no information is currently available on how cpam affects anaerobic fermentation of was for the accumulation of scfas the objective of this study is therefore to reveal the effect of cpam on scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was firstly scfas accumulation from alkaline fermentation ph 10 of was in the presence of cpam at different levels 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss was compared as ph 10 was proven to be the most suitable ph for scfas accumulation li et al 2011 then the mechanisms of how cpam affects scfa production were explored this work deepens our understanding regarding the impact of cpam on anaerobic fermentation of was and the findings obtained might be helpful for engineers to develop strategies to mitigate cpam s negative impact in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and cpam the was used in the following fermentation tests was collected from the secondary settler of a wwtp in changsha china where wastewater pretreatment using cpam was not conducted before use the raw sludge was stored at 4 c for 24 h and screened with a 1 mm sieve to remove impurities the main characteristics of was are as follows ph 6 9 0 1 total suspended solids tss 25040 585 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 16850 320 mg l

nitrogen nh4 n 24 4 4 mg l and soluble phosphate po4 3 p 6 7 0 6 mg l the cationic pam used in this study was purchased from chongqing reagent company which had a molecular weight of 6 8 million da with a 30 charge density and with a residual acrylamide content less than 10 mg kg bovine serum albumin bsa was used as the model protein compound with average molecular weight 67000 sigma aldrich dextran was used as the model polysaccharide compound with average molecular weight 23800 sigma aldrich l alanine was used as the model amino acid compound and glucose was utilized as the model monosaccharide compound sigma aldrich 2 2 effect of cpam on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation the fermentation experiments were carried out in 5 replicate long term semi continuous reactors and each had a working volume of 1 l first a total volume of 4 l was was divided equally into the 5 reactors then different volumes of flocculant solution 0 3 w w were added into those reactors to achieve the predetermined dosage at the beginning of the experiment followed by 200 rpm of stirring for 5 min and 50 rpm for 20 min at room temperature the predetermined dosages of cpam addition were 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss respectively afterwards each reactor was diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l flocculated sludge the fermentation ph was controlled at 10 b y adding 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with an automatic titrator according to the previous results luo et al 2016 the sludge retention time in all fermentation reactors was controlled at 8 days by daily withdrawing 125 ml fermentation mixture from each reactor and replenishing the same volume of flocculated sludges containing the corresponding concentrations of cpam with the organic loading rate olr in each reactor being 2 504 g tss l d all the reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm with medium temperature of 35 1 c the data were collected and analyzed when all the fermentation reactors reached relatively stable 60 d the analyzed items included the concentrations of proteins carbohydrates scfas h2 vss and the major intermediates of cpam biodegradation such as polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid besides the analyses of microbial community and key enzyme activities in the control and 12 g kg cpam added reactor were also conducted after stable operation 2 3 investigations on the mechanism of how cpam affects scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation 2 3 1 scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of cpam two replicate reactors with a liquid volume of 1 l each were carried out in this batch experiment to assess the potential contribution of cpam degradation to scfas accumulation in the anaerobic fermentation process each reactor received 80 ml fermentation mixture as inocula withdrawn from the semi continuous reactor fed with 12 g kg tss cpam added sludge operated above before use the inocula were centrifuged 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with milli q water and then resuspended in milli q water to 80 ml one reactor was fed with 0 244 g cpam the amount of cpam is equally to that in the 12 g kg tss cpam added sludge while the other reactor received no cpam and was set as the control afterwards both reactors were diluted with milli q water to 1 0 l the fermentation ph was controlled at 10 b y adding 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with an automatic titrator in the entire fermentation period the reactors were capped sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 35 1 c for 16 days 2 3 2 effect of cpam on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis processes the following batch test was performed in eight replicate reactors with working volume of 1 0 l each to assess the effects of cpam on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis processes using model compounds as fermentation substrates the selection of the model compounds e g bsa dextran and l alanine was based on the references angelidaki et al 2004a 2004b duan et al 2016 luo et al 2016 eight reactors were divided into four groups test i test ii test iii and test iv with two in each the two reactors in each test were inoculated with 80 ml of sludge mixture and added with different concentrations of cpam i e 0 and 244 mg l and substrate after that each reactor was filled with mineral medium to a total volume of 1 0 l the experimental parameters and conditions are detailed in table 1 the sludge mixtures as inocula were withdrawn from the semi continuous reactor fed with cpam added sludge all the tests were operated the same as described in section 2 2 except that the model compounds instead of real was were used as the fermentation substrates all the tests lasted for 3 d during which the variations of the added substrates in each fermenter were measured daily 2 3 3 characterization of the interaction between organic matters and cpam to further clarify the interaction between organic matters and cpam fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed using bas and dextran as the model protein and carbohydrate respectively four beakers were operated and each received 200 ml of milli q water these beakers were fed with 1 2 g bsa 0 3 g dextran 1 2 g bsa 0 05 g cpam or 0 3 g dextran 0 05 g cpam all of the beakers were stirred at 200 rpm for 5 min and 50 rpm for 20 min at room temperature afterwards the turbid liquids were lyophilized and grounded into a powder ftir using kbr as a solid diluent was used to analyze the vibrational features of these four samples ftir spectra were acquired by transmission in the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 using an avatar 360 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 2 3 4 effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid on was anaerobic fermentation polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid are thought as the main degradation metabolites that might affect was anaerobic alkaline fermentation five groups group i group ii group iii group iv and group v were conducted to assess the effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid the concentrations of them were obtained from the semi continuous reactor fed with sludge with 12 g kg tss cpam on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis respectively with the operational process being detailed in supporting information 2 4 microbial communities analysis the samples were collected in the control and 12 g kg tss cpam added long term semi continuous reactors after stable operation the collected samples were first centrifuged for 5

sulfuric method and lowry folin method respectively liu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b 2018c the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan was applied to characterize the changes of extracellular polymeric substances according to the method reported previously liu et al 2018b 2019 an agilent 6890 gc agilent usa with a flame ionization detector and a dbwaxtre column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm was utilized to analyze the composition of scfas and the method was detailed in our previous study liu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 hydrogen and methane fractions in gas samples were determined by use of a gastight syringe to inject 0 2 ml of the samples into a gas chromatograph gc 112a china and the collection and measurement procedures were detailed in our previous publication xu et al 2018a wang et al 2017 for determining the activity of key enzymes 25 ml sludge mixture was taken out from the reactors cleaned using 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 sonicated at 20kha at 4 c for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min to remove the waste debris the extracts were kept on the ice before analyzing the relative activities of protease and α glucosidase were measured according to the methods reported previously liu et al 2015 the acetate kinase ak and butyrate kinase bk were analyzed using the method reported by xu et al with potassium acetate and sodium butyrate as the substrate respectively xu et al 2018b the relative activity of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase codh was assayed as previously described luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 enzyme activity for the extracted samples was expressed as un mg vss for measuring the concentrations of cpam acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid the digestion mixture was firstly centrifuged at 10000 rpm and 4 c for 5 min and then filtered by filterable membrane 0 45 μm the filtrate was prepared for further testing the filter residue was first frozen at 20 c and dried for 24 h by freezer dryer and then the dried sludge sample was extracted in a reciprocal shaker for 30 min 25 c 600 rpm followed by centrifugation 10000 rpm 4 c 15 min the supernatant was prepared for further testing quantification of acrylic acid was performed using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 usa according to the published method czech et al 2008 the concentration of cpam was measured by the starch cadmium iodine method dai et al 2015 while the quantification of polyacrylic acid was performed using high performance size exclusion chromatography waters 1515 usa according to the method documented previously cotte et al 2017 dowling et al 2011 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance anova with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cpam on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation after operation for about 60 days the concentration and composition of scfas in all the long term reactors did not change significantly with time p 0 05 the scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of cpam at different levels is shown in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2a that the accumulation of scfas was largely affected by cpam when cpam content in was was respectively 0 3 6 12 and 24 g kg tss the accumulation of scfas was 3374 7 113 2 3092 2 120 4 2786 9 108 8 2391 7 96 2 and 1935 1 77 5 mg cod l respectively with an increase of cpam content from 0 to 24 g kg tss the scfas accumulation linearly decreased r2 0 9412 fig s1 statistical analyses further indicated that compared with the control the presence of cpam at any level investigated in this work caused significant decreases in the accumulation of total scfas table s1 fig 2b shows the effect of cpam on scfas compositions acetic propionic iso valeric and n butyric acids were the major scfas in all the fermenters the presence of 3 g cpam kg tss resulted in significant variations in the yields of propionic iso valeric and n valeric acids while the addition of cpam at other levels caused variations in all the individual scfa yield table s1 with an increase of cpam content the percentages of acetic acid and butyric acids increased whereas the fractions of propionic and iso valeric acids decreased fig 2b for example with an increase of cpam addition from 0 to 24 g kg the percentage of acetic acid increased from 45 2 to 55 5 whereas the percentage of propionic acid decreased from 21 6 to 12 2 in the following text the details of how cpam affects the scfas accumulation and composition were explored 3 2 contribution of cpam biodegradation to scfas production cpam was measured to be biodegraded in the long term fermenters fig s2 in the batch fermenter fed with 0 244 g cpam cpam degradation was also observed for example the initial concentration of cpam was 244 15 6 mg l while its concentration decreased significantly to 90 3 6 2 mg l on 8 d of the fermentation time with its metabolic products polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid being 75 2 5 5 and 33 6 2 2 mg l respectively fig s3a this suggested that the degradation efficiency of cpam reached 62 1 previous investigations verified that scfas could be produced from the degradation of cpam dai et al 2014 2015 thus one might want to know the contribution of the scfa produced from cpam degradation to the total scfa accumulation it was found that after 8 d fermentation the concentration of total scfas in the cpam degradation fermenter was only 49 2 2 5 mg cod l fig s3b which accounted for merely 1 5 of the total scfas from the relevant semi continuous fermenter the facts indicated that the contribution of cpam biodegradation to total scfas accumulation could be negligible though a significant level of cpam was degraded in the anaerobic fermentation process 3 3 effect of cpam on each step involved in scfas accumulation during sludge anaerobic fermentation scfas are important intermediates during was anaerobic fermentation if the steps of solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis involved in sludge fermentation are affected scfas accumulation and their composition will be affected inevitably it is well known that was is enfolded by extracellular polymeric substances which are mainly composed of solid state proteins and carbohydrates xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2018a and the extent of was solubilization is generally evaluated by the released organics and vss reduction chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it was found that with an increase of cpam content both the soluble protein or carbohydrate concentration and vss reduction ratio decreased obviously fig s4 in addition eem spectra analysis showed that the fermenter with higher cpam addition exhibited lower fluorescence intensity in the fermentation liquor fig s5 suggesting that lower soluble polymeric substances was available in the liquor phase in the cpam added fermenters all the results indicated that the addition of cpam restrained solubilization of was which was in accord with the data reported previously chu et al 2005 wang et al 2018b due to the reduction of was solubilization the amounts of substances provided for scfa producers decreased which was one reason for cpam reducing scfas accumulation the specific degradation rate of model compounds measured in the batch tests i e test i test ii test iii and test iv in section 2 3 2 are shown in table 2 the addition of cpam brought negative impacts on the degradation or consumption rate of all the model substrates employed in this work it was found that the degradation or consumption rate without cpam addition was 1 240 0 05 g l d in bsa 0 465 0 02 g l d in dextran 1 369 0 05 g l d in l alanine 0 369 0 01 g l d in glucose 0 576 0 02 g l d in butyrate and 4 637 0 10 ml l d in hydrogen when 12 g kg tss cpam was added the corresponding degradation or consumption rate decreased to 0 736 0 04 0 402 0 02 1 114 0 04 0 275 0 02 and 0 501 0 02 g l d and 4 232 0 12 ml l d respectively table 2 these results indicated that the addition of cpam inhibited the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis which was another reason for cpam reducing scfa production it can be also seen that the inhibition extent of cpam to the degradation of these compounds was different for example 12 g kg tss cpam inhibited bsa degradation by 40 6 from 1 240 to 0 736 g l d but only 8 7 of hydrogen consumption from 4 637 to 4 232 ml l d was inhibited at the same level of cpam suggesting that the inhibition of cpam to homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to hydrolysis this different inhibition might cause variations in the fraction of scfa as shown in fig 2b the reason for this inhibition was probably due to the suppression of cpam or its degradation intermediates to the key enzymes it can be found that the relative activities of protease α glucosidase acetate kinase butyrate kinase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase which are the key enzymes responsible for hydrolysis acetogenesis acidification or homoacetogenesis in the long term fermenter with 12 g kg cpam addition were lower than those in the control fermenter without cpam addition fig 3 the interactions of covalent bond and sweep flocculation between cpam and the enzymes might be the reasons for the suppression of cpam to the key enzymes dai et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018b besides some ectoenzymes available in the fermenters could be used for degradation of both organics and cpam due to the similar functional groups between them such as carboxylate group and amide group dai et al 2015 liu et al 2015 thus an alternative explanation for this inhibition might be owing to the competition by cpam degradation for the ectoenzymes available this competition might result in low degradation rates of substances in fermentation process which was also reported previously dai et al 2014 2015 also from table 2 it can be seen that 12 g kg tss cpam addition inhibited the degradation rates of bsa and dextran by 40 6 and 25 5 respectively this suggested that the degradation of proteins was inhibited more seriously than that of carbohydrates previous studies reported that carbon rich substrates significantly enhanced butyrate and ethanol accumulation while protein rich substrates substantially benefited propionate and valerate generation during anaerobic fermentation feng et al 2009 ma et al 2017 this different inhibition might be responsible for the variation in scfa composition fig 4 presents the ftir spectra of the samples with the addition of bsa dextran bsa cpam or dextran cpam the ftir spectrum of bsa showed a broad band centered around 3298 cm 1 due to nh stretching of secondary amides and it shifted to 3359 cm 1 after bonding with cpam this shift indicated that the nh stretching vibration of secondary amides needed more energy in the presence of cpam it was reported that the nh group of bsa molecules became more stable after bonding with cpam which was probably attributed to the electrostatic interaction dai et al 2017 xu et al 2017 similarly the band at 1392 cm 1 due to symmetric stretching of carboxylate group was shifted to 1399 cm 1 in the presence of cpam suggesting that the carboxylate group in bas was changed due to the steric effect caused by carboxylate group in cpam the peaks at 2962 cm 1 1663 cm 1 1542 cm 1 and 1245 cm 1 represent the ch stretching vibrations of the alkyl groups amide i band c o stretching in secondary amide nh bending motion and cn stretching of conh group and amide iii band cn stretching respectively shifted to lower vibration frequencies 2951 cm 1 1653 cm 1 1533 cm 1 and 1238 cm 1 respectively indicating that hydrogen bonding were involved in the interaction between the bsa and cpam dai et al 2015 santhiya et al 2000 xu et al 2017 apart from the changes discussed above it could also be observed that the relative transmittance of the bands of 1542 cm 1 1392 cm 1 and 1245 cm 1 increased after bonding with cpam which further demonstrated that the functional groups of protein molecules were largely influenced by cpam the ftir spectra of dextran and dextran cpam are displayed in fig 4b which shows little difference except for the peak at 1355 cm 1 and 1160 cm 1 the peaks at 1355 cm 1 and 1160 cm 1 in the spectrum of the dextran sample which were respectively due to the in plane deformation of oh groups and the c o stretching were shifted to lower vibration frequencies in the presence of cpam 1346 cm 1 and 1155 cm 1 respectively suggesting that hydrogen bonding may be involved in the interaction between dextran and cpam clearly the changes on bsa interacted with cpam were more observable than those on dextran interacted with cpam which indicated that cpam had stronger ability to adhere to proteins than carbohydrates resulting in much severer inhibition to the degradation of proteins than that to carbohydrates table 2 3 4 effect of polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid on was anaerobic fermentation in this work it was measured that the concentrations of cpam polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid in the semi continuous reactor fed with sludge with 12 g kg tss cpam were 64 9 4 2 82 7 5 2 and 39 1 3 6 mg l respectively fig s2 according to mass balance analysis the two metabolites accounted for 49 9 of the initial cpam thus the potential impacts of these metabolites at the relevant concentrations on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogesis were evaluated with the corresponding results being shown in table s2 it can be seen that cpam and polyacrylic acid at the relevant levels inhibited all the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes significantly p 0 05 while acrylic acid at 39 1 mg l did not significantly affect all these processes p 0 05 these results suggested that the degradation metabolites of cpam could inhibit the performance of sludge anaerobic fermentation and polyacrylic acid was the major inhibitor the inhibitions of cpam and its main metabolites on each process of anaerobic fermentation were further assessed by the inhibition constant ks i which was obtained from eq 3 ks i of acrylic acid to all the processes was much higher than that of either cpam or polyacrylic acid confirming again that acrylic acid did not affect anaerobic fermentation table 3 ks i of cpam or polyacrylic acid to the degradation of bsa was lower than that to the degradations of other substrates table 3 this suggested that hydrolysis was more sensitive to these inhibitors than other bioprocesses during sludge alkaline fermentation for glucose the inhibition constant of either polyacrylic acid 562 8 mg l or acrylic acid 1163 8 mg l was greater than that of cpam 520 3 mg l indicating that cpam s toxicity to acidogenesis was higher than its major metabolites at the same concentration 3 5 effect of cpam on microbial community and the activities of key enzymes during was anaerobic fermentation the structure of the microbial community and the abundance of functional microbes are relevant to the performance of was anaerobic fermentation thus the microbial communities between the control and the cpam added fermenter were compared by using the illumina miseq 16s rrna genes sequencing strategy venn analysis showed that the number of operational taxonomic units otus in the control was higher than that in the cpam added fermenter 1861 versus 1446 with 1032 otus shared by the two fermenters fig s7 the facts suggested that the presence of cpam reduced the microbial diversity most of microorganisms in the control and the cpam added fermenters were found to be affiliated into four phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig s8 some microbes belonged to these phyla were reported to have the ability to degrade lots of complex organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides to produce scfas under anaerobic conditions lu et al 2012 nelson et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 however the abundance of them changed between the control and the cpam added fermenter the abundance of bacteroidetes the dominant bacteria possessing the ability of producing lytic enzymes during anaerobic degradation of organic matters increased in the presence of cpam 26 4 versus 17 9 in the control which might be the response to particle aggregation of sludge caused by cpam wang et al 2017 the population of another dominant phylum proteobacteria which was demonstrated to produce scfas reduced in the cpam added fermenter 10 2 versus 14 9 in the control luo et al 2016 further exploration at genus level found that the abundances of microbes relevant to scfas production such as proteiniborus sp klebsiella sp tissierella sp and proteiniclasticum sp were the predominant microorganisms duan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 accounting for more than 60 of the total microbes in both the fermenters fig 5 klebsiella sp which was reported to be seriously inhibited by some polymerized pollutants such as vinyl polymer decreased in the presence of cpam 9 2 versus 12 8 in the control lou et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 besides the above predominant scfas producers other microorganisms were also detected to vary with cpam the amounts of petrimonas sp macellibacteroides sp sedimentibacter sp and syntrophomonas sp which were reported to be able to degrade some refractory organics or contaminants with scfas especially acetic acid as their major products such as cellulose aniline and polyacrylic acid increased in the cpam added fermenter suggesting that all of them might be potential microbes for the degradation of cpam luo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 based on the results of the number of otus and the distributions of microbial populations between the control and the cpam added fermenter it could be stated that the microbial diversity and the abundances of functional microbes were affected by cpam 3 6 overall understanding of inhibition mechanism of cpam and implications for sludge treatments this work for the first time reveals the details of how the presence of cpam affects anaerobic production of scfas from was at ph 10 which fills this gap in knowledge fig 6 shows the schematic diagram of cpam s effect on scfas accumulation during was anaerobic fermentation cpam could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation cpam and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited all the sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes to some extents however the inhibition to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to acidogenesis owing to the competition by cpam degradation for the ectoenzymes available the degradation rates of substances in fermentation process were lowered cpam adhered to the surface of protein molecules stronger than that of carbohydrates which inhibited the bioconversion of proteins more severely resulting in the variation of scfas production the inhibition kinetics analysis indicated that the hydrolysis especially the hydrolysis of proteins was more sensitive to cpam and its main metabolites than other bioprocesses during sludge alkaline fermentation moreover cpam decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas accumulation additionally the findings obtained in this work might deepen our understanding regarding the impact of cpam on anaerobic fermentation of was and might be helpful for engineers to develop strategies to mitigate cpam s negative impact in the future owing to the high efficiency of cpam in enhancing solid liquid separation its use was extensive but its impact was overlooked previously in field situations although it s physical enmeshment was reported before the toxicity of cpam to the bio processes of anaerobic fermentation was not well recognized which would require to be considered in the future manipulation of sludge fermention or even in the future operation of wwtps or else the residual cpam and its degradation metabolites after anaerobic fermentation might inevitably enter into the environment which brings risks to natural organisms and other biological processes chang et al 2001 wong et al 2006 moreover when the produced scfas from cpam added was were employed as external carbon source in the biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtps the low production and different composition of individual scfas caused by cpam also needed to be taken consideration chen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 4 conclusion this present study evaluated the effect of cpam on scfas accumulation from anaerobic fermentation of was and revealed the underlying mechanisms of cpam affecting scfas production the conclusions of this research are as follows 1 the presence of cpam not only significantly decreased the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of individual scfas 2 cpam could be partially degraded to produce scfas during anaerobic fermentation but its contribution to scfas accumulation could be ignored 3 although cpam and its major degradation metabolite polyacrylic acid inhibited to some extents to sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes their inhibitions to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis were slighter than those to acidogenesis 4 cpam decreased microbial community diversity altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for scfas accumulation acknowledgment this study was financially supported by the project of the natural science funds of hunan province for distinguished young scholar 2018jj1002 and science and technology
