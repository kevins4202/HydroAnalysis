9500,soil nitrogen n availability is fundamental for n uptake and biomass accumulation by plants and is affected by irrigation management deficit irrigation is an efficient strategy to manage soil moisture for crop production however responses of n uptake and soil mineral n to deficit irrigation are not yet clear in alfalfa grasslands a 2 year trial with alfalfa was carried out using two irrigation systems flood and subsurface drip irrigations at three irrigation levels full irrigation slight water deficit irrigation 70 of full irrigation and moderate water deficit irrigation 50 of full irrigation for the whole growth period the n uptake nuptake and n use efficiency nue of alfalfa as well as the soil mineral n were measured the nuptake by plant organs decreased with increasing deficit level of irrigation but slight deficit irrigation barely reduced nuptake as compared to full irrigation deficit irrigation led to a decrease in dry matter yield especially in the 2nd year but slight deficit irrigation reduced it little in contrast total n concentration in plant organs barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation suggesting that biomass growth rather than change in n concentration may play a major role in regulating nuptake the nue of alfalfa barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation although there was a decreasing tendency in the 2nd year there were significant correlations between nuptake and nue of alfalfa with soil ammonium n content suggesting that this form of n is relatively short lived and nitrate n may be adequate to meet the growth requirement of alfalfa in practice it is recommended that slight deficit irrigation should be set up during alfalfa production in the inland arid area of china keywords alfalfa arid area irrigation nitrogen uptake soil nitrogen availability 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l is a well known perennial forage crop that covers the largest planting area in the world it is fundamental to livestock husbandry due to its high yield rich protein content and palatability wagle et al 2019 this leguminous crop can adapt to diverse and adverse environments particularly it shows good performance in n poor habitats due to its strong capability for biological n2 fixation bnf grewal and williams 2003 liu et al 2011 in recent years the area cultivated with alfalfa has continued to expand in arid and semi arid regions due to the development of the livestock industry feng et al 2016 and an increase in the demand for ecological reconstruction li et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2017 although alfalfa has strong adaptability for wide ranging water conditions high water consumption by it often leads to yield reduction under water stress lamm et al 2012 which greatly restricts its cultivation and extensive use for instance in china alfalfa is mainly distributed in the north especially in arid areas where water stress has long been the main limiting factor for the survival and production of many plants including alfalfa ni 2004 kuslu et al 2010 liu et al 2022 under such conditions irrigation can not only enhance soil water moisture but also improve the availability of soil nutrients making it an efficient management strategy for sustaining crop production however water driven movement and use of nutrients raun et al 1999 suescun et al 2021 in alfalfa grassland under irrigation is yet to be understood fully a deeper understanding of changes in nitrogen n supply and utilization under irrigation is of great importance to optimize the management of irrigation and fertilization for enhanced alfalfa performance and production irrigation can improve crop performance by increasing yield and n uptake kunrath et al 2018 increases in irrigation amount have been reported to cause increases in wheat grain yield li et al 2021a 2021b wang et al 2020 huang et al 2005 garabet et al 1998 eissa 2018 found that drip irrigation with 100 of the water demand could increase wheat growth nutrient uptake and biological yield compared to the lower levels of irrigation irrigation with 75 of the water demand led to an 18 22 higher wheat yield compared to irrigation with 100 of the water demand this suggests that restricted irrigation influences biomass accumulation and allocation among plant organs which might lead to increased grain yield in grain crops similarly deficit irrigation has been reported to delay the growth of summer maize and reduce dry matter accumulation resulting in significant yield reduction chilundo et al 2016 a lack of adequate water supply during the early stages of growth significantly affects the overgrowth of plants where water stress enhances the ability of plants to absorb n and thus increases n concentration in the plant sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 farooq et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2011 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 there is continuing debate on the potential of drought to inhibit nutrient absorption by crops and reduce their tissue concentration davari 2016 some studies have shown that insufficient soil moisture reduces leaf n content sinclair et al 2000 or causes no effect on n allocation to the stem singandhupe and rajput 1989 suggesting water stress to affect n allocation among organs such as leaf stem and grain therefore the trade off between biomass yield and n absorption still awaits extensive investigation in crops grown under irrigation forage crops including alfalfa differ a lot from traditional grain crops such as wheat in showing specific growth characteristics and productivity for instance alfalfa yield increases linearly with an increase in irrigation in the first year lindenmayer et al 2011 while the yield decreases with decreasing irrigation during all the stages of alfalfa growth liu et al 2021 reduced irrigation or drought stress increases n concentration in leaves zhang et al 2021 and improves forage quality liu et al 2021 however the allocation of biomass yield and n in forage crops may not necessarily occur in response to different irrigation levels as vegetative parts are harvested before reaching full maturity it is still not clear how irrigation may change n uptake by alfalfa by affecting n absorption and use efficiency or biomass growth soil n availability is reduced by leaching of n into deeper soil layers which is readily regulated by water supplies such as rainfall and irrigation liu et al 2018 soil n leaching is positively correlated with rainfall or irrigation sharma and manchanda 1996 zhang et al 2004 fang et al 2006 suggesting that n availability in the upper layers of soil may reduce with vast water supply in a short duration therefore drip irrigation can effectively reduce n loss into deeper layers of soil yu et al 2022 as it allows water supply to be slowed down and prolonged soil n present as nitrate easily migrates with water while soil n present as ammonium does not migrate easily with water song and li 2006 xiao et al 2019 if the water supply is insufficient and is dominated by evaporation soil n moves upward with rising water due to strong evaporation larocque and banton 1994 larsson and johnsson 2003 enhanced soil moisture also improves the absorption and transportation of n during plant growth and development yang et al 2020 which consequently reduces soil n availability in legumes water supply can also promote bnf which increases soil n availability liu et al 2011 li et al 2015a 2015b in comparison to grain crops forage crops show contrasting water requirements as well as consumption and evapotranspiration patterns which have various impacts on soil n availability liu et al 2022 only a few studies have elucidated changes in mineral n in soils of alfalfa grasslands subjected to controlled irrigation and its role in regulating n uptake by alfalfa this study aimed to test the hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation will not substantially decrease n uptake by alfalfa and will increase n use efficiency where both of these characteristics may be regulated by soil n availability in alfalfa grasslands to test this hypothesis a field trial was conducted with two irrigation systems and three irrigation levels in an inland arid area of china the objectives of the study were to explore the 1 effects of deficit irrigation on n uptake and utilization by alfalfa 2 effects of deficit irrigation on soil mineral n content in alfalfa grassland and 3 relationships of soil n availability with n uptake and use efficiency by alfalfa under irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2018 in suzhou district 98 80 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china this site has a continental arid climate with scarce precipitation the annual average temperature and annual reference evapotranspiration are 8 14 c 1954 2018 and 1730 mm 1954 2018 respectively the annual average rainfall is 88 mm 1954 2018 which is concentrated from june to october soil surface layer of 0 60 cm was classified as loamy sand with a bulk density of 1 51 g cm3 and ph value of 7 6 organic matter total n phosphorus p and potassium k contents of the soil were 3 1 0 22 0 24 and 7 6 g kg the local farming system is strongly dependent on irrigation with a one cropping mode a local economic crop lycium ruthenicum was sown in the field before this experiment 2 2 experimental layout and treatment before seeding 300 kg ha diammonium phosphate was applied as base fertilizer alfalfa xinnong no 3 seed was then sown in straight lines on 24 may 2017 with a seeding rate of 22 5 kg ha the seeding depth and row spaces were 2 0 and 20 0 cm respectively to ensure seed germination and seedling growth spray irrigation was performed every day and non woven fabrics were used to cover the plots irrigation was started when on average three true leaves emerged on the alfalfa seedlings the experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three irrigation treatments under two irrigation systems the irrigation systems were flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi the irrigation treatments included full irrigation for the whole growth period s1 slight water deficit irrigation for the whole growth period s2 70 of full irrigation and moderate water deficit irrigation for the whole growth period s3 50 of full irrigation there were three replicates per treatment the plot area for fi was 24 m2 6 m 4 m and it was 48 m2 6 m 8 m for sdi water meters were used to measure the amount of irrigation water and water deficit was imposed in each treatment the irrigation water amount in s1 was considered the standard according to which the irrigation water amount in s2 and s3 were set at 70 of s1 and 50 of s1 respectively the irrigation time in s1 was determined by measuring the available water content in the reference soil layer kuslu et al 2010 irrigation was carried out when the water content available in the reference soil layer 0 6 m deep in 2017 and 1 0 m deep in 2018 decreased to half of the total available water content generally in this area alfalfa root can grow to 60 cm below soil surface in the planting year and over 100 cm in the following years therefore in this study the reference soil layer was 60 cm in 2017 and 100 cm in 2018 which we believe is the rooting depth of alfalfa in this filed in the corresponding years the soil water content of each plot was measured every three days by a manual time domain reflectometry tdr instrument trime pico iph imko germany considering the distinct characteristics of water movement and consumption under the two irrigation systems the amount of individual irrigation supplied to s1 was 50 60 mm for fi and 30 40 mm for sdi the amount of irrigation at each cut was shown in table 1 2 3 sampling measurements and calculation plant samples were taken at the early flowering stage as two cuts in 2017 and three cuts in 2018 a 0 5 m long alfalfa row in each plot was randomly sampled at a stubble height of 5 cm with hand clippers the plant sample was oven dried at 120 c for 20 min and then 75 c for 48 h to obtain the dry weight brink et al 2010 the dried sample was ground into a fine powder that could pass through a 1 mm sieve for further laboratory testing meanwhile soil samples were obtained from different depths including 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 60 cm three soil cores were taken from each plot and mixed to obtain a composite soil sample for the plot all samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve total n tn concentration in the shoot was measured using the automatic kjeldahl method with a kjeldahl 8400 auto analyzer foss hilleroed denmark soil ammonium n san and nitrate n snn concentrations were determined by the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method with a spectrophotometer uv 2102 pcs shanghai spectrum instruments co shanghai china the n uptake n uptake kg ha of alfalfa shoot was calculated using the formula 1 n uptake tn y dm where ydm is the dry matter yield t ha the n use efficiency nue kg kg of alfalfa was calculated using the formula 2 nue y dm n uptake soil nutrient content snc kg m2 was calculated with the formula 3 snc i 1 n ρ i c i t i 100 where snc is snn or san content kg m2 ρ i denotes the bulk density g cm3 of the ith soil layer c i denotes the snn or san concentration mg kg in the ith soil layer t i denotes the thickness cm of the ith layer n denotes the number of soil layers 2 4 statistical analysis all data were plotted using excel 2016 two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of irrigation level and irrigation system on nuptake and nue of alfalfa and content of san and snn pairs of mean values were compared by the least significant difference at 5 1 and 0 1 levels in analyzing san and snn concentrations across irrigation treatments along with the soil depth the relationships of soil n availability with nuptake and nue of alfalfa were evaluated by linear or curvilinear regression 3 results 3 1 n uptake by the alfalfa shoot the irrigation system had a significant p 0 05 effect on n uptake by the shoot nuptake the deficit level of irrigation only affected nuptake in the year 2 alfalfa and there were no significant interactive effects table 2 the nuptake was significantly higher p 0 05 under fi than under sdi fig 1 with the increase in irrigation deficit nuptake decreased gradually under both irrigation systems there was a significant difference p 0 05 between s3 and s1 treatments in contrast there was no significant difference between s2 and s1 treatments the trend in each sample cut was similar for the two stands of alfalfa in addition nuptake was significantly lower p 0 05 in the first planting year than in the 2nd year the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation significantly affected the dry matter yield ydm of the year 2 alfalfa without having a significant interactive effect for tn content there was a significant effect of irrigation system only in the year 2 alfalfa while no significant effects of deficit level and interaction with the irrigation system were observed in either of the years table 3 the ydm was significantly higher p 0 05 under fi than under sdi while there was no solid trend for tn concentration under both irrigation systems ydm tended to decrease with an increase in the deficit level and significant differences p 0 05 were observed especially in year 2 alfalfa in contrast tn concentration showed minor change with increasing deficit levels the ydm of the 1st cut was always the highest among all the cuts however tn concentration of the 1st cut was the lowest and increased with cut it was higher in the younger stand of alfalfa 3 2 n allocation in stems and leaves of alfalfa the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation imposed no significant effects on tn concentrations in the stem and leaves of year 2 alfalfa table 4 in the stem there were significances p 0 05 in the tn concentration which tended to increase with cuts especially under sdi in the leaf the highest tn concentration was measured in the 2nd cut and the lowest was in the 1st cut a significant interactive effect of irrigation system and deficit level was observed only in the ratio of stem tn concentration to the leaf tn concentration table 4 under fi the stem tn leaf tn ratios of the s3 treatment were significantly higher p 0 05 in the first two cuts than those in the s1 treatment while under sdi the ratios of s3 treatment tended to be the lowest the stem tn leaf tn ratio in the 3rd cut was the highest among the three cuts and there were few differences between the first two cuts irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation significantly affected nuptake by the stem and leaves of the year 2 alfalfa without interactive effects table 5 similar to nuptake by the shoot fig 1 the stem and leaves also had significantly higher nuptake under fi than under sdi except for nuptake by the leaves in the 3rd cut table 5 the nuptake by the stem and leaves tended to decrease with an increase in the deficit level under both systems significant differences were observed particularly in the first two cuts of the stems and in the 1st cut for leaves p 0 05 in these cases nuptake was significantly lower p 0 05 under the s3 treatment than the s1 treatment nuptake by the stem tended to significantly decrease with cuts p 0 05 only in s1 and s2 treatments under fi while nuptake by the leaves barely changed in most cases nuptake by the leaves tended to be higher in the 3rd cut than in the rest of the cuts under sdi 3 3 n use efficiency of alfalfa and its correlation with irrigation only the irrigation system significantly affected n use efficiency nue of the year 2 alfalfa where it was higher under fi than under sdi table 6 under fi the nue of the year 2 alfalfa was higher than that under sdi in most cases while in the planting first year it barely changed the nue of the year 2 alfalfa tended to decrease with an increase in deficit level of irrigation and significant differences p 0 05 were observed between the 2nd and 3rd cuts from the s1 and s3 treatments under fi in addition nue decreased with cuts in both years it was significantly higher p 0 05 in the 1st cut than in the other cuts 3 4 soil nitrate n the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation had significant effects on the snn content in the planting year without interactive effects while only the deficit level had a significant effect in the 2nd year table 7 the fi led to higher p 0 05 snn content than the sdi in the planting year fig 2 with an increase in the deficit level snn content tended to decrease under both irrigation systems especially under the deficit irrigation treatments and or in the year 2 alfalfa grassland with the growth of alfalfa snn content showed contrasting trends under the two irrigation systems it increased with crop growth under the s1 treatment with fi in contrast it decreased and then increased under deficit irrigation treatments there was an increase in growth under s1 and s2 treatments with sdi while growth decreased and then increased under the s3 treatment with sdi change in snn concentration across the soil depth was affected differently by varying deficit levels of irrigation the snn also varied between the two irrigation systems and or the two stands of alfalfa fig 3 under fi the s1 treatment showed minor changes in the snn concentration of the 0 40 cm soil layers in the planting year while snn concentration decreased significantly in 40 60 cm layers fig 3a in contrast deficit irrigation s2 and s3 treatments exhibited an increase and then a decrease in the snn concentration in the 0 60 cm layers the snn concentration in the 0 10 cm layer was significantly higher under the s1 treatment than under the s2 and s3 treatments it was significantly lower p 0 05 in the 20 60 cm layers of the s1 treatment than those of the s2 treatment the snn concentration in the 30 60 cm layers under the s3 treatment was also higher than those under the s1 treatment while there were no significant differences in the 0 30 cm layers under sdi s1 and s3 treatments exhibited an increase followed by a decrease and then again an increase in the snn concentration across the soil depth in the planting year the s2 treatment led to a decrease and then an increase in the snn fig 3b the snn in the 0 10 cm layer was higher under deficit irrigation treatments than in the s1 treatment while it was lower in the 30 60 cm layers in the year 2 alfalfa grassland the snn concentration decreased and then increased in the 0 60 cm soil layers of all irrigation treatments under fi fig 3c the snn concentration in the 0 10 cm layer was higher under the s1 treatment than that under the deficit irrigation treatments in contrast it was lower in the 10 30 cm layers the snn concentration was higher in the 10 30 cm layers and lower in the 30 60 cm layers of the s2 treatment than that in the s1 and s3 treatments in contrast s1 and s2 treatments with sdi increased and then a decrease in the snn concentration with deepening soil layer in the 2nd year the s3 treatment led to a decrease and then an increase in the snn concentration fig 3d the snn concentration under deficit irrigation treatments was higher in the 0 20 cm layer than that under the s1 treatment and their own 20 60 cm layers it was also lower in the s3 treatment than that in the s2 treatment 3 5 soil ammonium n irrigation system deficit level of irrigation and the interaction had significant effects on san content only in the planting year while there was no significant effect in the 2nd year table 7 in the planting year the san content under fi was higher than that under the sdi fig 4 the san content decreased with an increase in the deficit level under fi in the planting year while it decreased and then increased under the sdi with the growth of alfalfa san content decreased under all irrigation treatments of fi while it increased only under s2 treatment of sdi and remained stable under other treatments change in san concentration along the soil depth was affected variously by deficit levels of irrigation which varied between the two systems and or the two stands of alfalfa as well fig 5 under fi with soil depth both the s1 and s3 treatments led to an increase followed by a decrease and finally an increase in the san concentration in the planting year while san concentration simply decreased in the s2 treatment fig 5a the san concentrations was significantly lower p 0 05 in the 10 60 cm soil layers of the deficit irrigation treatments than in the s1 treatment while san concentration in the 0 10 cm soil layer under the s2 treatment was higher than that under s1 and s3 treatments under sdi san concentration in the 0 60 cm soil layers tended to increase followed by a decrease and finally an increase with various amplitudes in the planting year fig 5b the san concentration in each soil layer under the s2 treatment was lower than that under the s1 and s3 treatments while san concentration under the s3 treatment was higher in the 0 20 cm layers than that under the s1 treatment in the 2nd year s1 and s2 treatments led to an increase and then a decrease in the san concentration along with the soil depth under fi while the s3 treatment led to a decrease in the san concentration however there were only a few differences between the deficit levels of irrigation fig 5c in contrast s1 treatment under the sdi led to a decrease followed by an increase and then a decrease in the san concentration while in the s2 treatment increased and then decreased this trend san concentration which is opposite to changes ins3 treatment in the 2nd year fig 5d the san concentration under the s3 treatment was significantly lower p 0 05 than that under the s1 and s2 treatments the san concentration in 10 40 cm soil layers was higher under the s2 treatment than under the s1 treatment fig 5 3 6 correlations between n uptake and n use efficiency of alfalfa and soil mineral n content there were no significant correlations of snn content with nuptake by alfalfa fig 6a under both irrigation systems the relationships of san content with nuptake by alfalfa could be fitted well using quadratic functions fi r2 0 5685 sdi r2 0 3269 but the correlation was significant p 0 05 only under fi fig 6b these observations suggest that san content decreased as nuptake by alfalfa increased especially under fi there were no significant relationships of snn content with the nue of alfalfa fig 6c in contrast the correlation of san content with nue of alfalfa could be fitted well using quadratic functions fi r2 0 8456 sdi r2 0 799 under the two irrigation systems fig 6d both correlations were significant p 0 001 however under fi the correlation was positive while under sdi the correlation was negative suggesting that san content decreased with increasing nue of alfalfa under both irrigation systems 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deficit irrigation on n uptake of alfalfa the nuptake is fundamental for plant n metabolism and growth and is readily affected by available water in the soil generally soil n cannot be absorbed unless it is present in a soluble form therefore plant n absorption is affected by soil water availability that in turn affects the capacity and or absorption by the plant fan et al 2001 hamoud et al 2019 irrigation is a critical management strategy to produce more crop yield eissa et al 2018 li et al 2021a 2021b past studies have also shown that irrigation can improve nuptake by alfalfa zhang et al 2021 in this study decreasing deficit levels of irrigation tended to increase nuptake by alfalfa under both irrigation systems confirming previous findings slight deficit irrigation barely reduced nuptake by alfalfa which partly proved our hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation would not strongly decrease nuptake by alfalfa in addition nuptake by the stem and leaves in the 2nd year tended to decrease with increasing deficit level of irrigation but declined only slightly under slight deficit irrigation corroborating our findings we found that ydm increased with decreasing deficit levels of irrigation which has also been reported in past studies li and huang 2008 liu et al 2021 furthermore slight deficit irrigation led to a minor reduction in ydm sustained biomass accumulation enhances the capability of the shoot for nuptake under a slight water deficit in contrast tn concentration in alfalfa shoot barely changed and even decreased with increasing irrigation water amount in the last two cuts of this study which indirectly implied that the capability for absorbing more n was enhanced this also indicated the possibility of the dilution effect to occur due to rapid growth scholberg et al 2002 zhao et al 2020 nitrogen allocation in alfalfa stem and leaves is an important index that reflects the extent to which n supply satisfies growth girousse et al 2005 in this study both the tn concentrations in the stem and leaves of the plants from the 2nd year of this study barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation under the two irrigation systems this was inconsistent with the previous findings whereby drought stress increased n concentration in stems and or leaves aaltonen et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 the accumulation of photosynthetic products increases with relatively adequate water supply field et al 1992 imposing a dilution effect on plant n and reducing the leaf n concentration sinclair et al 2000 the effect of drought stress on n allocation in plant organs varies with the crop types or experimental conditions zhang et al 2021 however as the degree of water deficit increased the ratio of tn concentration in the stem to the tn concentration in the leaves showed an increasing trend under fi and a decreasing trend under sdi during the 2nd year slight deficit irrigation treatment led to the highest ratios only in the 1st cut due to the higher stem tn concentration and lowered leaf tn concentration under this deficit level of irrigation these observations suggest that the dilution effect likely worked on leaf n which is consistent with our observations on shoot n the inhibitory effect of water stress on stem growth is stronger than that on the leaf growth while water stress can improve n allocation to alfalfa leaves zhang et al 2021 4 2 effect of deficit irrigation on n use efficiency of alfalfa the nue sheds light on the productivity of a plant and is readily influenced by environmental variables including the soil water status chilundo et al 2016 atwill et al 2018 jia et al 2021 gheysari et al 2009 found higher average nue under irrigation deficits of 15 and 30 in silage maize chilundo et al 2016 found that nue tended to be higher at the 75 irrigation level in this study the nue of alfalfa barely changed with an increase in the deficit level of irrigation and tended to decrease in the 2nd year this partly contradicted our hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation should increase nue the nue of alfalfa decreases with increasing n levels but increases with an increase in the amount of water applied du et al 2017 as mentioned the tn concentration of alfalfa changed slightly with the deficit level of irrigation in this study leading to an unchanged nue this is likely because more water supply leads to dilution or leaching of plant n thus decreasing nue scholberg et al 2002 it may also be attributed to the effect of the irrigation method on the migration and transformation of n in plants which in turn affects the nue sun et al 2012 in addition the nue of the year 2 alfalfa was higher under fi than sdi in most cases this is in accordance with previous findings that reported furrow irrigation to lead to higher nue than drip irrigation chilundo et al 2016 4 3 effect of deficit irrigation on soil mineral n the supply of soil mineral n mainly in the forms of nitrate n and ammonium n is readily affected by soil water zhou et al 2011 yuan et al 2013 nitrate n is easily adsorbed on soil particles due to its negative charge but has strong mobility and thus it can easily migrate with water flux contrarily ammonium n does not readily migrate with soil water xiao et al 2019 sharma and manchanda 1996 found that the downward movement of nitrate n was quite consistent with the movement of water and the leaching amount and migration intensity also increased with an increase in water flux zhang et al 2004 found that precipitation was the main driving force for soil n migration in the loess areas furthermore nitrate n infiltration depth increased with increasing water content in this study there were inconsistent effects of irrigation treatments on snn and san contents and the most significant differences were observed in the planting year under fi snn content increased and then decreased with the deficit level of irrigation in the 1st cut of the planting year and the 2nd cut of year 2 no significant difference was observed among the deficit levels of irrigation under sdi therefore full irrigation under fi may lead to snn loss into the deeper soils which is in accordance with previous findings sharma and manchanda 1996 zhang et al 2004 moderate deficit irrigation could have led to severe impairment of bnf and n mineralization wang et al 2010 resulting in lower snn content similarly it was assumed here that different deficit levels of sdi would affect snn in the presence of a slower and more even supply of water in the soil leading to unchanged snn content in contrast san content decreased with the deficit level of irrigation under fi it decreased and then increased under sdi only in the planting year while there was no significant change with the deficit level of irrigation in the 2nd year slight water deficit led to a decrease in the san content and aided in absorption to meet stable growth requirement with ammonium n also evidenced by stable ydm different responses to moderate water deficit between the two irrigation systems could be attributed to stronger absorption by higher ydm under fi than sdi however san content exhibited low levels in the 2nd year under both irrigation systems which could mainly be attributed to the restricted availability in soils the inorganic n in soils accounted for only a small proportion of total soil n wang and dai 2000 the uptake of nitrate and ammonium n by plants is an antagonistic process lee and drew 1989 alfalfa has been reported to absorb ammonium n more easily than nitrate n gazzarrini et al 1999 while ammonium n tends to not readily leach out the migration of soil n with water flux and absorption by plants resulted in different trends of the distribution of soil n across the soil depth tao 2016 in this study under fi snn concentration tended to increase till 40 cm depth in the planting year and was significantly higher in the 40 60 cm soil layers than in the upper layers in the 2nd year suggesting that an obvious snn leaching happened in contrast snn concentration under sdi barely changed with soil depth in the planting year and was higher in the 20 40 cm soil layers than in the upper layers in the 2nd year indicating the occurrence of late and weak leaching however san concentration changed little across soil depths these findings are in agreement with previous reports on more rapid snn infiltration with water flux compared to san infiltration xiao et al 2019 in addition the deficit levels of irrigation affected the distribution of snn and san differently which was regulated by the irrigation system we could not identify strong tendencies implying that further investigation is needed in this regard additionally low san concentrations was observed under both irrigation systems in the 2nd year suggesting that there might be relatively complete exhaustion of san and thus a shortage of san supply 4 4 correlation between n uptake by alfalfa and soil mineral n content plants have a variety of absorption and transportation systems and utilization methods for snn and san the energy required by the plant to assimilate these two forms of n also differs caicedo et al 2000 the uptake of one of the forms by the plant is antagonistic to the uptake of the other lee and drew 1989 gherardi et al 2013 plants are more likely to absorb san when both forms are in physical access gazzarrini et al 1999 these differences may lead to various responses of the two n forms to environmental factors including soil water miller and cramer 2005 xia et al 2020 as a consequence their responses may result in different nuptake as well as different relationships between nuptake and available soil n content alt et al 2000 maeda et al 2018 in this study san content decreased with the increase in shoot nuptake while no significant relationship was observed between snn content and nuptake by alfalfa similarly san content was significantly correlated with nue of alfalfa whereby it decreased with increasing nue while no significant relationship was observed between snn content and nue of alfalfa this could be attributed to the fact that during growth alfalfa plants preferably consume san which appeared to be insufficient to meet the growth requirement on the contrary snn seemed to be relatively adequate which was evidenced by the increase in its content from the 2nd to the 3rd cut in the year 2 alfalfa these findings partly proved our hypothesis 5 conclusions nitrogen uptake by the shoot stem and leaves decreased with an increase in the deficit level of irrigation but slight deficit irrigation 70 of full irrigation barely reduced n uptake as compared to the full irrigation deficit irrigation led to a decrease in dry matter yield especially in the 2nd year but slight deficit irrigation reduced it only slightly in contrast total n concentration in the shoot stem and leaves barely changed with the difference in the deficit level of irrigation suggesting that biomass growth rather than change in n concentration play a major role in regulating n uptake nitrogen use efficiency of alfalfa barely changed with deficit levels of irrigation although there was a lowering tendency in the 2nd year there were significant correlations between n uptake and n use efficiency of alfalfa with soil ammonium n content suggesting this form of n is relatively short lived and nitrate n may be adequate to meet the growth requirement of alfalfa in addition differences in n uptake n use efficiency and soil mineral n existed among irrigation systems and stand ages of alfalfa which still requires extensive investigation to be understood better in practice slight deficit irrigation is recommended in alfalfa production in the inland arid area of

moisture for crop production however responses of n uptake and soil mineral n to deficit irrigation are not yet clear in alfalfa grasslands a 2 year trial with alfalfa was carried out using two irrigation systems flood and subsurface drip irrigations at three irrigation levels full irrigation slight water deficit irrigation 70 of full irrigation and moderate water deficit irrigation 50 of full irrigation for the whole growth period the n uptake nuptake and n use efficiency nue of alfalfa as well as the soil mineral n were measured the nuptake by plant organs decreased with increasing deficit level of irrigation but slight deficit irrigation barely reduced nuptake as compared to full irrigation deficit irrigation led to a decrease in dry matter yield especially in the 2nd year but slight deficit irrigation reduced it little in contrast total n concentration in plant organs barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation suggesting that biomass growth rather than change in n concentration may play a major role in regulating nuptake the nue of alfalfa barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation although there was a decreasing tendency in the 2nd year there were significant correlations between nuptake and nue of alfalfa with soil ammonium n content suggesting that this form of n is relatively short lived and nitrate n may be adequate to meet the growth requirement of alfalfa in practice it is recommended that slight deficit irrigation should be set up during alfalfa production in the inland arid area of china keywords alfalfa arid area irrigation nitrogen uptake soil nitrogen availability 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l is a well known perennial forage crop that covers the largest planting area in the world it is fundamental to livestock husbandry due to its high yield rich protein content and palatability wagle et al 2019 this leguminous crop can adapt to diverse and adverse environments particularly it shows good performance in n poor habitats due to its strong capability for biological n2 fixation bnf grewal and williams 2003 liu et al 2011 in recent years the area cultivated with alfalfa has continued to expand in arid and semi arid regions due to the development of the livestock industry feng et al 2016 and an increase in the demand for ecological reconstruction li et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2017 although alfalfa has strong adaptability for wide ranging water conditions high water consumption by it often leads to yield reduction under water stress lamm et al 2012 which greatly restricts its cultivation and extensive use for instance in china alfalfa is mainly distributed in the north especially in arid areas where water stress has long been the main limiting factor for the survival and production of many plants including alfalfa ni 2004 kuslu et al 2010 liu et al 2022 under such conditions irrigation can not only enhance soil water moisture but also improve the availability of soil nutrients making it an efficient management strategy for sustaining crop production however water driven movement and use of nutrients raun et al 1999 suescun et al 2021 in alfalfa grassland under irrigation is yet to be understood fully a deeper understanding of changes in nitrogen n supply and utilization under irrigation is of great importance to optimize the management of irrigation and fertilization for enhanced alfalfa performance and production irrigation can improve crop performance by increasing yield and n uptake kunrath et al 2018 increases in irrigation amount have been reported to cause increases in wheat grain yield li et al 2021a 2021b wang et al 2020 huang et al 2005 garabet et al 1998 eissa 2018 found that drip irrigation with 100 of the water demand could increase wheat growth nutrient uptake and biological yield compared to the lower levels of irrigation irrigation with 75 of the water demand led to an 18 22 higher wheat yield compared to irrigation with 100 of the water demand this suggests that restricted irrigation influences biomass accumulation and allocation among plant organs which might lead to increased grain yield in grain crops similarly deficit irrigation has been reported to delay the growth of summer maize and reduce dry matter accumulation resulting in significant yield reduction chilundo et al 2016 a lack of adequate water supply during the early stages of growth significantly affects the overgrowth of plants where water stress enhances the ability of plants to absorb n and thus increases n concentration in the plant sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 farooq et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2011 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 there is continuing debate on the potential of drought to inhibit nutrient absorption by crops and reduce their tissue concentration davari 2016 some studies have shown that insufficient soil moisture reduces leaf n content sinclair et al 2000 or causes no effect on n allocation to the stem singandhupe and rajput 1989 suggesting water stress to affect n allocation among organs such as leaf stem and grain therefore the trade off between biomass yield and n absorption still awaits extensive investigation in crops grown under irrigation forage crops including alfalfa differ a lot from traditional grain crops such as wheat in showing specific growth characteristics and productivity for instance alfalfa yield increases linearly with an increase in irrigation in the first year lindenmayer et al 2011 while the yield decreases with decreasing irrigation during all the stages of alfalfa growth liu et al 2021 reduced irrigation or drought stress increases n concentration in leaves zhang et al 2021 and improves forage quality liu et al 2021 however the allocation of biomass yield and n in forage crops may not necessarily occur in response to different irrigation levels as vegetative parts are harvested before reaching full maturity it is still not clear how irrigation may change n uptake by alfalfa by affecting n absorption and use efficiency or biomass growth soil n availability is reduced by leaching of n into deeper soil layers which is readily regulated by water supplies such as rainfall and irrigation liu et al 2018 soil n leaching is positively correlated with rainfall or irrigation sharma and manchanda 1996 zhang et al 2004 fang et al 2006 suggesting that n availability in the upper layers of soil may reduce with vast water supply in a short duration therefore drip irrigation can effectively reduce n loss into deeper layers of soil yu et al 2022 as it allows water supply to be slowed down and prolonged soil n present as nitrate easily migrates with water while soil n present as ammonium does not migrate easily with water song and li 2006 xiao et al 2019 if the water supply is insufficient and is dominated by evaporation soil n moves upward with rising water due to strong evaporation larocque and banton 1994 larsson and johnsson 2003 enhanced soil moisture also improves the absorption and transportation of n during plant growth and development yang et al 2020 which consequently reduces soil n availability in legumes water supply can also promote bnf which increases soil n availability liu et al 2011 li et al 2015a 2015b in comparison to grain crops forage crops show contrasting water requirements as well as consumption and evapotranspiration patterns which have various impacts on soil n availability liu et al 2022 only a few studies have elucidated changes in mineral n in soils of alfalfa grasslands subjected to controlled irrigation and its role in regulating n uptake by alfalfa this study aimed to test the hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation will not substantially decrease n uptake by alfalfa and will increase n use efficiency where both of these characteristics may be regulated by soil n availability in alfalfa grasslands to test this hypothesis a field trial was conducted with two irrigation systems and three irrigation levels in an inland arid area of china the objectives of the study were to explore the 1 effects of deficit irrigation on n uptake and utilization by alfalfa 2 effects of deficit irrigation on soil mineral n content in alfalfa grassland and 3 relationships of soil n availability with n uptake and use efficiency by alfalfa under irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2018 in suzhou district 98 80 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china this site has a continental arid climate with scarce precipitation the annual average temperature and annual reference evapotranspiration are 8 14 c 1954 2018 and 1730 mm 1954 2018 respectively the annual average rainfall is 88 mm 1954 2018 which is concentrated from june to october soil surface layer of 0 60 cm was classified as loamy sand with a bulk density of 1 51 g cm3 and ph value of 7 6 organic matter total n phosphorus p and potassium k contents of the soil were 3 1 0 22 0 24 and 7 6 g kg the local farming system is strongly dependent on irrigation with a one cropping mode a local economic crop lycium ruthenicum was sown in the field before this experiment 2 2 experimental layout and treatment before seeding 300 kg ha diammonium phosphate was applied as base fertilizer alfalfa xinnong no 3 seed was then sown in straight lines on 24 may 2017 with a seeding rate of 22 5 kg ha the seeding depth and row spaces were 2 0 and 20 0 cm respectively to ensure seed germination and seedling growth spray irrigation was performed every day and non woven fabrics were used to cover the plots irrigation was started when on average three true leaves emerged on the alfalfa seedlings the experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three irrigation treatments under two irrigation systems the irrigation systems were flood irrigation fi and subsurface drip irrigation sdi the irrigation treatments included full irrigation for the whole growth period s1 slight water deficit irrigation for the whole growth period s2 70 of full irrigation and moderate water deficit irrigation for the whole growth period s3 50 of full irrigation there were three replicates per treatment the plot area for fi was 24 m2 6 m 4 m and it was 48 m2 6 m 8 m for sdi water meters were used to measure the amount of irrigation water and water deficit was imposed in each treatment the irrigation water amount in s1 was considered the standard according to which the irrigation water amount in s2 and s3 were set at 70 of s1 and 50 of s1 respectively the irrigation time in s1 was determined by measuring the available water content in the reference soil layer kuslu et al 2010 irrigation was carried out when the water content available in the reference soil layer 0 6 m deep in 2017 and 1 0 m deep in 2018 decreased to half of the total available water content generally in this area alfalfa root can grow to 60 cm below soil surface in the planting year and over 100 cm in the following years therefore in this study the reference soil layer was 60 cm in 2017 and 100 cm in 2018 which we believe is the rooting depth of alfalfa in this filed in the corresponding years the soil water content of each plot was measured every three days by a manual time domain reflectometry tdr instrument trime pico iph imko germany considering the distinct characteristics of water movement and consumption under the two irrigation systems the amount of individual irrigation supplied to s1 was 50 60 mm for fi and 30 40 mm for sdi the amount of irrigation at each cut was shown in table 1 2 3 sampling measurements and calculation plant samples were taken at the early flowering stage as two cuts in 2017 and three cuts in 2018 a 0 5 m long alfalfa row in each plot was randomly sampled at a stubble height of 5 cm with hand clippers the plant sample was oven dried at 120 c for 20 min and then 75 c for 48 h to obtain the dry weight brink et al 2010 the dried sample was ground into a fine powder that could pass through a 1 mm sieve for further laboratory testing meanwhile soil samples were obtained from different depths including 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 60 cm three soil cores were taken from each plot and mixed to obtain a composite soil sample for the plot all samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve total n tn concentration in the shoot was measured using the automatic kjeldahl method with a kjeldahl 8400 auto analyzer foss hilleroed denmark soil ammonium n san and nitrate n snn concentrations were determined by the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method with a spectrophotometer uv 2102 pcs shanghai spectrum instruments co shanghai china the n uptake n uptake kg ha of alfalfa shoot was calculated using the formula 1 n uptake tn y dm where ydm is the dry matter yield t ha the n use efficiency nue kg kg of alfalfa was calculated using the formula 2 nue y dm n uptake soil nutrient content snc kg m2 was calculated with the formula 3 snc i 1 n ρ i c i t i 100 where snc is snn or san content kg m2 ρ i denotes the bulk density g cm3 of the ith soil layer c i denotes the snn or san concentration mg kg in the ith soil layer t i denotes the thickness cm of the ith layer n denotes the number of soil layers 2 4 statistical analysis all data were plotted using excel 2016 two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of irrigation level and irrigation system on nuptake and nue of alfalfa and content of san and snn pairs of mean values were compared by the least significant difference at 5 1 and 0 1 levels in analyzing san and snn concentrations across irrigation treatments along with the soil depth the relationships of soil n availability with nuptake and nue of alfalfa were evaluated by linear or curvilinear regression 3 results 3 1 n uptake by the alfalfa shoot the irrigation system had a significant p 0 05 effect on n uptake by the shoot nuptake the deficit level of irrigation only affected nuptake in the year 2 alfalfa and there were no significant interactive effects table 2 the nuptake was significantly higher p 0 05 under fi than under sdi fig 1 with the increase in irrigation deficit nuptake decreased gradually under both irrigation systems there was a significant difference p 0 05 between s3 and s1 treatments in contrast there was no significant difference between s2 and s1 treatments the trend in each sample cut was similar for the two stands of alfalfa in addition nuptake was significantly lower p 0 05 in the first planting year than in the 2nd year the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation significantly affected the dry matter yield ydm of the year 2 alfalfa without having a significant interactive effect for tn content there was a significant effect of irrigation system only in the year 2 alfalfa while no significant effects of deficit level and interaction with the irrigation system were observed in either of the years table 3 the ydm was significantly higher p 0 05 under fi than under sdi while there was no solid trend for tn concentration under both irrigation systems ydm tended to decrease with an increase in the deficit level and significant differences p 0 05 were observed especially in year 2 alfalfa in contrast tn concentration showed minor change with increasing deficit levels the ydm of the 1st cut was always the highest among all the cuts however tn concentration of the 1st cut was the lowest and increased with cut it was higher in the younger stand of alfalfa 3 2 n allocation in stems and leaves of alfalfa the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation imposed no significant effects on tn concentrations in the stem and leaves of year 2 alfalfa table 4 in the stem there were significances p 0 05 in the tn concentration which tended to increase with cuts especially under sdi in the leaf the highest tn concentration was measured in the 2nd cut and the lowest was in the 1st cut a significant interactive effect of irrigation system and deficit level was observed only in the ratio of stem tn concentration to the leaf tn concentration table 4 under fi the stem tn leaf tn ratios of the s3 treatment were significantly higher p 0 05 in the first two cuts than those in the s1 treatment while under sdi the ratios of s3 treatment tended to be the lowest the stem tn leaf tn ratio in the 3rd cut was the highest among the three cuts and there were few differences between the first two cuts irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation significantly affected nuptake by the stem and leaves of the year 2 alfalfa without interactive effects table 5 similar to nuptake by the shoot fig 1 the stem and leaves also had significantly higher nuptake under fi than under sdi except for nuptake by the leaves in the 3rd cut table 5 the nuptake by the stem and leaves tended to decrease with an increase in the deficit level under both systems significant differences were observed particularly in the first two cuts of the stems and in the 1st cut for leaves p 0 05 in these cases nuptake was significantly lower p 0 05 under the s3 treatment than the s1 treatment nuptake by the stem tended to significantly decrease with cuts p 0 05 only in s1 and s2 treatments under fi while nuptake by the leaves barely changed in most cases nuptake by the leaves tended to be higher in the 3rd cut than in the rest of the cuts under sdi 3 3 n use efficiency of alfalfa and its correlation with irrigation only the irrigation system significantly affected n use efficiency nue of the year 2 alfalfa where it was higher under fi than under sdi table 6 under fi the nue of the year 2 alfalfa was higher than that under sdi in most cases while in the planting first year it barely changed the nue of the year 2 alfalfa tended to decrease with an increase in deficit level of irrigation and significant differences p 0 05 were observed between the 2nd and 3rd cuts from the s1 and s3 treatments under fi in addition nue decreased with cuts in both years it was significantly higher p 0 05 in the 1st cut than in the other cuts 3 4 soil nitrate n the irrigation system and deficit level of irrigation had significant effects on the snn content in the planting year without interactive effects while only the deficit level had a significant effect in the 2nd year table 7 the fi led to higher p 0 05 snn content than the sdi in the planting year fig 2 with an increase in the deficit level snn content tended to decrease under both irrigation systems especially under the deficit irrigation treatments and or in the year 2 alfalfa grassland with the growth of alfalfa snn content showed contrasting trends under the two irrigation systems it increased with crop growth under the s1 treatment with fi in contrast it decreased and then increased under deficit irrigation treatments there was an increase in growth under s1 and s2 treatments with sdi while growth decreased and then increased under the s3 treatment with sdi change in snn concentration across the soil depth was affected differently by varying deficit levels of irrigation the snn also varied between the two irrigation systems and or the two stands of alfalfa fig 3 under fi the s1 treatment showed minor changes in the snn concentration of the 0 40 cm soil layers in the planting year while snn concentration decreased significantly in 40 60 cm layers fig 3a in contrast deficit irrigation s2 and s3 treatments exhibited an increase and then a decrease in the snn concentration in the 0 60 cm layers the snn concentration in the 0 10 cm layer was significantly higher under the s1 treatment than under the s2 and s3 treatments it was significantly lower p 0 05 in the 20 60 cm layers of the s1 treatment than those of the s2 treatment the snn concentration in the 30 60 cm layers under the s3 treatment was also higher than those under the s1 treatment while there were no significant differences in the 0 30 cm layers under sdi s1 and s3 treatments exhibited an increase followed by a decrease and then again an increase in the snn concentration across the soil depth in the planting year the s2 treatment led to a decrease and then an increase in the snn fig 3b the snn in the 0 10 cm layer was higher under deficit irrigation treatments than in the s1 treatment while it was lower in the 30 60 cm layers in the year 2 alfalfa grassland the snn concentration decreased and then increased in the 0 60 cm soil layers of all irrigation treatments under fi fig 3c the snn concentration in the 0 10 cm layer was higher under the s1 treatment than that under the deficit irrigation treatments in contrast it was lower in the 10 30 cm layers the snn concentration was higher in the 10 30 cm layers and lower in the 30 60 cm layers of the s2 treatment than that in the s1 and s3 treatments in contrast s1 and s2 treatments with sdi increased and then a decrease in the snn concentration with deepening soil layer in the 2nd year the s3 treatment led to a decrease and then an increase in the snn concentration fig 3d the snn concentration under deficit irrigation treatments was higher in the 0 20 cm layer than that under the s1 treatment and their own 20 60 cm layers it was also lower in the s3 treatment than that in the s2 treatment 3 5 soil ammonium n irrigation system deficit level of irrigation and the interaction had significant effects on san content only in the planting year while there was no significant effect in the 2nd year table 7 in the planting year the san content under fi was higher than that under the sdi fig 4 the san content decreased with an increase in the deficit level under fi in the planting year while it decreased and then increased under the sdi with the growth of alfalfa san content decreased under all irrigation treatments of fi while it increased only under s2 treatment of sdi and remained stable under other treatments change in san concentration along the soil depth was affected variously by deficit levels of irrigation which varied between the two systems and or the two stands of alfalfa as well fig 5 under fi with soil depth both the s1 and s3 treatments led to an increase followed by a decrease and finally an increase in the san concentration in the planting year while san concentration simply decreased in the s2 treatment fig 5a the san concentrations was significantly lower p 0 05 in the 10 60 cm soil layers of the deficit irrigation treatments than in the s1 treatment while san concentration in the 0 10 cm soil layer under the s2 treatment was higher than that under s1 and s3 treatments under sdi san concentration in the 0 60 cm soil layers tended to increase followed by a decrease and finally an increase with various amplitudes in the planting year fig 5b the san concentration in each soil layer under the s2 treatment was lower than that under the s1 and s3 treatments while san concentration under the s3 treatment was higher in the 0 20 cm layers than that under the s1 treatment in the 2nd year s1 and s2 treatments led to an increase and then a decrease in the san concentration along with the soil depth under fi while the s3 treatment led to a decrease in the san concentration however there were only a few differences between the deficit levels of irrigation fig 5c in contrast s1 treatment under the sdi led to a decrease followed by an increase and then a decrease in the san concentration while in the s2 treatment increased and then decreased this trend san concentration which is opposite to changes ins3 treatment in the 2nd year fig 5d the san concentration under the s3 treatment was significantly lower p 0 05 than that under the s1 and s2 treatments the san concentration in 10 40 cm soil layers was higher under the s2 treatment than under the s1 treatment fig 5 3 6 correlations between n uptake and n use efficiency of alfalfa and soil mineral n content there were no significant correlations of snn content with nuptake by alfalfa fig 6a under both irrigation systems the relationships of san content with nuptake by alfalfa could be fitted well using quadratic functions fi r2 0 5685 sdi r2 0 3269 but the correlation was significant p 0 05 only under fi fig 6b these observations suggest that san content decreased as nuptake by alfalfa increased especially under fi there were no significant relationships of snn content with the nue of alfalfa fig 6c in contrast the correlation of san content with nue of alfalfa could be fitted well using quadratic functions fi r2 0 8456 sdi r2 0 799 under the two irrigation systems fig 6d both correlations were significant p 0 001 however under fi the correlation was positive while under sdi the correlation was negative suggesting that san content decreased with increasing nue of alfalfa under both irrigation systems 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deficit irrigation on n uptake of alfalfa the nuptake is fundamental for plant n metabolism and growth and is readily affected by available water in the soil generally soil n cannot be absorbed unless it is present in a soluble form therefore plant n absorption is affected by soil water availability that in turn affects the capacity and or absorption by the plant fan et al 2001 hamoud et al 2019 irrigation is a critical management strategy to produce more crop yield eissa et al 2018 li et al 2021a 2021b past studies have also shown that irrigation can improve nuptake by alfalfa zhang et al 2021 in this study decreasing deficit levels of irrigation tended to increase nuptake by alfalfa under both irrigation systems confirming previous findings slight deficit irrigation barely reduced nuptake by alfalfa which partly proved our hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation would not strongly decrease nuptake by alfalfa in addition nuptake by the stem and leaves in the 2nd year tended to decrease with increasing deficit level of irrigation but declined only slightly under slight deficit irrigation corroborating our findings we found that ydm increased with decreasing deficit levels of irrigation which has also been reported in past studies li and huang 2008 liu et al 2021 furthermore slight deficit irrigation led to a minor reduction in ydm sustained biomass accumulation enhances the capability of the shoot for nuptake under a slight water deficit in contrast tn concentration in alfalfa shoot barely changed and even decreased with increasing irrigation water amount in the last two cuts of this study which indirectly implied that the capability for absorbing more n was enhanced this also indicated the possibility of the dilution effect to occur due to rapid growth scholberg et al 2002 zhao et al 2020 nitrogen allocation in alfalfa stem and leaves is an important index that reflects the extent to which n supply satisfies growth girousse et al 2005 in this study both the tn concentrations in the stem and leaves of the plants from the 2nd year of this study barely changed with the deficit level of irrigation under the two irrigation systems this was inconsistent with the previous findings whereby drought stress increased n concentration in stems and or leaves aaltonen et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 the accumulation of photosynthetic products increases with relatively adequate water supply field et al 1992 imposing a dilution effect on plant n and reducing the leaf n concentration sinclair et al 2000 the effect of drought stress on n allocation in plant organs varies with the crop types or experimental conditions zhang et al 2021 however as the degree of water deficit increased the ratio of tn concentration in the stem to the tn concentration in the leaves showed an increasing trend under fi and a decreasing trend under sdi during the 2nd year slight deficit irrigation treatment led to the highest ratios only in the 1st cut due to the higher stem tn concentration and lowered leaf tn concentration under this deficit level of irrigation these observations suggest that the dilution effect likely worked on leaf n which is consistent with our observations on shoot n the inhibitory effect of water stress on stem growth is stronger than that on the leaf growth while water stress can improve n allocation to alfalfa leaves zhang et al 2021 4 2 effect of deficit irrigation on n use efficiency of alfalfa the nue sheds light on the productivity of a plant and is readily influenced by environmental variables including the soil water status chilundo et al 2016 atwill et al 2018 jia et al 2021 gheysari et al 2009 found higher average nue under irrigation deficits of 15 and 30 in silage maize chilundo et al 2016 found that nue tended to be higher at the 75 irrigation level in this study the nue of alfalfa barely changed with an increase in the deficit level of irrigation and tended to decrease in the 2nd year this partly contradicted our hypothesis that slight deficit irrigation should increase nue the nue of alfalfa decreases with increasing n levels but increases with an increase in the amount of water applied du et al 2017 as mentioned the tn concentration of alfalfa changed slightly with the deficit level of irrigation in this study leading to an unchanged nue this is likely because more water supply leads to dilution or leaching of plant n thus decreasing nue scholberg et al 2002 it may also be attributed to the effect of the irrigation method on the migration and transformation of n in plants which in turn affects the nue sun et al 2012 in addition the nue of the year 2 alfalfa was higher under fi than sdi in most cases this is in accordance with previous findings that reported furrow irrigation to lead to higher nue than drip irrigation chilundo et al 2016 4 3 effect of deficit irrigation on soil mineral n the supply of soil mineral n mainly in the forms of nitrate n and ammonium n is readily affected by soil water zhou et al 2011 yuan et al 2013 nitrate n is easily adsorbed on soil particles due to its negative charge but has strong mobility and thus it can easily migrate with water flux contrarily ammonium n does not readily migrate with soil water xiao et al 2019 sharma and manchanda 1996 found that the downward movement of nitrate n was quite consistent with the movement of water and the leaching amount and migration intensity also increased with an increase in water flux zhang et al 2004 found that precipitation was the main driving force for soil n migration in the loess areas furthermore nitrate n infiltration depth increased with increasing water content in this study there were inconsistent effects of irrigation treatments on snn and san contents and the most significant differences were observed in the planting year under fi snn content increased and then decreased with the deficit level of irrigation in the 1st cut of the planting year and the 2nd cut of year 2 no significant difference was observed among the deficit levels of irrigation under sdi therefore full irrigation under fi may lead to snn loss into the deeper soils which is in accordance with previous findings sharma and manchanda 1996 zhang et al 2004 moderate deficit irrigation could have led to severe impairment of bnf and n mineralization wang et al 2010 resulting in lower snn content similarly it was assumed here that different deficit levels of sdi would affect snn in the presence of a slower and more even supply of water in the soil leading to unchanged snn content in contrast san content decreased with the deficit level of irrigation under fi it decreased and then increased under sdi only in the planting year while there was no significant change with the deficit level of irrigation in the 2nd year slight water deficit led to a decrease in the san content and aided in absorption to meet stable growth requirement with ammonium n also evidenced by stable ydm different responses to moderate water deficit between the two irrigation systems could be attributed to stronger absorption by higher ydm under fi than sdi however san content exhibited low levels in the 2nd year under both irrigation systems which could mainly be attributed to the restricted availability in soils the inorganic n in soils accounted for only a small proportion of total soil n wang and dai 2000 the uptake of nitrate and ammonium n by plants is an antagonistic process lee and drew 1989 alfalfa has been reported to absorb ammonium n more easily than nitrate n gazzarrini et al 1999 while ammonium n tends to not readily leach out the migration of soil n with water flux and absorption by plants resulted in different trends of the distribution of soil n across the soil depth tao 2016 in this study under fi snn concentration tended to increase till 40 cm depth in the planting year and was significantly higher in the 40 60 cm soil layers than in the upper layers in the 2nd year suggesting that an obvious snn leaching happened in contrast snn concentration under sdi barely changed with soil depth in the planting year and was higher in the 20 40 cm soil layers than in the upper layers in the 2nd year indicating the occurrence of late and weak leaching however san concentration changed little across soil depths these findings are in agreement with previous reports on more rapid snn infiltration with water flux compared to san infiltration xiao et al 2019 in addition the deficit levels of irrigation affected the distribution of snn and san differently which was regulated by the irrigation system we could not identify strong tendencies implying that further investigation is needed in this regard additionally low san concentrations was observed under both irrigation systems in the 2nd year suggesting that there might be relatively complete exhaustion of san and thus a shortage of san supply 4 4 correlation between n uptake by alfalfa and soil mineral n content plants have a variety of absorption and transportation systems and utilization methods for snn and san the energy required by the plant to assimilate these two forms of n also differs caicedo et al 2000 the uptake of one of the forms by the plant is antagonistic to the uptake of the other lee and drew 1989 gherardi et al 2013 plants are more likely to absorb san when both forms are in physical access gazzarrini et al 1999 these differences may lead to various responses of the two n forms to environmental factors including soil water miller and cramer 2005 xia et al 2020 as a consequence their responses may result in different nuptake as well as different relationships between nuptake and available soil n content alt et al 2000 maeda et al 2018 in this study san content decreased with the increase in shoot nuptake while no significant relationship was observed between snn content and nuptake by alfalfa similarly san content was significantly correlated with nue of alfalfa whereby it decreased with increasing nue while no significant relationship was observed between snn content and nue of alfalfa this could be attributed to the fact that during growth alfalfa plants preferably consume san which appeared to be insufficient to meet the growth requirement on the contrary snn seemed to be relatively adequate which was evidenced by the increase in its content from the 2nd to the 3rd cut in the year 2 alfalfa these findings partly proved our hypothesis 5 conclusions nitrogen uptake by the shoot stem and leaves decreased with an increase in the deficit level of irrigation but slight deficit irrigation 70 of full irrigation barely reduced n uptake as compared to the full irrigation deficit irrigation led to a decrease in dry matter yield especially in the 2nd year but slight deficit irrigation reduced it only slightly in contrast total n concentration in the shoot stem and leaves barely changed with the difference in the deficit level of irrigation suggesting that biomass growth rather than change in n concentration play a major role in regulating n uptake nitrogen use efficiency of alfalfa barely changed with deficit levels of irrigation although there was a lowering tendency in the 2nd year there were significant correlations between n uptake and n use efficiency of alfalfa with soil ammonium n content suggesting this form of n is relatively short lived and nitrate n may be adequate to meet the growth requirement of alfalfa in addition differences in n uptake n use efficiency and soil mineral n existed among irrigation systems and stand ages of alfalfa which still requires extensive investigation to be understood better in practice slight deficit irrigation is recommended in alfalfa production in the inland arid area of

in the middle heihe river basin hrb will not necessarily increase the water consumption despite the increase in the water saving irrigation area in this study the temporal and spatial distribution and the driving factors related to water consumption including evapotranspiration et transpiration t evapotranspiration ratio t et and precipitation deficit et p were investigated in the middle hrb using linear trend piecewise fitting and multiple linear regression method the results show that the 97 wds has prominent impacts on the temporal and spatial trends and the driving factors in et and t in the middle hrb water consumption does not necessarily increase under the centralized water allocation with improved irrigation efficiency and increased cultivated area the result provides new evidence for increasing t et to decrease water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area while helping decision makers to reduce water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluate 97 wds keywords heihe river basin water consumption temporal and spatial variation driving factors 97 water diversion scheme 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources in the world accounting for about 70 of total freshwater withdrawals kang et al 2017 pereira et al 2015 limited water availability for irrigation poses a challenge to irrigation water needs in arid regions the shortage of irrigation water is expected to further increase in the future due to the increase in domestic industrial ecological and environmental water use akhtar et al 2013 irrational use or allocation of irrigation water resources can exacerbate water shortages li et al 2021 increasing cultivated areas despite improving irrigation efficiency can potentially increase water consumption therefore importance should be attached to the temporal and spatial changes and the driving factors of water consumption in irrigation districts for the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas the state council of china approved the water diversion scheme of heihe river trunk stream 97 wds in 1997 owing to the prominent water use contradictions that the agricultural production water consumption in the middle stream displaces the ecological water consumption in the downstream geng et al 2021a the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 water inflows to the middle stream have remained abundant since 2000 meeting the middle stream and downstream water demands relieving the contradiction in water consumption to some extent however in years of abundant water achieving the diversion scheme can be challenging the water diverting downstream has not been achieved the goal for 13 years between 2000 and 2015 resulting in a cumulative water deficit of 2 43 billion m3 downstream jiang et al 2019 scholars believed that the expansion of the cultivated area caused the increase in water consumption in the middle stream which was one of the main reasons why the 97 wds could not be achieved jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2017a zhao et al 2019 geng et al 2021a scholars also believed that increasing irrigation efficiency and expanding cultivated areas would reduce water inflow but increase water consumption berbel et al 2018 believed that improved irrigation efficiency could reduce water diversion while increasing water consumption molle and tanouti 2017 found that in morocco drip irrigation increased water consumption by higher crop densities a shift to more water intensive crops and the reuse of saved water to expand the cultivated area zhang et al 2019 believed that under the consumption of restricted water supply and unlimited irrigation area water consumption would increase although to a lesser extent zhou et al 2021 found that despite water saving irrigation global irrigation water consumption increased by more than 50 from the 1980s to 2010 owing to the expansion of irrigated areas even though water saving irrigation is used in older irrigated areas traditional flood irrigation still dominates in newly developed irrigated areas however with the increase of water saving irrigation areas in the middle hrb whether the expansion of the cultivated area caused the increase in water consumption deserves further investigation the cultivated area in the middle hrb has seen expansion liu and shen 2018 but a series of water saving measures have been enforced in the middle stream to reduce water consumption and meet the 97 wds huang 2015 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2009 after the implementation of the 97 wds the water consumption the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge reduced and inflow from surface water diversion and groundwater withdrawal also reduced geng 2021 because of the unique topography and geomorphology in the middle hrb precipitation surface water and subsurface water interact frequently and water resources are reused at a high rate leading to significant disparities in water diversion and consumption liu et al 2019 we suspect that the reduced water consumption is due to the combined effect of the newly developed cultivated area and the water saving measures further the expansion of the cultivated area is not the main reason why the 97 wds could not be achieved in this study the temporal and spatial distribution of water consumption and its driving factors pre and post implementation of 97 wds were analyzed the objectives of this study were to evaluate the reason why the releasing indicator cannot complete from the perspective of water consumption in the middle hrb to analyze whether the water consumption in the middle hrb increases while increasing the water saving efficiency expanding the cultivated area to achieve water saving in the middle hrb the spatial patterns of et t t et and et p were analyzed by the mean method the spatial variation was analyzed by the linear trend method the annual trends of et t t et and et p were analyzed by piecewise fitting the influence and driving factors of water consumption in the middle hrb were analyzed by comparative analysis and correlation analysis respectively further the contribution rates of driving factors to water consumption were analyzed by the multiple linear regression method the result provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and provides a certain basis and reference for increasing t et reducing water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluating 97 wds 2 research methods and data sources 2 1 study area the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china with the midstream at 38 6 n 39 8 n 99 5 e 100 8 e fig 1 the upstream is above yingluoxia gorge the midstream is between yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and the downstream is below zhengyixia gorge the average altitude of the middle stream in hrb is 1451 m with an average annual temperature of 6 8 c and average annual precipitation of 150 mm the hrb is an important irrigated agricultural area if there is irrigation an oasis appears if there isn t a desert appears more than 90 of the total hrb cultivated area is in the middle stream a total of 13 irrigation districts exist in the midstream including daman shangsan yingke xijun shahe yanuan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan liyuanhe youlian liuba and luocheng the state council of china approved the water diversion scheme of the heihe river trunk stream 97 wds in 1997 because water utilization contradictions in the middle stream and the downstream of the heihe river basin hrb in china are very prominent and agricultural and production water consumption in the middle stream has displaced ecological water use in the lower reaches of ejina banner geng et al 2021a the core of the 97 wds is when the annual average water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 58 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 95 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 63 billion m3 when the 25 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 71 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 1 09 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 62 billion m3 when the 75 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 42 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 76 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 66 billion m3 when the 90 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 29 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 63 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 66 billion m3 when other guarantee rates come in the water discharged from the zhengyixia gorge is calculated by linear interpolation based on the above guaranteed rates the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 the 97 wds was approved in 1997 and implemented in 2000 the cultivated area in the middle hrb increased by 291 55 km2 from 1838 28 km2 in 2000 to 2129 83 km2 in 2015 jiang 2020 the gansu local administration has enforced a series of water saving measures to reduce the area of high water consuming crops and improve water saving in irrigation districts while meeting the 97 wds zhangye city was transformed into a national first class demonstration area of efficient water saving modern agriculture in china huang 2015 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2009 the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb had developed 496 33 km² of water saving irrigation area by 2017 accounting for 42 42 of the cultivated area in hrb geng 2021 the planting ratio of strip farmland with high water consumption decreased from 31 18 in 2000 to 5 1 in 2012 the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge which reflects water consumption traditionally in the middle hrb averaged 0 746 billion m3 in 2000 2009 and 0 788 billion m3 in 2010 2015 lower than the 0 808 billion m3 in 1990 1999 due to the effect of increased water consumption driven by newly developed cultivated area despite the decreased water consumption driven by water saving measures surface water diversion in the middle hrb increased first and then decreased from 1 294 billion m3 in 2000 to 1 503 billion m3 in 2004 and then falling to 1 15 billion m3 in 2015 a decrease of 0 144 billion m3 compare to 2000 groundwater withdrawal decreased first then increase and then decrease with an increase of 0 01 billion m3 in 2015 compared to 2000 the total surface water diversion and groundwater withdrawal has been decreasing then increasing then decreasing from 1 743 billion m3 in 2000 to 1 578 billion m3 in 2007 then increasing to 1 908 billion m3 in 2012 then decreasing to 1 609 billion m3 in 2015 a decrease of 0 134 billion m3 compared 2015 to 2000 geng 2021 irrigation water can be converted to i beneficial water consumption such as crop transpiration ii non beneficial water consumption such as bare soil evaporation and weed transpiration iii recyclable return water such as water receding to rivers and fresh aquifers iv non recoverable return water such as infiltration into saline aquifers perry 2007 where transpiration and evapotranspiration are consumable water and return water are non consumable water despite the frequent interaction among precipitation surface water and groundwater in the middle hrb the irrigated water will eventually be converted into evapotranspiration as long as it is consumed in the agricultural irrigation system therefore the water consumption in irrigation districts can be expressed by evapotranspiration where evaporation is non beneficial water consumption and transpiration is beneficial water consumption the irrigation efficiency increases as the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et rises the water deficit of an irrigation district is evapotranspiration minus precipitation et p which is the consumption of water resources except for precipitation 2 2 data data for et t and t et in this study were obtained from a spatial temporal continuous dataset of the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio in china from 1981 to 2015 published in scientific data by zhongen niu at the national ecosystem science data center https doi org 10 17605 osf io merzn the dataset contained daily and annual t et as well as transpiration and evapotranspiration data for t et calculation the spatial resolution was 0 05 0 05 the dataset was processed using a data fusion method that combined the pt jpl model with a multivariate observation dataset and the actual observed evapotranspiration data were for the calibration and parameter optimization of the pt jpl model the dataset is deemed efficient in exploring the land atmosphere interactions and ecological evolution niu et al 2020 in this paper we used zonal statistics in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the et t and t et dataset for the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb from 1981 to 2015 images were resampled with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km to reduce the error caused by excessive resolution in the zonal statistics unit of t and et dataset at the year scale were converted to billion m3 year 1 the water diversion in the middle hrb was the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge obtained from yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrologic stations respectively the inflow from liyuanhe was obtained from the hydrological station of yinggeju reservoir the inflow in 1981 1989 was the observed value of liyuanbao hydrologic stations 14 km downstream of the reservoir site before the completion of the reservoir data on water diversion water saving irrigation area and planting structure planting area of different crops such as wheat strip farmland seed corn corn fruit and vegetables were obtained from the annual reports of irrigation management in zhangye city and each irrigated area grain yield data was from the statistical yearbook of ganzhou linze and gaotai the cultivated area was extracted from the remote sensing interpretation of 8 periods in 1980 the late 1970 s 1990 late 1980 s 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 and 2015 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km from the resource and environmental science and data center http www resdc cn the cultivated area of 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb was extracted according to irrigated area ranges and the data of other years were interpolated according to the average growth rate during a given period precipitation data was from the spatial interpolation of gauge precipitation using regional climate model simulation in the hrb 1960 2014 dawen 2016 wang et al 2017 first the daily precipitation was converted into annual precipitation and then the spatial scope of the precipitation of the middle hrb was identified according to the spatial scope of the evapotranspiration data for industrial and domestic water were obtained from geng et

considered after 2000 3 results 3 1 validation hrb is an independent hydrogeological unit with complete recharge runoff and discharge processes the inflow and outflow of groundwater in adjacent areas should be balanced in zhangye basin a closed basin of the middle hrb and hence not taken into account jin et al 2008 li 2016 precipitation and inflow from yingluoxia gorge make up the majority of the water flowing into the irrigated areas in the middle hrb while evapotranspiration industrial and domestic water use and outflow from zhengyixia gorge make up the majority of the water flowing out the water balance equation is as follows 8 et balance x 1 x 2 x 3 x il x 4 δ r where et balance is et calculated by the water balance equation x 1 is the inflow from yingluoxia gorge x 2 is the inflow

water storage variations in the middle hrb the water consumption et niu in the middle hrb extracted from the data by niu zhongen was verified using the water balance eq 8 the schematic diagram is in fig 2a when the water storage variations δ r was 0 et niu and et balance showed the same increasing and decreasing trend et niu fluctuated around et balance when the water storage variations δr was not 0 the difference between et niu and et balance was the water storage variations δr as shown in fig 2b the total δr from 1981 to 2015 was 0 519 billion m3 between 1981 and 2000 the total δr decreased by 1 676 billion m3 from 2000 2015 the total δr was primarily increased with a 1 157 billion m3 increase the δr in the middle hrb showed a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2006 but an increasing trend from 2007 to 2015 this result is consistent with the variation trend of groundwater storage in the middle hrb by grace wu et al 2015 and forward modeling wu et al 2015 implying the reliability of et n iu 3 2 spatial patterns of et t t et et p the spatial patterns of et t t et and et p from 1981 to 2015 in the middle hrb and various irrigation districts are shown in fig 3 the

and yingke displayed a larger increase from 2013 2015 over 0 002 billion m3 yr 1 4 influencing factors of water consumption the annual trends of the possible influencing factors of water consumption in the middle hrb from 1981 to 2015 were analyzed including the water inflow from yingluoxia gorge the water inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the water consumption between hydrological stations precipitation transpiration the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration the water saving irrigation area grain yield cultivated area and planting structure fig 8 inflow and discharge affect the water consumption in the middle hrb before 2000 the water consumption in the middle hrb was greatly affected by the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and after 2000 by the inflow from liyuanhe before 2000 the water consumption et had a similar fluctuating trend to the water inflow from yingluoxia gorge but after 2000 it had a similar trend to that of liyuanhe the results indicate that before 2000 the more water inflow from yingluoxia gorge the more water diversion from the trunk stream the more water consumption et and vice versa while after 2000 due to the influence of 97 wds the inflow from yingluoxia gorge was allocated to the middle hrb at a certain rate with a small variation range but the inflow from liyuanhe was not affected by 97 wds exerting an impact on water consumption in the middle hrb precipitation affects annual water consumption the available precipitation within middle hrb fluctuates around 0 244 billion m3 which was similar to the inflow from yingluoxia gorge with et t t et and et p also fluctuating the precipitation significantly affects the fluctuation of et et p t and t et on a yearly scale but had little effect on a multi year scale with increases in grain yield water consumption increased grain yield increased gradually from 1980 to 2000 declined from 2000 to 2002 and remained unchanged from 2002 to 2015 from 1981 1993 when the inflow from zhengyixia gorge was abundant et et p t and t et increased slightly indicating that the increase in grain yield would lead to the increase in et t et p and t et and vice versa from 1981 2000 the grain yield increased due to the technological progress of chemical fertilizer agriculture mechanization and agricultural research which led to an increase in water consumption planting structures influence water consumption before 2000 the planting structure in the middle hrb was dominated by wheat corn and strip farmland xue 2021 after 2000 the planting structure was adjusted to save water resources the proportion of seed corn increased from 10 92 in 2000 to 60 65 in 2015 the proportion of strip farmland decreased from 31 18 in 2000 to 5 1 in 2015 and the proportion of wheat decreased from 23 73 in 2000 to 4 2 in 2015 the proportion of fruit and vegetables decreased from 9 85 in 2000 to 4 2 in 2015 among them the proportions of seed corn and strip farmland exhibited opposite trends take yingke irrigated districts as an example to calculate water saving caused by the adjustment of the planting structure the irrigation amount of strip farmland wheat corn fruit and vegetables were 635 m3 mu 365 m3 mu 495 m3 mu and 128 m3 mu respectively jazira 2006 when ignoring the influence of other factors such as the increase in cultivated area in 2006 the proportion of seed corn was the highest and the water consumption of the planting structure was the highest which increased by 0 0997 compared with that in 2000 in 2015 the water consumption increased by 0 0093 compared with that in 2000 cultivated areas affect water consumption the increase in the cultivated area mainly occurred during 1991 1995 2001 2005 and 2011 2015 with the corresponding increment of 157 km2 126 km2 and 103 km2 respectively all other conditions unchanged the increase in the cultivated area would inevitably lead to an increase in water consumption during 1991 1995 the cultivated area increased while et t and t et increased first and then decreased and et p decreased slightly the increase in the cultivated area did not cause an obvious increase in water consumption mainly due to extensive irrigation methods before 1990 in 1990 water saving irrigation projects were implemented in zhangye by 2000 61 73 km2 of pipe irrigation 7 09 km2 of drip irrigation and 8 67 km2 of sprinkler irrigation were developed which led to a reduction in average water consumption per unit area with little impact on the overall middle hrb in water consumption wang 2002 from 2001 2005 the cultivated area increased with et et p t t et also increasing indicating that the increase in cultivated area heightened the water consumption in the 13 irrigation districts during 2001 2005 from 2011 2015 the cultivated area increased while et and et p decreased slightly and t remained unchanged indicating that the impact of the increase in the cultivated area on the increase in water consumption was less than the impact of water saving irrigation measures on the decrease in water consumption from 2011 to 2015 water saving irrigation can reduce water consumption especially at the field scale since the implementation of 97 wds a variety of water saving measures had been adopted in the middle hrb including conventional water saving measures such as the trunk spur lateral and farm canal lining semi film furrow irrigation plastic film mulching ridge furrow irrigation and soil testing formula high efficiency water saving irrigation measures were adopted such as pipe drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation the effects of water saving measures differed taking seed corn as an example the flood irrigation amount was 415 m3 mu while after the implementation of high efficiency water saving irrigation measures the pipe and drip irrigation amounts were 390 m3 mu and 350 m3 mu respectively mo 2018 the implementation timing of these water saving measures also differed for ganzhou sprinkler irrigation dominated from 2000 to 2004 drip irrigation area grew slowly from 2004 to 2012 and after 2012 drip irrigation area grew rapidly in 2014 drip irrigation area exceeded pipe irrigation area water saving irrigation is supported by diversifying funding sources water saving project in hrb took the lead in the implementation of water saving irrigation from 2000 to 2003 followed by loans from japan bank for international cooperation for the development of water saving irrigation water saving society project the promotion and application of new varieties and technologies high efficiency water saving demonstration high standard farmland construction and other projects as well as the people s self financing have participated in high efficiency water saving projects making the actual high efficiency water saving irrigation area much higher than the water saving irrigation area calculated by the water department since 2000 water saving measures had reduced ineffective evaporation resulting in an increase in t et and a decrease in et 5 driving factors of temporal and spatial variation of water consumption before and after 97 wds pre and post the implementation of 97 wds driving factors of water consumption can be drawn through correlation analysis fig 9 for et before 2000 et was significantly positively correlated with precipitation p 0 05 after 2000 et was significantly positively correlated with the precipitation the area ratio of wheat the strip farmland the fruit and vegetables p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the area of the pipe drip and sprinkler irrigation the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 for t before 2000 t was significantly positively correlated with the cultivated area and the grain yield p 0 05 after 2000 t was significantly positively correlated with the precipitation the area ratio of wheat and strip farmland p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the cultivated area the drip irrigation area and the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 for t et before 2000 t et was significantly positively correlated with the cultivated area and the grain yield p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the inflow from liyuanhe and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge p 0 05 after 2000 t et was significantly positively correlated with the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the area of drip pipe and sprinkler irrigation the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the area ratio of wheat the strip farmland the fruit and vegetables p 0 05 the contribution rate of driving factors to water consumption was further quantified by using multiple linear regression for et from 1981 to 1993 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe gorge the fluctuating precipitation and the increased grain yield can explain 92 of the increased et from 1993 2000 the fluctuating precipitation the increased cultivated area and the increased grain can explain 84 of the decreased et from 2000 2007 the fluctuating precipitation the increased drip area the fluctuating groundwater withdrawal and the decreased ratio of fruit and vegetables can explain 78 of the decreased et from 2007 2015 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe gorge the fluctuating precipitation the decreased grain yield the increased pipe irrigation area the increased groundwater withdrawal and the increased area ratio of seed corn can explain 90 of the et which decreased followed by increased for t from 1981 to 1993 the inflow from yingluoxia the inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the fluctuating precipitation and the increased grain yield can explain 93 of the increased t from 1993 2000 the fluctuation precipitation the increased first then decreased discharge of zhengyixia gorge the increased cultivated area and the increased grain yield can explain 89 of the decreased first then increased t from 2000 2007 the fluctuating precipitation the increased drip irrigation area and the fluctuating groundwater withdrawal can explain 70 of the increased t from 2007 2015 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe the decreased precipitation the increased discharge of zhengyixia gorge and the decreased area ratio of fruit and vegetables can explain 76 of the decreased t for t et before 2000 the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge and the increased grain yield can explain 93 of the increased t et after 2000 the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the grain yield and the drip irrigation area can explain 45 of the increased t et 6 discussion 6 1 cultivated area expansion failing to increase the water consumption by analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of water consumption pre and post implementation of 97 wds we found that increasing the water saving irrigation efficiency and expanding the cultivated area in the middle hrb did not increase the water consumption increasing irrigation efficiency the water consumption evapotranspiration would be reduced because the plant height and ear of seed corn under drip irrigation were lower than that of flood irrigation and the growth period of drip irrigation was 2 days shorter than that of flood irrigation despite the corn yield and density of drip irrigation was higher zhao 2018 with improved irrigation efficiency farmers have the potential to grow less water consumption crops but more productive thereby reducing water consumption if the water consumption saved by improving irrigation efficiency is greater than the water consumption increased by expanding the cultivated area the total water consumption will fail to increase studies have shown that the increased cultivated area is the main factor driving the increase in water demand in the middle hrb geng et al 2021a jiang et al 2019 reducing cultivated areas is commonly regarded as the primary countermeasure to reducing water consumption in the middle hrb nian et al 2014 concluded that the further increase in the cultivated area should be limited analysis has shown that even a roll back of the cultivated area to the 2000 level could barely complete the releasing indicator but groundwater in the middle hrb will be over exploited jiang et al 2019 geng 2021 believed that the cultivated area should be restored to 1200 km2 to limit water consumption in the middle hrb within the 97 wds instead of focusing solely on restricting the extension of cultivated areas water consumption in the middle hrb should be reduced in terms of the cultivated area the water saving irrigation area the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the inflow from liyuanhe the storage variables and other driving factors 6 2 t et influenced by natural factors and human activities studies have reported that the average t et of the global ecosystem is around 0 6 berkelhammer et al 2016 maxwell and condon 2016 the t et was 0 51 in this study which is close to the global average existing research suggests that t et is driven by natural factors such as temperature rainfall soil moisture greening and enhanced vegetation index da rocha et al 2022 niu et al 2019 ren et al 2019 t et in the middle hrb increased significantly at a rate of 0 0075 yr 1 p 0 01 much higher than the average rate in china which is 0 0019 yr 1 it indicates that in addition to natural factors t et in the middle hrb is driven by other factors in this study before 2000 the driving factors for the increased t et are the grain yield and the cultivated area after 2000 the main driving factors are the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated areas the grain yield and the drip irrigation area t et is influenced by human activities such as water distribution schemes water saving irrigation areas cultivated areas and the planting structure as well as natural factors such as temperature and rainfall by adjusting the driving factors t et in liyuanhe daman youlian and luocheng should be increased and t et with decreasing pixels after 2000 should be increased such as decreasing pixels in yingke and daman 6 3 driving factors of water consumption not only cultivated area water consumption in the middle hrb has been measured using a variety of approaches for the difference between the inflow from yingluoxai gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the water consumption increased before 2000 and the annual average value after 2000 was lower than 0 808 billion m3 from 1990 to 1999 geng et al 2021a zhao et al 2019 argued that water consumption in the middle hrb is 0 830 billion m3 0 200 billion m3 more than 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds for water demand the water consumption in the middle hrb increased from 1 08 billion m3 in 1986 to 1 908 billion m3 in 2013 liu and shen 2018 for evapotranspiration water consumption increases gradually from 1990 to 2004 ranging from 2 23 to 3 416 billion m3 jin and liang 2009 while geng et al 2021 considered water consumption first decrease then increase and the multi year average evapotranspiration is 1 433 billion m3 this paper distinguishes between evapotranspiration and transpiration the multi year average et t t et and et p of the middle hrb were 1 150 billion m3 0 575 billion m3 0 51 and 0 905 billion m3 respectively influenced by 97 wds et and et p decrease significantly below 1981 t decreased slightly the same as in 1996 or 1999 the multi year average water deficit et p in the middle hrb was 0 905 billion m3 which was larger than the 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds over time the et p of the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb except liyuanhe gradually decreased from 0 885 billion m3 in 2000 to 0 580 billion m3 in 2013 et p from 2000 to 2012 is larger than 0 63 billion m3 while from 2013 to 2015 less than 0 63 billion m3 scholars believe that the expansion of cultivated areas is the driving factor for the increase in water consumption in the middle hrb hu et al 2015 jin and liang 2009 further liu and shen 2018 believed that climate change cultivated land expansion and planting structure changes contributed to the increase in water requirement at rates of 6 9 58 1 and 25 3 respectively our research indicates that before the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflows from yingluoxia gorge and liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation grain yield and cultivated area after the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflow from liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation groundwater withdrawal grain yield and water saving irrigation area and planting structure there is no significant correlation between cultivated area expansion and water consumption the following measures will reduce water consumption in the middle hrb 1 adjust the planting structure increasing the proportion of low water consumption low yield and high income crops 2 expand water saving irrigation area 3 improve t et 4 adjuste the 97 wds based on the inflow from liyuanhe and the precipitation in the middle hrb 6 4 evaluation of 97 wds based on water consumption in the middle hrb liu et al 2017a believe that the main reasons for the poor adaptability of the 97 wds are 1 the inflow from the tributaries is effectively intercepted and consumed on the spot and no water enters the mainstream of the heihe river except for liyuanhe 2 the cultivated area increased by 37 400 hm2 increasing 0 221 billion m3 in agricultural water consumption 3 since the implementation of the 97 wds the midstream has consumed nearly 0 2 billion m3 more than the water allocated by 97 wds which has seriously affected the implementation of the 97 wds jiang et al 2019 believe that the reason why the 97 wds can t complete the releasing indicator are 1 after the 97 wds inflow from tributaries decreased sharply and the mainstream could not be supplemented by tributaries in wet years 2 the expansion of cultivated areas increases water consumption in the middle hrb 3 the 97 wds doesn t make specific provisions for the year of inflows greater than 90 and less than 10 and the water distribution in the coming year when the water is more than 90 and less than 10 in recent years the continuous abundant inflow from yingluoxia gorge has caused difficulties in the implementation of 97 wds yi et al 2019 believes that 97 wds is based on the assumption that the precipitation in upstream and midstream is the same as abundance and dryness however the frequency is only 39 1 which leads the releasing indicator fail to be completed we believe that the reason why the 97 wds can t complete the releasing indicator are 1 before 2012 et p in the middle hrb is greater than 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds 2 after 2007 increased storage variables lead to increased groundwater storage 3 in very abundant year the precipitation in the midstream the inflow from yingluoxai gorge and the inflow from liyuanhe are not the same as abundance and dryness 7 conclusions in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics variation and the driving factors related to water consumption pre and post implementation of 97 wds were analyzed the spatial patterns of et t t et and et p were analyzed by the mean method the spatial variation was analyzed by the linear trend the annual trends of et t t et and et p were analyzed by piecewise fitting the influence factors of water consumption in the middle hrb were analyzed by comparative analysis the driving factors of water consumption were analyzed by correlation analysis further the contribution rate of driving factors to water consumption was analyzed by the multiple linear regression method the results show that the multi year average et t t et and et p of the middle hrb gradually decreased from the upstream to the downstream and with the increasing distance from the river before the implementation of the 97 water diversion scheme 97 wds in 2000 the spatial variation of et t t et and et p displayed increasing trends whereas after the implementation except for t et the trends reversed for annual trends the implementation of 97 wds resulted in a continuous increase in t et a significant decrease in et and et p below 1981 and a slight decrease in t basically the same as in 1996 or 1999 before the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflows from yingluoxia gorge and liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation grain yield and cultivated area after the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflow from liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation groundwater withdrawal grain yield and water saving irrigation area and planting structure the results show that the 97 wds has a great impact on the temporal and spatial trends and driving factors of et t and et p in the middle hrb under the centralized allocation of water resources the water consumption will not necessarily increase if increasing the water saving irrigation efficiency expanding the cultivated area this study expands the past work as follows 1 the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics variation and the driving factors of et and t were investigated in the middle hrb pre and post implementation of 97 wds 2 under the centralized allocation of water resources the study provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and improving irrigation efficiency 3 the driving factors of t et have been expanded t et is influenced by natural factors and human activities 4 from the perspective of water consumption in the middle hrb the 97 wds was evaluated in this paper we found that 1 the remote sensing data resolution used in the research needs to be improved 2 there are many studies on evapotranspiration and precipitation in the hrb or the upstream but less in midstream in the future evapotranspiration and precipitation in the middle hrb should be further researched the result provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and provides a certain basis and reference for increasing t et reducing water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluating 97 wds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9501,irrational allocation of irrigation water resources aggravates water shortages affecting the sustainable development of agriculture especially in arid regions the expansion of the cultivated area in the middle heihe river basin hrb will not necessarily increase the water consumption despite the increase in the water saving irrigation area in this study the temporal and spatial distribution and the driving factors related to water consumption including evapotranspiration et transpiration t evapotranspiration ratio t et and precipitation deficit et p were investigated in the middle hrb using linear trend piecewise fitting and multiple linear regression method the results show that the 97 wds has prominent impacts on the temporal and spatial trends and the driving factors in et and t in the middle hrb water consumption does not necessarily increase under the centralized water allocation with improved irrigation efficiency and increased cultivated area the result provides new evidence for increasing t et to decrease water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area while helping decision makers to reduce water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluate 97 wds keywords heihe river basin water consumption temporal and spatial variation driving factors 97 water diversion scheme 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources in the world accounting for about 70 of total freshwater withdrawals kang et al 2017 pereira et al 2015 limited water availability for irrigation poses a challenge to irrigation water needs in arid regions the shortage of irrigation water is expected to further increase in the future due to the increase in domestic industrial ecological and environmental water use akhtar et al 2013 irrational use or allocation of irrigation water resources can exacerbate water shortages li et al 2021 increasing cultivated areas despite improving irrigation efficiency can potentially increase water consumption therefore importance should be attached to the temporal and spatial changes and the driving factors of water consumption in irrigation districts for the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas the state council of china approved the water diversion scheme of heihe river trunk stream 97 wds in 1997 owing to the prominent water use contradictions that the agricultural production water consumption in the middle stream displaces the ecological water consumption in the downstream geng et al 2021a the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 water inflows to the middle stream have remained abundant since 2000 meeting the middle stream and downstream water demands relieving the contradiction in water consumption to some extent however in years of abundant water achieving the diversion scheme can be challenging the water diverting downstream has not been achieved the goal for 13 years between 2000 and 2015 resulting in a cumulative water deficit of 2 43 billion m3 downstream jiang et al 2019 scholars believed that the expansion of the cultivated area caused the increase in water consumption in the middle stream which was one of the main reasons why the 97 wds could not be achieved jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2017a zhao et al 2019 geng et al 2021a scholars also believed that increasing irrigation efficiency and expanding cultivated areas would reduce water inflow but increase water consumption berbel et al 2018 believed that improved irrigation efficiency could reduce water diversion while increasing water consumption molle and tanouti 2017 found that in morocco drip irrigation increased water consumption by higher crop densities a shift to more water intensive crops and the reuse of saved water to expand the cultivated area zhang et al 2019 believed that under the consumption of restricted water supply and unlimited irrigation area water consumption would increase although to a lesser extent zhou et al 2021 found that despite water saving irrigation global irrigation water consumption increased by more than 50 from the 1980s to 2010 owing to the expansion of irrigated areas even though water saving irrigation is used in older irrigated areas traditional flood irrigation still dominates in newly developed irrigated areas however with the increase of water saving irrigation areas in the middle hrb whether the expansion of the cultivated area caused the increase in water consumption deserves further investigation the cultivated area in the middle hrb has seen expansion liu and shen 2018 but a series of water saving measures have been enforced in the middle stream to reduce water consumption and meet the 97 wds huang 2015 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2009 after the implementation of the 97 wds the water consumption the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge reduced and inflow from surface water diversion and groundwater withdrawal also reduced geng 2021 because of the unique topography and geomorphology in the middle hrb precipitation surface water and subsurface water interact frequently and water resources are reused at a high rate leading to significant disparities in water diversion and consumption liu et al 2019 we suspect that the reduced water consumption is due to the combined effect of the newly developed cultivated area and the water saving measures further the expansion of the cultivated area is not the main reason why the 97 wds could not be achieved in this study the temporal and spatial distribution of water consumption and its driving factors pre and post implementation of 97 wds were analyzed the objectives of this study were to evaluate the reason why the releasing indicator cannot complete from the perspective of water consumption in the middle hrb to analyze whether the water consumption in the middle hrb increases while increasing the water saving efficiency expanding the cultivated area to achieve water saving in the middle hrb the spatial patterns of et t t et and et p were analyzed by the mean method the spatial variation was analyzed by the linear trend method the annual trends of et t t et and et p were analyzed by piecewise fitting the influence and driving factors of water consumption in the middle hrb were analyzed by comparative analysis and correlation analysis respectively further the contribution rates of driving factors to water consumption were analyzed by the multiple linear regression method the result provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and provides a certain basis and reference for increasing t et reducing water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluating 97 wds 2 research methods and data sources 2 1 study area the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china with the midstream at 38 6 n 39 8 n 99 5 e 100 8 e fig 1 the upstream is above yingluoxia gorge the midstream is between yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and the downstream is below zhengyixia gorge the average altitude of the middle stream in hrb is 1451 m with an average annual temperature of 6 8 c and average annual precipitation of 150 mm the hrb is an important irrigated agricultural area if there is irrigation an oasis appears if there isn t a desert appears more than 90 of the total hrb cultivated area is in the middle stream a total of 13 irrigation districts exist in the midstream including daman shangsan yingke xijun shahe yanuan banqiao pingchuan liaoquan liyuanhe youlian liuba and luocheng the state council of china approved the water diversion scheme of the heihe river trunk stream 97 wds in 1997 because water utilization contradictions in the middle stream and the downstream of the heihe river basin hrb in china are very prominent and agricultural and production water consumption in the middle stream has displaced ecological water use in the lower reaches of ejina banner geng et al 2021a the core of the 97 wds is when the annual average water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 58 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 95 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 63 billion m3 when the 25 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 71 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 1 09 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 62 billion m3 when the 75 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 42 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 76 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 66 billion m3 when the 90 guaranteed rate of the water inflows from yingluoxia gorge is 1 29 billion m3 the water discharged from zhengyixia gorge is 0 63 billion m3 and the water consumed in the middle stream is 0 66 billion m3 when other guarantee rates come in the water discharged from the zhengyixia gorge is calculated by linear interpolation based on the above guaranteed rates the average water consumption distributed to the middle hrb is 0 63 billion m3 jiang et al 2019 the 97 wds was approved in 1997 and implemented in 2000 the cultivated area in the middle hrb increased by 291 55 km2 from 1838 28 km2 in 2000 to 2129 83 km2 in 2015 jiang 2020 the gansu local administration has enforced a series of water saving measures to reduce the area of high water consuming crops and improve water saving in irrigation districts while meeting the 97 wds zhangye city was transformed into a national first class demonstration area of efficient water saving modern agriculture in china huang 2015 liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2009 the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb had developed 496 33 km² of water saving irrigation area by 2017 accounting for 42 42 of the cultivated area in hrb geng 2021 the planting ratio of strip farmland with high water consumption decreased from 31 18 in 2000 to 5 1 in 2012 the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge which reflects water consumption traditionally in the middle hrb averaged 0 746 billion m3 in 2000 2009 and 0 788 billion m3 in 2010 2015 lower than the 0 808 billion m3 in 1990 1999 due to the effect of increased water consumption driven by newly developed cultivated area despite the decreased water consumption driven by water saving measures surface water diversion in the middle hrb increased first and then decreased from 1 294 billion m3 in 2000 to 1 503 billion m3 in 2004 and then falling to 1 15 billion m3 in 2015 a decrease of 0 144 billion m3 compare to 2000 groundwater withdrawal decreased first then increase and then decrease with an increase of 0 01 billion m3 in 2015 compared to 2000 the total surface water diversion and groundwater withdrawal has been decreasing then increasing then decreasing from 1 743 billion m3 in 2000 to 1 578 billion m3 in 2007 then increasing to 1 908 billion m3 in 2012 then decreasing to 1 609 billion m3 in 2015 a decrease of 0 134 billion m3 compared 2015 to 2000 geng 2021 irrigation water can be converted to i beneficial water consumption such as crop transpiration ii non beneficial water consumption such as bare soil evaporation and weed transpiration iii recyclable return water such as water receding to rivers and fresh aquifers iv non recoverable return water such as infiltration into saline aquifers perry 2007 where transpiration and evapotranspiration are consumable water and return water are non consumable water despite the frequent interaction among precipitation surface water and groundwater in the middle hrb the irrigated water will eventually be converted into evapotranspiration as long as it is consumed in the agricultural irrigation system therefore the water consumption in irrigation districts can be expressed by evapotranspiration where evaporation is non beneficial water consumption and transpiration is beneficial water consumption the irrigation efficiency increases as the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration t et rises the water deficit of an irrigation district is evapotranspiration minus precipitation et p which is the consumption of water resources except for precipitation 2 2 data data for et t and t et in this study were obtained from a spatial temporal continuous dataset of the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio in china from 1981 to 2015 published in scientific data by zhongen niu at the national ecosystem science data center https doi org 10 17605 osf io merzn the dataset contained daily and annual t et as well as transpiration and evapotranspiration data for t et calculation the spatial resolution was 0 05 0 05 the dataset was processed using a data fusion method that combined the pt jpl model with a multivariate observation dataset and the actual observed evapotranspiration data were for the calibration and parameter optimization of the pt jpl model the dataset is deemed efficient in exploring the land atmosphere interactions and ecological evolution niu et al 2020 in this paper we used zonal statistics in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the et t and t et dataset for the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb from 1981 to 2015 images were resampled with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km to reduce the error caused by excessive resolution in the zonal statistics unit of t and et dataset at the year scale were converted to billion m3 year 1 the water diversion in the middle hrb was the difference between the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge obtained from yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrologic stations respectively the inflow from liyuanhe was obtained from the hydrological station of yinggeju reservoir the inflow in 1981 1989 was the observed value of liyuanbao hydrologic stations 14 km downstream of the reservoir site before the completion of the reservoir data on water diversion water saving irrigation area and planting structure planting area of different crops such as wheat strip farmland seed corn corn fruit and vegetables were obtained from the annual reports of irrigation management in zhangye city and each irrigated area grain yield data was from the statistical yearbook of ganzhou linze and gaotai the cultivated area was extracted from the remote sensing interpretation of 8 periods in 1980 the late 1970 s 1990 late 1980 s 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 and 2015 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km from the resource and environmental science and data center http www resdc cn the cultivated area of 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb was extracted according to irrigated area ranges and the data of other years were interpolated according to the average growth rate during a given period precipitation data was from the spatial interpolation of gauge precipitation using regional climate model simulation in the hrb 1960 2014 dawen 2016 wang et al 2017 first the daily precipitation was converted into annual precipitation and then the spatial scope of the precipitation of the middle hrb was identified according to the spatial scope of the evapotranspiration data for industrial and domestic water were obtained from geng et

considered after 2000 3 results 3 1 validation hrb is an independent hydrogeological unit with complete recharge runoff and discharge processes the inflow and outflow of groundwater in adjacent areas should be balanced in zhangye basin a closed basin of the middle hrb and hence not taken into account jin et al 2008 li 2016 precipitation and inflow from yingluoxia gorge make up the majority of the water flowing into the irrigated areas in the middle hrb while evapotranspiration industrial and domestic water use and outflow from zhengyixia gorge make up the majority of the water flowing out the water balance equation is as follows 8 et balance x 1 x 2 x 3 x il x 4 δ r where et balance is et calculated by the water balance equation x 1 is the inflow from yingluoxia gorge x 2 is the inflow

fig 2a when the water storage variations δ r was 0 et niu and et balance showed the same increasing and decreasing trend et niu fluctuated around et balance when the water storage variations δr was not 0 the difference between et niu and et balance was the water storage variations δr as shown in fig 2b the total δr from 1981 to 2015 was 0 519 billion m3 between 1981 and 2000 the total δr decreased by 1 676 billion m3 from 2000 2015 the total δr was primarily increased with a 1 157 billion m3 increase the δr in the middle hrb showed a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2006 but an increasing trend from 2007 to 2015 this result is consistent with the variation trend of groundwater storage in the middle hrb by grace wu et al 2015 and forward modeling wu et al 2015 implying the

and yingke displayed a larger increase from 2013 2015 over 0 002 billion m3 yr 1 4 influencing factors of water consumption the annual trends of the possible influencing factors of water consumption in the middle hrb from 1981 to 2015 were analyzed including the water inflow from yingluoxia gorge the water inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the water consumption between hydrological stations precipitation transpiration the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration the water saving irrigation area grain yield cultivated area and planting structure fig 8 inflow and discharge affect the water consumption in the middle hrb before 2000 the water consumption in the middle hrb was greatly affected by the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and after 2000 by the inflow from liyuanhe before 2000 the water consumption et had a similar fluctuating trend to the water inflow from yingluoxia gorge but after 2000 it had a similar trend to that of liyuanhe the results indicate that before 2000 the more water inflow from yingluoxia gorge the more water diversion from the trunk stream the more water consumption et and vice versa while after 2000 due to the influence of 97 wds the inflow from yingluoxia gorge was allocated to the middle hrb at a certain rate with a small variation range but the inflow from liyuanhe was not affected by 97 wds exerting an impact on water consumption in the middle hrb precipitation affects annual water consumption the available precipitation within middle hrb fluctuates around 0 244 billion m3 which was similar to the inflow from yingluoxia gorge with et t t et and et p also fluctuating the precipitation significantly affects the fluctuation of et et p t and t et on a yearly scale but had little effect on a multi year scale with increases in grain yield water consumption increased grain yield increased gradually from 1980 to 2000 declined from 2000 to 2002 and remained unchanged from 2002 to 2015 from 1981 1993 when the inflow from zhengyixia gorge was abundant et et p t and t et increased slightly indicating that the increase in grain yield would lead to the increase in et t et p and t et and vice versa from 1981 2000 the grain yield increased due to the technological progress of chemical fertilizer agriculture mechanization and agricultural research which led to an increase in water consumption planting structures influence water consumption before 2000 the planting structure in the middle hrb was dominated by wheat corn and strip farmland xue 2021 after 2000 the planting structure was adjusted to save water resources the proportion of seed corn increased from 10 92 in 2000 to 60 65 in 2015 the proportion of strip farmland decreased from 31 18 in 2000 to 5 1 in 2015 and the proportion of wheat decreased from 23 73 in 2000 to 4 2 in 2015 the proportion of fruit and vegetables decreased from 9 85 in 2000 to 4 2 in 2015 among them the proportions of seed corn and strip farmland exhibited opposite trends take yingke irrigated districts as an example to calculate water saving caused by the adjustment of the planting structure the irrigation amount of strip farmland wheat corn fruit and vegetables were 635 m3 mu 365 m3 mu 495 m3 mu and 128 m3 mu respectively jazira 2006 when ignoring the influence of other factors such as the increase in cultivated area in 2006 the proportion of seed corn was the highest and the water consumption of the planting structure was the highest which increased by 0 0997 compared with that in 2000 in 2015 the water consumption increased by 0 0093 compared with that in 2000 cultivated areas affect water consumption the increase in the cultivated area mainly occurred during 1991 1995 2001 2005 and 2011 2015 with the corresponding increment of 157 km2 126 km2 and 103 km2 respectively all other conditions unchanged the increase in the cultivated area would inevitably lead to an increase in water consumption during 1991 1995 the cultivated area increased while et t and t et increased first and then decreased and et p decreased slightly the increase in the cultivated area did not cause an obvious increase in water consumption mainly due to extensive irrigation methods before 1990 in 1990 water saving irrigation projects were implemented in zhangye by 2000 61 73 km2 of pipe irrigation 7 09 km2 of drip irrigation and 8 67 km2 of sprinkler irrigation were developed which led to a reduction in average water consumption per unit area with little impact on the overall middle hrb in water consumption wang 2002 from 2001 2005 the cultivated area increased with et et p t t et also increasing indicating that the increase in cultivated area heightened the water consumption in the 13 irrigation districts during 2001 2005 from 2011 2015 the cultivated area increased while et and et p decreased slightly and t remained unchanged indicating that the impact of the increase in the cultivated area on the increase in water consumption was less than the impact of water saving irrigation measures on the decrease in water consumption from 2011 to 2015 water saving irrigation can reduce water consumption especially at the field scale since the implementation of 97 wds a variety of water saving measures had been adopted in the middle hrb including conventional water saving measures such as the trunk spur lateral and farm canal lining semi film furrow irrigation plastic film mulching ridge furrow irrigation and soil testing formula high efficiency water saving irrigation measures were adopted such as pipe drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation the effects of water saving measures differed taking seed corn as an example the flood irrigation amount was 415 m3 mu while after the implementation of high efficiency water saving irrigation measures the pipe and drip irrigation amounts were 390 m3 mu and 350 m3 mu respectively mo 2018 the implementation timing of these water saving measures also differed for ganzhou sprinkler irrigation dominated from 2000 to 2004 drip irrigation area grew slowly from 2004 to 2012 and after 2012 drip irrigation area grew rapidly in 2014 drip irrigation area exceeded pipe irrigation area water saving irrigation is supported by diversifying funding sources water saving project in hrb took the lead in the implementation of water saving irrigation from 2000 to 2003 followed by loans from japan bank for international cooperation for the development of water saving irrigation water saving society project the promotion and application of new varieties and technologies high efficiency water saving demonstration high standard farmland construction and other projects as well as the people s self financing have participated in high efficiency water saving projects making the actual high efficiency water saving irrigation area much higher than the water saving irrigation area calculated by the water department since 2000 water saving measures had reduced ineffective evaporation resulting in an increase in t et and a decrease in et 5 driving factors of temporal and spatial variation of water consumption before and after 97 wds pre and post the implementation of 97 wds driving factors of water consumption can be drawn through correlation analysis fig 9 for et before 2000 et was significantly positively correlated with precipitation p 0 05 after 2000 et was significantly positively correlated with the precipitation the area ratio of wheat the strip farmland the fruit and vegetables p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the area of the pipe drip and sprinkler irrigation the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 for t before 2000 t was significantly positively correlated with the cultivated area and the grain yield p 0 05 after 2000 t was significantly positively correlated with the precipitation the area ratio of wheat and strip farmland p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the cultivated area the drip irrigation area and the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 for t et before 2000 t et was significantly positively correlated with the cultivated area and the grain yield p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the inflow from liyuanhe and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge p 0 05 after 2000 t et was significantly positively correlated with the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the area of drip pipe and sprinkler irrigation the area ratio of seed corn p 0 05 while significantly negatively correlated with the area ratio of wheat the strip farmland the fruit and vegetables p 0 05 the contribution rate of driving factors to water consumption was further quantified by using multiple linear regression for et from 1981 to 1993 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe gorge the fluctuating precipitation and the increased grain yield can explain 92 of the increased et from 1993 2000 the fluctuating precipitation the increased cultivated area and the increased grain can explain 84 of the decreased et from 2000 2007 the fluctuating precipitation the increased drip area the fluctuating groundwater withdrawal and the decreased ratio of fruit and vegetables can explain 78 of the decreased et from 2007 2015 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe gorge the fluctuating precipitation the decreased grain yield the increased pipe irrigation area the increased groundwater withdrawal and the increased area ratio of seed corn can explain 90 of the et which decreased followed by increased for t from 1981 to 1993 the inflow from yingluoxia the inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the fluctuating precipitation and the increased grain yield can explain 93 of the increased t from 1993 2000 the fluctuation precipitation the increased first then decreased discharge of zhengyixia gorge the increased cultivated area and the increased grain yield can explain 89 of the decreased first then increased t from 2000 2007 the fluctuating precipitation the increased drip irrigation area and the fluctuating groundwater withdrawal can explain 70 of the increased t from 2007 2015 the decreased inflow from liyuanhe the decreased precipitation the increased discharge of zhengyixia gorge and the decreased area ratio of fruit and vegetables can explain 76 of the decreased t for t et before 2000 the inflow from yingluoxia gorge the inflow from liyuanhe the discharge of zhengyixia gorge and the increased grain yield can explain 93 of the increased t et after 2000 the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated area the grain yield and the drip irrigation area can explain 45 of the increased t et 6 discussion 6 1 cultivated area expansion failing to increase the water consumption by analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of water consumption pre and post implementation of 97 wds we found that increasing the water saving irrigation efficiency and expanding the cultivated area in the middle hrb did not increase the water consumption increasing irrigation efficiency the water consumption evapotranspiration would be reduced because the plant height and ear of seed corn under drip irrigation were lower than that of flood irrigation and the growth period of drip irrigation was 2 days shorter than that of flood irrigation despite the corn yield and density of drip irrigation was higher zhao 2018 with improved irrigation efficiency farmers have the potential to grow less water consumption crops but more productive thereby reducing water consumption if the water consumption saved by improving irrigation efficiency is greater than the water consumption increased by expanding the cultivated area the total water consumption will fail to increase studies have shown that the increased cultivated area is the main factor driving the increase in water demand in the middle hrb geng et al 2021a jiang et al 2019 reducing cultivated areas is commonly regarded as the primary countermeasure to reducing water consumption in the middle hrb nian et al 2014 concluded that the further increase in the cultivated area should be limited analysis has shown that even a roll back of the cultivated area to the 2000 level could barely complete the releasing indicator but groundwater in the middle hrb will be over exploited jiang et al 2019 geng 2021 believed that the cultivated area should be restored to 1200 km2 to limit water consumption in the middle hrb within the 97 wds instead of focusing solely on restricting the extension of cultivated areas water consumption in the middle hrb should be reduced in terms of the cultivated area the water saving irrigation area the inflow from yingluoxia gorge and the inflow from liyuanhe the storage variables and other driving factors 6 2 t et influenced by natural factors and human activities studies have reported that the average t et of the global ecosystem is around 0 6 berkelhammer et al 2016 maxwell and condon 2016 the t et was 0 51 in this study which is close to the global average existing research suggests that t et is driven by natural factors such as temperature rainfall soil moisture greening and enhanced vegetation index da rocha et al 2022 niu et al 2019 ren et al 2019 t et in the middle hrb increased significantly at a rate of 0 0075 yr 1 p 0 01 much higher than the average rate in china which is 0 0019 yr 1 it indicates that in addition to natural factors t et in the middle hrb is driven by other factors in this study before 2000 the driving factors for the increased t et are the grain yield and the cultivated area after 2000 the main driving factors are the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the cultivated areas the grain yield and the drip irrigation area t et is influenced by human activities such as water distribution schemes water saving irrigation areas cultivated areas and the planting structure as well as natural factors such as temperature and rainfall by adjusting the driving factors t et in liyuanhe daman youlian and luocheng should be increased and t et with decreasing pixels after 2000 should be increased such as decreasing pixels in yingke and daman 6 3 driving factors of water consumption not only cultivated area water consumption in the middle hrb has been measured using a variety of approaches for the difference between the inflow from yingluoxai gorge and the discharge of zhengyixia gorge the water consumption increased before 2000 and the annual average value after 2000 was lower than 0 808 billion m3 from 1990 to 1999 geng et al 2021a zhao et al 2019 argued that water consumption in the middle hrb is 0 830 billion m3 0 200 billion m3 more than 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds for water demand the water consumption in the middle hrb increased from 1 08 billion m3 in 1986 to 1 908 billion m3 in 2013 liu and shen 2018 for evapotranspiration water consumption increases gradually from 1990 to 2004 ranging from 2 23 to 3 416 billion m3 jin and liang 2009 while geng et al 2021 considered water consumption first decrease then increase and the multi year average evapotranspiration is 1 433 billion m3 this paper distinguishes between evapotranspiration and transpiration the multi year average et t t et and et p of the middle hrb were 1 150 billion m3 0 575 billion m3 0 51 and 0 905 billion m3 respectively influenced by 97 wds et and et p decrease significantly below 1981 t decreased slightly the same as in 1996 or 1999 the multi year average water deficit et p in the middle hrb was 0 905 billion m3 which was larger than the 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds over time the et p of the 13 irrigation districts in the middle hrb except liyuanhe gradually decreased from 0 885 billion m3 in 2000 to 0 580 billion m3 in 2013 et p from 2000 to 2012 is larger than 0 63 billion m3 while from 2013 to 2015 less than 0 63 billion m3 scholars believe that the expansion of cultivated areas is the driving factor for the increase in water consumption in the middle hrb hu et al 2015 jin and liang 2009 further liu and shen 2018 believed that climate change cultivated land expansion and planting structure changes contributed to the increase in water requirement at rates of 6 9 58 1 and 25 3 respectively our research indicates that before the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflows from yingluoxia gorge and liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation grain yield and cultivated area after the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflow from liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation groundwater withdrawal grain yield and water saving irrigation area and planting structure there is no significant correlation between cultivated area expansion and water consumption the following measures will reduce water consumption in the middle hrb 1 adjust the planting structure increasing the proportion of low water consumption low yield and high income crops 2 expand water saving irrigation area 3 improve t et 4 adjuste the 97 wds based on the inflow from liyuanhe and the precipitation in the middle hrb 6 4 evaluation of 97 wds based on water consumption in the middle hrb liu et al 2017a believe that the main reasons for the poor adaptability of the 97 wds are 1 the inflow from the tributaries is effectively intercepted and consumed on the spot and no water enters the mainstream of the heihe river except for liyuanhe 2 the cultivated area increased by 37 400 hm2 increasing 0 221 billion m3 in agricultural water consumption 3 since the implementation of the 97 wds the midstream has consumed nearly 0 2 billion m3 more than the water allocated by 97 wds which has seriously affected the implementation of the 97 wds jiang et al 2019 believe that the reason why the 97 wds can t complete the releasing indicator are 1 after the 97 wds inflow from tributaries decreased sharply and the mainstream could not be supplemented by tributaries in wet years 2 the expansion of cultivated areas increases water consumption in the middle hrb 3 the 97 wds doesn t make specific provisions for the year of inflows greater than 90 and less than 10 and the water distribution in the coming year when the water is more than 90 and less than 10 in recent years the continuous abundant inflow from yingluoxia gorge has caused difficulties in the implementation of 97 wds yi et al 2019 believes that 97 wds is based on the assumption that the precipitation in upstream and midstream is the same as abundance and dryness however the frequency is only 39 1 which leads the releasing indicator fail to be completed we believe that the reason why the 97 wds can t complete the releasing indicator are 1 before 2012 et p in the middle hrb is greater than 0 63 billion m3 allocated by 97 wds 2 after 2007 increased storage variables lead to increased groundwater storage 3 in very abundant year the precipitation in the midstream the inflow from yingluoxai gorge and the inflow from liyuanhe are not the same as abundance and dryness 7 conclusions in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics variation and the driving factors related to water consumption pre and post implementation of 97 wds were analyzed the spatial patterns of et t t et and et p were analyzed by the mean method the spatial variation was analyzed by the linear trend the annual trends of et t t et and et p were analyzed by piecewise fitting the influence factors of water consumption in the middle hrb were analyzed by comparative analysis the driving factors of water consumption were analyzed by correlation analysis further the contribution rate of driving factors to water consumption was analyzed by the multiple linear regression method the results show that the multi year average et t t et and et p of the middle hrb gradually decreased from the upstream to the downstream and with the increasing distance from the river before the implementation of the 97 water diversion scheme 97 wds in 2000 the spatial variation of et t t et and et p displayed increasing trends whereas after the implementation except for t et the trends reversed for annual trends the implementation of 97 wds resulted in a continuous increase in t et a significant decrease in et and et p below 1981 and a slight decrease in t basically the same as in 1996 or 1999 before the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflows from yingluoxia gorge and liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation grain yield and cultivated area after the implementation of 97 wds the main driving factors of et and t were water inflow from liyuanhe discharge from the zhengyixia gorge precipitation groundwater withdrawal grain yield and water saving irrigation area and planting structure the results show that the 97 wds has a great impact on the temporal and spatial trends and driving factors of et t and et p in the middle hrb under the centralized allocation of water resources the water consumption will not necessarily increase if increasing the water saving irrigation efficiency expanding the cultivated area this study expands the past work as follows 1 the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics variation and the driving factors of et and t were investigated in the middle hrb pre and post implementation of 97 wds 2 under the centralized allocation of water resources the study provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and improving irrigation efficiency 3 the driving factors of t et have been expanded t et is influenced by natural factors and human activities 4 from the perspective of water consumption in the middle hrb the 97 wds was evaluated in this paper we found that 1 the remote sensing data resolution used in the research needs to be improved 2 there are many studies on evapotranspiration and precipitation in the hrb or the upstream but less in midstream in the future evapotranspiration and precipitation in the middle hrb should be further researched the result provides new evidence for the decreasing water consumption in response to the expanding cultivated area and provides a certain basis and reference for increasing t et reducing water consumption in the middle hrb and evaluating 97 wds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9502,water is a critical resource for sustainable development and stable food production in agroecosystems china is one of the countries with intensified agricultural activities and extreme water shortages climate change is likely to contribute to an increased scarcity of agricultural water resources which may threaten china s food security therefore a comprehensive understanding of long term agricultural soil water variation and its controlling factors at a regional scale is urgently needed based on in situ relative soil moisture rsm the ratio of soil water content to field capacity data collected from 238 agricultural stations in china variations in rsm between 1992 and 2012 and the driving factors were investigated within different climate zones overall the national mean rsm showed a decreasing trend indicating mild or moderate levels of drought during the study period the rates and ratios of rsm reduction varied with the soil depth and climate zone among the four climate zones the reduction in rsm was faster and higher in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones however there was no significant trend in the temperate humid and subtropical humid climate zones both climate and agricultural management activities have made significant contributions to rsm in china s agroecosystems in this study rsm in 58 2 of the selected stations was driven by the combined effects of climate and management activities for different climate zones the rsm in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones was mainly controlled by temperature and precipitation respectively in the temperate humid climate zone climate change was the dominant factor controlling rsm in the subtropical humid climate zone grain output had a negative effect on the rsm our findings provide a theoretical reference for each region to facilitate agricultural water evaluation and agricultural policymaking and enhance field management for the sustainable use of

of studies on spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture and the controlling factors have been carried out in various regions and agroecosystems in china in the loess plateau dryland region of china a 15 year study of winter wheat monoculture showed that the long term application of chemical fertilizers and manure was accompanied by a decrease in soil water levels of approximately 64 mm and 105 mm during the planting and harvest periods respectively huang et al 2003 precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration are the main routes of soil water replenishment and consumption in rainfed agroecosystems and directly affect soil moisture ren et al 2021 temperature is the key parameter in evapotranspiration models and the temperature based model is one of the most widely used models for

increasing pressure of water scarcity piao et al 2010 veeck 2013 xu et al 2017 at a national scale the study of the long term characteristics of soil moisture and related factors is hampered by the challenges associated with data collection and intensive investments in terms of cost and time previous studies have mainly focused on the response of soil moisture to a single impact factor at a plot or regional scale this approach is inappropriate for understanding long term soil moisture variations and controlling factors at a national scale entin et al 2000 with an increasing spatial scale the large scale processes may obscure the contribution of small scale factors and factors that govern large scale soil moisture content variations must be considered botter et al 2007 zhao et al 2021 thus there is a knowledge gap in the understanding of long term variation patterns of soil moisture and the relative contributions of potential driving factors in agroecosystems at a national scale this is a theoretical and practical requirement for sustainable agricultural soil water management and stabilization of china s grain production in this study 238 in situ relative soil moisture rsm the ratio of soil water content to field capacity data points were collected across all chinese agroecosystems from 1992 to 2012 the long term variations in rsm and relative contributions of the driving factors within different climate zones were investigated the specific objectives of this study were to i understand the temporal and spatial variations in rsm across china s agroecosystems and ii investigate the relative contributions of climate i e precipitation and temperature and or factors related to management practices i e fertilization plant coverage and crop yield to rsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil moisture data rsm is the ratio of soil water content to field capacity wang et al 2015 in agriculture rsm is an important index for characterizing the degree of drought and soil water availability which can synthetically reflect the soil moisture status and surface hydrological processes kunstmann et al 2008 in addition rsm provides an important reference for irrigation strategies according to the standard of classification for drought severity ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 rsm is used as an indicator to evaluate the severity of agricultural drought based on the value of rsm the severity of soil drought was divided into five grades i no drought if rsm 60 ii mild drought if 50 rsm 60 iii moderate drought if 40 rsm 50 iv severe drought if 30 rsm 40 and v extreme drought if rsm 30 in this study we acquired rsm data from the national climate data science center website http data cma cn which was measured using an automatic agricultural weather station among all the agricultural meteorological stations 238 stations were selected with strong time continuity to carry out this research which covers the chinese mainland fig 1 rsm information at various soil depths 10 20 and 50 cm was obtained at 10 day intervals covering the years 1992 2012 the annual rsm was calculated by averaging 10 day values to investigate the effects of climate on the rsm four climate zones were identified based on precipitation and temperature zheng et al 2010 among the selected stations 18 were located in the plateau mountain climate zone i 44 in the temperate continental climate zone ii 129 in the temperate humid climate zone iii and 47 in the subtropical humid climate zone iv fig 1 the statistical values of the annual rsm in the four climate zones are shown in table 1 2 2 climatic variables climate data temperature measured in c and precipitation measured in mm for 2400 weather stations in china were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn with a spatial resolution of 1 km the raster data were analyzed using the anusplin software package subsequently resampling was performed using arcgis 10 6 to extract the specific climate factors for each selected station the statistical values of the annual temperature and precipitation in the four climate zones are shown in table s1 2 3 agricultural management activities three socioeconomic indicators were introduced to identify the agricultural management activities annual grain output fertilizer amount and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi information on annual grain output and fertilizer amount at the county level was collected from the statistical yearbook of the republic of china these data were assumed to represent the specific annual grain output and fertilizer amount at each selected station using the gimms ndvi and spot vegetation ndvi software packages we analyzed the changes in ndvi to determine the relationship between vegetation growth and rsm gimms ndvi acquired from the global land cover facility university of maryland http www geo data cn has a spatial resolution of 8 km and a temporal resolution of 15 days and was used for the 1992 2000 period spot vegetation ndvi that was acquired from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 10 days and was used for the 2000 2012 period the annual ndvi value was calculated using the maximum value composite method which can minimize the effects of the solar zenith angle cloud contamination atmospheric impact and scan angles holben 1986 the statistical values of the annual ndvi grain output and fertilizer amount in the four climate zones are shown in table s2 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 interannual trends linear regression was used to analyze the interannual rsm trends and the following formula was used 1 slope n i 1 n i r sm i i 1 n i i 1 n rsm i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where n is the number of years n 21 during the study period i is the individual year varying from 1 to n and rsm is the relative soil moisture content a positive slope value indicates an increasing trend in rsm conversely a negative slope indicates a decreasing trend the statistical significance of the slope was determined using a t test 2 4 2 contributions of each factor the contributions of each factor temperature precipitation grain output fertilizer amount and ndvi were calculated using partial derivatives suggested by roderick et al 2007 and applied to the loess plateau naeem et al 2021 this method works on the principle of partial correlation coefficients which evaluate the degree of association between two random variables by controlling the effect of other variables thereby improving the reliability of the data before the partial derivative analysis was performed all datasets were normalized to the range of the rsm by applying the following equation 2 x x x min x max x min y where x is the normalized time series of x x is the annual value of each factor for one year at a given location x min is the minimum value of the driving factor in 1992 2012 x max is the maximum value of the driving factor in 1992 2012 and y is the maximum value of the rsm in 1992 2012 we applied the chain rule to describe the multivariate function for the relationship between the rsm and the five factors the chain rule can be expressed as follows 3 rsm f temp prec go fa ndvi where temp is temperature prec is precipitation go is grain output and fa is the fertilizer amount multivariate nonparametric analysis was used to calculate the contributions of each factor by estimating the elasticities of multiple factors in a multivariate regression model as regression coefficients the multivariate nonparametric model was developed by assuming that the absolute change in rsm was a linear combination of absolute changes in temp prec ndvi go and fa as follows 4 drsm rsm temp dtemp rsm prec dprec rsm ndvi dndvi rsm go dgo ndvi fa dfa r by substituting the absolute changes from the mean in eq 4 we obtained 5 rsm rsm rsm temp temp temp rsm prec prec prec rsm ndvi ndvi ndvi rsm go go go rsm fa fa fa r where rsm is the mean rsm for the study period similarly the mean values for the study period were calculated for all five factors the above equation can be rearranged as 6 rsm rsm rsm rsm temp temp rsm temp temp temp rsm prec prec rsm prec prec prec rsm ndvi ndvi rsm ndvi ndvi

and precipitation the contribution of management practices was calculated as the sum of the contributions of grain output fertilizer amount and ndvi the impact of climate and management practices was explored by comparing the slope of rsm contribution of climate change and contribution of agricultural management practices if the slope of the rsm increases the rsm is defined as restoration if the slope of rsm decreases the rsm is defined as degradation 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations in rsm across china s agroecosystems at a national scale rsm generally increased with increasing soil depth indicating that the water content in deeper soil layers was higher fig 2 1992 2012 the national mean rsm for all soil depths showed a decreasing trend the rate of reduction varied with the soil depth with a mean value of 0 12 a 1 in particular the rsm at a depth of 20 cm decreased the fastest 0 15 a 1 followed by the rsm at 50 and 10 cm depths 0 11 and 0 09 a 1 respectively fig 2 the average rsm in the 0 50 cm layer fluctuated over time and indicated a mild and moderate levels of drought 40 rsm 60 these fluctuations were consistent with variations in the recorded precipitation levels the spatial distribution of the average rsm 1992 2012 in the 0 50 cm soil layer is shown in fig 3 a among the 238 stations only 24 had an rsm higher than 60 which indicated the absence of an agricultural drought seventy six percent of the sites had an rsm lower than 60 which indicated that more than three quarters of croplands had experienced varying intensities of drought these sites are mainly located in the central and western regions of china the annual percentage of sites experiencing varying drought severities during the study period is shown in fig 3 b with the fluctuation in precipitation the percentage of no drought sites increased or decreased accordingly and the percentage of extreme drought sites showed the opposite trend throughout the study period variations in the rsm at each selected station were calculated using eq 1 and the results for the different soil depths 10 20 50 and 0 50 cm are presented in fig 4 over the 21 years the average rsm in the 0 50 cm soil layer decreased significantly in 24 of the sites and increased significantly in 18 of the sites regarding different soil depths the 20 and 50 cm depths showed the largest number of sites 44 with significant changes 26 increase and 18 decrease followed by 35 18 increase and 17 decrease in the 10 cm depth 3 2 soil moisture variation within different climate zones the temporal variations in rsm at various soil depths in the four climate zones are presented in fig 5 there are clear regional disparity differences in the rsm trends among climate zones in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones the rsm decreased significantly however in the temperate humid and subtropical humid climate zones there was no obvious trend in the rsm variation fig 5 in the plateau mountain climate zone the rsm in the 0 50 cm layer fluctuated between mild and moderate drought levels the rsm decreased to 0 24 0 51 and 0 54 a 1 at soil depths of 10 20 and 50 cm respectively the annual precipitation in the plateau mountain climate zone is between 400 and 500 mm and the years with higher rsm levels were usually accompanied by higher annual precipitation rsm in the temperate continental climate zone was the lowest among those for all the four climate zones and decreased at a rate of over 0 4 a 1 across multiple soil depths the annual precipitation was generally lower than 400 mm in 1997 2005 2009 and 2011 and the rsm declined accordingly in the temperate humid climate zone the rsm showed an insignificant increase across soil depths annual precipitation in 1997 480 mm was the lowest during the study period and the rsm dramatically declined by approximately 8 a 1 at a soil depth of 10 cm the water conditions in the subtropical humid climate zone were the best among the four climate zones the drought level indicated by rsm in the 0 50 cm profile fluctuated between no drought and mild drought with no significant trend in the rsm variation for the years 1993 1998 2008 and 2010 the annual precipitation exceeded 800 mm thereby resulting in drought free conditions 3 3 contributions of climate and management practices to rsm the site specific contributions of climate factors and management practices to the rsm are shown in fig 6 variations in rsm were controlled by a combination of climate factors and management practices for 58 2 of all the sites climate factors dominated the variation in rsm in 25 8 of the selected sites for the remaining 16 0 the variation was dominated by management practices the dominant factor underlying rsm differed across the climate zones as shown in fig 7 in the plateau mountain climate zone temperature contributed the highest percentage to all soil depths in the 0 50 cm profile fig 7 which indicated that temperature changes were the main driving force that affected the rsm the results of the multivariate nonparametric analysis also showed that the sites with an increase or decrease in rsm were mainly controlled by increasing or decreasing temperature tables 2 3 in the temperate continental climate zone precipitation variation had the greatest impact on the rsm fig 7 and this contribution increased with increasing soil depth table 3 for different sites increased rsm was controlled by increased precipitation whereas decreased rsm was controlled by decreased precipitation and ndvi tables 2 3 in the temperate humid climate zone climate change including temperature and precipitation significantly affected the rsm at all soil depths fig 7 an increase in rsm was caused by increased temperature and precipitation whereas a decrease in rsm was caused by decreased temperature and precipitation tables 2 3 in the subtropical humid climate zone the combined influence of temperature and ndvi was the principal controlling factor affecting rsm decreased rsm was associated with decreased ndvi and temperature an increased rsm was associated with increased ndvi temperature precipitation and fertilizer usage tables 2 3 in addition grain output had a negative impact on rsm variation fig 7 with a decreased grain output resulting in an increased rsm and vice versa tables 2 3 4 discussion 4 1 unbalanced distribution of soil moisture the distribution of rsm was regionally imbalanced and the variation in rsm across various climate zones showed clear differences within china the distribution of water resources in china does not correspond well with the geospatial distribution of the water demand liu et al 2015 with only 18 of china s water resources available for 65 of the total arable land piao et al 2010 northern china is facing increasing water scarcity liu et al 2015 in addition there is evidence of a drought like trend in northern china wang et al 2015 the imbalance between water supply and demand leads to severe droughts in croplands which in turn threaten the sustainability of the agricultural ecosystem and food security in northern china chen et al 2013 based on the results of our study the key impact factors for rsm varied with soil depth and across the climate zones fig 7 the rsm in more than half of the selected sites was a combined result of climate change and management practices in the plateau mountain climate zone rsm was mainly controlled by temperature fig 7 snow and glacial meltwater are important sources of soil moisture on the tibetan plateau pu et al 2020 at the same time the regional temperature is maintained at a low level throughout the year and frozen soil hampers the infiltration and lateral movement of water pang et al 2012 dai et al 2019 as a result of global warming the temperature in this area has gradually increased this temperature change caused a shift in the snow line increased glacial ablation and increased the water volume of the surface rivers wang et al 2013 lu et al 2017 the warming trend during the cold season shortens the duration of seasonal ground freezing yang et al 2010 which in turn increases the infiltration of snow and glacial meltwater thus the rsm has increased with an increase in temperature in the plateau mountain climate zone pang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 also claimed that temperature was the primary factor affecting soil moisture status in the tibetan plateau 4 2 most significant impact factor for soil moisture the surface soil is the main site for precipitation infiltration and soil evaporation hu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019a and the influence of precipitation on soil moisture generally decreases as the depth of the soil layer increases zhao et al 2019b however in this study the influence of precipitation on the rsm in the temperate continental climate zone increased with increasing depth table 3 this was mainly due to the higher water infiltration capacity created by coarse textured soil with infiltrated precipitation mainly stored in the deeper soil layers 10 50 cm zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2021a in addition temperate continental climate zones have low precipitation and high evaporation rates liu et al 2004 han et al 2009 precipitation recharged soil water could not be retained by the surface soil layer for extended periods and the effect of precipitation on the surface rsm was therefore small temperature affects the evapotranspiration process and thus the variation in rsm deol et al 2012 song et al 2013 an increase in temperature leads to an increase in soil water evaporation and plant transpiration which ultimately causes a reduction in the soil moisture content song et al 2009 and 2013 wei et al 2015 however in temperate humid climate zones an increase in temperature is generally accompanied by an increase in precipitation chen et al 2013 wei et al 2015 although high temperatures result in a high evaporation rate soil water can be recharged in a timely manner by precipitation and rsm in temperate humid climate zones is mainly caused by precipitation wu et al 2008 song et al 2009 in arid and semi arid regions excessive ndvi and fertilizer application cause excessive consumption of soil moisture via crop root uptake huang et al 2003 liu et al 2015 in the subtropical humid climate zone the effects of ndvi and fertilizer amount on rsm

9502,water is a critical resource for sustainable development and stable food production in agroecosystems china is one of the countries with intensified agricultural activities and extreme water shortages climate change is likely to contribute to an increased scarcity of agricultural water resources which may threaten china s food security therefore a comprehensive understanding of long term agricultural soil water variation and its controlling factors at a regional scale is urgently needed based on in situ relative soil moisture rsm the ratio of soil water content to field capacity data collected from 238 agricultural stations in china variations in rsm between 1992 and 2012 and the driving factors were investigated within different climate zones overall the national mean rsm showed a decreasing trend indicating mild or moderate levels of drought during the study period the rates and ratios of rsm reduction varied with the soil depth and climate zone among the four climate zones the reduction in rsm was faster and higher in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones however there was no significant trend in the temperate humid and subtropical humid climate zones both climate and agricultural management activities have made significant contributions to rsm in china s agroecosystems in this study rsm in 58 2 of the selected stations was driven by the combined effects of climate and management activities for different climate zones the rsm in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones was mainly controlled by temperature and precipitation respectively in the temperate humid climate zone climate change was the dominant factor controlling rsm in the subtropical humid climate zone grain output had a negative effect on the rsm our findings provide a theoretical reference for each region to facilitate agricultural water evaluation and agricultural policymaking and enhance field management for the sustainable use of agricultural water resources keywords relative soil moisture agroecosystems long term evolution driving factors 1 introduction soil moisture a key status variable in terrestrial ecosystems plays a crucial role in energy and matter cycles jung et al 2010 manzoni et al 2012 and is the most important source of available water for plants atmospheric water and groundwater dorigo et al 2012 although it accounts only for approximately 0 05 of global freshwater shiklomanov 2000 soil moisture plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles d odorico et al 2003 streamflow botter et al 2007

food production zhao et al 2021 knowledge of the temporal variation and controls of soil moisture dynamics is crucial for understanding hydrological processes agricultural water management and developing models for soil moisture prediction dai et al 2016 hu et al 2010 soil moisture is controlled by precipitation evapotranspiration soil type irradiation vegetation and human activities dorigo et al 2012 mccoll et al 2017 climate change and its impact on crop production are major threats to agroecosystems in the twenty first century gao et al 2008 piao et al 2010 in recent decades a series of studies on spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture and the controlling factors have been carried out in various regions and agroecosystems in china in the loess plateau dryland region of china a 15 year study of winter wheat monoculture showed that the long term application of chemical fertilizers and manure was accompanied by a decrease in soil water levels of approximately 64 mm and 105 mm during the planting and harvest periods respectively huang et al 2003 precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration are the main routes of soil water replenishment and consumption in rainfed agroecosystems and directly affect soil moisture ren et al 2021 temperature is the key parameter in evapotranspiration models and the temperature based model is one of the most widely used models for estimating evapotranspiration valipour 2015 studies have shown that climate change has significant negative effects on the productivity and water conditions of agroecosystems in the loess plateau of china as well as in other similar regions around the world zaveri et al 2020 soil moisture in agroecosystems is also controlled by farmland management practices liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 in northern china intensified agriculture has caused a decline in the soil moisture content liu et al 2015 with the largest human population in the world china has been making efforts to feed 22 of the world s population by cultivating in only 7 of the world s arable land liu et al 2015 in 2015 china s grain production marked 12 consecutive years of growth and reached a record of 621 4 million tons wang et al 2018 however china is one of the 13 countries facing extreme water shortages as the water resources per capita are only one quarter of that of the world average piao et al 2010 by 2030 china s population is predicted to be close to 1 5 billion chen 2007 veeck 2013 with the largest population and limited farmland that is unevenly distributed agroecosystems in china will experience an increasing pressure of water scarcity piao et al 2010 veeck 2013 xu et al 2017 at a national scale the study of the long term characteristics of soil moisture and related factors is hampered by the challenges associated with data collection and intensive investments in terms of cost and time previous studies have mainly focused on the response of soil moisture to a single impact factor at a plot or regional scale this approach is inappropriate for understanding long term soil moisture variations and controlling factors at a national scale entin et al 2000 with an increasing spatial scale the large scale processes may obscure the contribution of small scale factors and factors that govern large scale soil moisture content variations must be considered botter et al 2007 zhao et al 2021 thus there is a knowledge gap in the understanding of long term variation patterns of soil moisture and the relative contributions of potential driving factors in agroecosystems at a national scale this is a theoretical and practical requirement for sustainable agricultural soil water management and stabilization of china s grain production in this study 238 in situ relative soil moisture rsm the ratio of soil water content to field capacity data points were collected across all chinese agroecosystems from 1992 to 2012 the long term variations in rsm and relative contributions of the driving factors within different climate zones were investigated the specific objectives of this study were to i understand the temporal and spatial variations in rsm across china s agroecosystems and ii investigate the relative contributions of climate i e precipitation and temperature and or factors related to management practices i e fertilization plant coverage and crop yield to rsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil moisture data rsm is the ratio of soil water content to field capacity wang et al 2015 in agriculture rsm is an important index for characterizing the degree of drought and soil water availability which can synthetically reflect the soil moisture status and surface hydrological processes kunstmann et al 2008 in addition rsm provides an important reference for irrigation strategies according to the standard of classification for drought severity ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 rsm is used as an indicator to evaluate the severity of agricultural drought based on the value of rsm the severity of soil drought was divided into five grades i no drought if rsm 60 ii mild drought if 50 rsm 60 iii moderate drought if 40 rsm 50 iv severe drought if 30 rsm 40 and v extreme drought if rsm 30 in this study we acquired rsm data from the national climate data science center website http data cma cn which was measured using an automatic agricultural weather station among all the agricultural meteorological stations 238 stations were selected with strong time continuity to carry out this research which covers the chinese mainland fig 1 rsm information at various soil depths 10 20 and 50 cm was obtained at 10 day intervals covering the years 1992 2012 the annual rsm was calculated by averaging 10 day values to investigate the effects of climate on the rsm four climate zones were identified based on precipitation and temperature zheng et al 2010 among the selected stations 18 were located in the plateau mountain climate zone i 44 in the temperate continental climate zone ii 129 in the temperate humid climate zone iii and 47 in the subtropical humid climate zone iv fig 1 the statistical values of the annual rsm in the four climate zones are shown in table 1 2 2 climatic variables climate data temperature measured in c and precipitation measured in mm for 2400 weather stations in china were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn with a spatial resolution of 1 km the raster data were analyzed using the anusplin software package subsequently resampling was performed using arcgis 10 6 to extract the specific climate factors for each selected station the statistical values of the annual temperature and precipitation in the four climate zones are shown in table s1 2 3 agricultural management activities three socioeconomic indicators were introduced to identify the agricultural management activities annual grain output fertilizer amount and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi information on annual grain output and fertilizer amount at the county level was collected from the statistical yearbook of the republic of china these data were assumed to represent the specific annual grain output and fertilizer amount at each selected station using the gimms ndvi and spot vegetation ndvi software packages we analyzed the changes in ndvi to determine the relationship between vegetation growth and rsm gimms ndvi acquired from the global land cover facility university of maryland http www geo data cn has a spatial resolution of 8 km and a temporal resolution of 15 days and was used for the 1992 2000 period spot vegetation ndvi that was acquired from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 10 days and was used for the 2000 2012 period the annual ndvi value was calculated using the maximum value composite method which can minimize the effects of the solar zenith angle cloud contamination atmospheric impact and scan angles holben 1986 the statistical values of the annual ndvi grain output and fertilizer amount in the four climate zones are shown in table s2 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 interannual trends linear regression was used to analyze the interannual rsm trends and the following formula was used 1 slope n i 1 n i r sm i i 1 n i i 1 n rsm i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where n is the number of years n 21 during the study period i is the individual year varying from 1 to n and rsm is the relative soil moisture content a positive slope value indicates an increasing trend in rsm conversely a negative slope indicates a decreasing trend the statistical significance of the slope was determined using a t test 2 4 2 contributions of each factor the contributions of each factor temperature precipitation grain output fertilizer amount and ndvi were calculated using partial derivatives suggested by roderick et al 2007 and applied to the loess plateau naeem et al 2021 this method works on the principle of partial correlation coefficients which evaluate the degree of association between two random variables by controlling the effect of other variables thereby improving the reliability of the data before the partial derivative analysis was performed all datasets were normalized to the range of the rsm by applying the following equation 2 x x x min x max x min y where x is the normalized time series of x x is the annual value of each factor for one year at a given location x min is the minimum value of the driving factor in 1992 2012 x max is the maximum value of the driving factor in 1992 2012 and y is the maximum value of the rsm in 1992 2012 we applied the chain rule to describe the multivariate function for the relationship between the rsm and the five factors the chain rule can be expressed as follows 3 rsm f temp prec go fa ndvi where temp is temperature prec is precipitation go is grain output and fa is the fertilizer amount multivariate nonparametric analysis was used to calculate the contributions of each factor by estimating the elasticities of multiple factors in a multivariate regression model as regression coefficients the multivariate nonparametric model was developed by assuming that the absolute change in rsm was a linear combination of absolute changes in temp prec ndvi go and fa as follows 4 drsm rsm temp dtemp rsm prec dprec rsm ndvi dndvi rsm go dgo ndvi fa dfa r by substituting the absolute changes from the mean in eq 4 we obtained 5 rsm rsm rsm temp temp temp rsm prec prec prec rsm ndvi ndvi ndvi rsm go go go rsm fa fa fa r where rsm is the mean rsm for the study period similarly the mean values for the study period were calculated for all five factors the above equation can be rearranged as 6 rsm rsm rsm rsm temp temp rsm temp temp temp rsm prec prec rsm prec prec prec rsm ndvi ndvi rsm ndvi ndvi ndvi rsm go go rsm go go go rsm fa fa rsm fa fa fa r the elasticity of a factor can be defined as 7 ԑ x i rsm rsm x i x i applying the elasticity definition for each factor in eq 6 we obtained 8 rsm

and precipitation the contribution of management practices was calculated as the sum of the contributions of grain output fertilizer amount and ndvi the impact of climate and management practices was explored by comparing the slope of rsm contribution of climate change and contribution of agricultural management practices if the slope of the rsm increases the rsm is defined as restoration if the slope of rsm decreases the rsm is defined as degradation 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations in rsm across china s agroecosystems at a national scale rsm generally increased with increasing soil depth indicating that the water content in deeper soil layers was higher fig 2 1992 2012 the national mean rsm for all soil depths showed a decreasing trend the rate of reduction varied with the soil depth with a mean value of 0 12 a 1 in particular the rsm at a depth of 20 cm decreased the fastest 0 15 a 1 followed by the rsm at 50 and 10 cm depths 0 11 and 0 09 a 1 respectively fig 2 the average rsm in the 0 50 cm layer fluctuated over time and indicated a mild and moderate levels of drought 40 rsm 60 these fluctuations were consistent with variations in the recorded precipitation levels the spatial distribution of the average rsm 1992 2012 in the 0 50 cm soil layer is shown in fig 3 a among the 238 stations only 24 had an rsm higher than 60 which indicated the absence of an agricultural drought seventy six percent of the sites had an rsm lower than 60 which indicated that more than three quarters of croplands had experienced varying intensities of drought these sites are mainly located in the central and western regions of china the annual percentage of sites experiencing varying drought severities during the study period is shown in fig 3 b with the fluctuation in precipitation the percentage of no drought sites increased or decreased accordingly and the percentage of extreme drought sites showed the opposite trend throughout the study period variations in the rsm at each selected station were calculated using eq 1 and the results for the different soil depths 10 20 50 and 0 50 cm are presented in fig 4 over the 21 years the average rsm in the 0 50 cm soil layer decreased significantly in 24 of the sites and increased significantly in 18 of the sites regarding different soil depths the 20 and 50 cm depths showed the largest number of sites 44 with significant changes 26 increase and 18 decrease followed by 35 18 increase and 17 decrease in the 10 cm depth 3 2 soil moisture variation within different climate zones the temporal variations in rsm at various soil depths in the four climate zones are presented in fig 5 there are clear regional disparity differences in the rsm trends among climate zones in the plateau mountain and temperate continental climate zones the rsm decreased significantly however in the temperate humid and subtropical humid climate zones there was no obvious trend in the rsm variation fig 5 in the plateau mountain climate zone the rsm in the 0 50 cm layer fluctuated between mild and moderate drought levels the rsm decreased to 0 24 0 51 and 0 54 a 1 at soil depths of 10 20 and 50 cm respectively the annual precipitation in the plateau mountain climate zone is between 400 and 500 mm and the years with higher rsm levels were usually accompanied by higher annual precipitation rsm in the temperate continental climate zone was the lowest among those for all the four climate zones and decreased at a rate of over 0 4 a 1 across multiple soil depths the annual precipitation was generally lower than 400 mm in 1997 2005 2009 and 2011 and the rsm declined accordingly in the temperate humid climate zone the rsm showed an insignificant increase across soil depths annual precipitation in 1997 480 mm was the lowest during the study period and the rsm dramatically declined by approximately 8 a 1 at a soil depth of 10 cm the water conditions in the subtropical humid climate zone were the best among the four climate zones the drought level indicated by rsm in the 0 50 cm profile fluctuated between no drought and mild drought with no significant trend in the rsm variation for the years 1993 1998 2008 and 2010 the annual precipitation exceeded 800 mm thereby resulting in drought free conditions 3 3 contributions of climate and management practices to rsm the site specific contributions of climate factors and management practices to the rsm are shown in fig 6 variations in rsm were controlled by a combination of climate factors and management practices for 58 2 of all the sites climate factors dominated the variation in rsm in 25 8 of the selected sites for the remaining 16 0 the variation was dominated by management practices the dominant factor underlying rsm differed across the climate zones as shown in fig 7 in the plateau mountain climate zone temperature contributed the highest percentage to all soil depths in the 0 50 cm profile fig 7 which indicated that temperature changes were the main driving force that affected the rsm the results of the multivariate nonparametric analysis also showed that the sites with an increase or decrease in rsm were mainly controlled by increasing or decreasing temperature tables 2 3 in the temperate continental climate zone precipitation variation had the greatest impact on the rsm fig 7 and this contribution increased with increasing soil depth table 3 for different sites increased rsm was controlled by increased precipitation whereas decreased rsm was controlled by decreased precipitation and ndvi tables 2 3 in the temperate humid climate zone climate change including temperature and precipitation significantly affected the rsm at all soil depths fig 7 an increase in rsm was caused by increased temperature and precipitation whereas a decrease in rsm was caused by decreased temperature and precipitation tables 2 3 in the subtropical humid climate zone the combined influence of temperature and ndvi was the principal controlling factor affecting rsm decreased rsm was associated with decreased ndvi and temperature an increased rsm was associated with increased ndvi temperature precipitation and fertilizer usage tables 2 3 in addition grain output had a negative impact on rsm variation fig 7 with a decreased grain output resulting in an increased rsm and vice versa tables 2 3 4 discussion 4 1 unbalanced distribution of soil moisture the distribution of rsm was regionally imbalanced and the variation in rsm across various climate zones showed clear differences within china the distribution of water resources in china does not correspond well with the geospatial distribution of the water demand liu et al 2015 with only 18 of china s water resources available for 65 of the total arable land piao et al 2010 northern china is facing increasing water scarcity liu et al 2015 in addition there is evidence of a drought like trend in northern china wang et al 2015 the imbalance between water supply and demand leads to severe droughts in croplands which in turn threaten the sustainability of the agricultural ecosystem and food security in northern china chen et al 2013 based on the results of our study the key impact factors for rsm varied with soil depth and across the climate zones fig 7 the rsm in more than half of the selected sites was a combined result of climate change and management practices in the plateau mountain climate zone rsm was mainly controlled by temperature fig 7 snow and glacial meltwater are important sources of soil moisture on the tibetan plateau pu et al 2020 at the same time the regional temperature is maintained at a low level throughout the year and frozen soil hampers the infiltration and lateral movement of water pang et al 2012 dai et al 2019 as a result of global warming the temperature in this area has gradually increased this temperature change caused a shift in the snow line increased glacial ablation and increased the water volume of the surface rivers wang et al 2013 lu et al 2017 the warming trend during the cold season shortens the duration of seasonal ground freezing yang et al 2010 which in turn increases the infiltration of snow and glacial meltwater thus the rsm has increased with an increase in temperature in the plateau mountain climate zone pang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 also claimed that temperature was the primary factor affecting soil moisture status in the tibetan plateau 4 2 most significant impact factor for soil moisture the surface soil is the main site for precipitation infiltration and soil evaporation hu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019a and the influence of precipitation on soil moisture generally decreases as the depth of the soil layer increases zhao et al 2019b however in this study the influence of precipitation on the rsm in the temperate continental climate zone increased with increasing depth table 3 this was mainly due to the higher water infiltration capacity created by coarse textured soil with infiltrated precipitation mainly stored in the deeper soil layers 10 50 cm zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2021a in addition temperate continental climate zones have low precipitation and high evaporation rates liu et al 2004 han et al 2009 precipitation recharged soil water could not be retained by the surface soil layer for extended periods and the effect of precipitation on the surface rsm was therefore small temperature affects the evapotranspiration process and thus the variation in rsm deol et al 2012 song et al 2013 an increase in temperature leads to an increase in soil water evaporation and plant transpiration which ultimately causes a reduction in the soil moisture content song et al 2009 and 2013 wei et al 2015 however in temperate humid climate zones an increase in temperature is generally accompanied by an increase in precipitation chen et al 2013 wei et al 2015 although high temperatures result in a high evaporation rate soil water can be recharged in a timely manner by precipitation and rsm in temperate humid climate zones is mainly caused by precipitation wu et al 2008 song et al 2009 in arid and semi arid regions excessive ndvi and fertilizer application cause excessive consumption of soil moisture via crop root uptake huang et al 2003 liu et al 2015 in the subtropical humid climate zone the effects of ndvi and fertilizer amount on rsm showed an opposite trend to those in arid and semi arid regions fig 7 these differences could be attributed to the effect of the root system on the soil structure and precipitation infiltration in the subtropical humid climate zone sufficient rainfall and high ndvi weakened the effect of evapotranspiration on soil water content chen et al 2009 yang et al 2019 the well developed root system affected precipitation infiltration and improved the water holding capacity of the soil fu et al 2015 wang et al 2021b the reduction in ndvi and fertilizer amount may lead to a decrease in plant root biomass which affects the infiltration of precipitation thereby leading to a decrease in soil moisture chen et al 2009 alletto and coquet 2009 wang et al 2021b 4 3 implications for future agriculture

system profit gap probability theory and risk aversion analysis to quantify economic risk and compare 16 adaptation scenarios in an irrigated broadacre farm of the riverina region in australia the scenarios result from the factorial of four agronomic systems baseline current diversified intensified simplified and four irrigation methods including surface irrigation by gravity flood and by pumps pipe riser pressurised irrigation by overhead spray pivot and micro dosing drip results and conclusions a system profit gap of 10 m was quantified for the irrigated farm area over 30 years relative to the baseline flood irrigated wheat canola significant long term profit gains were identified for the intensified mean 273 and diversified mean 80 scenarios current and simplified scenarios were less profitable than the baseline mean 16 and 37 respectively the benefits of intensification were accrued from large gains in crop gross margins especially cotton yields that consistently offset the set up costs and additional water use diversification was superior in mitigating economic risk due to higher returns per ml of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income under the assumptions in our study agronomic system had greater relative influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure significance we demonstrated the potential to inform investment decisions from

particularly in a global operational environment of high risks significant trade offs increasing energy costs labour shortages and large capital costs ara et al 2021 for rainfed grain crops nitrogen n deficiency often accounts for an important part of the gap between the exploitable water limited yield and actual yield hochman et al 2013 2009 monjardino et al 2015 2013 sadras and roget 2004 sadras et al 2016 the yield gap attributable to insufficient applied n becomes negligible where irrigation eliminates the uncertainty in water supply christie et al 2018 grassini et al 2011 rawnsley et al 2019 this effectively translates into lower yield risks associated with irrigated systems assuming that sufficient water is available for timely irrigation the average yield gap for irrigated wheat in sub tropical australia is 1 0 2 7 t ha for non lodged and lodged fields respectively peake et al 2014 and can be attributed to factors including crop and water management peake et al 2016 roth et al 2013 the ratio commodity prices to input costs kirby et al 2014 inadequate irrigation infrastructure khan et al 2009 maraseni et al 2012 and environmental concerns and policy regulations that affect water availability mdba 2019a nwc 2009 social factors also influence profitability farmer risk aversion affects farm productivity in rainfed systems monjardino et al 2019 2015 and is likely to influence irrigation decisions and water productivity fereres et al 2014 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 because of significant price and financial risks incurred from high price volatility and costly irrigation infrastructure frameworks have been developed to expand the yield gap analysis from individual crops to the cropping system accounting for the spatial and temporal arrangement of crops guilpart et al 2017 the concept of cropping system yield gap is particularly useful in irrigated systems because investments in infrastructure and water allocation affect multiple crops in space and time and affect whole farm performance energy based yield per unit of land and time has been used as a currency to aggregate contrasting crops guilpart et al 2017 we use economic return for aggregation thereby shifting the focus from yield gap to profit gap profit gap is defined here as the change in profitability associated with the irrigation system yield gap the aims of this article are to i develop a new analytical framework that combines crop simulation discounted cash flow dcf system profit gap probability theory and risk aversion analysis underpinned by realistic longitudinal trends in commodity and water price and ii compare profit and risk trade offs of 16 farmers informed scenarios resulting from the factorial combination of four agronomic systems and four contrasting water delivery methods using a farm case study in the riverina region of the murray darling basin 2 methods 2 1 farm case study the case study farm is located near the town of finley in nsw 35 6230 s 145 5844 e in the irrigation region of the riverina in the murray darling basin of eastern australia the region has an average annual rainfall of 380 mm 225 mm in winter and 155 mm in summer making dryland cropping difficult soils are predominantly clay loam topsoil over clay and typically store less than 200 mm of water in a maximum depth of 1 5 m the average farm area is 1000 ha with 700 ha of irrigated winter crops e g canola wheat wheat in rotation with summer fallow typical of many in the region the farm holds a permanent water licence with a median entitlement of 1400 ml year taken from the murray irrigation system water entitlements remain the same in wet and dry years goesch et al 2020 whereas allocations against entitlements change according to rainfall inflows into storages and how much water is already stored mdba 2019b allocated water does not come at an extra cost to the licensed farmer because they are entitled to it a temporary trading licence allows the farmer to buy and sell allocated water at market price in addition water carryover allows the farmer to hold up to 30 of water allocation in dam storage within and between years which helps to limit the increase in allocation prices in dry years goesch et al 2020 average annual allocations 60 70 of the total water entitlement are used to flood irrigate 70 of the farmland flood irrigation is presently the preferred choice of riverina finley farmers 2 2 scenarios our analysis focuses on 16 scenarios from the combination of four agronomic systems and four irrigation methods these scenarios were selected from discussions with farmers and industry across the region to represent relevant and contrasting levels of system intensity as well as methods of water delivery a key assumption in this analysis is that all adaptation scenarios including the baseline are underpinned by a new upfront investment in irrigation infrastructure to allow for a simple and direct comparison between options this is in contrast with a farms being already equipped with alternative infrastructure or only requiring partial adjustments and b the baseline flood infrastructure investment being considered a sunk cost that is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered in other words the analysis assumes 16 possible scenarios in which a clean block of land is used for irrigation purpose and where the baseline scenario represents the current situation in terms of agronomy and irrigation for benchmarking 2 2 1 agronomic system four agronomic systems are defined in terms of crop choice allocation of irrigation water area of farm under irrigation level of inputs costs and risk 1 baseline current current system as outlined in section 2 1 further supported by farmer records and regional statistics jlacy consulting 2021 the current system with flood irrigation is the baseline note that variations of current with different irrigation methods see 2 2 2 are considered separately to the baseline 2 diversified seeking diversification of crop income i e more income derived from a variety of sources in any given year the diversified system has similar average water usage and irrigated farm area as baseline current a greater variety of winter crops grown within the year i e wheat canola and a grain legume but similar inputs and costs 3 intensified in general this is a high input high output high risk system relative to the baseline current more water per unit area and year is used for irrigation a larger portion of the farm area is irrigated i e less unirrigated fallow more crops are sown with greater water usage higher inputs per unit area and year e g n herbicides together resulting in higher cost and higher risk per unit area and year 4 simplified in general this is a low input low output low risk system relative to the baseline current this scenario uses less irrigation water per unit area and year increases frequency of rainfed crops and reduces inputs per unit area e g n herbicides resulting in lower cost and lower risk per unit area and year 2 2 2 on farm irrigation infrastructure four irrigation methods are assessed and described in table 1 agvic 2021 thinkwater 2021 a flood surface irrigation in levelled bays water applied by gravity b pipe riser surface irrigation in levelled bays water applied by pumps c pivot pressurised spray irrigation applied by an overhead irrigator that rotates around a central pivot fulcrum d drip pressurised micro irrigation typically applied through small pipes laid on the ground surface irrigation is applied over a longer duration than the other irrigation types as the delivery pipe diameters are small 2 3 simulated crop yield and irrigation water use the agricultural production systems simulator apsim v 7 10 holzworth et al 2014 was used to simulate crop yield irrigation water use n fertiliser and fallow management practises for the 1989 2018 growing seasons 30 years apsim simulation of grain yield in response to weather soil and management including water application has been widely tested in australia across crops soils and cropping systems brennan mckellar et al 2013 de voil et al 2009 gaydon et al 2012 ibrahim et al 2019 liu et al 2020 phelan et al 2018 power et al 2011 supplementary table s1 highlights key features of these studies that support low uncertainty related to model structure the model simulates a different crop rotation for each agronomic system each with four levels of transfer efficiency broadly aligned with the four irrigation infrastructure options described in table 1 all scenarios were parameterised with a combination of farm interview data weather data from silo jeffrey et al 2001 and soil data from apsoil dalgliesh et al 2012 irrigated crops were sown on fixed dates mid april for winter crops mid november for summer crops and dryland crops were sown when rainfall opportunities occur i e 25 mm over four days double cropping systems in the intensified scenario were modelled as summer paddock and winter paddock where sowing and harvesting operations may overlap by a few weeks n fertiliser was applied at sowing and for the intensified scenario 60 days after sowing each irrigation strategy depended on both crop and scenario for the pressurised irrigation scenarios pivot drip cotton was irrigated to 95 of drained upper limit and rice was managed to maintain a surface pond of water between 50 150 mm deep for the surface irrigation systems flood pipe riser the soil was filled to drained upper limit when the fractional water content fell below 0 6 summer crops in the intensified scenario were watered when the fractional content fell below 0 8 for all scenarios watering of the crop finished at 75 of the grain filling period a simple hydrothermal time model was used to estimate weed germination and consequent requirement for weed control during fallow periods we deliberately did not model annual allocation limits because the rotation specifies the water consumption via frequency and sown area and a combination of temporary water trading where a fixed amount of water can be bought or sold at a point in time and carryover transactions where unused allocation can be used in the subsequent year allowing the operator to buffer against both shortfalls and excesses of water consumption however the simulated water consumption fell within the allocated volumes broadly specified for each system section 2 4 2 2 4 assumptions 2 4 1 irrigation infrastructure farmer choices of irrigation infrastructure are complex and often context specific involving trade offs in terms of water management and efficiency annual costs capital investments and farmers preference key characteristics and costs of different irrigation infrastructure are summarised in table 1 based on a wide range of sources including farmer and consultant data and expertise electronic databases technical reports and scientific literature brennan mckellar et al 2013 culpitt 2011 dalton et al 2001 deedi 2011 hogan et al 2006 khan et al 2009 maraseni et al 2012 moore et al 2000 petheram et al 2016 2013 rmcg 2018 roth et al 2005 thinkwater 2021 thompson 2016a 2016b 2 4 2 agronomy prices and costs table 2 summarises parameters and model outputs for the 16 scenarios of agronomic system by irrigation infrastructure over 30 years while water allocation limits were not imposed on the simulations section 2 3 they influenced system design and opportunities for trading water the baseline current scenarios are assumed to irrigate 700 ha of a canola wheat wheat rotation with each winter crop followed by a summer fallow the fallow generates no income but stores water and n and imposes a cost for weed control 0 4 herbicide spray events 1 1 a simple hydro thermal time model of weed germination events was used in apsim to calculate the frequency of spraying events which have an economic but no biophysical impact during fallow periods the model assumed that weeds emerged 250 degree days after a rainfall event 4 days total 25 mm and adequate surface soil water content 50 triggered germination if there was no follow up rain germinated weed seeds stopped growing and died so no spray event was triggered no seed bank was modelled with seeds assumed to be ephemerally distributed the diversified scenarios include a canola wheat faba bean rotation each winter crop similarly followed by a summer fallow 700 ha in comparison to the baseline current the simplified scenarios are assumed to have lower water supply which can only irrigate a reduced area of wheat 50 350 ha while dryland canola grows on the original 700 ha area of the farm the intensified scenarios are assumed to have higher water supply which is used to irrigate 700 ha of winter crops canola wheat and a smaller area 25 175 ha of summer crops maize cotton rice with the remaining 75 of the area in summer fallow annual water allocations were drawn from a 20 year distribution extrapolated from broader water allocations for the region mdba 2019b westwood et al 2020 overall in line with farmer experience and depending on market forces lower water allocations in dry seasons favour simplification whereas high water allocations in wet seasons allow for greater intensification of the cropping program extra water may be carried over from the previous year and or purchased at market price to top up annual allocation and meet higher crop demand an initial drop to a low allocation high price year due to drought for example increases the likelihood of a lower than average allocation in the following year apsim simulated mean irrigation water applied varied from 1 0 ml ha year for canola current drip to 19 4 ml ha year for rice intensified flood broadly aligning with regional experience brennan mckellar et al 2013 dwyer et al 2020 gaydon et al 2012 jlacy consulting 2021 finley farmers have reported annual irrigated yields of 3 0 9 5 t ha from 1 5 4 0 ml ha year of water for wheat 2 5 4 0 t ha from 1 0 2 5 ml ha for canola 1 5 5 0 t ha from 1 0 4 0 ml ha for faba bean 7 8 22 0 t ha from 8 0 11 0 ml ha for maize 6 6 12 6 t ha from 7 5 10 5 ml ha for cotton and 5 0 15 2 t ha from 10 0 17 0 ml ha for rice applications of n fertiliser varied between 100 and 500 kg n ha year table 2 the higher water and n rates simulated in intensified fit a potential scenario with abundant water and unlimited n other variable costs shown in table 2 include the typical crop production costs detailed in section 2 5 1 along with the additional costs of shifting to cotton and rice cropping through a 40 ha year cost of hiring specific cotton harvest machinery e g cotton king baler and a 176 ha year cost of preparing the ground for rice beds e g laser levelling also included is an additional cost of 70 ha year under drip irrigation from changes in requirements in n fertilisers 100 ha year and herbicides 30 ha year table 1 the relative annual economic performance of production or benefit cost ratio was assessed with the economic water productivity ratio ewpr paredes et al 2014 which encompasses the suite of annual irrigation costs c required to achieve the annual crop benefit b or revenue based on simulated irrigated yields for each irrigation scenario i 1 ewpr bi ci where higher ewpr indicates greater benefit per unit cost fig 2 shows the disaggregated annual costs of irrigation and associated ewpr for all scenarios as a rule surface water delivery flood pipe riser requires more water labour and maintenance to run whereas pressurised irrigation pivot drip incurs the highest power and capital costs in terms of benefit cost impact ewpr varied between 1 16 simplified flood and simplified pivot and 2 07 intensified drip ewpr fluctuates with the terms of trade 2 5 discounted cash flow analysis the financial performance of all adaptations was assessed using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis across the crop rotation dcf computes the present value of cash inflows and cash outflows discounted over the time of the investment brennan mckellar et al 2013 petheram et al 2016 the following measures were used in the analysis 2 5 1 net present value the long term profitability of each scenario is summarised as the net present value npv of future cash flows or the sum of future net cash flows discounted to their present value npv is defined as 2 npv t 0 t 30 y t p v t w t n t o t 1 r t i where the sum of annual cash inflows over a period of 30 years corresponding to half a typical australian farmer s career is calculated as the revenue from crop grain yield y t in year t by grain price p and the sum of annual cash outflows includes the bundled variable costs of crop production and fallow management vt cost of irrigation water w t cost of n fertiliser n t and overhead costs of irrigation o t a real discount rate r of 5 0 is used in the analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows based on rates of return experienced for general investments in agriculture in recent years pannell and schilizzi 2008 and i is the initial investment made in year 0 see table 1 for capital costs of different infrastructure options yields for crop revenue were simulated in apsim as described in section 2 3 the farm gate price for grains table 2 temporary water mean 138 ml fig 1 and fertiliser n mean 806 per tonne of n based on urea at 46 n were drawn from frequency distributions of historical real prices 20 30 years abares 2020 indexmundi 2021 westwood et al 2020 after adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index cotton a summer crop grown for intensified scenarios generates two income streams with the seed sold for stockfeed t of fresh weight and the lint sold to the cotton gin on a bale basis using the risk software palisade corporation 2012 the price frequency distributions were fitted using probability density functions pdf of various forms and the anderson darling ad statistics test was used to measure the goodness of fit of each distribution supplementary fig s1 no significant correlation was found between grain water and n prices so the pdf with the best fit was selected for use in monte carlo simulation of annual cash inflows and selected outflows water cost and n cost for use in the npv analysis through the process of generating 1000 random iterations to sample from the probability distribution costs are an important component of irrigation investment and were drawn from a range of sources including technical literature abares www agriculture gov au abares gross margin budgets and expert opinion we assumed that all infrastructure adaptations were new investments rather than partially or completely existing and that all capital costs were incurred in the first year i e the development was not staged likewise we assumed that land was not a constraint and that differences between farm system applied instantaneously as modelled in apsim as opposed to farm system transition taking place over time the costs included in the analysis are capital costs initial investment ha related to the irrigation infrastructure including system purchase and installation earthworks pump installation electrical works storage if applicable as well as other upfront costs such as machinery for new irrigated crops motor vehicles workshops sheds attributable to irrigation interest and depreciation costs of capital are excluded from the npv analysis to avoid double counting pannell and schilizzi 2008 overhead or fixed annual costs associated with irrigation operation and maintenance ha year and include power required for pumping extra labour r m of irrigation system and vehicle running costs these costs vary between irrigation methods and are assumed constant throughout the analysis period within each scenario another fixed cost related to irrigation is the purchase or lease of water entitlements the product of water entitlement median 1400 ml year and permanent water price long term average 1292 ml which has been excluded from this analysis because a it is accounted as a farm finance cost along with lease on land other farm capital assets etc and b it is the same for all scenarios water cost of irrigation ml calculated as the product of the temporary water price mean drawn from a 20 year distribution and the volume of water purchased for irrigation annually nitrogen fertiliser cost ha year calculated as the n rate per crop by n price drawn from a 30 year distribution variable costs of production ha year are specific to each crop and include inputs other than irrigation water and n fertiliser accounted for separately such as seed inoculants soil amelioration other fertilisers herbicides fuel oil and hired labour for seeding fertilising spraying harvesting cartage r m of crop machinery crop insurance and levies the annual costs of shifting production into cotton and rice crops are included here as well variable costs are assumed unchanged throughout the analysis period within each scenario cost of fallow management ha year includes the number of herbicide applications per fallow at an assumed cost of 15 ha year per application 2 5 2 internal rate of return and payback period internal rate of return irr is the discount rate that makes the npv of all cash flows equal to zero irr is the return received by investing capital in this enterprise an enterprise is considered a good investment when the irr exceeds the discount rate payback period is the number of years required to recoup the investment funds i e to reach break even point lower payback periods are preferred 2 5 3 opportunity cost of trading allocation water in the riverina water trade allows licence holders to buy or sell water at any time while permanent trade involves the sale or lease of water entitlements the temporary trade of allocation water is seasonal mdba 2019b we consider the opportunity cost oc of trading allocation water or the potential benefit a farmer loses when using the water for irrigation over selling it mallawaarachchi et al 2020 we calculated oc as the difference between the return on the option not chosen water sale and the return or irr of the chosen option water purchased for crop irrigation the return on allocation water sale was calculated as the product of temporary water price and annual water allocated to the farm for irrigation both drawn from long term distributions along with a seasonal factor in addition a fallow was assumed to replace the crop in the water sale option incurring only a low weed control cost assumed a single spray at a cost of 15 ha 2 6 net value of adaptation and system profit gap an irrigation investment is considered viable if the present value of the benefits is greater than the present value of the costs i e npv 0 the principal economic criterion to compare irrigation scenarios is the net value of adaptation which is calculated as the difference between the npv of future cash flows of each adaptation scenario and the npv of future cash flows of the baseline using economic currency to aggregate contrasting crops and irrigation allocations we define irrigated system profit gap as the difference between the largest net value of all scenarios considered here and the baseline under consideration 2 7 risk analysis for each scenario the frequency distribution of the discounted annual cash flow was fitted based on the ad test to characterise profit volatility using risk the pdf with the best fit was used to determine risk metrics 2 7 1 downside risk and probability of break even a useful measure of downside risk is the conditional value at risk of the lowest 20 of possible outcomes cvar0 2 i e the mean of the lowest 20 of discounted cash flows or in other words the risk of extreme financial loss associated with unfavourable events in addition the probability of positive returns p π 0 is used to measure the likelihood of breaking even over the 30 year period of the analysis and the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean provides a measure of dispersion of a probability distribution discounted cash flows the cvar0 2 p π 0 and cv capture long term yield price and financial risk underpinning the irrigation investment across the whole irrigation system 2 7 2 farmer risk aversion we use a risk premium rp year the minimum amount of money one is willing to pay to eliminate risk exposure to calculate risk adjusted profit or certainty equivalent ce π rp year difalco et al 2007 risk premium captures the cost of risk measured through mean variance and skewness of profit distributions and can be approximated as 3 rp 0 5 r π v where r is a coefficient of relative risk aversion described below π year is the mean net profit based on discounted annual cash flows and v year is the variance of the mean net profit for each adaptation scenario the risk attitude range of farmers is typically measured by a unitless risk aversion coefficient measuring either absolute or relative risk aversion based on the magnitude and spread of the distribution of net returns hardaker et al 2015 a scale of 0 4 was used for r in this study assuming 0 no risk aversion i e risk neutral decision maker 1 low risk aversion 2 moderate risk aversion 3 high risk aversion 4 very high risk aversion gandorfer et al 2011 the analysis was run for each of these r to capture the full spectrum of attitudes to risk a risk adjusted profit value was calculated for each of the five levels of risk aversion the difference between risk neutral profit r 0 and risk adjusted profit at the maximum level of risk aversion r 4 is the maximum cost of risk aversion 2 8 statistical analysis additional statistical tests were performed on the 16 factorial scenarios to assess the influence of agronomy infrastructure and their interaction on financial outputs using anova two factor with replication data were analysed for all scenarios with focus on i varying the agronomy system for each infrastructure option and ii varying irrigation infrastructure within each agronomy system discounted annual cash flow outputs over 30 years were used as replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 profitability of the irrigated system profitability was highest for intensified table 3 fig 3 diversified was generally more profitable than baseline current while simplified proved less attractive especially under pressurised irrigation pivot drip surface irrigation mainly pipe riser was relatively more profitable in most agronomic systems note that the downward trend in discounted annual cash flows relates to the discount rate which is used to allow valid comparisons of benefits and costs that occur at different times fig 3 the higher the rate the lower the present value of future cash flows all scenarios generated a positive npv indicating a relatively profitable investment however the magnitude of the benefit varied widely from 1 7 m simplified drip to 12 9 m intensified pipe riser compared with 3 4 m for the baseline current flood annualised benefits per hectare of irrigated farm and per megalitre of irrigation water varied between 105 ha for current pivot and 26 ml for intensified flood and 491 ha for intensified pipe riser and 160 ml for diversified drip table 3 fig 4 annualised equivalent benefit per unit area strongly aligned with the annualised equivalent benefit and per unit water except for intensified fig 4 suggesting that intensification would be more suited to farmers targeting area based rather than water based returns taking infrastructure investment into account the irr was lowest for current pivot 4 9 return on investment and 14 4 years to pay it back whereas intensified flood had the highest irr 26 8 and the lowest payback period 3 1 years this result indicates that lower input lower output systems would not justify high cost investments regarding the relative effect of key inputs on the npv output mean water price always ranked first followed by grain prices and n price in all current diversified and simplified scenarios in intensified water price had the largest effect followed by a mix of grain and n prices the price of n fertilizer had a relatively higher effect in most drip scenarios tornado graphs for inputs ranked by effect on output mean for the 16 scenarios are shown in supplementary fig s2 overall the benefits of intensified were accrued from large gains in crop gross margins especially per irrigated area which consistently offset the mounting costs including additional water use while diversified was superior in mitigating risk across the system due to higher return per ml of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income lower cv higher cvar0 2 and p π 0 table 3 the de risking role of diversification with moderate input use was highlighted in lower rainfall years such as 1992 and 2004 where restricted irrigation water impacted crop yields and system profitability fig 3 this was also evident in the higher benefit per ml of water in diversified drip compared for example to intensified drip table 3 and fig 4 3 2 mitigating risk and uncertainty relative to the baseline current flood diversified scenarios with surface and pivot irrigation and all simplified scenarios reduced downside risk quantified with cvar0 2 the less costly albeit less efficient flood and pipe riser irrigation methods were the least risky in all scenarios over 30 years compared to the baseline cvar0 2 was reduced for diversified scenarios from 1 diversified pivot to 19 diversified flood but not with drip 12 the probability of break even p π 0 varied between 71 current pivot and 81 diversified pipe riser compared with 73 in the baseline the cv of annual discounted cash flows changed from 2 30 in the baseline to a low of 1 10 in diversified flood and a high of 2 60 in current pivot indicating a reduced risk or increased resilience in the former and an increased risk in the latter scenario table 3 fig 5 our results partially support the proposition that when water supply is limited pressurised irrigation should be favoured for efficient water use despite their high capital costs and higher energy requirements mantovani et al 1995 the results above assumed the farmer had a risk neutral behaviour i e nil risk aversion accounting for four levels of risk aversion low moderate high very high we found that intensified returned the highest risk adjusted profit for the low and moderate risk aversion levels followed by diversified especially with surface irrigation figs 5 and 6 while all scenarios broke even in risk neutral conditions some were too risky for a more risk averse farmer in this context and diversified was the least risky overall fig 6 in comparison for example gandorfer et al 2011 reported ce or risk adjusted profit in the range from 282 78 ha year 2 2 converted from euros in a study of risk associated with tillage and nitrogen fertilisation and monjardino et al 2019 reported a maximum range from 254 486 ha year in risk adjusted profit or ce for one site in a study of yield and profit gaps the maximum cost of risk aversion varied 3 fold from 0 27 m year in simplified flood to 0 75 m year in intensified drip compared to 0 39 m year in the baseline these results confirm that given sufficient water crop diversification particularly in combination with surface irrigation could de risk the system in a profitable way at least for low to moderate attitudes to risk when water is limited simplifying the system is a risk reducing strategy quantitative evidence on approaches more likely to mitigate financial risk or boost profitability could increase the confidence of more risk averse farmers to step away from conventional practices the level of farmer risk aversion could be reflected in terms of the level of adaptation choice of infrastructure area of farm irrigated crop type and the willingness to pay for irrigation water as well as opportunistic trade of water driven by the movement in the water market farmer risk aversion is particularly relevant in the context of near absence of government subsidies for australian farm businesses about 1 4 of gross farm income in comparison to an average 18 for oecd countries and larger subsidies in countries such as norway 60 and japan 48 oecd 2017 3 3 closing the system profit gap and the opportunity cost of trading water the net value of adaptation was positive for all diversified and intensified scenarios but negative for most simplified and current scenarios fig 7 this result summarises the financial performance of each scenario relative to the baseline current flood given all bioeconomic trade offs considered in the analysis driven by cotton intensified generated the highest returns per area of irrigated farm and diversified achieved the highest return per megalitre of irrigation water fig 4 surface irrigation flood pipe riser had a relatively higher net value under most scenarios while drip outperformed in terms of return per ml of water under all scenarios except in simplified the largest net value of adaptation identified in this probabilistic analysis was just under 10 m for intensified pipe riser indicating the potential magnitude of the profit gap in this case study given high water availability and a neutral attitude to risk however a more risk averse farmer may prefer a less risky approach in closing a third of that profit gap by diversifying the system with a legume crop and flooding irrigation the relative profitability of each scenario correlated negatively with the opportunity cost of trading allocation water fig 7 given the relatively strong negative correlation r 0 89 p 0 05 between historical water price and irrigation allocation the likely opportunity cost of trading water varied from 2 for current drip and 3 for simplified drip and current pivot to 29 for intensified flood compared to 13 for the baseline in this context a positive opportunity cost means that a farmer is better off selling their allocated water whereas irrigating valuable crops is the more profitable option when the opportunity cost is negative or lower in other words simplification with costly irrigation is more likely to generate financial return from moving to less secure entitlement of note farmers can smooth out annual variation in water availability not only by trading water in the market but also through the carryover of unused water clearly the design of the systems including crop rotation crop inputs irrigated area water allocations infrastructure options bounded our results and conclusions we did explore only a small sample of the profit and risk trade offs associated with alternatives including more water efficient but energy intensive irrigation technologies in any case crop management can hardly be optimised in the real world sadras and denison 2016 the scenarios investigated here provide a benchmark for comparisons of alternative combinations of new and current agronomic practices and irrigation infrastructures sensitivity analysis is highly recommended around input costs transfer efficiencies and infrastructure costs likewise further analysis is required to explore best use of water and land and the potential role for deficit irrigation i e more land cropped less intensively with each hectare receiving less supplementary irrigation 3 4 implications for irrigation decisions for the case study farm intensifying the current irrigation system delivered the largest financial benefits over 30 years but diversification was superior in terms of risk mitigation across low to moderate farmer risk aversion while also profitable a system profit gap of up to 10 m was quantified for the irrigated farm area max 700 ha over 30 years compared to present practice if more profitable farm designs would be adopted in addition our study has confirmed that the capital cost of irrigation development is a key driver of investment performance and consistently high crop gross margins are required to offset costs at a system scale under the assumptions in our study agronomic system had greater relative influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure anova s f ratio a measure of true variance between scenarios varied between 0 15 for simplified irrespective of irrigation methods and 0 83 for current suggesting a low variance with 14 56 confidence the difference was larger for changes in agronomic system within the same irrigation infrastructure with the f ratio ranging between 16 33 for flood and 21 30 for pivot all with 100 confidence these results provide useful insights to tailor agronomy to infrastructure and vice versa they also support the trend of farmers adapting to climate adversity and variable agronomic performance by employing technology such as irrigation systems to mitigate risk and maintain or increase profitability hughes and gooday 2021 an important dimension beyond the scope of this study is the likely environmental impact of each adaptation strategy for example pressurised irrigation systems e g pivot are more energy intensive surface irrigation e g flood requires more intense vehicle and fuel usage and micro irrigation drip could increase the risk of agrochemical pollution and agricultural emissions from higher n fertiliser inputs albeit lower herbicides options to minimise leakiness are desirable both to reduce environmental damage and increase system efficiency models such as apsim can quantify these across a wide range of climates and soil types keating et al 2002 while not presented here the water balance components evaporation runoff drainage in this environment are proportional to water applied from minimal amounts in the simplified system to the extreme of the rice paddy component within the intensified system our findings build on previous system wide studies on the relative benefits of various adaptation strategies for irrigation including for the critical management of soil nitrogen dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions kodur et al 2019 maraseni et al 2021 maraseni and kodur 2019 mushtaq et al 2015 in particular gaydon et al 2012 concluded that farm level strategy mainly depends on seasonal water availability but did not account for new crops contrasting irrigation infrastructure farmer risk aversion nor historical prices for key commodities such as grains water and fertiliser in contrast while seasonal water availability was considered and provided useful insights for profitable adaptations to water constrained systems the broader implications for overall water allocations including environmental flows and water recovery programs fell outside the scope of this study a follow up study could explore how investments in on farm irrigation infrastructure impact on the supply of irrigation water exchanging entitlements for irrigation infrastructure could lead to a reduction in water entitlements and allocations to irrigators goesch et al 2020 however as suggested by goesch et al 2020 the impact of these investments on production is less than the purchase of an equivalent volume of water because they increase water use efficiency increasing the effective supply of irrigation water in addition irrigators retain some of the savings from these investments our results were strictly dependent on the modelling assumptions and simulated outcomes and hence are intrinsically less variable than the field observations for example assuming average transfer efficiencies of 70 80 90 and 100 respectively for flood pipe riser pivot and drip means the benefit of intensified with micro irrigation was likely over estimated as some losses are expected to occur in the field this is compounded by the fact that rice is commonly flood irrigated incurring field losses of 60 80 not the assumed range of 70 100 associated with the four selected irrigation methods it is worth remembering that all adaptation scenarios are assumed to rely on new investments which may not always apply if farms are already equipped with alternative infrastructure or only require partial adjustments similarly operational costs may change if other supplies such as groundwater are pumped through the system an vo et al 2015 further sensitivity analysis on the capital and operational costs of irrigation is therefore recommended altering the discount rate is expected to impact npv lower rates increase the present value of benefit and vice versa determining an appropriate discount rate remains controversial and could warrant further testing abelson and dalton 2018 in a stricter financial analysis using a modified internal rate of return mirr could more accurately reflect the relative profitability of an investment this is because it assumes that positive cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital instead of the irr itself and the initial outlays are financed at the financing cost rate suited to the business zhang 2005 assuming a long term water price mean 138 ml drawn from a 20 year distribution means the conclusions favouring intensified would not hold in a drought context such as in 2007 08 when the price of irrigation water exceeded 800 ml the same applies to the price of n fertiliser also drawn from a 30 year distribution which would have been unfavourable to intensified during n price spikes e g up to 900 t of urea at the height of the global energy crisis in the late 2000 s furthermore the impact of grain prices is significant while cotton is one of the most profitable irrigated crops in sub tropical australia roth et al 2013 high grain prices in 2008 triggered a record area of irrigated wheat in the region peake et al 2014 generally the cost of crop production and decline in the terms of trade is a growing concern for farmers for example the open water market in the riverina has favoured higher value permanent crops like almonds olives citrus and grapes but these industries are also adjusting to fast rising production costs and potential reduction in yield and quality from restricted water delivery in mid season extreme heat githui and goodwin 2019 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 8 cotton is the main driver of profitability in intensified followed by canola with wheat maize and rice performing relatively well especially under pivot and drip the higher profitability of diversified relative to baseline current was mainly attributed to the inclusion of a profitable grain legume in the rotation along with the water and n implications of rotations flowing on to the wheat and canola simplified resulted in the lowest wheat profitability although dryland canola was relatively more attractive in a water limited system due to the significant savings in irrigation costs if water security and affordability permit intensification investing in pressurised irrigation favours more flexible rotations including summer crops and provides the opportunity to irrigate more strategically across larger areas ultimately the complex trade offs between water scarcity price volatility irrigation investment environmental impacts and farmers attitude to risk influence irrigation decisions so insights from this study could inform pathways towards the closure of the irrigated profit gap more broadly knowing that saving 1 of irrigation water could be used to grow additional food and fibre worth 154 m per annum in australia csiro 2020 points to the opportunity to design agronomic and irrigation systems to increase water productivity whole farm profitability and resilience approaches that combine crop simulation economics and finance risk and uncertainty such as the one used in this analysis add value to agricultural systems research weersink and fulton 2020 while system interpretations of yield gaps have been limited to crop rotations few have scaled the concept of yield and profit gap to the whole farm given logistical and economic concerns a simplified version of the analysis described in this article was incorporated in the investment app of watercan profit www watercanprofit com au the tool is freely available to researchers extension officers and agribusinesses potential exists for similar approaches to be applied to other irrigated crop production regions of the world with similar trends of dry hydrological conditions and limited water supply driving high water prices such as california nasdaq 2020 the indo gangetic plains of india and pakistan ali et al 2016 kirby et al 2017 the nile basin in ne africa oestigaard 2012 the yaqui valley in mexico fischer et al 2022 schoups et al 2006 and the iberian peninsula in europe rodrigues et al 2021 soto garcía et al 2013 4 conclusion a framework of crop simulation and profit risk analysis was used to investigate profit risk trade offs and farmer risk aversion in contrasting agronomic and irrigation scenarios for this case study scenarios of intensification with cotton were the most profitable while crop diversification with a grain legume along with moderate inputs and surface irrigation was superior for de risking significant differences in the cost of risk aversion across scenarios confirm that attitudes to risk are likely to affect irrigation decisions and profit outcomes in riskier contexts underpinned by complex trade offs we demonstrated the potential to better understand and quantify where benefits may be greatest and where risk and uncertainty can most readily be mitigated in the face of high volatility in seasonal rainfall water allocations and commodity prices along with high capital costs of infrastructure we advance a context specific system based approach that aims to identify financially feasible irrigation systems design and decision making with

australia s open water market are significant challenges objective in this paper we advance a context specific system based approach that aims to identify financially feasible irrigation designs and decision making with the goal to increase water productivity whole farm profitability and risk management methods we use a new analytical framework that combines crop simulation discounted cash flow system profit gap probability theory and risk aversion analysis to quantify economic risk and compare 16 adaptation scenarios in an irrigated broadacre farm of the riverina region in australia the scenarios result from the factorial of four agronomic systems baseline current diversified intensified simplified and four irrigation methods including surface irrigation by gravity flood and by pumps pipe riser pressurised irrigation by overhead spray pivot and micro dosing drip results and conclusions a system profit gap of 10 m was quantified for the irrigated farm area over 30 years relative to the baseline flood irrigated wheat canola significant long term profit gains were identified for the intensified mean 273 and diversified mean 80 scenarios current and simplified scenarios were less profitable than the baseline mean 16 and 37 respectively the benefits of intensification were accrued from large gains in crop gross margins especially cotton yields that consistently offset the set up costs and additional water use diversification was superior in mitigating economic risk due to higher returns per ml of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income under the assumptions in our study agronomic system had greater relative influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure significance we demonstrated the potential to inform investment decisions from

in river flows mdba 2019a ongoing climate change bom 2020 csiro bom 2015 and the growing demand for environmental water flows mdba 2019a is limiting allocation of water for irrigation the murray darling basin which accounts for 45 60 of irrigation in australia abs 2018 kirby et al 2014 has been particularly affected adamson et al 2009 ejaz qureshi et al 2013 reeson and whitten 2015 the limited availability of water coupled with an increased water demand has led to significant spikes in water price westwood et al 2020 water scarcity challenges farmers together with the decline in terms of trade i e lower prices received for outputs relative to the rising prices for irrigation water fertilisers agrochemicals and energy these are key drivers of recent declines in farm profitability hughes et al 2019 however to a point productivity gains from farmer adaptations tend to offset the negative impacts in the long run hughes and gooday 2021 interestingly high water prices

irrigation systems and technologies culpitt 2011 khan et al 2009 mushtaq et al 2013 roth et al 2013 so far the economic benefits of irrigation in australia have been assessed with a focus on crop and water management practices in multiple crops and irrigation systems brennan mckellar et al 2013 dalton et al 2001 gaydon et al 2012 harrison et al 2017 maraseni et al 2012 peake et al 2016 phelan et al 2015 power et al 2011 comparisons between full and deficit irrigated crops based on water saving vs farm economic returns have been conducted for maize rodrigues et al 2013 and wheat darouich et al 2017 in mediterranean conditions the economics of water management has long been the focus in water scarce irrigation contexts dinar and zilberman 1991 hogan et al 2006 khan et al 2020 wild et al 2021 it is notable that comparisons of irrigation infrastructure are rare in the scientific literature brennan mckellar et al 2013 maraseni et al 2012 mushtaq et al 2013 this is despite their relevance particularly in a global operational environment of high risks significant trade offs increasing energy costs labour shortages and large capital costs ara et al 2021 for rainfed grain crops nitrogen n deficiency often accounts for an important part of the gap between the exploitable water limited yield and actual yield hochman et al 2013 2009 monjardino et al 2015 2013 sadras and roget 2004 sadras et al 2016 the yield gap attributable to insufficient applied n becomes negligible where irrigation eliminates the uncertainty in water supply christie et al 2018 grassini et al 2011 rawnsley et al 2019 this effectively translates into lower yield risks associated with irrigated systems assuming that sufficient water is available for timely irrigation the average yield gap for irrigated wheat in sub tropical australia is 1 0 2 7 t ha for non lodged and lodged fields respectively peake et al 2014 and can be attributed to factors including crop and water management peake et al 2016 roth et al 2013 the ratio commodity prices to input costs kirby et al 2014 inadequate irrigation infrastructure khan et al 2009 maraseni et al 2012 and environmental concerns and policy regulations that affect water availability mdba 2019a nwc 2009 social factors also influence profitability farmer risk aversion affects farm productivity in rainfed systems monjardino et al 2019 2015 and is likely to influence irrigation decisions and water productivity fereres et al 2014 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 because of significant price and financial risks incurred from high price volatility and costly irrigation infrastructure frameworks have been developed to expand the yield gap analysis from individual crops to the cropping system accounting for the spatial and temporal arrangement of crops guilpart et al 2017 the concept of cropping system yield gap is particularly useful in irrigated systems because investments in infrastructure and water allocation affect multiple crops in space and time and affect whole farm performance energy based yield per unit of land and time has been used as a currency to aggregate contrasting crops guilpart et al 2017 we use economic return for aggregation thereby shifting the focus from yield gap to profit gap profit gap is defined here as the change in profitability associated with the irrigation system yield gap the aims of this article are to i develop a new analytical framework that combines crop simulation discounted cash flow dcf system profit gap probability theory and risk aversion analysis underpinned by realistic longitudinal trends in commodity and water price and ii compare profit and risk trade offs of 16 farmers informed scenarios resulting from the factorial combination of four agronomic systems and four contrasting water delivery methods using a farm case study in the riverina region of the murray darling basin 2 methods 2 1 farm case study the case study farm is located near the town of finley in nsw 35 6230 s 145 5844 e in the irrigation region of the riverina in the murray darling basin of eastern australia the region has an average annual rainfall of 380 mm 225 mm in winter and 155 mm in summer making dryland cropping difficult soils are predominantly clay loam topsoil over clay and typically store less than 200 mm of water in a maximum depth of 1 5 m the average farm area is 1000 ha with 700 ha of irrigated winter crops e g canola wheat wheat in rotation with summer fallow typical of many in the region the farm holds a permanent water licence with a median entitlement of 1400 ml year taken from the murray irrigation system water entitlements remain the same in wet and dry years goesch et al 2020 whereas allocations against entitlements change according to rainfall inflows into storages and how much water is already stored mdba 2019b allocated water does not come at an extra cost to the licensed farmer because they are entitled to it a temporary trading licence allows the farmer to buy and sell allocated water at market price in addition water carryover allows the farmer to hold up to 30 of water allocation in dam storage within and between years which helps to limit the increase in allocation prices in dry years goesch et al 2020 average annual allocations 60 70 of the total water entitlement are used to flood irrigate 70 of the farmland flood irrigation is presently the preferred choice of riverina finley farmers 2 2 scenarios our analysis focuses on 16 scenarios from the combination of four agronomic systems and four irrigation methods these scenarios were selected from discussions with farmers and industry across the region to represent relevant and contrasting levels of system intensity as well as methods of water delivery a key assumption in this analysis is that all adaptation scenarios including the baseline are underpinned by a new upfront investment in irrigation infrastructure to allow for a simple and direct comparison between options this is in contrast with a farms being already equipped with alternative infrastructure or only requiring partial adjustments and b the baseline flood infrastructure investment being considered a sunk cost that is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered in other words the analysis assumes 16 possible scenarios in which a clean block of land is used for irrigation purpose and where the baseline scenario represents the current situation in terms of agronomy and irrigation for benchmarking 2 2 1 agronomic system four agronomic systems are defined in terms of crop choice allocation of irrigation water area of farm under irrigation level of inputs costs and risk 1 baseline current current system as outlined in section 2 1 further supported by farmer records and regional statistics jlacy consulting 2021 the current system with flood irrigation is the baseline note that variations of current with different irrigation methods see 2 2 2 are considered separately to the baseline 2 diversified seeking diversification of crop income i e more income derived from a variety of sources in any given year the diversified system has similar average water usage and irrigated farm area as baseline current a greater variety of winter crops grown within the year i e wheat canola and a grain legume but similar inputs and costs 3 intensified in general this is a high input high output high risk system relative to the baseline current more water per unit area and year is used for irrigation a larger portion of the farm area is irrigated i e less unirrigated fallow more crops are sown with greater water usage higher inputs per unit area and year e g n herbicides together resulting in higher cost and higher risk per unit area and year 4 simplified in general this is a low input low output low risk system relative to the baseline current this scenario uses less irrigation water per unit area and year increases frequency of rainfed crops and reduces inputs per unit area e g n herbicides resulting in lower cost and lower risk per unit area and year 2 2 2 on farm irrigation infrastructure four irrigation methods are assessed and described in table 1 agvic 2021 thinkwater 2021 a flood surface irrigation in levelled bays water applied by gravity b pipe riser surface irrigation in levelled bays water applied by pumps c pivot pressurised spray irrigation applied by an overhead irrigator that rotates around a central pivot fulcrum d drip pressurised micro irrigation typically applied through small pipes laid on the ground surface irrigation is applied over a longer duration than the other irrigation types as the delivery pipe diameters are small 2 3 simulated crop yield and irrigation water use the agricultural production systems simulator apsim v 7 10 holzworth et al 2014 was used to simulate crop yield irrigation water use n fertiliser and fallow management practises for the 1989 2018 growing seasons 30 years apsim simulation of grain yield in response to weather soil and management including water application has been widely tested in australia across crops soils and cropping systems brennan mckellar et al 2013 de voil et al 2009 gaydon et al 2012 ibrahim et al 2019 liu et al 2020 phelan et al 2018 power et al 2011 supplementary table s1 highlights key features of these studies that support low uncertainty related to model structure the model simulates a different crop rotation for each agronomic system each with four levels of transfer efficiency broadly aligned with the four irrigation infrastructure options described in table 1 all scenarios were parameterised with a combination of farm interview data weather data from silo jeffrey et al 2001 and soil data from apsoil dalgliesh et al 2012 irrigated crops were sown on fixed dates mid april for winter crops mid november for summer crops and dryland crops were sown when rainfall opportunities occur i e 25 mm over four days double cropping systems in the intensified scenario were modelled as summer paddock and winter paddock where sowing and harvesting operations may overlap by a few weeks n fertiliser was applied at sowing and for the intensified scenario 60 days after sowing each irrigation strategy depended on both crop and scenario for the pressurised irrigation scenarios pivot drip cotton was irrigated to 95 of drained upper limit and rice was managed to maintain a surface pond of water between 50 150 mm deep for the surface irrigation systems flood pipe riser the soil was filled to drained upper limit when the fractional water content fell below 0 6 summer crops in the intensified scenario were watered when the fractional content fell below 0 8 for all scenarios watering of the crop finished at 75 of the grain filling period a simple hydrothermal time model was used to estimate weed germination and consequent requirement for weed control during fallow periods we deliberately did not model annual allocation limits because the rotation specifies the water consumption via frequency and sown area and a combination of temporary water trading where a fixed amount of water can be bought or sold at a point in time and carryover transactions where unused allocation can be used in the subsequent year allowing the operator to buffer against both shortfalls and excesses of water consumption however the simulated water consumption fell within the allocated volumes broadly specified for each system section 2 4 2 2 4 assumptions 2 4 1 irrigation infrastructure farmer choices of irrigation infrastructure are complex and often context specific involving trade offs in terms of water management and efficiency annual costs capital investments and farmers preference key characteristics and costs of different irrigation infrastructure are summarised in table 1 based on a wide range of sources including farmer and consultant data and expertise electronic databases technical reports and scientific literature brennan mckellar et al 2013 culpitt 2011 dalton et al 2001 deedi 2011 hogan et al 2006 khan et al 2009 maraseni et al 2012 moore et al 2000 petheram et al 2016 2013 rmcg 2018 roth et al 2005 thinkwater 2021 thompson 2016a 2016b 2 4 2 agronomy prices and costs table 2 summarises parameters and model outputs for the 16 scenarios of agronomic system by irrigation infrastructure over 30 years while water allocation limits were not imposed on the simulations section 2 3 they influenced system design and opportunities for trading water the baseline current scenarios are assumed to irrigate 700 ha of a canola wheat wheat rotation with each winter crop followed by a summer fallow the fallow generates no income but stores water and n and imposes a cost for weed control 0 4 herbicide spray events 1 1 a simple hydro thermal time model of weed germination events was used in apsim to calculate the frequency of spraying events which have an economic but no biophysical impact during fallow periods the model assumed that weeds emerged 250 degree days after a rainfall event 4 days total 25 mm and adequate surface soil water content 50 triggered germination if there was no follow up rain germinated weed seeds stopped growing and died so no spray event was triggered no seed bank was modelled with seeds assumed to be ephemerally distributed the diversified scenarios include a canola wheat faba bean rotation each winter crop similarly followed by a summer fallow 700 ha in comparison to the baseline current the simplified scenarios are assumed to have lower water supply which can only irrigate a reduced area of wheat 50 350 ha while dryland canola grows on the original 700 ha area of the farm the intensified scenarios are assumed to have higher water supply which is used to irrigate 700 ha of winter crops canola wheat and a smaller area 25 175 ha of summer crops maize cotton rice with the remaining 75 of the area in summer fallow annual water allocations were drawn from a 20 year distribution extrapolated from broader water allocations for the region mdba 2019b westwood et al 2020 overall in line with farmer experience and depending on market forces lower water allocations in dry seasons favour simplification whereas high water allocations in wet seasons allow for greater intensification of the cropping program extra water may be carried over from the previous year and or purchased at market price to top up annual allocation and meet higher crop demand an initial drop to a low allocation high price year due to drought for example increases the likelihood of a lower than average allocation in the following year apsim simulated mean irrigation water applied varied from 1 0 ml ha year for canola current drip to 19 4 ml ha year for rice intensified flood broadly aligning with regional experience brennan mckellar et al 2013 dwyer et al 2020 gaydon et al 2012 jlacy consulting 2021 finley farmers have reported annual irrigated yields of 3 0 9 5 t ha from 1 5 4 0 ml ha year of water for wheat 2 5 4 0 t ha from 1 0 2 5 ml ha for canola 1 5 5 0 t ha from 1 0 4 0 ml ha for faba bean 7 8 22 0 t ha from 8 0 11 0 ml ha for maize 6 6 12 6 t ha from 7 5 10 5 ml ha for cotton and 5 0 15 2 t ha from 10 0 17 0 ml ha for rice applications of n fertiliser varied between 100 and 500 kg n ha year table 2 the higher water and n rates simulated in intensified fit a potential scenario with abundant water and unlimited n other variable costs shown in table 2 include the typical crop production costs detailed in section 2 5 1 along with the additional costs of shifting to cotton and rice cropping through a 40 ha year cost of hiring specific cotton harvest machinery e g cotton king baler and a 176 ha year cost of preparing the ground for rice beds e g laser levelling also included is an additional cost of 70 ha year under drip irrigation from changes in requirements in n fertilisers 100 ha year and herbicides 30 ha year table 1 the relative annual economic performance of production or benefit cost ratio was assessed with the economic water productivity ratio ewpr paredes et al 2014 which encompasses the suite of annual irrigation costs c required to achieve the annual crop benefit b or revenue based on simulated irrigated yields for each irrigation scenario i 1 ewpr bi ci where higher ewpr indicates greater benefit per unit cost fig 2 shows the disaggregated annual costs of irrigation and associated ewpr for all scenarios as a rule surface water delivery flood pipe riser requires more water labour and maintenance to run whereas pressurised irrigation pivot drip incurs the highest power and capital costs in terms of benefit cost impact ewpr varied between 1 16 simplified flood and simplified pivot and 2 07 intensified drip ewpr fluctuates with the terms of trade 2 5 discounted cash flow analysis the financial performance of all adaptations was assessed using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis across the crop rotation dcf computes the present value of cash inflows and cash outflows discounted over the time of the investment brennan mckellar et al 2013 petheram et al 2016 the following measures were used in the analysis 2 5 1 net present value the long term profitability of each scenario is summarised as the net present value npv of future cash flows or the sum of future net cash flows discounted to their present value npv is defined as 2 npv t 0 t 30 y t p v t w t n t o t 1 r t i where the sum of annual cash inflows over a period of 30 years corresponding to half a typical australian farmer s career is calculated as the revenue from crop grain yield y t in year t by grain price p and the sum of annual cash outflows includes the bundled variable costs of crop production and fallow management vt cost of irrigation water w t cost of n fertiliser n t and overhead costs of irrigation o t a real discount rate r of 5 0 is used in the analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows based on rates of return experienced for general investments in agriculture in recent years pannell and schilizzi 2008 and i is the initial investment made in year 0 see table 1 for capital costs of different infrastructure options yields for crop revenue were simulated in apsim as described in section 2 3 the farm gate price for grains table 2 temporary water mean 138 ml fig 1 and fertiliser n mean 806 per tonne of n based on urea at 46 n were drawn from frequency distributions of historical real prices 20 30 years abares 2020 indexmundi 2021 westwood et al 2020 after adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index cotton a summer crop grown for intensified scenarios generates two income streams with the seed sold for stockfeed t of fresh weight and the lint sold to the cotton gin on a bale basis using the risk software palisade corporation 2012 the price frequency distributions were fitted using probability density functions pdf of various forms and the anderson darling ad statistics test was used to measure the goodness of fit of each distribution supplementary fig s1 no significant correlation was found between grain water and n prices so the pdf with the best fit was selected for use in monte carlo simulation of annual cash inflows and selected outflows water cost and n cost for use in the npv analysis through the process of generating 1000 random iterations to sample from the probability distribution costs are an important component of irrigation investment and were drawn from a range of sources including technical literature abares www agriculture gov au abares gross margin budgets and expert opinion we assumed that all infrastructure adaptations were new investments rather than partially or completely existing and that all capital costs were incurred in the first year i e the development was not staged likewise we assumed that land was not a constraint and that differences between farm system applied instantaneously as modelled in apsim as opposed to farm system transition taking place over time the costs included in the analysis are capital costs initial investment ha related to the irrigation infrastructure including system purchase and installation earthworks pump installation electrical works storage if applicable as well as other upfront costs such as machinery for new irrigated crops motor vehicles workshops sheds attributable to irrigation interest and depreciation costs of capital are excluded from the npv analysis to avoid double counting pannell and schilizzi 2008 overhead or fixed annual costs associated with irrigation operation and maintenance ha year and include power required for pumping extra labour r m of irrigation system and vehicle running costs these costs vary between irrigation methods and are assumed constant throughout the analysis period within each scenario another fixed cost related to irrigation is the purchase or lease of water entitlements the product of water entitlement median 1400 ml year and permanent water price long term average 1292 ml which has been excluded from this analysis because a it is accounted as a farm finance cost along with lease on land other farm capital assets etc and b it is the same for all scenarios water cost of irrigation ml calculated as the product of the temporary water price mean drawn from a 20 year distribution and the volume of water purchased for irrigation annually nitrogen fertiliser cost ha year calculated as the n rate per crop by n price drawn from a 30 year distribution variable costs of production ha year are specific to each crop and include inputs other than irrigation water and n fertiliser accounted for separately such as seed inoculants soil amelioration other fertilisers herbicides fuel oil and hired labour for seeding fertilising spraying harvesting cartage r m of crop machinery crop insurance and levies the annual costs of shifting production into cotton and rice crops are included here as well variable costs are assumed unchanged throughout the analysis period within each scenario cost of fallow management ha year includes the number of herbicide applications per fallow at an assumed cost of 15 ha year per application 2 5 2 internal rate of return and payback period internal rate of return irr is the discount rate that makes the npv of all cash flows equal to zero irr is the return received by investing capital in this enterprise an enterprise is considered a good investment when the irr exceeds the discount rate payback period is the number of years required to recoup the investment funds i e to reach break even point lower payback periods are preferred 2 5 3 opportunity cost of trading allocation water in the riverina water trade allows licence holders to buy or sell water at any time while permanent trade involves the sale or lease of water entitlements the temporary trade of allocation water is seasonal mdba 2019b we consider the opportunity cost oc of trading allocation water or the potential benefit a farmer loses when using the water for irrigation over selling it mallawaarachchi et al 2020 we calculated oc as the difference between the return on the option not chosen water sale and the return or irr of the chosen option water purchased for crop irrigation the return on allocation water sale was calculated as the product of temporary water price and annual water allocated to the farm for irrigation both drawn from long term distributions along with a seasonal factor in addition a fallow was assumed to replace the crop in the water sale option incurring only a low weed control cost assumed a single spray at a cost of 15 ha 2 6 net value of adaptation and system profit gap an irrigation investment is considered viable if the present value of the benefits is greater than the present value of the costs i e npv 0 the principal economic criterion to compare irrigation scenarios is the net value of adaptation which is calculated as the difference between the npv of future cash flows of each adaptation scenario and the npv of future cash flows of the baseline using economic currency to aggregate contrasting crops and irrigation allocations we define irrigated system profit gap as the difference between the largest net value of all scenarios considered here and the baseline under consideration 2 7 risk analysis for each scenario the frequency distribution of the discounted annual cash flow was fitted based on the ad test to characterise profit volatility using risk the pdf with the best fit was used to determine risk metrics 2 7 1 downside risk and probability of break even a useful measure of downside risk is the conditional value at risk of the lowest 20 of possible outcomes cvar0 2 i e the mean of the lowest 20 of discounted cash flows or in other words the risk of extreme financial loss associated with unfavourable events in addition the probability of positive returns p π 0 is used to measure the likelihood of breaking even over the 30 year period of the analysis and the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean provides a measure of dispersion of a probability distribution discounted cash flows the cvar0 2 p π 0 and cv capture long term yield price and financial risk underpinning the irrigation investment across the whole irrigation system 2 7 2 farmer risk aversion we use a risk premium rp year the minimum amount of money one is willing to pay to eliminate risk exposure to calculate risk adjusted profit or certainty equivalent ce π rp year difalco et al 2007 risk premium captures the cost of risk measured through mean variance and skewness of profit distributions and can be approximated as 3 rp 0 5 r π v where r is a coefficient of relative risk aversion described below π year is the mean net profit based on discounted annual cash flows and v year is the variance of the mean net profit for each adaptation scenario the risk attitude range of farmers is typically measured by a unitless risk aversion coefficient measuring either absolute or relative risk aversion based on the magnitude and spread of the distribution of net returns hardaker et al 2015 a scale of 0 4 was used for r in this study assuming 0 no risk aversion i e risk neutral decision maker 1 low risk aversion 2 moderate risk aversion 3 high risk aversion 4 very high risk aversion gandorfer et al 2011 the analysis was run for each of these r to capture the full spectrum of attitudes to risk a risk adjusted profit value was calculated for each of the five levels of risk aversion the difference between risk neutral profit r 0 and risk adjusted profit at the maximum level of risk aversion r 4 is the maximum cost of risk aversion 2 8 statistical analysis additional statistical tests were performed on the 16 factorial scenarios to assess the influence of agronomy infrastructure and their interaction on financial outputs using anova two factor with replication data were analysed for all scenarios with focus on i varying the agronomy system for each infrastructure option and ii varying irrigation infrastructure within each agronomy system discounted annual cash flow outputs over 30 years were used as replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 profitability of the irrigated system profitability was highest for intensified table 3 fig 3 diversified was generally more profitable than baseline current while simplified proved less attractive especially under pressurised irrigation pivot drip surface irrigation mainly pipe riser was relatively more profitable in most agronomic systems note that the downward trend in discounted annual cash flows relates to the discount rate which is used to allow valid comparisons of benefits and costs that occur at different times fig 3 the higher the rate the lower the present value of future cash flows all scenarios generated a positive npv indicating a relatively profitable investment however the magnitude of the benefit varied widely from 1 7 m simplified drip to 12 9 m intensified pipe riser compared with 3 4 m for the baseline current flood annualised benefits per hectare of irrigated farm and per megalitre of irrigation water varied between 105 ha for current pivot and 26 ml for intensified flood and 491 ha for intensified pipe riser and 160 ml for diversified drip table 3 fig 4 annualised equivalent benefit per unit area strongly aligned with the annualised equivalent benefit and per unit water except for intensified fig 4 suggesting that intensification would be more suited to farmers targeting area based rather than water based returns taking infrastructure investment into account the irr was lowest for current pivot 4 9 return on investment and 14 4 years to pay it back whereas intensified flood had the highest irr 26 8 and the lowest payback period 3 1 years this result indicates that lower input lower output systems would not justify high cost investments regarding the relative effect of key inputs on the npv output mean water price always ranked first followed by grain prices and n price in all current diversified and simplified scenarios in intensified water price had the largest effect followed by a mix of grain and n prices the price of n fertilizer had a relatively higher effect in most drip scenarios tornado graphs for inputs ranked by effect on output mean for the 16 scenarios are shown in supplementary fig s2 overall the benefits of intensified were accrued from large gains in crop gross margins especially per irrigated area which consistently offset the mounting costs including additional water use while diversified was superior in mitigating risk across the system due to higher return per ml of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income lower cv higher cvar0 2 and p π 0 table 3 the de risking role of diversification with moderate input use was highlighted in lower rainfall years such as 1992 and 2004 where restricted irrigation water impacted crop yields and system profitability fig 3 this was also evident in the higher benefit per ml of water in diversified drip compared for example to intensified drip table 3 and fig 4 3 2 mitigating risk and uncertainty relative to the baseline current flood diversified scenarios with surface and pivot irrigation and all simplified scenarios reduced downside risk quantified with cvar0 2 the less costly albeit less efficient flood and pipe riser irrigation methods were the least risky in all scenarios over 30 years compared to the baseline cvar0 2 was reduced for diversified scenarios from 1 diversified pivot to 19 diversified flood but not with drip 12 the probability of break even p π 0 varied between 71 current pivot and 81 diversified pipe riser compared with 73 in the baseline the cv of annual discounted cash flows changed from 2 30 in the baseline to a low of 1 10 in diversified flood and a high of 2 60 in current pivot indicating a reduced risk or increased resilience in the former and an increased risk in the latter scenario table 3 fig 5 our results partially support the proposition that when water supply is limited pressurised irrigation should be favoured for efficient water use despite their high capital costs and higher energy requirements mantovani et al 1995 the results above assumed the farmer had a risk neutral behaviour i e nil risk aversion accounting for four levels of risk aversion low moderate high very high we found that intensified returned the highest risk adjusted profit for the low and moderate risk aversion levels followed by diversified especially with surface irrigation figs 5 and 6 while all scenarios broke even in risk neutral conditions some were too risky for a more risk averse farmer in this context and diversified was the least risky overall fig 6 in comparison for example gandorfer et al 2011 reported ce or risk adjusted profit in the range from 282 78 ha year 2 2 converted from euros in a study of risk associated with tillage and nitrogen fertilisation and monjardino et al 2019 reported a maximum range from 254 486 ha year in risk adjusted profit or ce for one site in a study of yield and profit gaps the maximum cost of risk aversion varied 3 fold from 0 27 m year in simplified flood to 0 75 m year in intensified drip compared to 0 39 m year in the baseline these results confirm that given sufficient water crop diversification particularly in combination with surface irrigation could de risk the system in a profitable way at least for low to moderate attitudes to risk when water is limited simplifying the system is a risk reducing strategy quantitative evidence on approaches more likely to mitigate financial risk or boost profitability could increase the confidence of more risk averse farmers to step away from conventional practices the level of farmer risk aversion could be reflected in terms of the level of adaptation choice of infrastructure area of farm irrigated crop type and the willingness to pay for irrigation water as well as opportunistic trade of water driven by the movement in the water market farmer risk aversion is particularly relevant in the context of near absence of government subsidies for australian farm businesses about 1 4 of gross farm income in comparison to an average 18 for oecd countries and larger subsidies in countries such as norway 60 and japan 48 oecd 2017 3 3 closing the system profit gap and the opportunity cost of trading water the net value of adaptation was positive for all diversified and intensified scenarios but negative for most simplified and current scenarios fig 7 this result summarises the financial performance of each scenario relative to the baseline current flood given all bioeconomic trade offs considered in the analysis driven by cotton intensified generated the highest returns per area of irrigated farm and diversified achieved the highest return per megalitre of irrigation water fig 4 surface irrigation flood pipe riser had a relatively higher net value under most scenarios while drip outperformed in terms of return per ml of water under all scenarios except in simplified the largest net value of adaptation identified in this probabilistic analysis was just under 10 m for intensified pipe riser indicating the potential magnitude of the profit gap in this case study given high water availability and a neutral attitude to risk however a more risk averse farmer may prefer a less risky approach in closing a third of that profit gap by diversifying the system with a legume crop and flooding irrigation the relative profitability of each scenario correlated negatively with the opportunity cost of trading allocation water fig 7 given the relatively strong negative correlation r 0 89 p 0 05 between historical water price and irrigation allocation the likely opportunity cost of trading water varied from 2 for current drip and 3 for simplified drip and current pivot to 29 for intensified flood compared to 13 for the baseline in this context a positive opportunity cost means that a farmer is better off selling their allocated water whereas irrigating valuable crops is the more profitable option when the opportunity cost is negative or lower in other words simplification with costly irrigation is more likely to generate financial return from moving to less secure entitlement of note farmers can smooth out annual variation in water availability not only by trading water in the market but also through the carryover of unused water clearly the design of the systems including crop rotation crop inputs irrigated area water allocations infrastructure options bounded our results and conclusions we did explore only a small sample of the profit and risk trade offs associated with alternatives including more water efficient but energy intensive irrigation technologies in any case crop management can hardly be optimised in the real world sadras and denison 2016 the scenarios investigated here provide a benchmark for comparisons of alternative combinations of new and current agronomic practices and irrigation infrastructures sensitivity analysis is highly recommended around input costs transfer efficiencies and infrastructure costs likewise further analysis is required to explore best use of water and land and the potential role for deficit irrigation i e more land cropped less intensively with each hectare receiving less supplementary irrigation 3 4 implications for irrigation decisions for the case study farm intensifying the current irrigation system delivered the largest financial benefits over 30 years but diversification was superior in terms of risk mitigation across low to moderate farmer risk aversion while also profitable a system profit gap of up to 10 m was quantified for the irrigated farm area max 700 ha over 30 years compared to present practice if more profitable farm designs would be adopted in addition our study has confirmed that the capital cost of irrigation development is a key driver of investment performance and consistently high crop gross margins are required to offset costs at a system scale under the assumptions in our study agronomic system had greater relative influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure anova s f ratio a measure of true variance between scenarios varied between 0 15 for simplified irrespective of irrigation methods and 0 83 for current suggesting a low variance with 14 56 confidence the difference was larger for changes in agronomic system within the same irrigation infrastructure with the f ratio ranging between 16 33 for flood and 21 30 for pivot all with 100 confidence these results provide useful insights to tailor agronomy to infrastructure and vice versa they also support the trend of farmers adapting to climate adversity and variable agronomic performance by employing technology such as irrigation systems to mitigate risk and maintain or increase profitability hughes and gooday 2021 an important dimension beyond the scope of this study is the likely environmental impact of each adaptation strategy for example pressurised irrigation systems e g pivot are more energy intensive surface irrigation e g flood requires more intense vehicle and fuel usage and micro irrigation drip could increase the risk of agrochemical pollution and agricultural emissions from higher n fertiliser inputs albeit lower herbicides options to minimise leakiness are desirable both to reduce environmental damage and increase system efficiency models such as apsim can quantify these across a wide range of climates and soil types keating et al 2002 while not presented here the water balance components evaporation runoff drainage in this environment are proportional to water applied from minimal amounts in the simplified system to the extreme of the rice paddy component within the intensified system our findings build on previous system wide studies on the relative benefits of various adaptation strategies for irrigation including for the critical management of soil nitrogen dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions kodur et al 2019 maraseni et al 2021 maraseni and kodur 2019 mushtaq et al 2015 in particular gaydon et al 2012 concluded that farm level strategy mainly depends on seasonal water availability but did not account for new crops contrasting irrigation infrastructure farmer risk aversion nor historical prices for key commodities such as grains water and fertiliser in contrast while seasonal water availability was considered and provided useful insights for profitable adaptations to water constrained systems the broader implications for overall water allocations including environmental flows and water recovery programs fell outside the scope of this study a follow up study could explore how investments in on farm irrigation infrastructure impact on the supply of irrigation water exchanging entitlements for irrigation infrastructure could lead to a reduction in water entitlements and allocations to irrigators goesch et al 2020 however as suggested by goesch et al 2020 the impact of these investments on production is less than the purchase of an equivalent volume of water because they increase water use efficiency increasing the effective supply of irrigation water in addition irrigators retain some of the savings from these investments our results were strictly dependent on the modelling assumptions and simulated outcomes and hence are intrinsically less variable than the field observations for example assuming average transfer efficiencies of 70 80 90 and 100 respectively for flood pipe riser pivot and drip means the benefit of intensified with micro irrigation was likely over estimated as some losses are expected to occur in the field this is compounded by the fact that rice is commonly flood irrigated incurring field losses of 60 80 not the assumed range of 70 100 associated with the four selected irrigation methods it is worth remembering that all adaptation scenarios are assumed to rely on new investments which may not always apply if farms are already equipped with alternative infrastructure or only require partial adjustments similarly operational costs may change if other supplies such as groundwater are pumped through the system an vo et al 2015 further sensitivity analysis on the capital and operational costs of irrigation is therefore recommended altering the discount rate is expected to impact npv lower rates increase the present value of benefit and vice versa determining an appropriate discount rate remains controversial and could warrant further testing abelson and dalton 2018 in a stricter financial analysis using a modified internal rate of return mirr could more accurately reflect the relative profitability of an investment this is because it assumes that positive cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital instead of the irr itself and the initial outlays are financed at the financing cost rate suited to the business zhang 2005 assuming a long term water price mean 138 ml drawn from a 20 year distribution means the conclusions favouring intensified would not hold in a drought context such as in 2007 08 when the price of irrigation water exceeded 800 ml the same applies to the price of n fertiliser also drawn from a 30 year distribution which would have been unfavourable to intensified during n price spikes e g up to 900 t of urea at the height of the global energy crisis in the late 2000 s furthermore the impact of grain prices is significant while cotton is one of the most profitable irrigated crops in sub tropical australia roth et al 2013 high grain prices in 2008 triggered a record area of irrigated wheat in the region peake et al 2014 generally the cost of crop production and decline in the terms of trade is a growing concern for farmers for example the open water market in the riverina has favoured higher value permanent crops like almonds olives citrus and grapes but these industries are also adjusting to fast rising production costs and potential reduction in yield and quality from restricted water delivery in mid season extreme heat githui and goodwin 2019 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 8 cotton is the main driver of profitability in intensified followed by canola with wheat maize and rice performing relatively well especially under pivot and drip the higher profitability of diversified relative to baseline current was mainly attributed to the inclusion of a profitable grain legume in the rotation along with the water and n implications of rotations flowing on to the wheat and canola simplified resulted in the lowest wheat profitability although dryland canola was relatively more attractive in a water limited system due to the significant savings in irrigation costs if water security and affordability permit intensification investing in pressurised irrigation favours more flexible rotations including summer crops and provides the opportunity to irrigate more strategically across larger areas ultimately the complex trade offs between water scarcity price volatility irrigation investment environmental impacts and farmers attitude to risk influence irrigation decisions so insights from this study could inform pathways towards the closure of the irrigated profit gap more broadly knowing that saving 1 of irrigation water could be used to grow additional food and fibre

that combine crop simulation economics and finance risk and uncertainty such as the one used in this analysis add value to agricultural systems research weersink and fulton 2020 while system interpretations of yield gaps have been limited to crop rotations few have scaled the concept of yield and profit gap to the whole farm given logistical and economic concerns a simplified version of the analysis described in this article was incorporated in the investment app of watercan profit www watercanprofit com au the tool is freely available to researchers extension officers and agribusinesses potential exists for similar approaches to be applied to other irrigated crop production regions of the world with similar trends of dry hydrological conditions and limited water supply driving high water prices such as california nasdaq 2020 the indo gangetic plains of india and pakistan ali et al 2016 kirby et al 2017 the nile basin in ne africa oestigaard 2012 the yaqui valley in mexico fischer et al 2022 schoups et al 2006 and the iberian peninsula in europe rodrigues et al 2021 soto garcía et al 2013 4 conclusion a framework of crop simulation and profit risk analysis was used to investigate profit risk trade offs and farmer risk aversion in contrasting agronomic and irrigation scenarios for this case study scenarios of intensification with cotton were the most profitable while crop diversification with a grain legume along with moderate inputs and surface irrigation was superior for de risking significant differences in the cost of risk aversion across scenarios confirm that attitudes to risk are likely to affect irrigation decisions and profit outcomes in riskier contexts underpinned by complex trade offs we demonstrated the potential to better understand and quantify where benefits may be greatest and where risk and uncertainty can most readily be mitigated in the face of high volatility in seasonal rainfall water allocations and commodity prices along with high capital costs of infrastructure we advance a context specific system based approach that aims to identify financially feasible irrigation systems design and decision making with

9504,on farm measures can be used in multi barrier schemes to manage microbial risks from consumption of wastewater irrigated vegetables especially where informality of the practice determines minimal external support for farmers evidence indicates that cessation of irrigation greatly reduces microbial contamination on leafy vegetables but at the expense of produce quality replacing wastewater with higher quality irrigation water during the last days of cultivation is an alternative to cessation of irrigation that does not compromise produce quality this study evaluated the effect of wastewater substitution under on farm conditions on different indicators of microbial contamination of lettuce lettuce was cultivated in experimental plots and irrigated with three water sources spring water water from a wastewater polluted river and effluent from a primary wastewater treatment plant but with the river water replaced by spring water in half the plots about two weeks before harvest the experiment was repeated four times in different seasons irrigation water samples collected during cultivation and lettuce samples collected at harvest were analysed for helminth eggs escherichia coli and coliphages variables characterizing the irrigation practices and environmental conditions were recorded there were no significant differences in helminth egg or e coli concentrations on lettuce medians ranged from 0 7 to 0 1 log10 eggs g 1 and 0 6 1 4 log10 cfu g 1 respectively between any of the treatments involving wastewater irrigation no statistical analysis was possible for coliphages because concentrations on lettuce were mostly at or below the detection limit 94 of samples variables associated with temperature and soil explained helminth egg and e coli concentrations on lettuce while number of days of irrigation with spring water representing wastewater substitution was significant only for e coli it was concluded that the experimental conditions were suboptimal for successful implementation of wastewater substitution for on farm microbial risk management but key variables for successful implementation were identified keywords pathogens nutrient recycling farm based measures irrigation scheduling health ecotechnology 1 introduction reusing wastewater for crop irrigation is an effective way to recirculate plant nutrients and water thereby contributing to achievement of a circular economy chojnacka et al 2020 mahjoub et al 2018 however using wastewater for irrigation poses risks to human health by introducing pathogens into agricultural production systems these risks are higher in low and middle income countries where coverage by wastewater treatment services is generally low qadir et al 2010 existing treatment plants commonly face sustainability problems that hamper their performance cossio et al 2019 and irrigation with wastewater is mostly informal scott et al 2009 i e unplanned unregulated and with minimal external support for farmers huibers et al 2009 the risks posed by wastewater irrigation to human health and the environment derive from variety of pollutants wwap 2017 but pathogens are the major concern in low and low middle income countries prüss ustün et al 2019 in order to address the risks from pathogens a multi barrier approach in which different measures act as barriers along the farm to fork pathway has been proposed to complement and even replace treatment plants who 2006 some examples of such barriers are rinsing the produce with clean water right after harvest and disinfecting the vegetables before consumption there are various measures available at farm level to reduce microbial contamination of produce e g allowing irrigation water to settle and modifying irrigation technique and regime keraita et al 2014 in informal contexts where farmers lack external support and wastewater treatment is not necessarily a feasible alternative on farm measures are among the few realistic alternatives to manage microbial risks posed by wastewater irrigation keraita et al 2010 one suggested on farm measure is cessation of irrigation several days prior to harvest to allow time for natural pathogen die off on the crop qadir et al 2010 the actual level of die off will depend on environmental factors such as temperature humidity and exposure to sunlight sánchez and bosch 2016 according to the who 2006 die off of bacteria and viruses on crop surfaces is 0 5 log10 day 1 in cool wet weather and reduced exposure to direct sunlight and 2 log10 d 1 in hot dry weather based on this cessation of irrigation is considered a reliable barrier keraita et al 2010 however many field studies have shown much higher variability and complexity in die off rates than estimated by the who 2006 e g reduction rates from 2 log10 within 2 h to 1 7 log10 in 7 days have been reported for the pathogenic bacterium e coli o157 h7 on leafy crops gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2012 moyne et al 2020 other studies have found that bacterial die off on vegetables can be biphasic i e two decay rates instead of only one due to the existence of persistent subpopulations of bacteria that can decay as slowly as 0 01 log10 day 1 belias et al 2020 after several hours or days following an initial rapid decay of the less persistent subpopulation seidu et al 2013 studies by belias et al 2020 and chase et al 2019 2017 even found periods of e coli growth on vegetable crop surfaces as regards variability similar findings have been made for enteric viruses for example li and uyttendaele 2018 found a reduction of 5 5 log10 in 3 days for murine norovirus mnv 1 on basil leaves while an earlier study found rates of 0 01 and 0 12 log10 d 1 for human adenovirus hav on cantaloupe and lettuce respectively stine et al 2005 a biphasic decay rate has also been reported for the bacteriophage virus bacteroides fragilis on lettuce petterson et al 2001 the unexpected variability and complexity in literature findings suggested that the dynamics of microbe die off on vegetables under field conditions are insufficiently well understood some studies examining multiple factors have been conducted to better understand the dynamics of bacterial die off belias et al 2020 castro ibáñez et al 2015 park et al 2015 those studies identified some key explanatory factors e g bacterial species crop species relative ambient humidity temperature and precipitation but the findings appeared to be specific to the context of the study for example relative humidity was found to affect the survival of e coli in the study by belias et al 2020 while it did not show any apparent effect in the study by castro ibáñez et al 2015 therefore there is a continuing need for multi factor studies of microbe die off dynamics under different field conditions multi factor studies are also needed on other pathogens that are present in wastewater and persist longer than bacteria in the environment such as viruses and helminths aw 2018 for instance the bacteria salmonella spp can survive for up to 70 days in soil and 30 days on crops while enteroviruses survive 30 days longer in both surfaces and the eggs of the helminth ascaris lumbricoides survive many months in soil and up to 60 days on crops ilic et al 2009 investigating die off of multiple types of pathogens is of critical importance in relation to cessation of irrigation as part of the multi barrier approach as differences in their persistence can determine the need for additional measures thus more information about die off of different types of foodborne pathogens under field conditions is necessary a major challenge with cessation of irrigation is its effect on the physical quality and yield of vegetable crops which has been found to reduce acceptance of the measure among farmers amoah et al 2011 mayilla et al 2016 replacing wastewater with higher quality irrigation water instead of ceasing irrigation could be a viable option to extend the die off period without affecting produce quality while alternative higher quality water sources are most likely unavailable in regions where wastewater irrigation is performed it is possible to envision a system in which higher quality effluent from the same wastewater treatment source is produced and used for irrigation in such a system wastewater would be used for bulk irrigation during the initial stages of crop growth while at the same time small wastewater volumes would be diverted to on farm water treatment units and then stored various on farm treatments such as on farm ponds keraita et al 2014 and filtration systems kaetzl et al 2019 perez mercado et al 2019 have been shown to reduce the concentrations of pathogens in wastewater while these treatments cannot handle the large flows needed for irrigation they can probably efficiently treat smaller flows perez mercado et al 2019 such as untreated wastewater volumes diverted during bulk irrigation the treated wastewater would be accumulated on farm until two weeks prior to harvest and used then as the sole source for crop irrigation replacing untreated wastewater before harvest and thus extending the pathogen die off period to our knowledge no previous study has examined extended die off following irrigation water substitution the aim of this study was therefore to test the core mechanism of the envisioned extended die off system this was done by assessing the impact of replacing wastewater with a higher quality water source on the microbial hygiene status of wastewater irrigated lettuce in field conditions using cochabamba bolivia as an example of a semi arid agricultural region where informal wastewater irrigation is practiced lettuce was chosen because it is the crop for raw consumption with the largest area 2 800 ha in 2018 harvested in bolivia iniaf et al 2019 and it has been found to be the main crop in several production systems that use wastewater for irrigation perez mercado et al 2018 specific objectives were to i assess the concentration of viral bacterial and pathogenic helminth indicators on lettuce samples in plots where wastewater was replaced with a cleaner irrigation water source for two weeks before harvesting and ii analyse the combined effects of water quality irrigation regime and environmental factors on microbial contamination of lettuce 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up the effect of wastewater substitution in experimental field lettuce plots supplied by furrow irrigation was investigated by determining the concentrations of viral bacterial and helminth indicators fig 1 in total six treatments were evaluated during four different crop cycles in different seasons four treatments were defined based on combining two factors i frequency of irrigation events throughout the crop cycle and ii replacement of a wastewater polluted river water as the source for irrigation two irrigation frequencies 3 and 2 irrigations per week representing intervals of 2 3 and 3 5 days respectively throughout the cycle were defined based on previous work showing these to be common practice in lettuce cultivation in the study region perez mercado et al 2018 for substitution of the wastewater polluted source two alternatives were assessed a no substitution i e irrigating with wastewater polluted river water for the entire crop cycle and b substitution with cleaner water from a nearby spring during the last two weeks before harvest the spring water had lower levels of pathogens see table s2 in supplementary material and was used as a proxy for wastewater treatment on farm combining the two irrigation frequencies with the two substitution alternatives resulted in four treatments three irrigations per week only with wastewater polluted source river 3 week two irrigations per week only with wastewater polluted river water river 2 week three irrigations per week with substitution of wastewater polluted water riv spring 3 week and two irrigations per week with substitution of wastewater polluted source riv spring 2 week two control treatments were also included irrigation with spring water three times per week spring 3 week representing a best case scenario and irrigation with effluent from primary treatment upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor at a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp three times per week wwtp 3 week representing a worst case scenario 2 2 lettuce plots and irrigation system the experiment was conducted at san pedro magisterio treatment plant sacaba municipality cochabamba bolivia a semi arid region with mean annual temperature 16 18 c mean relative ambient humidity 45 and mean annual rainfall 400 500 mm of which less than 40 mm falls between april and september gossweiler et al 2019 salini calderón and medina mitma 2017 the soil at the site was found to transition from sandy clay loam texture at the north side of the field to sandy loam at the south side with moderately alkaline ph 7 9 8 1 6 7 ds m 1 salinity 1 2 2 6 of total organic matter and bulk density 1 4 1 5 g cm 3 see table s1 in supplementary material the soil had not been used for agricultural production for at least seven years prior to the experiment but had occasionally received raw wastewater diverted from the nearby wwtp during intense rainfall events and maintenance tasks in order to account for the effect of differences in soil texture shade from nearby trees and slope north side the field site was divided into three blocks of 15 m x 5 m each separated by a 0 7 m wide footpath to avoid cross contamination fig 1a each block was divided into six plots 2 5 m wide x 4 m long and the experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with which each of the six treatments randomly assigned to a plot within each block seven ridges measuring 0 35 m width including their respective furrow and 4 5 m long were created in each plot the first ridge in each plot was considered the plot edge and was therefore not planted and the adjacent furrows were not irrigated figure1b all six remaining ridges were planted with lettuce but only the four central ridges were used for soil and lettuce sampling the distance between lettuce plants along the ridges was 15 cm all treatments see fig 1a were applied to the same plots during four crop cycles of lettuce lactuca sativa var crispa agricultural practices were kept the same for all plots during the four crop cycles cycles one and two were in spring 2016 september december and cycles three and four were in autumn winter 2017 april august lasting 47 50 42 45 60 61 and 53 55 days respectively the agricultural routines followed were as prescribed by an experienced lettuce farmer who decided the dates for applying fertilisers and pest control and the irrigation times and amounts i e the water volume for each irrigation event the harvest dates in each cycle were also defined in agreement with that farmer but harvesting was carried out on different days for each block due to some constraints in laboratory capacity see full dataset in table s3 in supplementary material following the experienced farmer s instructions in the first and third crop cycles dried cow manure was applied at 15 ton ha 1 one week before lettuce transplanting one week after transplanting in all four cycles a complete foliar fertiliser npk was applied to the soil at 0 5 ton ha 1 i e 0 1 0 1 and 0 03 ton ha 1 for n p2o5 and k20 respectively and the plantlets were sprayed with an insecticide fungicide solution diluted in tap water at the dosage recommended on the product label one month after transplanting urea was added in pellet form to the soil at a rate of 30 kg ha 1 and the plants were given a second spraying with the insecticide fungicide solution the irrigation method used was furrow irrigation and the water was transported by means of a water pump and assembled pvc pipelines irrigation was always performed between 08 00 and 11 00 h or 16 00 18 00 h when irrigation from different water sources had to be performed on the same day the sequence started with spring water followed by river water and finally primary effluent i e from cleanest to dirtiest as the same pipes were used for all water sources the duration and therefore the volume of irrigation for every event and plot was defined by the experienced farmer the amount of irrigation water was measured on two occasions each during the first and third cycles and on three occasions during the second cycle using the volumetric method no measurements were performed during the fourth cycle irrigation runoff seldom occurred and therefore was considered negligible during the first weeks after transplanting each plot was irrigated with its corresponding water source four plots with river water one plot with spring water and one plot with primary effluent all randomly assigned per block about two weeks 11 15 days before harvest estimated by the experienced farmer based on crop development the river water was replaced by spring water in two plots per block 2 3 irrigation water sources 2 3 1 river water due to unplanned urban expansion in sacaba municipality the nearby river rocha receives wastewater discharges from many sewage systems with no or poor treatment along the valley gossweiler et al 2019 as a result the river is heavily polluted with domestic wastewater and it is believed that its flow mostly comprises wastewater in the driest months huibers et al 2009 despite being heavily polluted the river is still a major source of irrigation water in surrounding periurban and rural zones in cochabamba verbyla et al 2016 especially during the dry season march november perez mercado et al 2018 the river was located around 45 m of the experimental plots to where river water was pumped 2 3 2 effluent from primary wastewater treatment the san pedro magisterio wwtp receives wastewater from 235 households the incoming wastewater undergoes a preliminary treatment comprised of screening and a rectangular grit chamber the effluent then passes through a uasb reactor and finally to a horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetland the effluent water used for irrigation of the experimental plots was pumped from the inspection chamber located between the uasb reactor and the wetland this source represented a worst case scenario in which farmers irrigated their vegetables with undiluted settled wastewater 2 3 3 spring water the spring water source was located approximately 25 m away from the experimental plots the emerging water flowed to a dug pond of 30 m3 and the overflow was conducted to the river the water used for irrigation of experimental plots was pumped from the dug pond no information was available about the source of the spring water but a slow reduction in water flow was observed during the experimental year which suggests that the water may infiltrate into the soil in the high part of the basin during the rainy season 2 4 analysis of water samples 2 4 1 sampling samples from the three water sources were collected between 08 00 and 11 00 h on 2 3 occasions during each crop cycle at 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation for the first crop cycle and at 2 4 and 5 weeks for the second to fourth crop cycles see table s2 in supplementary material in brief 400 ml from each water source were collected in sterile plastic bottles and transported on ice to the laboratory for analysis of escherichia coli and coliphages in addition 10 l of each water type were collected for helminth egg analysis at the laboratory all samples were stored at 4 c the samples used for e coli and coliphages analysis were processed within 2 4 h after collection while those for helminth egg analysis were processed within 1 4 weeks a total of 33 water samples were collected during the four crop cycles 2 4 2 processing the 400 ml water samples were analysed according to method epa 1603 u s epa 2014 and modified epa 1602 u s epa 2001 for e coli and coliphages respectively for determination of e coli 100 ml of water sample were filtered through a membrane onto modified mtec agar medium and then incubated at 44 c for 24 h red magenta colonies were counted at the end of the period for determination of coliphages log phase host bacteria e coli c3000 atcc 15597 which is susceptible to somatic and f specific coliphages and 100 ml of double strength molten tryptic soy agar were added to 100 ml of water sample and the mixture was poured into five petri plates after 16 20 h of incubation at 36 c circular lysis zones were enumerated helminth eggs were extracted following the procedure described in the mexican norm nmx aa 113 scfi 2012 2012 in brief the 10 l samples of the different irrigation waters were allowed to sediment sieved at 150 170 µm re suspended and centrifuged at 400 rpm for 5 min the sediment was collected and immersed in magnesium sulphate any material floating was collected and centrifuged and the pellet was immersed in ether ethyl 0 1 n sulphuric acid solution 35 65 v v subsamples of the resulting concentrated material were placed in neubauer improved counting chambers with immersion oil and enumerated by microscopy at 100x magnification 2 5 analysis of soil and manure samples 2 5 1 sampling soils from the experimental plots were sampled at transplanting i e right before transplantation in each crop cycle each plot was sampled by collecting soil from the top 7 cm at six points located at the intersections of a grid formed by the third and sixth ridges widthways and three transverse lines at 1 2 and 3 m along both ridges the six samples per plot were then mixed to give one composite sample of about 1 5 kg manure samples for analysis were collected from three points on the manure pile one week before manure was added to soil in the first crop cycle see section 2 2 the manure samples and composite soil samples were placed in plastic bags and transported to the laboratory where they were analysed on the same day for e coli and coliphages and then stored at 4 c until helminth analysis in total three manure samples and 72 soil samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 4 transplantations were collected during the four crop cycles 2 5 2 processing the same analytical methods as used for the water samples were applied to the soil and manure samples but modified to suit solid samples according to the procedure described by verbyla et al 2016 for e coli and coliphages and complemented with the tulane method for helminth eggs bowman et al 2003 for analysis of e coli and coliphages 25 g of soil sample were added to 225 ml sterile water and shaken vigorously for 1 m and the mixture was then processed as described for water samples see section 2 4 2 for extraction of helminth eggs 20 g of soil were immersed and homogenised in 200 ml of sterile water and blended the mixture was diluted to 900 ml with 1 aqueous solution of 7x limbro v v and allowed to settle overnight after which the sediment was collected re suspended with 300 ml of sterile water and blended again the homogenised mixture was then passed through a 50 mesh sieve diluted to 900 ml with 7x and allowed to settle for 2 h the sediment was collected and centrifuged the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was immersed in magnesium sulphate after that the same procedure as for water samples was followed section 2 4 2 2 6 analysis of lettuce samples 2 6 1 sampling a composite lettuce sample was collected from each plot at harvest in each crop cycle to obtain a representative sample four plants were randomly selected from the four central ridges of each plot see section 2 2 outer leaves whose appearance would make selling of the lettuce difficult were discarded following the experienced farmer s instructions using an aseptic technique six leaves from each selected plant were cut from the stem and placed in a plastic bag to give one composite sample of 24 leaves 6 leaves x 4 selected plants the composite samples were transported to the laboratory where they were analysed on the same day for e coli and coliphages and stored at 4 c until helminth analysis storage time varied between 1 and 7 weeks helminth eggs were analysed only for the first two crop cycles therefore 36 composite samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 2 harvests were collected and analysed for helminth eggs while 72 composite samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 4 harvests were analysed for e coli and coliphages 2 6 2 processing the lettuce leaf samples were processed following the same procedure used for soil samples see section 2 5 2 2 7 statistical analysis the concentrations of the different indicator microbes on lettuce samples cultivated in the six treatments see section 2 1 were tested for significant differences α 0 05 using one way analysis of variance anova in randomised blocks after verifying normality in the model residuals and homoscedasticity by means of shapiro wilk and bartlett tests respectively when anova indicated a significant difference tukey post hoc tests were performed to compare the means of the six treatments α 0 05 concentrations below the detection limit were replaced with a value between zero and the detection limit in the statistical analysis section 3 1 following common practice wood et al 2011 principal component analysis pca was used to analyse the influence of irrigation practices irrigation frequency and time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest and environmental factors concentrations of microbial indicators in soil at transplantation number of days until harvest and block on the concentrations of each of the indicator microorganisms on lettuce leaves the analysis was based on the relationships between microbial concentrations on lettuce and the target variables when the two principal components pc with the highest proportions of explained variance were plotted it should be noted that the time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest substitution days included the treatments where no water substitution was performed for instance since wastewater polluted river water was not used for irrigation in the control treatment with spring water section 2 1 the value for substitution days was the number of days from transplantation until harvest for the treatment where wastewater polluted river water was the sole irrigation source the value for substitution days was the number of days between the last irrigation event and harvest the analysis of graphical relationships in pca plots was complemented with multiple linear regressions between microbial concentrations on lettuce as response variable and the remaining variables as predictors statistical analyses and graphical plotting were carried out with r software r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria input data for the statistical analysis and the r code applied are shown in table s3 sections s5 s6 and s7 in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of indicator microorganisms on lettuce the proportion of lettuce samples with microbial concentrations below the detection limit was different for each indicator microorganism helminth eggs and e coli were detected in 56 and 93 of samples respectively values below the detection limit were replaced with 0 7 log10 for helminth eggs and 0 05 log10 for e coli section 2 7 table s3 most samples of lettuce 75 had coliphage concentrations below the detection limit and consequently it was not possible to perform any statistical analyses on these fig s8 the median concentration of helminth eggs on lettuce irrigated with spring water 0 06 log10 eggs g 1 was higher than that in the treatments involving wastewater i e ranging from 0 70 to 0 26 log10 eggs g 1 fig 2 this was unexpected since spring water had lower concentrations of faecal microorganisms throughout the experiment table s2 as the same pipes were used for all the water sources plots watered with spring water were always the first to be irrigated during a given day in order to avoid cross contamination section 2 2 however pathogens remaining in the pipes from the previous day were likely flushed with the first daily irrigation i e plots irrigated only with spring water cross contaminating the irrigation water and therefore the lettuce such cross contamination has been shown previously for bacteria blaustein et al 2016 and likely affected all the indicator microorganisms but its effect more evident for helminth eggs because they persist longer in the environment i e the pipes leading to greater accumulation than seen for less persistent organisms over time ilic et al 2009 therefore we excluded data for lettuce irrigated with spring water in the statistical analysis for helminth eggs moreover during the statistical analysis we found noticeable differences between the data collected in spring and autumn winter for e coli multiple regressions performed with two separate datasets for e coli yielded higher r squared values r2 0 27 for spring dataset and 0 22 for autumn winter dataset than one dataset r2 0 13 see tables s9 and s10 in supplementary material therefore e coli concentrations on lettuce were analysed separately for spring and autumn winter and the respective results are referred to as spring lettuce or spring e coli and autumn winter lettuce or autumn winter e coli median microbe concentration on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater or wastewater polluted river water ranged from 0 7 to 0 1 log10 eggs g 1 for helminth eggs 1 1 1 4 log10 cfu g 1 for spring e coli and 0 6 1 2 log10 cfu g 1 for autumn winter e coli fig 2 these values are higher than those reported by woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 1 6 and 0 7 log10 eggs kg 1 respectively for helminth eggs on lettuce and coriander furrow irrigated with wastewater respectively since average concentration of helminth eggs in wastewater found in this study 0 37 log10 eggs kg 1 was similar to both woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 0 25 0 49 and 0 43 0 86 log10 eggs kg 1 respectively there can be several other reasons for the discrepancy in concentration of helminth eggs on produce between studies first irrigation frequency was higher in the present study with 2 3 weekly irrigations compared with 1 2 in woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 second larger volumes of water per irrigation event were used in this study 50 100 l m 2 based on local practice while amahmid et al 2021 applied only 12 l m 2 third the leaves of the lettuce cultivated in this study may grow closer to the soil and therefore to the irrigation water compared with the variety i e not specified cultivated in woldetsadik et al 2017 and with the coriander in amahmid et al 2021 on the other hand helminth and e coli concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater and river water in this study were lower than in our previous study where we found 1 6 log10 eggs g 1 and 3 log10 cfu g 1 for lettuce irrigated with water from the same river perez mercado et al 2018 this can be explained by differences in sampling technique as outer leaves were included in the previous study while they were discarded before sampling for this study see section 2 6 1 since outer leaves are more exposed to contamination than inner leaves discarding them presumably reduced the concentrations of microorganisms to the levels observed in this study the concentrations of helminth eggs ascaris spp and taenia spp and e coli on lettuce were not significantly different between any of the treatments involving wastewater for irrigation fig 2 this contradicted our hypothesis that late irrigation of lettuce with higher quality water would reduce microbial contamination of the lettuce considering the favourable conditions for die off of microorganisms with the semi arid climate in cochabamba and sunlight exposure during 11 15 days ottoson et al 2011 stine et al 2005 the high e coli concentration found on lettuce is particularly surprising although not significantly different the median concentrations of e coli on spring lettuce with irrigation water substitution were consistently numerically lower by around 0 4 0 6 log10 than on spring lettuce irrigated only with river water in contrast the median concentration of helminth eggs on spring lettuce with irrigation water substitution were numerically similar to or lower than the median concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with river water the median concentrations of autumn winter e coli with irrigation water substitution also varied from lower to higher than those on lettuce irrigated only with river fig 2 assuming a constant decay rate since the last irrigation with river water the reduction in helminth eggs 0 0 4 log10 in 11 15 days was lower than that reported by amahmid et al 1999 on coriander 0 9 log10 in 7 days and by amahmid et al 2021 on lettuce 0 5 log10 in 7 days likewise the reductions in e coli throughout the four crop cycles ranged from 0 6 log10 in 11 15 days in spring to negative reduction likely due to bacterial growth in autumn winter which were lower than the lowest reduction determined by belias et al 2020 for e coli on spinach 0 07 log10 day 1 and much lower than the minimum reference value 0 5 log10 day 1 set by the who 2006 however the reductions in our study were similar to those found for persistent subpopulations on lettuce of the helminth ascaris suum 0 2 log10 in 25 days by seidu et al 2013 and for e coli some persistent subpopulations increased their concentrations by belias et al 2020 in modelling studies assuming biphasic decay patterns in die off this suggests that die off is biphasic for both organisms and indicates that their persistent subpopulations can have a strong influence on concentrations on lettuce limiting the efficiency of extended die off from irrigation water substitution 3 2 effect of multiple factors on microbial contamination of lettuce 3 2 1 factors affecting concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce the pca and linear regression results showed that the concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce had a significant direct relationship with the length of the crop cycle time between transplantation and harvest fig 3 and table s9 there are two possible reasons for this the first being the difference in temperature between crop cycles the length of a crop cycle is determined by the time it takes lettuce to reach commercial size and thus depends on the ambient conditions a longer crop cycle and higher concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce were both seen at lower minimum daily temperatures 11 7 c than in the shorter crop cycle 14 6 c table s11 in supplementary material this is in agreement with conclusions drawn in recent reviews on ascaris spp asaolu and ofoezie 2019 and taenia spp jansen et al 2021 that the persistence of the eggs decreases with increasing ambient temperature however those conclusions were based on investigations comparing survival at constant temperatures with larger differences than seen in this study 8 18 c for ascaris spp 5 20 c for taenia sp thus it is uncertain whether the difference in temperature between crop cycles in this study was enough to have a significant impact on helminth egg prevalence the second possible reason for the relationship between helminth egg concentrations and crop cycle length was the higher number of irrigation events during the longer crop cycle since every additional irrigation event represents an additional opportunity for lettuce contamination due to wastewater splash resulting in higher concentrations of persistent microorganisms such as helminth eggs on the crop see section 3 1 time between irrigation events had a significant inverse relationship with concentration of helminth eggs on lettuce meaning that concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce with two irrigations per week tended to be higher than with three irrigations per week fig 3 table s9 this was unexpected because a longer interval between irrigation events implies longer exposure of microorganisms to drier conditions sunlight and low relative humidity rh 35 36 see table s11 which is known to hamper environmental survival of helminth eggs rh 35 for taenia spp jansen et al 2021 and 40 for ascaris spp asaolu and ofoezie 2019 a possible explanation is variation in turgor of lettuce leaves with the longer irrigation interval likely causing greater loss of turgor than the shorter interval kirkham 2014 as turgor loss causes temporary wilting of leaves it can be speculated that contact between leaves and soil or irrigation water increased favouring contamination the concentration of helminth eggs in soil before transplantation had a direct relationship with concentrations on lettuce fig 3 table s9 this is in line with jimenez et al 2006 who found that concentrations of helminth eggs in spinach leaves increased with increasing concentrations of helminth eggs in soils fertilised with ecosan a dry source separation latrine sludge helminth eggs in soil before transplantation likely originated from manure addition to soil for the first cycle table s4 however the higher concentrations before transplantation for the second crop cycle compared with the first table s3 suggest that the relative contribution of helminth eggs from manure would decrease after several crop cycles due to continuous addition of helminth eggs from wastewater polluted river water as there is no evidence of helminth egg internalisation in crops through the roots transference of helminth eggs to crops likely occurred via splashing of contaminated soil onto aboveground plant parts alegbeleye et al 2018 the cropping system in the present study included soil hoeing two or three times per crop cycle in order to loosen the soil which involves translocation and suspension of soil particles ziegler et al 2007 and potentially contamination of the crop furthermore as helminth eggs survive longer in soil than on vegetables stien and schwartzbrod 1990 contamination of irrigation water with helminth eggs from soil i e re suspension of helminth eggs from soil followed by water splashing to lettuce is plausible such a mechanism could counteract the effect of wastewater substitution by contaminating the cleaner irrigation water to our knowledge none of these routes of contamination splashing of contaminated soil or re contaminated water applied by furrow from soil to produce has been thoroughly studied to date and thus further investigations are needed 3 2 2 escherichia coli as previously mentioned section 3 1 the data on e coli concentrations on lettuce in the spring and autumn winter crop cycles were analysed separately because of marked differences between these seasons overall median e coli concentrations on lettuce were lower with irrigation water substitution in spring but not in autumn winter fig 2 furthermore in autumn winter median e coli concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with spring water were statistically similar to those on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater both findings indicate lower die off of e coli during autumn winter compared with spring which can be explained by the different temperature regimes in these seasons table s11 fig s12 minimum daily temperatures in spring were mostly above 12 c and tended to increase to 15 c by harvest while temperatures in autumn winter were mostly below 12 c up to 5 c and tended to decrease by harvest fig s12 higher die off of e coli with increasing temperatures has been reported in previous studies e g ottoson et al 2011 found significantly higher concentrations of e coli on lettuce leaves exposed to light at 11 c than at 18 and 25 c while mcevoy et al 2009 observed no loss of viability in e coli populations on lettuce at 5 c apart from the linear relationship with e coli concentrations on lettuce seasonal temperatures i e spring and autumn winter also affected the relationships between e coli on lettuce and other variables for instance the time between irrigation events was significant for e coli in spring but not in autumn winter fig 4 this means that temperature regime and perhaps other seasonal weather factors conditioned the effect of these variables time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest was the only variable with a significant inverse relationship with e coli concentrations on lettuce in the spring and autumn winter datasets fig 4 table s10 this suggests that concentrations of e coli on lettuce with irrigation water substitution were lower than with no substitution especially in spring cycles fig 2 section 3 1 although the difference was not sufficiently large to be statistically significant cross contamination of the spring water could partly explain this lack of significance with spring water continuing to contaminate the lettuce during river water substitution as e coli and even helminth eggs were found in spring water samples at similar higher concentrations table s2 to the threshold values for unrestricted irrigation of 104 cfu of faecal bacteria and 1 helminth egg l 1 who 2006 the degree of cross contamination will depend heavily on the microbial quality of the cleaner source but the mechanism is plausible and should be considered when planning water substitution for autumn winter lettuce time between transplantation and harvest and blocks were the only two variables significantly related to e coli concentration on lettuce fig 4 concentrations of e coli on lettuce tended to be higher with longer time between transplantation and harvest table s10 this is in line with our finding for helminth eggs section 3 2 1 i e a longer period between transplantation and harvest is required at lower temperatures which are in turn favourable for microbial survival and a longer cropping period also requires more irrigation events creating more opportunities for contamination and cross contamination experimental block showed an inverse relationship with e coli on lettuce table s10 with plots located closer to the shaded and slightly more clayey north side of the field see section 2 2 and fig 1 having higher e coli concentrations this influence of blocks on the e coli concentration was likely due to increasing shade from the trees during autumn winter due to bolivia s latitude having fewer hours of sunlight appeared to increase survival of bacteria and likely also caused a gradient of lower temperatures in blocks towards the north side which may have been favourable for e coli survival on vegetable surfaces mcevoy et al 2009 ottoson et al 2011 the shade likely also improved bacterial survival in the soil by reducing evapotranspiration resulting in higher soil moisture levels higher clay content probably also increased soil moisture retention survival of e coli is widely reported to be higher in soils under saturated flooded conditions see review by alegbeleye et al 2018 higher e coli survival in the soil may have increased internalisation of bacteria from soil into the lettuce wright et al 2017 and may also have acted as a reservoir for cross contamination of irrigation water 3 2 3 implications of irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure under the experimental conditions in this study substitution of irrigation water did not significantly reduce the concentrations of helminth eggs or e coli on lettuce and explained little of the variation in e coli concentrations on lettuce however most variables found to be significant in explaining concentrations of the indicator microorganisms on lettuce were related directly or indirectly to two major factors temperature and soil acting as a reservoir of faecal microorganisms the impact of temperature was linked to three significant variables i time between transplantation and harvest helminths and autumn winter e coli ii different concentrations interactions of e coli on spring and autumn winter lettuce and iii shade effect from nearby trees autumn winter e coli the impact of soil as pathogen reservoir was linked to i concentrations of microorganisms during transplantation helminth eggs ii time between transplantation and harvest and iii shade effect from nearby trees based on both major factors temperature and soil it is possible to make some recommendations on use of irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure to reduce microbial risk regarding temperature our results indicated that irrigation water substitution begins to reduce e coli at minimum daily temperatures between 12 and 15 c and that concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce are lower with increasing temperature therefore greater reductions in e coli and some reduction in helminth eggs can be expected if irrigation water substitution is carried out in hot countries this is in line with previous findings of higher reduction rates on lettuce after irrigation cessation in locations warmer than cochabamba 1 5 log10 day 1 for e coli in ghana seidu et al 2013 and 0 5 log10 day 1 for helminth eggs in morocco amahmid et al 2021 thus irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure could significantly reduce faecal microorganisms in regions where minimum daily temperature is at least 15 c soil acting as a reservoir of helminth eggs and e coli when temperature and humidity are favourable for e coli survival can likely counteract other mechanisms that decrease the e coli concentration including irrigation water substitution thus lower concentrations of e coli and helminth eggs following irrigation water substitution could be expected when concentrations in soil and mechanisms for their transference to crop are limited this might be achieved by reducing the volume of water applied as indicated when comparing the water volumes and microorganism concentrations applied in this and previous studies as discussed in section 3 1 there is very often scope for reducing irrigation water volume as water consumption efficiency by the crop with furrow irrigation varies between 50 and 70 brouwer et al 1989 the efficiency can be improved by simple measures such as decreasing the length of furrows or applying irrigation water to the furrows in pulses in order to reduce the losses due to soil infiltration brouwer et al 1989 van opstal et al 2021 implementing drip irrigation could be also an alternative as it reduces water volume and splash compared with furrow irrigation song et al 2006 although its affordability in informal irrigation contexts should be investigated therefore in other contexts where lower irrigation volumes or other irrigation techniques are applied water substitution might be more efficient than found in this study caution is needed however as highly persistent organisms such as helminths or protozoa could accumulate in soil during many crop cycles despite lower irrigation volumes likely resulting in increasing risks of crop contamination over time amoah et al 2018 much of the variation in faecal microorganism concentrations remains unexplained by the variables considered in this study the linear regression models for concentration of helminth eggs and e coli on lettuce accounted for 38 and 22 27 of variance respectively any die off from irrigation water substitution could thus have been counteracted by other factors not considered or monitored in this study for instance paez rubio et al 2005 identified wind as a transporter of e coli at a flooded wastewater irrigation site the large variability in microbial concentrations on lettuce between the different treatments in this study should also be highlighted e g e coli ranged from 0 to 2 log10 g 1 fig 2 this variability made it difficult to determine the reduction achieved by irrigation water substitution as some microbial concentrations on lettuce were similar or even higher with water substitution than in the control fig 2 further research is required to determine whether this variability can be reduced and how it affects the health risks from consumption of lettuce following irrigation water substitution from a more practical perspective contamination from irrigation pipes should be considered if irrigation water substitution is implemented we found this effect to be especially significant for highly persistent pathogens as using dirty pipes when irrigating with spring water resulted in concentrations of helminth eggs similar to those on lettuce irrigated with wastewater polluted river water section 3 1 although we omitted these data to avoid misleading results they imply that cross contamination via pipes could counteract the effect of irrigation water substitution in any context where irrigation devices and infrastructure may be shared as in andean zones of bolivia del callejo veracc 2019 this issue could be overcome by simply flushing the pipes with cleaner water before irrigation a practice that should be emphasised as an essential part of irrigation water substitution 4 conclusions water substitution as an on farm barrier did not significantly reduce the concentrations of helminth eggs and e coli on lettuce mainly irrigated with wastewater temperature and soil acting as a reservoir were the main factors explaining the concentrations of both microbial indicators on lettuce while water substitution explained the concentrations of e coli to a smaller extent water substitution reduced bacteria concentrations on lettuce but the effect was largely counteracted by low temperatures in autumn winter and cross contamination from soil facilitated by the low temperatures shade from trees soil texture and irrigation regime thus we concluded that the conditions in which the study was undertaken were suboptimal for implementing water substitution as on farm measure for risk management of wastewater irrigation further investigations especially on influence of temperature regime on microbial survival on crops and microbial transference from soils both in field studies are required to determine whether water substitution can be optimised as a microbial barrier under the studied conditions or whether it is a more appropriate on farm measure for warmer regions funding this work was supported by the swedish international development cooperation agency

9504,on farm measures can be used in multi barrier schemes to manage microbial risks from consumption of wastewater irrigated vegetables especially where informality of the practice determines minimal external support for farmers evidence indicates that cessation of irrigation greatly reduces microbial contamination on leafy vegetables but at the expense of produce quality replacing wastewater with higher quality irrigation water during the last days of cultivation is an alternative to cessation of irrigation that does not compromise produce quality this study evaluated the effect of wastewater substitution under on farm conditions on different indicators of microbial contamination of lettuce lettuce was cultivated in experimental plots and irrigated with three water sources spring water water from a wastewater polluted river and effluent from a primary wastewater treatment plant but with the river water replaced by spring water in half the plots about two weeks before harvest the experiment was repeated four times in different seasons irrigation water samples collected during cultivation and lettuce samples collected at harvest were analysed for helminth eggs escherichia coli and coliphages variables characterizing the irrigation practices and environmental conditions were recorded there were no significant differences in helminth egg or e coli concentrations on lettuce medians ranged from 0 7 to 0 1 log10 eggs g 1 and 0 6 1 4 log10 cfu g 1 respectively between any of the treatments involving wastewater irrigation no statistical analysis was possible for coliphages because concentrations on lettuce were mostly at or below the detection limit 94 of samples variables associated with temperature and soil explained helminth egg and e coli concentrations on lettuce while number of days of irrigation with spring water representing wastewater substitution was significant only for e coli it was concluded that the experimental conditions were suboptimal for successful implementation of wastewater substitution for on farm microbial risk management but key variables for successful implementation were identified keywords pathogens nutrient recycling farm based measures irrigation scheduling health ecotechnology 1 introduction reusing wastewater for crop irrigation is an effective way to recirculate plant nutrients and water thereby contributing to achievement of a circular economy chojnacka et al 2020 mahjoub et al 2018 however using wastewater for irrigation poses risks to human health by introducing pathogens into agricultural production systems these risks are higher in low and middle income countries where coverage by wastewater treatment services is generally low qadir et al 2010 existing treatment plants commonly face sustainability problems that hamper their performance cossio et al 2019 and irrigation with wastewater is mostly informal scott et al 2009 i e unplanned unregulated and with minimal external support for farmers huibers et al 2009 the risks posed by wastewater irrigation to human health and the environment derive from variety of pollutants wwap 2017 but pathogens are the major concern in low and low middle income countries prüss ustün et al 2019 in order to address the risks from pathogens a multi barrier approach in which different measures act as barriers along the farm to fork pathway has been proposed to complement and even replace treatment plants who 2006 some examples of such barriers are rinsing the produce with clean water right after harvest and disinfecting the vegetables before consumption there are various measures available at farm level to reduce microbial contamination of produce e g allowing irrigation water to settle and modifying irrigation technique and regime keraita et al 2014 in informal contexts where farmers lack external support and wastewater treatment is not necessarily a feasible alternative on farm measures are among the few realistic alternatives to manage microbial risks posed by wastewater irrigation keraita et al 2010 one suggested on farm measure is cessation of irrigation several days prior to harvest to allow time for natural pathogen die off on the crop qadir et al 2010 the actual level of die off will depend on environmental factors such as temperature humidity and exposure to sunlight sánchez and bosch 2016 according to the who 2006 die off of bacteria and viruses on crop surfaces is 0 5 log10 day 1 in cool wet weather and reduced exposure to direct sunlight and 2 log10 d 1 in hot dry weather based on this cessation of irrigation is considered a reliable barrier keraita et al 2010 however many field studies have shown much higher variability and complexity in die off rates than estimated by the who 2006 e g reduction rates from 2 log10 within 2 h to 1 7 log10 in 7 days have been reported for the pathogenic bacterium e coli o157 h7 on leafy crops gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2012 moyne et al 2020 other studies have found that bacterial die off on vegetables can be biphasic i e two decay rates instead of only one due to the existence of persistent subpopulations of bacteria that can decay as slowly as 0 01 log10 day 1 belias et al 2020 after several hours or days following an initial rapid decay of the less persistent subpopulation seidu et al 2013 studies by belias et al 2020 and chase et al 2019 2017 even found periods of e coli growth on vegetable crop surfaces as regards variability similar findings have been made for enteric viruses for example li and uyttendaele 2018 found a reduction of 5 5 log10 in 3 days for murine norovirus mnv 1 on basil leaves while an earlier study found rates of 0 01 and 0 12 log10 d 1 for human adenovirus hav on cantaloupe and lettuce respectively stine et al 2005 a biphasic decay rate has also been reported for the bacteriophage virus bacteroides fragilis on lettuce petterson et al 2001 the unexpected variability and complexity in literature findings suggested that the dynamics of microbe die off on vegetables under field conditions are insufficiently well understood some studies examining multiple factors have been conducted to better understand the dynamics of bacterial die off belias et al 2020 castro ibáñez et al 2015 park et al 2015 those studies identified some key explanatory factors e g bacterial species crop species relative ambient humidity temperature and precipitation but the findings appeared to be specific to the context of the study for example relative humidity was found to affect the survival of e coli in the study by belias et al 2020 while it did not show any apparent effect in the study by castro ibáñez et al 2015 therefore there is a continuing need for multi factor studies of microbe die off dynamics under different field conditions multi factor studies are also needed on other pathogens that are present in wastewater and persist longer than bacteria in the environment such as viruses and helminths aw 2018 for instance the bacteria salmonella spp can survive for up to 70 days in soil and 30 days on crops while enteroviruses survive 30 days longer in both surfaces and the eggs of the helminth ascaris lumbricoides survive many months in soil and up to 60 days on crops ilic et al 2009 investigating die off of multiple types of pathogens is of critical importance in relation to cessation of irrigation as part of the multi barrier approach as differences in their persistence can determine the need for additional measures thus more information about die off of different types of foodborne pathogens under field conditions is necessary a major challenge with cessation of irrigation is its effect on the physical quality and yield of vegetable crops which has been found to reduce acceptance of the measure among farmers amoah et al 2011 mayilla et al 2016 replacing wastewater with higher quality irrigation water instead of ceasing irrigation could be a viable option to extend the die off period without affecting produce quality while alternative higher quality water sources are most likely unavailable in regions where wastewater irrigation is performed it is possible to envision a system in which higher quality effluent from the same wastewater treatment source is produced and used for irrigation in such a system wastewater would be used for bulk irrigation during the initial stages of crop growth while at the same time small wastewater volumes would be diverted to on farm water treatment units and then stored various on farm treatments such as on farm ponds keraita et al 2014 and filtration systems kaetzl et al 2019 perez mercado et al 2019 have been shown to reduce the concentrations of pathogens in wastewater while these treatments cannot handle the large flows needed for irrigation they can probably efficiently treat smaller flows perez mercado et al 2019 such as untreated wastewater volumes diverted during bulk irrigation the treated wastewater would be accumulated on farm until two weeks prior to harvest and used then as the sole source for crop irrigation replacing untreated wastewater before harvest and thus extending the pathogen die off period to our knowledge no previous study has examined extended die off following irrigation water substitution the aim of this study was therefore to test the core mechanism of the envisioned extended die off system this was done by assessing the impact of replacing wastewater with a higher quality water source on the microbial hygiene status of wastewater irrigated lettuce in field conditions using cochabamba bolivia as an example of a semi arid agricultural region where informal wastewater irrigation is practiced lettuce was chosen because it is the crop for raw consumption with the largest area 2 800 ha in 2018 harvested in bolivia iniaf et al 2019 and it has been found to be the main crop in several production systems that use wastewater for irrigation perez mercado et al 2018 specific objectives were to i assess the concentration of viral bacterial and pathogenic helminth indicators on lettuce samples in plots where wastewater was replaced with a cleaner irrigation water source for two weeks before harvesting and ii analyse the combined effects of water quality irrigation regime and environmental factors on microbial contamination of lettuce 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up the effect of wastewater substitution in experimental field lettuce plots supplied by furrow irrigation was investigated by determining the concentrations of viral bacterial and helminth indicators fig 1 in total six treatments were evaluated during four different crop cycles in different seasons four treatments were defined based on combining two factors i frequency of irrigation events throughout the crop cycle and ii replacement of a wastewater polluted river water as the source for irrigation two irrigation frequencies 3 and 2 irrigations per week representing intervals of 2 3 and 3 5 days respectively throughout the cycle were defined based on previous work showing these to be common practice in lettuce cultivation in the study region perez mercado et al 2018 for substitution of the wastewater polluted source two alternatives were assessed a no substitution i e irrigating with wastewater polluted river water for the entire crop cycle and b substitution with cleaner water from a nearby spring during the last two weeks before harvest the spring water had lower levels of pathogens see table s2 in supplementary material and was used as a proxy for wastewater treatment on farm combining the two irrigation frequencies with the two substitution alternatives resulted in four treatments three irrigations per week only with wastewater polluted source river 3 week two irrigations per week only with wastewater polluted river water river 2 week three irrigations per week with substitution of wastewater polluted water riv spring 3 week and two irrigations per week with substitution of wastewater polluted source riv spring 2 week two control treatments were also included irrigation with spring water three times per week spring 3 week representing a best case scenario and irrigation with effluent from primary treatment upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor at a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp three times per week wwtp 3 week representing a worst case scenario 2 2 lettuce plots and irrigation system the experiment was conducted at san pedro magisterio treatment plant sacaba municipality cochabamba bolivia a semi arid region with mean annual temperature 16 18 c mean relative ambient humidity 45 and mean annual rainfall 400 500 mm of which less than 40 mm falls between april and september gossweiler et al 2019 salini calderón and medina mitma 2017 the soil at the site was found to transition from sandy clay loam texture at the north side of the field to sandy loam at the south side with moderately alkaline ph 7 9 8 1 6 7 ds m 1 salinity 1 2 2 6 of total organic matter and bulk density 1 4 1 5 g cm 3 see table s1 in supplementary material the soil had not been used for agricultural production for at least seven years prior to the experiment but had occasionally received raw wastewater diverted from the nearby wwtp during intense rainfall events and maintenance tasks in order to account for the effect of differences in soil texture shade from nearby trees and slope north side the field site was divided into three blocks of 15 m x 5 m each separated by a 0 7 m wide footpath to avoid cross contamination fig 1a each block was divided into six plots 2 5 m wide x 4 m long and the experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with which each of the six treatments randomly assigned to a plot within each block seven ridges measuring 0 35 m width including their respective furrow and 4 5 m long were created in each plot the first ridge in each plot was considered the plot edge and was therefore not planted and the adjacent furrows were not irrigated figure1b all six remaining ridges were planted with lettuce but only the four central ridges were used for soil and lettuce sampling the distance between lettuce plants along the ridges was 15 cm all treatments see fig 1a were applied to the same plots during four crop cycles of lettuce lactuca sativa var crispa agricultural practices were kept the same for all plots during the four crop cycles cycles one and two were in spring 2016 september december and cycles three and four were in autumn winter 2017 april august lasting 47 50 42 45 60 61 and 53 55 days respectively the agricultural routines followed were as prescribed by an experienced lettuce farmer who decided the dates for applying fertilisers and pest control and the irrigation times and amounts i e the water volume for each irrigation event the harvest dates in each cycle were also defined in agreement with that farmer but harvesting was carried out on different days for each block due to some constraints in laboratory capacity see full dataset in table s3 in supplementary material following the experienced farmer s instructions in the first and third crop cycles dried cow manure was applied at 15 ton ha 1 one week before lettuce transplanting one week after transplanting in all four cycles a complete foliar fertiliser npk was applied to the soil at 0 5 ton ha 1 i e 0 1 0 1 and 0 03 ton ha 1 for n p2o5 and k20 respectively and the plantlets were sprayed with an insecticide fungicide solution diluted in tap water at the dosage recommended on the product label one month after transplanting urea was added in pellet form to the soil at a rate of 30 kg ha 1 and the plants were given a second spraying with the insecticide fungicide solution the irrigation method used was furrow irrigation and the water was transported by means of a water pump and assembled pvc pipelines irrigation was always performed between 08 00 and 11 00 h or 16 00 18 00 h when irrigation from different water sources had to be performed on the same day the sequence started with spring water followed by river water and finally primary effluent i e from cleanest to dirtiest as the same pipes were used for all water sources the duration and therefore the volume of irrigation for every event and plot was defined by the experienced farmer the amount of irrigation water was measured on two occasions each during the first and third cycles and on three occasions during the second cycle using the volumetric method no measurements were performed during the fourth cycle irrigation runoff seldom occurred and therefore was considered negligible during the first weeks after transplanting each plot was irrigated with its corresponding water source four plots with river water one plot with spring water and one plot with primary effluent all randomly assigned per block about two weeks 11 15 days before harvest estimated by the experienced farmer based on crop development the river water was replaced by spring water in two plots per block 2 3 irrigation water sources 2 3 1 river water due to unplanned urban expansion in sacaba municipality the nearby river rocha receives wastewater discharges from many sewage systems with no or poor treatment along the valley gossweiler et al 2019 as a result the river is heavily polluted with domestic wastewater and it is believed that its flow mostly comprises wastewater in the driest months huibers et al 2009 despite being heavily polluted the river is still a major source of irrigation water in surrounding periurban and rural zones in cochabamba verbyla et al 2016 especially during the dry season march november perez mercado et al 2018 the river was located around 45 m of the experimental plots to where river water was pumped 2 3 2 effluent from primary wastewater treatment the san pedro magisterio wwtp receives wastewater from 235 households the incoming wastewater undergoes a preliminary treatment comprised of screening and a rectangular grit chamber the effluent then passes through a uasb reactor and finally to a horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetland the effluent water used for irrigation of the experimental plots was pumped from the inspection chamber located between the uasb reactor and the wetland this source represented a worst case scenario in which farmers irrigated their vegetables with undiluted settled wastewater 2 3 3 spring water the spring water source was located approximately 25 m away from the experimental plots the emerging water flowed to a dug pond of 30 m3 and the overflow was conducted to the river the water used for irrigation of experimental plots was pumped from the dug pond no information was available about the source of the spring water but a slow reduction in water flow was observed during the experimental year which suggests that the water may infiltrate into the soil in the high part of the basin during the rainy season 2 4 analysis of water samples 2 4 1 sampling samples from the three water sources were collected between 08 00 and 11 00 h on 2 3 occasions during each crop cycle at 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation for the first crop cycle and at 2 4 and 5 weeks for the second to fourth crop cycles see table s2 in supplementary material in brief 400 ml from each water source were collected in sterile plastic bottles and transported on ice to the laboratory for analysis of escherichia coli and coliphages in addition 10 l of each water type were collected for helminth egg analysis at the laboratory all samples were stored at 4 c the samples used for e coli and coliphages analysis were processed within 2 4 h after collection while those for helminth egg analysis were processed within 1 4 weeks a total of 33 water samples were collected during the four crop cycles 2 4 2 processing the 400 ml water samples were analysed according to method epa 1603 u s epa 2014 and modified epa 1602 u s epa 2001 for e coli and coliphages respectively for determination of e coli 100 ml of water sample were filtered through a membrane onto modified mtec agar medium and then incubated at 44 c for 24 h red magenta colonies were counted at the end of the period for determination of coliphages log phase host bacteria e coli c3000 atcc 15597 which is susceptible to somatic and f specific coliphages and 100 ml of double strength molten tryptic soy agar were added to 100 ml of water sample and the mixture was poured into five petri plates after 16 20 h of incubation at 36 c circular lysis zones were enumerated helminth eggs were extracted following the procedure described in the mexican norm nmx aa 113 scfi 2012 2012 in brief the 10 l samples of the different irrigation waters were allowed to sediment sieved at 150 170 µm re suspended and centrifuged at 400 rpm for 5 min the sediment was collected and immersed in magnesium sulphate any material floating was collected and centrifuged and the pellet was immersed in ether ethyl 0 1 n sulphuric acid solution 35 65 v v subsamples of the resulting concentrated material were placed in neubauer improved counting chambers with immersion oil and enumerated by microscopy at 100x magnification 2 5 analysis of soil and manure samples 2 5 1 sampling soils from the experimental plots were sampled at transplanting i e right before transplantation in each crop cycle each plot was sampled by collecting soil from the top 7 cm at six points located at the intersections of a grid formed by the third and sixth ridges widthways and three transverse lines at 1 2 and 3 m along both ridges the six samples per plot were then mixed to give one composite sample of about 1 5 kg manure samples for analysis were collected from three points on the manure pile one week before manure was added to soil in the first crop cycle see section 2 2 the manure samples and composite soil samples were placed in plastic bags and transported to the laboratory where they were analysed on the same day for e coli and coliphages and then stored at 4 c until helminth analysis in total three manure samples and 72 soil samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 4 transplantations were collected during the four crop cycles 2 5 2 processing the same analytical methods as used for the water samples were applied to the soil and manure samples but modified to suit solid samples according to the procedure described by verbyla et al 2016 for e coli and coliphages and complemented with the tulane method for helminth eggs bowman et al 2003 for analysis of e coli and coliphages 25 g of soil sample were added to 225 ml sterile water and shaken vigorously for 1 m and the mixture was then processed as described for water samples see section 2 4 2 for extraction of helminth eggs 20 g of soil were immersed and homogenised in 200 ml of sterile water and blended the mixture was diluted to 900 ml with 1 aqueous solution of 7x limbro v v and allowed to settle overnight after which the sediment was collected re suspended with 300 ml of sterile water and blended again the homogenised mixture was then passed through a 50 mesh sieve diluted to 900 ml with 7x and allowed to settle for 2 h the sediment was collected and centrifuged the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was immersed in magnesium sulphate after that the same procedure as for water samples was followed section 2 4 2 2 6 analysis of lettuce samples 2 6 1 sampling a composite lettuce sample was collected from each plot at harvest in each crop cycle to obtain a representative sample four plants were randomly selected from the four central ridges of each plot see section 2 2 outer leaves whose appearance would make selling of the lettuce difficult were discarded following the experienced farmer s instructions using an aseptic technique six leaves from each selected plant were cut from the stem and placed in a plastic bag to give one composite sample of 24 leaves 6 leaves x 4 selected plants the composite samples were transported to the laboratory where they were analysed on the same day for e coli and coliphages and stored at 4 c until helminth analysis storage time varied between 1 and 7 weeks helminth eggs were analysed only for the first two crop cycles therefore 36 composite samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 2 harvests were collected and analysed for helminth eggs while 72 composite samples 6 treatments x 3 blocks x 4 harvests were analysed for e coli and coliphages 2 6 2 processing the lettuce leaf samples were processed following the same procedure used for soil samples see section 2 5 2 2 7 statistical analysis the concentrations of the different indicator microbes on lettuce samples cultivated in the six treatments see section 2 1 were tested for significant differences α 0 05 using one way analysis of variance anova in randomised blocks after verifying normality in the model residuals and homoscedasticity by means of shapiro wilk and bartlett tests respectively when anova indicated a significant difference tukey post hoc tests were performed to compare the means of the six treatments α 0 05 concentrations below the detection limit were replaced with a value between zero and the detection limit in the statistical analysis section 3 1 following common practice wood et al 2011 principal component analysis pca was used to analyse the influence of irrigation practices irrigation frequency and time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest and environmental factors concentrations of microbial indicators in soil at transplantation number of days until harvest and block on the concentrations of each of the indicator microorganisms on lettuce leaves the analysis was based on the relationships between microbial concentrations on lettuce and the target variables when the two principal components pc with the highest proportions of explained variance were plotted it should be noted that the time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest substitution days included the treatments where no water substitution was performed for instance since wastewater polluted river water was not used for irrigation in the control treatment with spring water section 2 1 the value for substitution days was the number of days from transplantation until harvest for the treatment where wastewater polluted river water was the sole irrigation source the value for substitution days was the number of days between the last irrigation event and harvest the analysis of graphical relationships in pca plots was complemented with multiple linear regressions between microbial concentrations on lettuce as response variable and the remaining variables as predictors statistical analyses and graphical plotting were carried out with r software r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria input data for the statistical analysis and the r code applied are shown in table s3 sections s5 s6 and s7 in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of indicator microorganisms on lettuce the proportion of lettuce samples with microbial concentrations below the detection limit was different for each indicator microorganism helminth eggs and e coli were detected in 56 and 93 of samples respectively values below the detection limit were replaced with 0 7 log10 for helminth eggs and 0 05 log10 for e coli section 2 7 table s3 most samples of lettuce 75 had coliphage concentrations below the detection limit and consequently it was not possible to perform any statistical analyses on these fig s8 the median concentration of helminth eggs on lettuce irrigated with spring water 0 06 log10 eggs g 1 was higher than that in the treatments involving wastewater i e ranging from 0 70 to 0 26 log10 eggs g 1 fig 2 this was unexpected since spring water had lower concentrations of faecal microorganisms throughout the experiment table s2 as the same pipes were used for all the water sources plots watered with spring water were always the first to be irrigated during a given day in order to avoid cross contamination section 2 2 however pathogens remaining in the pipes from the previous day were likely flushed with the first daily irrigation i e plots irrigated only with spring water cross contaminating the irrigation water and therefore the lettuce such cross contamination has been shown previously for bacteria blaustein et al 2016 and likely affected all the indicator microorganisms but its effect more evident for helminth eggs because they persist longer in the environment i e the pipes leading to greater accumulation than seen for less persistent organisms over time ilic et al 2009 therefore we excluded data for lettuce irrigated with spring water in the statistical analysis for helminth eggs moreover during the statistical analysis we found noticeable differences between the data collected in spring and autumn winter for e coli multiple regressions performed with two separate datasets for e coli yielded higher r squared values r2 0 27 for spring dataset and 0 22 for autumn winter dataset than one dataset r2 0 13 see tables s9 and s10 in supplementary material therefore e coli concentrations on lettuce were analysed separately for spring and autumn winter and the respective results are referred to as spring lettuce or spring e coli and autumn winter lettuce or autumn winter e coli median microbe concentration on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater or wastewater polluted river water ranged from 0 7 to 0 1 log10 eggs g 1 for helminth eggs 1 1 1 4 log10 cfu g 1 for spring e coli and 0 6 1 2 log10 cfu g 1 for autumn winter e coli fig 2 these values are higher than those reported by woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 1 6 and 0 7 log10 eggs kg 1 respectively for helminth eggs on lettuce and coriander furrow irrigated with wastewater respectively since average concentration of helminth eggs in wastewater found in this study 0 37 log10 eggs kg 1 was similar to both woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 0 25 0 49 and 0 43 0 86 log10 eggs kg 1 respectively there can be several other reasons for the discrepancy in concentration of helminth eggs on produce between studies first irrigation frequency was higher in the present study with 2 3 weekly irrigations compared with 1 2 in woldetsadik et al 2017 and amahmid et al 2021 second larger volumes of water per irrigation event were used in this study 50 100 l m 2 based on local practice while amahmid et al 2021 applied only 12 l m 2 third the leaves of the lettuce cultivated in this study may grow closer to the soil and therefore to the irrigation water compared with the variety i e not specified cultivated in woldetsadik et al 2017 and with the coriander in amahmid et al 2021 on the other hand helminth and e coli concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater and river water in this study were lower than in our previous study where we found 1 6 log10 eggs g 1 and 3 log10 cfu g 1 for lettuce irrigated with water from the same river perez mercado et al 2018 this can be explained by differences in sampling technique as outer leaves were included in the previous study while they were discarded before sampling for this study see section 2 6 1 since outer leaves are more exposed to contamination than inner leaves discarding them presumably reduced the concentrations of microorganisms to the levels observed in this study the concentrations of helminth eggs ascaris spp and taenia spp and e coli on lettuce were not significantly different between any of the treatments involving wastewater for irrigation fig 2 this contradicted our hypothesis that late irrigation of lettuce with higher quality water would reduce microbial contamination of the lettuce considering the favourable conditions for die off of microorganisms with the semi arid climate in cochabamba and sunlight exposure during 11 15 days ottoson et al 2011 stine et al 2005 the high e coli concentration found on lettuce is particularly surprising although not significantly different the median concentrations of e coli on spring lettuce with irrigation water substitution were consistently numerically lower by around 0 4 0 6 log10 than on spring lettuce irrigated only with river water in contrast the median concentration of helminth eggs on spring lettuce with irrigation water substitution were numerically similar to or lower than the median concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with river water the median concentrations of autumn winter e coli with irrigation water substitution also varied from lower to higher than those on lettuce irrigated only with river fig 2 assuming a constant decay rate since the last irrigation with river water the reduction in helminth eggs 0 0 4 log10 in 11 15 days was lower than that reported by amahmid et al 1999 on coriander 0 9 log10 in 7 days and by amahmid et al 2021 on lettuce 0 5 log10 in 7 days likewise the reductions in e coli throughout the four crop cycles ranged from 0 6 log10 in 11 15 days in spring to negative reduction likely due to bacterial growth in autumn winter which were lower than the lowest reduction determined by belias et al 2020 for e coli on spinach 0 07 log10 day 1 and much lower than the minimum reference value 0 5 log10 day 1 set by the who 2006 however the reductions in our study were similar to those found for persistent subpopulations on lettuce of the helminth ascaris suum 0 2 log10 in 25 days by seidu et al 2013 and for e coli some persistent subpopulations increased their concentrations by belias et al 2020 in modelling studies assuming biphasic decay patterns in die off this suggests that die off is biphasic for both organisms and indicates that their persistent subpopulations can have a strong influence on concentrations on lettuce limiting the efficiency of extended die off from irrigation water substitution 3 2 effect of multiple factors on microbial contamination of lettuce 3 2 1 factors affecting concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce the pca and linear regression results showed that the concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce had a significant direct relationship with the length of the crop cycle time between transplantation and harvest fig 3 and table s9 there are two possible reasons for this the first being the difference in temperature between crop cycles the length of a crop cycle is determined by the time it takes lettuce to reach commercial size and thus depends on the ambient conditions a longer crop cycle and higher concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce were both seen at lower minimum daily temperatures 11 7 c than in the shorter crop cycle 14 6 c table s11 in supplementary material this is in agreement with conclusions drawn in recent reviews on ascaris spp asaolu and ofoezie 2019 and taenia spp jansen et al 2021 that the persistence of the eggs decreases with increasing ambient temperature however those conclusions were based on investigations comparing survival at constant temperatures with larger differences than seen in this study 8 18 c for ascaris spp 5 20 c for taenia sp thus it is uncertain whether the difference in temperature between crop cycles in this study was enough to have a significant impact on helminth egg prevalence the second possible reason for the relationship between helminth egg concentrations and crop cycle length was the higher number of irrigation events during the longer crop cycle since every additional irrigation event represents an additional opportunity for lettuce contamination due to wastewater splash resulting in higher concentrations of persistent microorganisms such as helminth eggs on the crop see section 3 1 time between irrigation events had a significant inverse relationship with concentration of helminth eggs on lettuce meaning that concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce with two irrigations per week tended to be higher than with three irrigations per week fig 3 table s9 this was unexpected because a longer interval between irrigation events implies longer exposure of microorganisms to drier conditions sunlight and low relative humidity rh 35 36 see table s11 which is known to hamper environmental survival of helminth eggs rh 35 for taenia spp jansen et al 2021 and 40 for ascaris spp asaolu and ofoezie 2019 a possible explanation is variation in turgor of lettuce leaves with the longer irrigation interval likely causing greater loss of turgor than the shorter interval kirkham 2014 as turgor loss causes temporary wilting of leaves it can be speculated that contact between leaves and soil or irrigation water increased favouring contamination the concentration of helminth eggs in soil before transplantation had a direct relationship with concentrations on lettuce fig 3 table s9 this is in line with jimenez et al 2006 who found that concentrations of helminth eggs in spinach leaves increased with increasing concentrations of helminth eggs in soils fertilised with ecosan a dry source separation latrine sludge helminth eggs in soil before transplantation likely originated from manure addition to soil for the first cycle table s4 however the higher concentrations before transplantation for the second crop cycle compared with the first table s3 suggest that the relative contribution of helminth eggs from manure would decrease after several crop cycles due to continuous addition of helminth eggs from wastewater polluted river water as there is no evidence of helminth egg internalisation in crops through the roots transference of helminth eggs to crops likely occurred via splashing of contaminated soil onto aboveground plant parts alegbeleye et al 2018 the cropping system in the present study included soil hoeing two or three times per crop cycle in order to loosen the soil which involves translocation and suspension of soil particles ziegler et al 2007 and potentially contamination of the crop furthermore as helminth eggs survive longer in soil than on vegetables stien and schwartzbrod 1990 contamination of irrigation water with helminth eggs from soil i e re suspension of helminth eggs from soil followed by water splashing to lettuce is plausible such a mechanism could counteract the effect of wastewater substitution by contaminating the cleaner irrigation water to our knowledge none of these routes of contamination splashing of contaminated soil or re contaminated water applied by furrow from soil to produce has been thoroughly studied to date and thus further investigations are needed 3 2 2 escherichia coli as previously mentioned section 3 1 the data on e coli concentrations on lettuce in the spring and autumn winter crop cycles were analysed separately because of marked differences between these seasons overall median e coli concentrations on lettuce were lower with irrigation water substitution in spring but not in autumn winter fig 2 furthermore in autumn winter median e coli concentrations on lettuce irrigated only with spring water were statistically similar to those on lettuce irrigated only with wastewater both findings indicate lower die off of e coli during autumn winter compared with spring which can be explained by the different temperature regimes in these seasons table s11 fig s12 minimum daily temperatures in spring were mostly above 12 c and tended to increase to 15 c by harvest while temperatures in autumn winter were mostly below 12 c up to 5 c and tended to decrease by harvest fig s12 higher die off of e coli with increasing temperatures has been reported in previous studies e g ottoson et al 2011 found significantly higher concentrations of e coli on lettuce leaves exposed to light at 11 c than at 18 and 25 c while mcevoy et al 2009 observed no loss of viability in e coli populations on lettuce at 5 c apart from the linear relationship with e coli concentrations on lettuce seasonal temperatures i e spring and autumn winter also affected the relationships between e coli on lettuce and other variables for instance the time between irrigation events was significant for e coli in spring but not in autumn winter fig 4 this means that temperature regime and perhaps other seasonal weather factors conditioned the effect of these variables time between the last irrigation with wastewater polluted river water and harvest was the only variable with a significant inverse relationship with e coli concentrations on lettuce in the spring and autumn winter datasets fig 4 table s10 this suggests that concentrations of e coli on lettuce with irrigation water substitution were lower than with no substitution especially in spring cycles fig 2 section 3 1 although the difference was not sufficiently large to be statistically significant cross contamination of the spring water could partly explain this lack of significance with spring water continuing to contaminate the lettuce during river water substitution as e coli and even helminth eggs were found in spring water samples at similar higher concentrations table s2 to the threshold values for unrestricted irrigation of 104 cfu of faecal bacteria and 1 helminth egg l 1 who 2006 the degree of cross contamination will depend heavily on the microbial quality of the cleaner source but the mechanism is plausible and should be considered when planning water substitution for autumn winter lettuce time between transplantation and harvest and blocks were the only two variables significantly related to e coli concentration on lettuce fig 4 concentrations of e coli on lettuce tended to be higher with longer time between transplantation and harvest table s10 this is in line with our finding for helminth eggs section 3 2 1 i e a longer period between transplantation and harvest is required at lower temperatures which are in turn favourable for microbial survival and a longer cropping period also requires more irrigation events creating more opportunities for contamination and cross contamination experimental block showed an inverse relationship with e coli on lettuce table s10 with plots located closer to the shaded and slightly more clayey north side of the field see section 2 2 and fig 1 having higher e coli concentrations this influence of blocks on the e coli concentration was likely due to increasing shade from the trees during autumn winter due to bolivia s latitude having fewer hours of sunlight appeared to increase survival of bacteria and likely also caused a gradient of lower temperatures in blocks towards the north side which may have been favourable for e coli survival on vegetable surfaces mcevoy et al 2009 ottoson et al 2011 the shade likely also improved bacterial survival in the soil by reducing evapotranspiration resulting in higher soil moisture levels higher clay content probably also increased soil moisture retention survival of e coli is widely reported to be higher in soils under saturated flooded conditions see review by alegbeleye et al 2018 higher e coli survival in the soil may have increased internalisation of bacteria from soil into the lettuce wright et al 2017 and may also have acted as a reservoir for cross contamination of irrigation water 3 2 3 implications of irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure under the experimental conditions in this study substitution of irrigation water did not significantly reduce the concentrations of helminth eggs or e coli on lettuce and explained little of the variation in e coli concentrations on lettuce however most variables found to be significant in explaining concentrations of the indicator microorganisms on lettuce were related directly or indirectly to two major factors temperature and soil acting as a reservoir of faecal microorganisms the impact of temperature was linked to three significant variables i time between transplantation and harvest helminths and autumn winter e coli ii different concentrations interactions of e coli on spring and autumn winter lettuce and iii shade effect from nearby trees autumn winter e coli the impact of soil as pathogen reservoir was linked to i concentrations of microorganisms during transplantation helminth eggs ii time between transplantation and harvest and iii shade effect from nearby trees based on both major factors temperature and soil it is possible to make some recommendations on use of irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure to reduce microbial risk regarding temperature our results indicated that irrigation water substitution begins to reduce e coli at minimum daily temperatures between 12 and 15 c and that concentrations of helminth eggs on lettuce are lower with increasing temperature therefore greater reductions in e coli and some reduction in helminth eggs can be expected if irrigation water substitution is carried out in hot countries this is in line with previous findings of higher reduction rates on lettuce after irrigation cessation in locations warmer than cochabamba 1 5 log10 day 1 for e coli in ghana seidu et al 2013 and 0 5 log10 day 1 for helminth eggs in morocco amahmid et al 2021 thus irrigation water substitution as an on farm measure could significantly reduce faecal microorganisms in regions where minimum daily temperature is at least 15 c soil acting as a reservoir of helminth eggs and e coli when temperature and humidity are favourable for e coli survival can likely counteract other mechanisms that decrease the e coli concentration including irrigation water substitution thus lower concentrations of e coli and helminth eggs following irrigation water substitution could be expected when concentrations in soil and mechanisms for their transference to crop are limited this might be achieved by reducing the volume of water applied as indicated when comparing the water volumes and microorganism concentrations applied in this and previous studies as discussed in section 3 1 there is very often scope for reducing irrigation water volume as water consumption efficiency by the crop with furrow irrigation varies between 50 and 70 brouwer et al 1989 the efficiency can be improved by simple measures such as decreasing the length of furrows or applying irrigation water to the furrows in pulses in order to reduce the losses due to soil infiltration brouwer et al 1989 van opstal et al 2021 implementing drip irrigation could be also an alternative as it reduces water volume and splash compared with furrow irrigation song et al 2006 although its affordability in informal irrigation contexts should be investigated therefore in other contexts where lower irrigation volumes or other irrigation techniques are applied water substitution might be more efficient than found in this study caution is needed however as highly persistent organisms such as helminths or protozoa could accumulate in soil during many crop cycles despite lower irrigation volumes likely resulting in increasing risks of crop contamination over time amoah et al 2018 much of the variation in faecal microorganism concentrations remains unexplained by the variables considered in this study the linear regression models for concentration of helminth eggs and e coli on lettuce accounted for 38 and 22 27 of variance respectively any die off from irrigation water substitution could thus have been counteracted by other factors not considered or monitored in this study for instance paez rubio et al 2005 identified wind as a transporter of e coli at a flooded wastewater irrigation site the large variability in microbial concentrations on lettuce between the different treatments in this study should also be highlighted e g e coli ranged from 0 to 2 log10 g 1 fig 2 this variability made it difficult to determine the reduction achieved by irrigation water substitution as some microbial concentrations on lettuce were similar or even higher with water substitution than in the control fig 2 further research is required to determine whether this variability can be reduced and how it affects the health risks from consumption of lettuce following irrigation water substitution from a more practical perspective contamination from irrigation pipes should be considered if irrigation water substitution is implemented we found this effect to be especially significant for highly persistent pathogens as using dirty pipes when irrigating with spring water resulted in concentrations of helminth eggs similar to those on lettuce irrigated with wastewater polluted river water section 3 1 although we omitted these data to avoid misleading results they imply that cross contamination via pipes could counteract the effect of irrigation water substitution in any context where irrigation devices and infrastructure may be shared as in andean zones of bolivia del callejo veracc 2019 this issue could be overcome by simply flushing the pipes with cleaner water before irrigation a practice that should be emphasised as an essential part of irrigation water substitution 4 conclusions water substitution as an on farm barrier did not significantly reduce the concentrations of helminth eggs and e coli on lettuce mainly irrigated with wastewater temperature and soil acting as a reservoir were the main factors explaining the concentrations of both microbial indicators on lettuce while water substitution explained the concentrations of e coli to a smaller extent water substitution reduced bacteria concentrations on lettuce but the effect was largely counteracted by low temperatures in autumn winter and cross contamination from soil facilitated by the low temperatures shade from trees soil texture and irrigation regime thus we concluded that the conditions in which the study was undertaken were suboptimal for implementing water substitution as on farm measure for risk management of wastewater irrigation further investigations especially on influence of temperature regime on microbial survival on crops and microbial transference from soils both in field studies are required to determine whether water substitution can be optimised as a microbial barrier under the studied conditions or whether it is a more appropriate on farm measure for warmer regions funding this work was supported by the swedish international development cooperation agency
