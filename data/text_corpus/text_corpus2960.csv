14800,reducing co2 emission and energy consumption is crucial for the sustainable management of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this study an algal bacterial aerobic granular sludge ags system was developed for efficient carbon c assimilation and nitrogen n phosphorus p removal without the need for mechanical aeration the photosynthetic o2 production by phototrophic organisms maintained the dissolved oxygen do level at 3 4 mg l in the bulk liquid and an led light control system reduced 10 30 of light energy consumption results showed that the biomass assimilated 52 of input dissolved total carbon dtc and the produced o2 simultaneously facilitated aerobic nitrification and p uptake with the coexisting phototrophs serving as a c fixer and o2 supplier this resulted in a stably high total n removal of 81 7 and an n assimilation rate of 7 55 mg g mlvss d with enhanced microbial assimilation and simultaneous nitrification denitrification good p removal of 92 98 was maintained during the test period at a molar p c ratio of 0 36 0 03 and high p release and uptake rates of 10 84 0 41 and 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h respectively photosynthetic o2 was more advantageous for n and p removal than mechanical aeration this proposed system can contribute to a better design and sustainable operation of wwtps using algal bacterial ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bacterial aerobic granular sludge carbon fixation nitrogen assimilation photosynthetic oxygen simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global wastewater generation is estimated at 359 4 billion m3 annually with only 53 receiving adequate treatment jones et al 2021 the substantial volume of wastewater production and its associated environmental impacts drive the need for sustainable development of wastewater treatment plants wwtps aeration is these plants most energy intensive treatment unit with energy consumption ranging between 0 27 and 1 89 kwh m3 in conventional activated sludge cas based wwtps vergara araya et al 2021 additionally wwtps have been identified as a significant contributor to greenhouse gasses ghgs emission mainly co2 from electricity consumption and biological processes campos et al 2016 larsen 2015 as a result reducing co2 emission and energy consumption in wwtps has become a subject of increased attention bacterial aerobic granular sludge ags has become a popular option for wastewater treatment because of its compact structure efficient settling and high biomass retention which can reduce operating costs and energy consumption de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 it has been applied in over 90 wwtps in 20 countries nereda 2023 however it is worth noting that the application of ags does not necessarily reduce co2 emission from biological processes additionally sequencing batch reactors sbrs commonly used for ags cultivation and operation adav et al 2008 de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 can contribute to a higher direct co2 emission compared to other processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o anoxic oxic a o and oxidation ditch bao et al 2015 cultivation of phototrophic organisms including microalgae and cyanobacteria using wastewater can provide a promising way to fix carbon c in wwtps phototrophic organisms can fix co2 and produce high value added biomass during the biological processes reducing net co2 emission simultaneously the photosynthetic o2 can help microbes decompose organics remove nutrients and substantially reduce electricity consumption required by aeration in biological wwtps gonçalves et al 2017 muñoz and guieysse 2006 unlike the big granule size of ags the tiny structure of phototrophic organisms especially microalgae leads to a low biomass settleability and a high energy requirement for biomass separation and harvesting gonçalves et al 2017 wang q et al 2020 in addition the cultivation of phototrophic organisms for nutrients removal requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 6 days muñoz and guieysse 2006 resulting in lower efficiencies when compared to nitrogen n removal by nitrifiers denitrifiers and phosphorus p removal by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in conventional biological wwtps more recently the newly developed algal bacterial ags has attracted much attention due to its great potential for reduction in co2 emission and energy consumption since it combines the excellent properties of microalgae and or phototrophic organisms and bacterial ags abouhend et al 2018 ji et al 2020a wang j et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 at its early stage the algal bacterial ags were developed in sbrs with mechanical aeration huang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 beneficial for granulation and stable granules maintenance nevertheless the stripping effect of bubbling aeration operation may remove the inorganic c available for microalgae growth and the photosynthetic o2 for aerobic bacteria li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore the open airlift reactors may not fulfill this new granule system s and coexisting microalgae s potential currently several studies have attempted to develop aeration free algal bacterial ags systems where phototrophs fix inorganic c to produce o2 for organics and nutrient removal targeting the maximum effects of phototrophic organisms on c fixation and energy saving zhao et al 2019 detected excellent c n removal performance by the algal bacterial ags in shaking photo reactors without mechanical aeration wang j et al 2020 achieved efficient c p removal from a photosynthetic o2 supported and closed photo sbr with algal bacterial ags naturally developed from bacterial ags ji and co workers investigated n p removal pathways in the algal bacterial ags system under non aeration using successive cycle tests ji et al 2020a 2020b they attributed the main n p removal mechanisms to microbial assimilation these previous works show that the activities of functional bacteria including de nitrifiers and paos are weakened in this aeration free granule system de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 pointed out that functional bacteria can maintain highly efficient nutrient removal performance and play critical roles in granules formation and stability thus good coordination between microalgae phototrophs and functional bacteria can favor the sustainable operation and maintenance o m of algal bacterial ags systems abouhend et al 2018 noticed photosynthetic o2 supported nitrification in an algal bacterial ags system treating the primary effluent from a wwtp under aeration free conditions in which efficient n removal was realized via nitrification and denitrification however little information is available on the sufficiency of photosynthetic o2 to facilitate paos for p removal or both nitrifiers and paos targeting stably high nutrient removal efficiency in the photosynthetic o2 supported algal bacterial ags system the growth of phototrophs can impact two critical parameters namely dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph that are closely associated with the activities of functional bacteria under uncontrolled conditions therefore this study was designed to coordinate microalgae phototrophs with functional bacteria for simultaneously high efficiencies of n p removals and c fixation in algal bacterial ags by adopting the following strategies 1 ph control for enhanced growth of the functional bacteria 2 do control to eliminate adverse impacts of high do concentration on phototrophs and functional bacteria for reduced light energy consumption and 3 a shorter oxic phase to promote simultaneous nitrification and denitrification for improved n removal and reduced energy consumption in this study batch cycle tests mass balance analysis and microbial communities analysis were also conducted to shed light on the mechanisms involved in c n p removal and the c and o2 mass exchanges between microalgae phototrophs and bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup of photo sbr the experimental photo sbr was a glass beaker as one japan with a working volume of 1 0 l 10 4 cm in inner diameter and 15 1 cm in height two led lights nlss20c nikki japan were placed opposite at the right and left sides to provide a photon flux density of about 480 µmol s 1 m 2 about 28 klx at the beaker wall an overhead stirrer os20 s dlab china was operated at 150 rpm to ensure the mature granules in suspension in the beaker during the anaerobic and oxic phases a ph controller nph 6900 nissin rika japan was used to monitor and control the bulk ph by automatically adding 0 5 mol l hcl when the bulk ph rose above the setpoint ph the bulk do concentration was also monitored and or controlled by a do controller hi8410 hanna instruments usa connected to the two led lights that were automatically switched on or off at the do level below or above the set range 2 2 operation of the photo sbr in a pre experiment the impact of atmospheric o2 on aerobic p uptake and nitrification was evaluated using this open photo sbr under the same operating conditions described in section 2 1 the do concentration remained below 0 1 mg l after a one hour anaerobic phase the concentrations of p and nh4 n were detected almost unchanged during a subsequent three hour test period under no illumination and mechanical aeration air bubbling these results indicate that atmospheric o2 had minimal influence on this open system under the operational conditions applied as shown in table 1 the whole study comprised three stages during stage ⅰ according to the nutrient removal profiles from a pre experiment the open photo sbr was operated at a 4 h cycle consisting of 50 min anaerobic phase including 5 min feeding 170 min illumination phase oxic phase 3 min settling 5 min discharging and 12 min idling among them anaerobic oxic and idling durations were set to allow completely anaerobic p release aerobic nh4 n and p removal and residual o2 removal respectively the bulk ph was controlled at 8 0 during the illumination period facilitating the activities of paos and nitrifiers li et al 2022 do was monitored but not controlled during stage ⅰ and the volumetric exchange ratio ver was controlled at 50 hrt 8 h during stage ⅱ a feedback loop phototrophs light o2 do controller light phototrophs was constructed through the do controller to stabilize the growth of phototrophic organisms and reduce input illumination energy consumption the led lights were switched on via the do controller at do 3 mg l which were switched off at do 4 mg l during the illumination phase during stage ⅲ under the controlled bulk ph and do concentration conditions the cycle time was optimized for a higher wastewater treatment efficiency and capacity in which the oxic and idling periods were decreased to 115 min and 7 min respectively leading to a shorter cycle time of 3 h hrt 6 h with the other operational parameters being unchanged the solid retention time srt was not controlled in this study estimated as 28 10 or 14 days during stages ⅰ ⅱ or ⅲ respectively according to the discharged effluent biomass and sampled sludge for analysis averagely 10 ml d it was worth mentioning that the operation of algal bacterial ags was not stopped after the experiments in this study because this proposed system was then used to examine other impact factors and some interesting phenomena to better its design and sustainable operation the seed algal bacterial ags was sampled from a mother photo sbr treating synthetic domestic wastewater which has been stably operated for 3 years in the laboratory the synthetic wastewater ph 7 4 was prepared with tap water and chemicals as previously wang et al 2021 during the whole test period the average concentrations of the primary influent nutrients and ions were as follows dissolved organic carbon doc with ch3coona as the sole organic carbon 91 05 4 22 mg l dissolved inorganic carbon dic 27 19 1 65 mg l total p tp kh2po4 4 77 0 18 mg l total n tn nh4cl 30 57 1 63 mg l k 11 74 1 09 mg l mg2 11 43 0 36 mg l ca2 22 89 0 69 mg l na 158 30 5 00 mg l

check the reactor performance with average values being reported in addition a 1 1 v v mixture solution of influent synthetic wastewater and effluent from the previous cycle was used as the sample at zero min during the cycle tests 2 3 2 batch tests in the batch tests aeration instead of photosynthetic o2 to maintain do concentration at 3 4 mg l was performed to illuminate the role of phototrophic organisms the lights were switched off during the oxic phase but an air pump aerated the bulk liquor at a low aeration rate of 0 3 l min other parameters including stirring were the same as the cycle tests in section 2 3 1 2 3 3 mass balance analysis of c n and p in order to analyze the fates of influent c n and p mass balance analysis was performed during the stable operation from days 31 to 43 during this period the sampled effluents were centrifuged the liquid was used to analyze soluble c n p concentrations and the solid was collected and stored at 18 c for further quantification of c n p contents in the effluent biomass in addition the granular c n p contents were also quantified from the sampled granules the released c and n were calculated by subtracting c and n in the liquid and solid portions from the total input c and n amounts 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 calculations the calculations of 1 total emitted c or n mg g mlvss d and assimilated c or n in biomass mg g mlvss d 2 the molar ratios of δp δc δk δp δmg δp or δca δp for estimation of paos activity acevedo et al 2012 3 p release or uptake rates mg g mlvss h and 4 nitrification efficiency were described in detail in the supplementary material 2 4 2 statistical analysis paired samples t test was adopted to analyze the statistical difference of datum using ibm spss statistics 27 p 0 05 was assumed as statistically significant difference the linear correction coefficient was also calculated 2 5 analytical methods mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 the pigment contents including chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b and carotenoids were extracted by using the methanol method and quantified according to pancha et al 2014 the concentrations of acetate po4 3 no2 and no3 cl na nh4 k mg2 and ca2 in the liquid were quantified by ion chromatography shimadzu japan after samples being filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters wang et al 2021 total p and n in liquid were measured with the standard methods apha 2012 after the samples were completely oxidized with persulfate dissolved total carbon dtc solid tc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc in the liquid were measured by the toc detector toc vcsn shimadzu japan equipped with an autosampler asi v shimadzu japan and a solid sample combustion unit ssm 5000a shimadzu japan the total n tn in solid was determined by an elemental analyzer unicube elementar germany the extraction and determination of total phosphorus tp apatite phosphorus ap and non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip were performed according to a previous study wang et al 2021 the extracellular polymeric substances eps were quantified after being extracted from the mixed suspended granules with a heating method following the same procedures wang et al 2021 after being crushed and centrifuged the liquid was used for the analysis of loosely bound eps and the residual sludge was re suspended and treated at 80 c for 30 min for quantification of tightly bound eps granular morphology and size were recorded by microscope leica m205 c leica microsystems switzerland and analyzed by imagej 1 53a the lab aid824s dna extraction kit zeesan extracted total dna from freeze dried sludge samples a 2 step tailed pcr method was used to amplify 16s rrna and 18s rrna gene fragments from the extracted dna using primers of 338f 806r and 1422f 1642r respectively the verified amplicons were subjected to paired end sequencing on the illumina miseq sequencing platform at bioengineering lab co ltd japan the raw reads have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number prjna957041 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in granule properties 3 1 1 biomass concentration pigments and eps the results shown in fig 1 a indicate a rapid increase in mlvss from 5 1 0 1 g l on day 1 to 7 1 0 1 g l on day 7 during stage ⅰ accompanied by a corresponding increase in chl a content from 5 3 0 1 to 7 4 0 5 mg g mlvss fig 1b during stage ⅱ however the mlvss decreased to 5 1 0 4 g l fig 1a in contrast the chl a content continued to increase to 12 0 0 4 mg g mlvss on day 13 fig 1b probably due to high effluent biomass and decreased inhibition of controlled do on the growth of phototrophic organisms in stage ⅲ both mlss and mlvss showed an upward trend while the effluent biomass decreased and then remained stable achieving a biomass yield of about 0 64 g mlvss g cod during the last 12 days despite the reduced illumination time as a result of the shortened cycle time and controlled do a high chl a content of 11 1 0 9 mg g mlvss was maintained fig 1b this content is significantly higher than those of algal bacterial ags developed under mechanical aeration conditions he et al 2018a wang et al 2022 but close to those of algal bacterial ags developed under non aeration conditions ji and liu 2022 wang j et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 additionally the trend in chl b content was similar to that of chl a fig 1b while the carotenoid content showed a slight increase during stages ⅰ and ⅱ and decreased during stage ⅲ fig 1b this observation may suggest no photoinhibition to phototrophic organisms in this system as a high carotenoid content with low chl a content is generally considered a sign of photoinhibition sousa et al 2013 the variation of eps and their components polysaccharides ps and proteins pn are associated with the changes in granular stability both ps and pn contents decreased during stage ⅰ however they gradually increased during stage ⅱ fig s1 which may imply that the granular stability deteriorated to some extent during stage ⅰ while recovered during stage ⅱ in agreement with the variations of effluent biomass concentration fig 1a 3 1 2 granule morphology the seed algal bacterial ags was nearly spherical with a compact structure and smooth surface entangled with green microalgae and surrounded by some filamentous organisms fig s2 the average diameter of seed granules was 1 24 0 59 mm and about 44 were smaller than 1 00 mm along with the operation the granules became more brushy with more significant amounts of green matter which was also indicated by the increment of chl a content on day 31 some brown matter appeared and intertwined with the filamentous organisms which promoted the growth of some small new granules increasing the percentage of granules with a diameter of 1 00 mm the newly grown granules were cylindrical different from the spherical granules sampled from the mother photo sbr probably due to the stirring operation 3 1 3 microbial community fig 2 shows that the relative abundances of major functional bacteria kept well during the test period in this photo sbr nitrosomonadaceae 1 2 and nitrospiraceae 9 10 the frequently reported ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob he et al 2018b remained relatively stable during the entire period suggesting a stable nitrification process the genera paracoccus and pseudomonas as typical denitrifying bacteria were detected but presented a low relative abundance of 0 04 in this system thus the enriched zoogloea and acinetobacter possibly contributed to denitrification rajta et al 2020 the typical paos like the genus candidatus accumulibacter oehmen et al 2007 were also detected at a relative abundance of 3 4 these data imply the stable nutrient removal performance by the functional bacteria the identified eukaryotic microalgae were class trebouxiophyceae but their relative abundance decreased from 7 on day 1 to 4 on day 43 fig 2d thus the increased chl a b and carotenoid contents fig 1b were probably attributable to the growth of photosynthetic bacteria including genera arthronema leptolyngbya rhodobacter and oscillochloris fig 2c besides the genera arthronema and leptolyngbya of cyanobacteria the genus thiothrix of proteobacteria possibly contributed to the filamentous structure of algal bacterial granules 3 2 changes of do and ph and their control strategies during the operation of stage ⅰ a significant amount of photosynthetic o2 production was detected during the illumination phase figs 1c and s3a which is sufficient for both aerobic p uptake and nitrification the do profile was characterized as three steps during the light on period of stage ⅰ 1 do concentration rapidly rose after initializing the illumination step 1 2 do reached a stable concentration step 2 during which the generated o2 was consumed by aerobic p uptake nitrification and or other aerobic reactions as discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 please note that the do concentration was elevated by 1 3 mg l along with the operation fig s3a possibly resulting from the increased chl a content and 3 at step 3 the do concentration linearly increased to a level up to supersaturation in this step the photosynthetic o2 was much more than the o2 consumption needed by the system such a too high do concentration may affect p uptake by paos carvalheira et al 2014 and n removal by denitrifiers mosquera corral et al 2005 thus the do concentration in the subsequent oxic phases during stages ⅱ and ⅲ was controlled at 3 4 mg l via the do controller and led lights on off which was set slightly higher than the stable do concentration step 2 at the end of stage ⅰ as a higher do concentration may allow phototrophic organisms to fix more inorganic c during stages ⅱ and ⅲ the do concentration increased faster to the set do range 3 4 mg l in step 1 fig s3a than in stage ⅰ due to their higher chl a contents with adequate do control some balance might be established among chl a content do concentration and illumination as such the increased chl a content promotes photosynthetic o2 production to increase do the rapid increase of do activates the do controller to switch off the led lights limiting the phototrophs growth increase in chl a content this resulted in a relatively stable chl a content during stage ⅲ fig 1b during the anaerobic phase the ph slightly decreased fig 1d probably due to the combined effects of influent wastewater and anaerobic decomposition once the illumination was initiated the ph linearly rose to the controlling point of 8 0 due to co2 consumption by photosynthesis during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the time needed for ph rising to the setpoint ph 8 0 were gradually shortened fig 1d owing to the increased phototrophs growth indicated by chl a content during stage ⅲ the principal ph rise was completed in 30 min attributable to the granules relatively stable and high chl a content fig 1b and d then the ph gradually decreased with do fluctuations after reaching the set do in this proposed system the illumination phase is dominated by three biological reactions photosynthesis by phototrophs aerobic p removal by paos and de nitrification by de nitrifiers respectively fig 2 for simplicity microbial assimilation was not taken into consideration in these bioreactions the following reactions 1 4 summarize the major biological processes as described by gerardi 2002 and smolders et al 1995 1 p h o t o s y n t h e s i s c o 2 h 2 o c h 2 o o 2 2 p u p t a k e 0 87 c h 1 5 o 0 5 o 2 3 23 h 3 p o 4 3 23 h p o 3 0 87 c o 2 3 87 h 2 o 3 n i t r i f i c a t i o n 0 5 n h 4 o 2 0 5 n o 3 h 0 5 h 2 o 4 d

increasing processes seen from the above reactions one mmol co2 corresponds to one mmol o2 production during photosynthesis one mmol o2 utilized by nitrifiers can generate one mmol h or 0 87 mmol co2 by paos if all the produced no3 is denitrified one mmol o2 consumed would produce 0 50 mmol h and 0 63 mmol co2 in this reaction the contribution of produced protons is much more significant than co2 considering the very low dissociation constant of carbonic acid pka1 6 37 25 c therefore the decrease in ph is mainly attributable to nitrogen removal during the illumination phase restated in the present photo sbr system the increased ph by photosynthesis based on the unit o2 produced was lower than the decreased ph by nutrient removal based on the unit o2 utilized as such if the ph controller controlled the led lights to maintain liquid ph the do increase by photosynthesis based on a unit ph elevated will be higher than the do decrease by nutrients removal based on a unit ph decreased which has been supported by an increasing do concentration during the oxic phase data not shown 3 3 c removal 3 3 1 changes in c species and their removal the photo sbr system demonstrated an excellent and stable doc removal efficiency of 90 3 during the entire test period fig 3 a the average effluent doc was 8 95 2 78 mg l close to the effluents from bacterial or algal bacteria ags systems zhao et al 2018 this observation is attributable to the dissolved organic substances excreted by the coexisting microalgae and or bacteria since the sole organic carbon sodium acetate was almost completely removed within the initial 30 min during the anaerobic phase figs 3c and s4a during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the effluent dic concentration remained low at 17 44 3 56 mg l lower than the influent dic concentration when the illumination duration was shortened during stage ⅲ the effluent dic concentration slightly increased very close to the influent dic suggesting less contribution of phototrophic organisms to the dic removal under the mechanical aeration operation an insignificant increase of dic was detected fig 3d in which dic from acetate degradation may be stripped into the air by aeration operation in the photosynthetic o2 condition the dic concentration decreased during the illumination period fig 3c demonstrating the great potential of the algal bacterial ags system for ghgs emission reduction 3 3 2 c assimilation and co2 emission reduction as expected the tc content in granules increased from 405 7 mg g mlvss on day 1 to 460 3 mg g mlvss on day 43 the average c assimilation rate was 35 03 mg g mlvss d during the last 12 days table 2 to estimate the contribution of phototrophs to c fixation in the algal bacterial ags an empirically stoichiometric formula of ch1 78 o0 36n0 12p0 01 boelee et al 2014 for phototrophs and a ratio of 56 31 mg mlvss mg chl a samiotis et al 2021 were used as shown in table 2 the contribution of phototrophic organisms to c sequestration was about 23 28 mg g mlvss d with a co2 fixation capacity of 85 36 mg co2 g mlvss d which accounted for about 66 of total c assimilation by the algal bacterial ags the co2 emission from this algal bacterial granule system was only 0 25 kg co2 kg cod without consideration of other direct and indirect co2 emissions much lower than 0 58 0 68 0 76 and 0 97 kg co2 kg cod from the four full scale a2o ao oxidation ditch and sbr based wwtps bao et al 2015 indicating its great potential of reducing ghgs emission it was estimated that 14 of input dtc was released while the biomass assimilated 52 of input dtc in this study the contribution of phototrophic organisms to c fixation was limited due to the short illumination duration of 80 104 min under the do control strategy applied in order to achieve more reduction of co2 emission from this photo sbr the do control range is a crucial factor which needs more in depth studies 3 4 n removal 3 4 1 n removal and nitrification efficiency as shown in fig 4 effective n removal was achieved through the photosynthetic o2 supply the effluent tn concentrations rapidly decreased during stage ⅰ and kept relatively stable during stage ⅱ possibly associated with the relatively low do concentration compared to the near saturated do concentration in the mother photo sbr the effluent no3 n concentration followed the trend of the effluent tn while the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were negligible during these two stages as a result the tn removal efficiency was increased from 62 on day 1 to 79 2 during stage ⅱ with nh4 n removal of nearly 100 during stages ⅰ and ⅱ an interesting phenomenon was observed when the illumination duration was shortened during stage ⅲ the photo sbr experienced a deterioration period and then recovery of n removal the effluent nh4 n concentration increased first and then decreased while the effluent no3 n concentration decreased first and remained low in addition the effluent no2 n concentration slightly increased as such the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped to 77 on day 27 and then recovered to nearly 100 while tn removal efficiency kept at 81 7 during stage ⅲ a competitive nh4 n removal rate was obtained during the entire test period fig 3b averagely 1 25 0 30 mg g mlvss h much higher than 0 89 0 05 mg g mlvss h of a bacterial ags system under an aerobic oxic anoxic mode he et al 2016 on the other hand the nitrification efficiency was almost halved from 68 to 35 during stage ⅰ it remained at 36 2 and 20 12 respectively during stages ⅱ and ⅲ significantly lower than 80 by the mother photo sbr considering the relatively stable tn removal efficiency it can be inferred that more n might be emitted and or assimilated in the biomass during the operation 3 4 2 main contributors to n removal as illustrated in the cycle tests fig 5 a and b nh4 n removal was rapidly initiated once the led lights switched on while no3 n was correspondingly produced during stages ⅰ and ⅱ in stage ⅰ n removal was completed in 2 h illumination in correspondence with the stable do concentration step 2 in fig 1c the above results indicated a photosynthetic o2 driving aerobic nitrification process which was evidenced by the stable aob and nob abundance in granules fig 2 on the other hand the generated no3 n and low no2 n production cannot cover the decreased amount of nh4 n what is more the effluent no3 n decreased with the operation such an increasing n loss may imply its complex n removal pathways including microbial assimilation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification anammox and or ammonia precipitation such as struvite formation the tn content in the seed granules was about 92 0 mg g mlvss higher than 56 7 11 3 mg g in the activated sludge chen et al 2021 used for the initial seed sludge for granulation in the mother photo sbr in addition the granular n content did not increase with the increase in chl a content which was about 88 4 mg g mlvss on day 31 and 91 4 mg g mlvss on day 43 according to the n balance analysis table 2 approximately 44 of input n was assimilated in biomass compared to the maximum 20 by seed granules in the mother photo sbr from their nitrification efficiency this significant difference is attributable to the enhanced assimilation by phototrophic bacteria indicated by the increased chl a content fig 1b and enriched arthronema leptolyngbya rhodobacter and oscillochloris fig 2c the n assimilation rate was about 7 55 mg n g mlvss d in this study lower than 11 37 mg n g mlvss d by activated sludge with enriched nitrogen fixing bacteria treating thermomechanical pulping wastewater slade et al 2003 the n assimilation rate of phototrophs was estimated as 3 26 mg n g mlvss d table 2 indicating that bacteria in this system contributed about half of n assimilation as illustrated in fig 5d the photosynthetic o2 can help remove n faster with a higher n removal efficiency when compared to the mechanical aeration suggesting less contribution of nitrifiers to n removal in this algal bacterial ags system however a similar nitrification efficiency of 14 was observed under the two o2 supply strategies implying that the n species assimilated by phototrophs include both nh4 n and no3 n since whichever n species was utilized alone by phototrophs would contribute to their difference in nitrification efficiency fig 5d simultaneous nitrification and denitrification are considered other competitive contributors to n removal since about 42 of input n was emitted from the system according to the n balance analysis although a low no2 n and no3 n during nh4 n removal process may imply the possibility of shortcut denitrification during stage ⅲ the enriched nitrospiraceae directly indicated a stable nitrite oxidizing process therefore shortcut denitrification is not considered a major n emission pathway the low do concentration increasing granular size fig s2 and short oxic time may favor denitrification in the ags systems abouhend et al 2023 he et al 2018b mosquera corral et al 2005 probably accounting for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in the present system on the other hand the doc concentrations during the illumination phase were statistically p 0 05 higher than those under the mechanical aeration condition fig 3c and d which may be utilized as carbon sources to some extent thus the relatively high phototroph content and the photosynthetically produced doc or organic matter may favor simultaneous nitrification and denitrification it is worth mentioning that the removal of nh4 n by ammonia precipitation struvite was excluded since struvite is unsaturated under the low ph value 8 0 estimated by visual minteq 3 1 software on the other hand during the nh4 n removal process the set do range of 3 4 mg l still maintained an oxic condition with almost no no2 accumulation fig 5 in addition the typical anammox bacteria such as genera brocadia kuenenia anammoxoglobus jettenia and scalindua were not detected in the granules fig 2 the anammox process is thus not considered as the primary n removal pathway in this study 3 5 p removal 3 5 1 p removal efficiency and removal rate a highly efficient p removal was achieved through photosynthetic o2 production that supports aerobic p uptake during stage ⅰ the tp removal efficiency rapidly increased from 42 on day 1 to 98 on day 7 fig 6 a indicating that the algal bacterial ags quickly adapted to the new environment under the adopted ph control strategy the controlled do and shortened illumination time also showed little adverse impact on tp removal efficiency which remained at 97 2 and 92 8 during stages ⅱ and ⅲ respectively the p release and uptake functioned well during the test period fig 6b and fig s4b the p uptake process was completed within 2 h illumination during stages ⅱ and ⅲ corresponding to the stable do concentration step 2 in fig 1c during this period the o2 generated by phototrophic organisms was used for aerobic p uptake and nitrification the p release rate of the seed granules was about 27 57 mg g mlvss h much higher than 2 87 0 29 mg g mlss h from the bacterial ags he et al 2016 and 16 24 0 91 mg g mlvss h from the algal bacterial ags system under no ph control li et al 2022 during stage ⅰ the p release rate decreased quickly to 16 55 mg g mlvss h on day 7 accompanied by the decrease of maximum p release this decreasing trend continued during stage ⅱ with a lower decrease rate till day 25 fig 6b finally the p release rate remained around 10 84 0 41 mg g mlvss h during the subsequent operation during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the growth of phototrophic bacteria and higher effluent biomass figs 1a and 2 possibly led to the low granular polyp content that accounts for the decrease in p release rate this deduction is partially evidenced by the decrease in granular naip content fig 7 d in contrast the variation of p uptake rate was insignificant averagely 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h during the entire test period li et al 2022 pointed out that aerobic p uptake is limited by intra particle diffusion including macropore and micropore diffusion in the algal bacterial ags luo et al 2014 claimed that flocculent sludge had a higher surface area than ags according to the morphological changes of the algal bacterial ags fig s2 the granules became more significant with more filamentous matter attached along with the operation this morphological change may increase granular surface area and improve intra particle diffusion limitation maintaining the stable granular p uptake rate under the controlled do ph operation conditions 3 5 2 p removal pathway all the plots of δp against δc achieved high linear correlation coefficients r2 fig 7a similar to the changes in p release rate the molar δp δc ratio significantly decreased during stages ⅰ and ⅱ implying the decreased paos activity in the granules acevedo et al 2012 during stage ⅲ the molar δp δc ratio was 0 36 0 03 lower than 0 48 0 80 for paos enriched cultures but much higher than 0 0 02 for gaos enriched cultures acevedo et al 2012 meanwhile the genus candidatus accumulibacter of paos slightly decreased from 4 on day 1 to 3 on day 43 fig 2 this observation suggests that the paos primarily contributing to p removal were still active in the present study k and mg2 as the counterions of po4 3 are known to participate in anaerobic hydrolysis and aerobic synthesis of polyp at an assumed stoichiometry of k0 33mg0 33po3 n the increase in phototrophs abundance may change their quantitative relationship from the cycle tests the molar δk δp and δmg δp ratios were relatively stable fig 7b averagely 0 23 0 02 and 0 28 0 03 lower than the theoretical value of 0 33 this observation may support p assimilation by phototrophic organisms that result in low δk δp and δmg δp ratios according to the tp removal efficiency and the assumed stoichiometry of polyp the maximum contributions of paos to k and mg2 reduction can be up to 7 and 4 respectively the latter estimation is close to the measured mg2 reduction about 4 2 except on day 1 fig 7b but the former significantly deviated from the measured k reduction 24 11 except on day 1 such a deviation is probably associated with active assimilation by phototrophic organisms that require more k which needs further confirmation in the case of ca2 besides the low ph condition its negligible reduction in concentration may exclude ca p precipitation from the p removal pathway fig 7c presents the apparent advantage of the photosynthetic o2 on p removal compared to the mechanical aeration due to a higher p uptake rate detected in the former however similar molar ratios under the two o2 supply strategies did not support the phototrophs p assimilation a previous study found that microalgal p assimilation during aerobic p uptake from the liquid was negligible in the algal bacterial ags system p for microalgae growth was from the solid granules instead of the liquid li et al 2022 generally p assimilation by phototrophs requires a long hrt the adopted short hrt of 6 h during stage ⅲ in the present study may not highlight the contribution of assimilation as shown in table 2 according to the estimated contribution 0 60 mg g mlss d of phototrophs to p assimilation namely 0 1 mg g mlss is required for each cycle this value is significantly lower than the anaerobically released p 5 9 1 1 mg g mlss based on mlss concentration during the last 12 days operation this study determined the p assimilation rate as 2 08 mg g mlss d mainly attributable to paos as noted in table 2 the measured output tp cannot cover the input tp probably due to tp dissolution from the effluent biomass during the collection and storage stages for final determination 3 6 energy consumption and implications the energy requirement by the biological treatment especially the aeration unit generally accounts for 50 70 of the total operating costs in wwtps vergara araya et al 2021 according to the ideal mixing energy requirement of 1 5 w m3 and the mixing energy of 5 w m3 in an example wwtp vergara araya et al 2021 the energy consumption for only mixing applied in this study was about 5 75 wh m3 during the oxic phase significantly lower than 180 800 wh m3 for the commonly mechanical aeration operation silva and rosa 2021 this observation implies that only mixing instead of mechanical aeration to suspend algal bacterial granules is economically feasible however the energy consumption by stirring should be carefully re examined when the reactor system is scaled up since the energy consumption may not increase linearly with the increase in system treatment capacity on the other hand a high electricity consumption of 36 73 kwh m3 for the led lights is required supplementary material which can be replaced by natural sunlight and designed correspondingly in the followed up research works the algal bacterial ags system is promising for c fixation and co2 emission reduction from wwtps which successfully assimilated 52 of the total input c the fixed c estimated by the assumed formula of phototrophs table 2 can be used to produce a maximum 55 mg o2 per cycle enough to complete the high o2 requirement by the nitrification process 35 mg o2 assimilated n was not counted and aerobic p uptake process 15 mg o2 according to eqs 2 and 3 and nutrient removal performance this observation indicates that a higher c fixation could be achieved when treating wastewater with a higher nh4 n concentration that requires more o2 in addition the do control by switching on off the light reduces illumination time from 115 min to 80 104 min saving 10 30 of light energy requirement as noted compared to the energy intensive mechanical aeration the photosynthetic o2 is more efficient for nutrients removal as the o2 molecules generated by the coexisting microalgae inside or on the granule surface may avoid the resistance to gas diffusion and transfer from the gas phase to liquid phase and then into the granules 4 conclusions the feasibility of using photosynthetic o2 from phototrophic organisms for simultaneous aerobic nitrification and p uptake by paos in an algal bacterial ags system has been demonstrated the energy consumption of 5 75 wh m3 for mixing required only for the proposed system is more economical than that of mechanical aeration commonly used for ags systems although the additional illumination cost by artificial lights was relatively high in this study the do control strategy involving switching the lights on and off could reduce light energy consumption by 10 30 in a short hrt of 6 h the coexisting phototrophic organisms in algal bacterial ags could photosynthesize enough o2 production to implement nitrification and aerobic p uptake the system achieved a highly efficient tn removal of 81 7 with an n assimilation rate of 7 55 mg g mlvss d mainly due to microbial assimilation and simultaneous nitrification denitrification under the test conditions in the proposed ph do controlled algal bacterial ags system paos dominated p removal process and exhibited high activity as indicated by a high p release rate of 10 84 0 41 mg g mlvss h p uptake rate of 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h and a molar δp δc ratio of 0 36 0 03 resulting in tp removal greater than 92 considering the scale up and better o m of the proposed algal bacterial ags system a more in depth research is demanded c n p assimilation and removal mechanisms contributions of microalgae phototrophs and bacteria light system design the sensitivity of co2 emission to do ph control range and influence of influent characteristics should be further explored during the long term operation

14800,reducing co2 emission and energy consumption is crucial for the sustainable management of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this study an algal bacterial aerobic granular sludge ags system was developed for efficient carbon c assimilation and nitrogen n phosphorus p removal without the need for mechanical aeration the photosynthetic o2 production by phototrophic organisms maintained the dissolved oxygen do level at 3 4 mg l in the bulk liquid and an led light control system reduced 10 30 of light energy consumption results showed that the biomass assimilated 52 of input dissolved total carbon dtc and the produced o2 simultaneously facilitated aerobic nitrification and p uptake with the coexisting phototrophs serving as a c fixer and o2 supplier this resulted in a stably high total n removal of 81 7 and an n assimilation rate of 7 55 mg g mlvss d with enhanced microbial assimilation and simultaneous nitrification denitrification good p removal of 92 98 was maintained during the test period at a molar p c ratio of 0 36 0 03 and high p release and uptake rates of 10 84 0 41 and 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h respectively photosynthetic o2 was more advantageous for n and p removal than mechanical aeration this proposed system can contribute to a better design and sustainable operation of wwtps using algal bacterial ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bacterial aerobic granular sludge carbon fixation nitrogen assimilation photosynthetic oxygen simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global wastewater generation is estimated at 359 4 billion m3 annually with only 53 receiving adequate treatment jones et al 2021 the substantial volume of wastewater production and its associated environmental impacts drive the need for sustainable development of wastewater treatment plants wwtps aeration is these plants most energy intensive treatment unit with energy consumption ranging between 0 27 and 1 89 kwh m3 in conventional activated sludge cas based wwtps vergara araya et al 2021 additionally wwtps have been identified as a significant contributor to greenhouse gasses ghgs emission mainly co2 from electricity consumption and biological processes campos et al 2016 larsen 2015 as a result reducing co2 emission and energy consumption in wwtps has become a subject of increased attention bacterial aerobic granular sludge ags has become a popular option for wastewater treatment because of its compact structure efficient settling and high biomass retention which can reduce operating costs and energy consumption de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 it has been applied in over 90 wwtps in 20 countries nereda 2023 however it is worth noting that the application of ags does not necessarily reduce co2 emission from biological processes additionally sequencing batch reactors sbrs commonly used for ags cultivation and operation adav et al 2008 de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 can contribute to a higher direct co2 emission compared to other processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o anoxic oxic a o and oxidation ditch bao et al 2015 cultivation of phototrophic organisms including microalgae and cyanobacteria using wastewater can provide a promising way to fix carbon c in wwtps phototrophic organisms can fix co2 and produce high value added biomass during the biological processes reducing net co2 emission simultaneously the photosynthetic o2 can help microbes decompose organics remove nutrients and substantially reduce electricity consumption required by aeration in biological wwtps gonçalves et al 2017 muñoz and guieysse 2006 unlike the big granule size of ags the tiny structure of phototrophic organisms especially microalgae leads to a low biomass settleability and a high energy requirement for biomass separation and harvesting gonçalves et al 2017 wang q et al 2020 in addition the cultivation of phototrophic organisms for nutrients removal requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 6 days muñoz and guieysse 2006 resulting in lower efficiencies when compared to nitrogen n removal by nitrifiers denitrifiers and phosphorus p removal by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in conventional biological wwtps more recently the newly developed algal bacterial ags has attracted much attention due to its great potential for reduction in co2 emission and energy consumption since it combines the excellent properties of microalgae and or phototrophic organisms and bacterial ags abouhend et al 2018 ji et al 2020a wang j et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 at its early stage the algal bacterial ags were developed in sbrs with mechanical aeration huang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 beneficial for granulation and stable granules maintenance nevertheless the stripping effect of bubbling aeration operation may remove the inorganic c available for microalgae growth and the photosynthetic o2 for aerobic bacteria li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore the open airlift reactors may not fulfill this new granule system s and coexisting microalgae s potential currently several studies have attempted to develop aeration free algal bacterial ags systems where phototrophs fix inorganic c to produce o2 for organics and nutrient removal targeting the maximum effects of phototrophic organisms on c fixation and energy saving zhao et al 2019 detected excellent c n removal performance by the algal bacterial ags in shaking photo reactors without mechanical aeration wang j et al 2020 achieved efficient c p removal from a photosynthetic o2 supported and closed photo sbr with algal bacterial ags naturally developed from bacterial ags ji and co workers investigated n p removal pathways in the algal bacterial ags system under non aeration using successive cycle tests ji et al 2020a 2020b they attributed the main n p removal mechanisms to microbial assimilation these previous works show that the activities of functional bacteria including de nitrifiers and paos are weakened in this aeration free granule system de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 pointed out that functional bacteria can maintain highly efficient nutrient removal performance and play critical roles in granules formation and stability thus good coordination between microalgae phototrophs and functional bacteria can favor the sustainable operation and maintenance o m of algal bacterial ags systems abouhend et al 2018 noticed photosynthetic o2 supported nitrification in an algal bacterial ags system treating the primary effluent from a wwtp under aeration free conditions in which efficient n removal was realized via nitrification and denitrification however little information is available on the sufficiency of photosynthetic o2 to facilitate paos for p removal or both nitrifiers and paos targeting stably high nutrient removal efficiency in the photosynthetic o2 supported algal bacterial ags system the growth of phototrophs can impact two critical parameters namely dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph that are closely associated with the activities of functional bacteria under uncontrolled conditions therefore this study was designed to coordinate microalgae phototrophs with functional bacteria for simultaneously high efficiencies of n p removals and c fixation in algal bacterial ags by adopting the following strategies 1 ph control for enhanced growth of the functional bacteria 2 do control to eliminate adverse impacts of high do concentration on phototrophs and functional bacteria for reduced light energy consumption and 3 a shorter oxic phase to promote simultaneous nitrification and denitrification for improved n removal and reduced energy consumption in this study batch cycle tests mass balance analysis and microbial communities analysis were also conducted to shed light on the mechanisms involved in c n p removal and the c and o2 mass exchanges between microalgae phototrophs and bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup of photo sbr the experimental photo sbr was a glass beaker as one japan with a working volume of 1 0 l 10 4 cm in inner diameter and 15 1 cm in height two led lights nlss20c nikki japan were placed opposite at the right and left sides to provide a photon flux density of about 480 µmol s 1 m 2 about 28 klx at the beaker wall an overhead stirrer os20 s dlab china was operated at 150 rpm to ensure the mature granules in suspension in the beaker during the anaerobic and oxic phases a ph controller nph 6900 nissin rika japan was used to monitor and control the bulk ph by automatically adding 0 5 mol l hcl when the bulk ph rose above the setpoint ph the bulk do concentration was also monitored and or controlled by a do controller hi8410 hanna instruments usa connected to the two led lights that were automatically switched on or off at the do level below or above the set range 2 2 operation of the photo sbr in a pre experiment the impact of atmospheric o2 on aerobic p uptake and nitrification was evaluated using this open photo sbr under the same operating conditions described in section 2 1 the do concentration remained below 0 1 mg l after a one hour anaerobic phase the concentrations of p and nh4 n were detected almost unchanged during a subsequent three hour test period under no illumination and mechanical aeration air bubbling these results indicate that atmospheric o2 had minimal influence on this open system under the operational conditions applied as shown in table 1 the whole study comprised three stages during stage ⅰ according to the nutrient removal profiles from a pre experiment the open photo sbr was operated at a 4 h cycle consisting of 50 min anaerobic phase including 5 min feeding 170 min illumination phase oxic phase 3 min settling 5 min discharging and 12 min idling among them anaerobic oxic and idling durations were set to allow completely anaerobic p release aerobic nh4 n and p removal and residual o2 removal respectively the bulk ph was controlled at 8 0 during the illumination period facilitating the activities of paos and nitrifiers li et al 2022 do was monitored but not controlled during stage ⅰ and the volumetric exchange ratio ver was controlled at 50 hrt 8 h during stage ⅱ a feedback loop phototrophs light o2 do controller light phototrophs was constructed through the do controller to stabilize the growth of phototrophic organisms and reduce input illumination energy consumption the led lights were switched on via the do controller at do 3 mg l which were switched off at do 4 mg l during the illumination phase during stage ⅲ under the controlled bulk ph and do concentration conditions the cycle time was optimized for a higher wastewater treatment efficiency and capacity in which the oxic and idling periods were decreased to 115 min and 7 min respectively leading to a shorter cycle time of 3 h hrt 6 h with the other operational parameters being unchanged the solid retention time srt was not controlled in this study estimated as 28 10 or 14 days during stages ⅰ ⅱ or ⅲ respectively according to the discharged effluent biomass and sampled sludge for analysis averagely 10 ml d it was worth mentioning that the operation of algal bacterial ags was not stopped after the experiments in this study because this proposed system was then used to examine other impact factors and some interesting phenomena to better its design and sustainable operation the seed algal bacterial ags was sampled from a mother photo sbr treating synthetic domestic wastewater which has been stably operated for 3 years in the laboratory the synthetic wastewater ph 7 4 was prepared with tap water and chemicals as previously wang et al 2021 during the whole test period the average concentrations of the primary influent nutrients and ions were as follows dissolved organic carbon doc with ch3coona as the sole organic carbon 91 05 4

check the reactor performance with average values being reported in addition a 1 1 v v mixture solution of influent synthetic wastewater and effluent from the previous cycle was used as the sample at zero min during the cycle tests 2 3 2 batch tests in the batch tests aeration instead of photosynthetic o2 to maintain do concentration at 3 4 mg l was performed to illuminate the role of phototrophic organisms the lights were switched off during the oxic phase but an air pump aerated the bulk liquor at a low aeration rate of 0 3 l min other parameters including stirring were the same as the cycle tests in section 2 3 1 2 3 3 mass balance analysis of c n and p in order to analyze the fates of influent c n and p mass balance analysis was performed during the stable operation from days 31 to 43 during this period the sampled effluents were centrifuged the liquid was used to analyze soluble c n p concentrations and the solid was collected and stored at 18 c for further quantification of c n p contents in the effluent biomass in addition the granular c n p contents were also quantified from the sampled granules the released c and n were calculated by subtracting c and n in the liquid and solid portions from the total input c and n amounts 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 calculations the calculations of 1 total emitted c or n mg g mlvss d and assimilated c or n in biomass mg g mlvss d 2 the molar ratios of δp δc δk δp δmg δp or δca δp for estimation of paos activity acevedo et al 2012 3 p release or uptake rates mg g mlvss h and 4 nitrification efficiency were described in detail in the supplementary material 2 4 2 statistical analysis paired samples t test was adopted to analyze the statistical difference of datum using ibm spss statistics 27 p 0 05 was assumed as statistically significant difference the linear correction coefficient was also calculated 2 5 analytical methods mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 the pigment contents including chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b and carotenoids were extracted by using the methanol method and quantified according to pancha et al 2014 the concentrations of acetate po4 3 no2 and no3 cl na nh4 k mg2 and ca2 in the liquid were quantified by ion chromatography shimadzu japan after samples being filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters wang et al 2021 total p and n in liquid were measured with the standard methods apha 2012 after the samples were completely oxidized with persulfate dissolved total carbon dtc solid tc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc in the liquid were measured by the toc detector toc vcsn shimadzu japan equipped with an autosampler asi v shimadzu japan and a solid sample combustion unit ssm 5000a shimadzu japan the total n tn in solid was determined by an elemental analyzer unicube elementar germany the extraction and determination of total phosphorus tp apatite phosphorus ap and non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip were performed according to a previous study wang et al 2021 the extracellular polymeric substances eps were quantified after being extracted from the mixed suspended granules with a heating method following the same procedures wang et al 2021 after being crushed and centrifuged the liquid was used for the analysis of loosely bound eps and the residual sludge was re suspended and treated at 80 c for 30 min for quantification of tightly bound eps granular morphology and size were recorded by microscope leica m205 c leica microsystems switzerland and analyzed by imagej 1 53a the lab aid824s dna extraction kit zeesan extracted total dna from freeze dried sludge samples a 2 step tailed pcr method was used to amplify 16s rrna and 18s rrna gene fragments from the extracted dna using primers of 338f 806r and 1422f 1642r respectively the verified amplicons were subjected to paired end sequencing on the illumina miseq sequencing platform at bioengineering lab co ltd japan the raw reads have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number prjna957041 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in granule properties 3 1 1 biomass concentration pigments and eps the results shown in fig 1 a indicate a rapid increase in mlvss from 5 1 0 1 g l on day 1 to 7 1 0 1 g l on day 7 during stage ⅰ accompanied by a corresponding increase in chl a content from 5 3 0 1 to 7 4 0 5 mg g mlvss fig 1b during stage ⅱ however the mlvss decreased to 5 1 0 4 g l fig 1a in contrast the chl a content continued to increase to 12 0 0 4 mg g mlvss on day 13 fig 1b probably due to high effluent biomass and decreased inhibition of controlled do on the growth of phototrophic organisms in stage ⅲ both mlss and mlvss showed an upward trend while the effluent biomass decreased and then remained stable achieving a biomass yield of about 0 64 g mlvss g cod during the last 12 days despite the reduced illumination time as a result of the shortened cycle time and controlled do a high chl a content of 11 1 0 9 mg g mlvss was maintained fig 1b this content is significantly higher than those of algal bacterial ags developed under mechanical aeration conditions he et al 2018a wang et al 2022 but close to those of algal bacterial ags developed under non aeration conditions ji and liu 2022 wang j et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 additionally the trend in chl b content was similar to that of chl a fig 1b while the carotenoid content showed a slight increase during stages ⅰ and ⅱ and decreased during stage ⅲ fig 1b this observation may suggest no photoinhibition to phototrophic organisms in this system as a high carotenoid content with low chl a content is generally considered a sign of photoinhibition sousa et al 2013 the variation of eps and their components polysaccharides ps and proteins pn are associated with the changes in granular stability both ps and pn contents decreased during stage ⅰ however they gradually increased during stage ⅱ fig s1 which may imply that the granular stability deteriorated to some extent during stage ⅰ while recovered during stage ⅱ in agreement with the variations of effluent biomass concentration fig 1a 3 1 2 granule morphology the seed algal bacterial ags was nearly spherical with a compact structure and smooth surface entangled with green microalgae and surrounded by some filamentous organisms fig s2 the average diameter of seed granules was 1 24 0 59 mm and about 44 were smaller than 1 00 mm along with the operation the granules became more brushy with more significant amounts of green matter which was also indicated by the increment of chl a content on day 31 some brown matter appeared and intertwined with the filamentous organisms which promoted the growth of some small new granules increasing the percentage of granules with a diameter of 1 00 mm the newly grown granules were cylindrical different from the spherical granules sampled from the mother photo sbr probably due to the stirring operation 3 1 3 microbial community fig 2 shows that the relative abundances of major functional bacteria kept well during the test period in this photo sbr nitrosomonadaceae 1 2 and nitrospiraceae 9 10 the frequently reported ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob he et al 2018b remained relatively stable during the entire period suggesting a stable nitrification process the genera paracoccus and pseudomonas as typical denitrifying bacteria were detected but presented a low relative abundance of 0 04 in this system thus the enriched zoogloea and acinetobacter possibly contributed to denitrification rajta et al 2020 the typical paos like the genus candidatus accumulibacter oehmen et al 2007 were also detected at a relative abundance of 3 4 these data imply the stable nutrient removal performance by the functional bacteria the identified eukaryotic microalgae were class trebouxiophyceae but their relative abundance decreased from 7 on day 1 to 4 on day 43 fig 2d thus the increased chl a b and carotenoid contents fig 1b were probably attributable to the growth of photosynthetic bacteria including genera arthronema leptolyngbya rhodobacter and oscillochloris fig 2c besides the genera arthronema and leptolyngbya of cyanobacteria the genus thiothrix of proteobacteria possibly contributed to the filamentous structure of algal bacterial granules 3 2 changes of do and ph and their control strategies during the operation of stage ⅰ a significant amount of photosynthetic o2 production was detected during the illumination phase figs 1c and s3a which is sufficient for both aerobic p uptake and nitrification the do profile was characterized as three steps during the light on period of stage ⅰ 1 do concentration rapidly rose after initializing the illumination step 1 2 do reached a stable concentration step 2 during which the generated o2 was consumed by aerobic p uptake nitrification and or other aerobic reactions as discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 please note that the do concentration was elevated by 1 3 mg l along with the operation fig s3a possibly resulting from the increased chl a content and 3 at step 3 the do concentration linearly increased to a level up to supersaturation in this step the photosynthetic o2 was much more than the o2 consumption needed by the system such a too high do concentration may affect p uptake by paos carvalheira et al 2014 and n removal by denitrifiers mosquera corral et al 2005 thus the do concentration in the subsequent oxic phases during stages ⅱ and ⅲ was controlled at 3 4 mg l via the do controller and led lights on off which was set slightly higher than the stable do concentration step 2 at the end of stage ⅰ as a higher do concentration may allow phototrophic organisms to fix more inorganic c during stages ⅱ and ⅲ the do concentration increased faster to the set do range 3 4 mg l in step 1 fig s3a than in stage ⅰ due to their higher chl a contents with adequate do control some balance might be established among chl a content do concentration and illumination as such the increased chl a content promotes photosynthetic o2 production to increase do the rapid increase of do activates the do controller to switch off the led lights limiting the phototrophs growth increase in chl a content this resulted in a relatively stable chl a content during stage ⅲ fig 1b during the anaerobic phase the ph slightly decreased fig 1d probably due to the combined effects of influent wastewater and anaerobic decomposition once the illumination was initiated the ph linearly rose to the controlling point of 8 0 due to co2 consumption by photosynthesis during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the time needed for ph rising to the setpoint ph 8 0 were gradually shortened fig 1d owing to the increased phototrophs growth indicated by chl a content during stage ⅲ the principal ph rise was completed in 30 min attributable to the granules relatively stable and high chl a content fig 1b and d then the ph gradually decreased with do fluctuations after reaching the set do in this proposed system the illumination phase is dominated by three biological reactions photosynthesis by phototrophs aerobic p removal by paos and de nitrification by de nitrifiers respectively fig 2 for simplicity microbial assimilation was not taken into consideration in these bioreactions the following reactions 1 4 summarize the major biological processes as described by gerardi 2002 and smolders et al 1995 1 p h o t o s y n t h e s i s c o 2 h 2 o c h 2 o o 2 2 p u p t a k e 0 87 c h 1 5 o 0 5 o 2 3 23 h 3 p o 4 3 23 h p o 3 0 87 c o 2 3 87 h 2 o 3 n i t r i f i c a t i o n 0 5 n h 4 o 2 0 5 n o 3 h 0 5 h 2 o 4 d

increasing processes seen from the above reactions one mmol co2 corresponds to one mmol o2 production during photosynthesis one mmol o2 utilized by nitrifiers can generate one mmol h or 0 87 mmol co2 by paos if all the produced no3 is denitrified one mmol o2 consumed would produce 0 50 mmol h and 0 63 mmol co2 in this reaction the contribution of produced protons is much more significant than co2 considering the very low dissociation constant of carbonic acid pka1 6 37 25 c therefore the decrease in ph is mainly attributable to nitrogen removal during the illumination phase restated in the present photo sbr system the increased ph by photosynthesis based on the unit o2 produced was lower than the decreased ph by nutrient removal based on the unit o2 utilized as such if the ph controller controlled the led lights to maintain liquid ph the do increase by photosynthesis based on a unit ph elevated will be higher than the do decrease by nutrients removal based on a unit ph decreased which has been supported by an increasing do concentration during the oxic phase data not shown 3 3 c removal 3 3 1 changes in c species and their removal the photo sbr system demonstrated an excellent and stable doc removal efficiency of 90 3 during the entire test period fig 3 a the average effluent doc was 8 95 2 78 mg l close to the effluents from bacterial or algal bacteria ags systems zhao et al 2018 this observation is attributable to the dissolved organic substances excreted by the coexisting microalgae and or bacteria since the sole organic carbon sodium acetate was almost completely removed within the initial 30 min during the anaerobic phase figs 3c and s4a during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the effluent dic concentration remained low at 17 44 3 56 mg l lower than the influent dic concentration when the illumination duration was shortened during stage ⅲ the effluent dic concentration slightly increased very close to the influent dic suggesting less contribution of phototrophic organisms to the dic removal under the mechanical aeration operation an insignificant increase of dic was detected fig 3d in which dic from acetate degradation may be stripped into the air by aeration operation in the photosynthetic o2 condition the dic concentration decreased during the illumination period fig 3c demonstrating the great potential of the algal bacterial ags system for ghgs emission reduction 3 3 2 c assimilation and co2 emission reduction as expected the tc content in granules increased from 405 7 mg g mlvss on day 1 to 460 3 mg g mlvss on day 43 the average c assimilation rate was 35 03 mg g mlvss d during the last 12 days table 2 to estimate the contribution of phototrophs to c fixation in the algal bacterial ags an empirically stoichiometric formula of ch1 78 o0 36n0 12p0 01 boelee et al 2014 for phototrophs and a ratio of 56 31 mg mlvss mg chl a samiotis et al 2021 were used as shown in table 2 the contribution of phototrophic organisms to c sequestration was about 23 28 mg g mlvss d with a co2 fixation capacity of 85 36 mg co2 g mlvss d which accounted for about 66 of total c assimilation by the algal bacterial ags the co2 emission from this algal bacterial granule system was only 0 25 kg co2 kg cod without consideration of other direct and indirect co2 emissions much lower than 0 58 0 68 0 76 and 0 97 kg co2 kg cod from the four full scale a2o ao oxidation ditch and sbr based wwtps bao et al 2015 indicating its great potential of reducing ghgs emission it was estimated that 14 of input dtc was released while the biomass assimilated 52 of input dtc in this study the contribution of phototrophic organisms to c fixation was limited due to the short illumination duration of 80 104 min under the do control strategy applied in order to achieve more reduction of co2 emission from this photo sbr the do control range is a crucial factor which needs more in depth studies 3 4 n removal 3 4 1 n removal and nitrification efficiency as shown in fig 4 effective n removal was achieved through the photosynthetic o2 supply the effluent tn concentrations rapidly decreased during stage ⅰ and kept relatively stable during stage ⅱ possibly associated with the relatively low do concentration compared to the near saturated do concentration in the mother photo sbr the effluent no3 n concentration followed the trend of the effluent tn while the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were negligible during these two stages as a result the tn removal efficiency was increased from 62 on day 1 to 79 2 during stage ⅱ with nh4 n removal of nearly 100 during stages ⅰ and ⅱ an interesting phenomenon was observed when the illumination duration was shortened during stage ⅲ the photo sbr experienced a deterioration period and then recovery of n removal the effluent nh4 n concentration increased first and then decreased while the effluent no3 n concentration decreased first and remained low in addition the effluent no2 n concentration slightly increased as such the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped to 77 on day 27 and then recovered to nearly 100 while tn removal efficiency kept at 81 7 during stage ⅲ a competitive nh4 n removal rate was obtained during the entire test period fig 3b averagely 1 25 0 30 mg g mlvss h much higher than 0 89 0 05 mg g mlvss h of a bacterial ags system under an aerobic oxic anoxic mode he et al 2016 on the other hand the nitrification efficiency was almost halved from 68 to 35 during stage ⅰ it remained at 36 2 and 20 12 respectively during stages ⅱ and ⅲ significantly lower than 80 by the mother photo sbr considering the relatively stable tn removal efficiency it can be inferred that more n might be emitted and or assimilated in the biomass during the operation 3 4 2 main contributors to n removal as illustrated in the cycle tests fig 5 a and b nh4 n removal was rapidly initiated once the led lights switched on while no3 n was correspondingly produced during stages ⅰ and ⅱ in stage ⅰ n removal was completed in 2 h illumination in correspondence with the stable do concentration step 2 in fig 1c the above results indicated a photosynthetic o2 driving aerobic nitrification process which was evidenced by the stable aob and nob abundance in granules fig 2 on the other hand the generated no3 n and low no2 n production cannot cover the decreased amount of nh4 n what is more the effluent no3 n decreased with the operation such an increasing n loss may imply its complex n removal pathways including microbial assimilation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification anammox and or ammonia precipitation such as struvite formation the tn content in the seed granules was about 92 0 mg g mlvss higher than 56 7 11 3 mg g in the activated sludge chen et al 2021 used for the initial seed sludge for granulation in the mother photo sbr in addition the granular n content did not increase with the increase in chl a content which was about 88 4 mg g mlvss on day 31 and 91 4 mg g mlvss on day 43 according to the n balance analysis table 2 approximately 44 of input n was assimilated in biomass compared to the maximum 20 by seed granules in the mother photo sbr from their nitrification efficiency this significant difference is attributable to the enhanced assimilation by phototrophic bacteria indicated by the increased chl a content fig 1b and enriched arthronema leptolyngbya rhodobacter and oscillochloris fig 2c the n assimilation rate was about 7 55 mg n g mlvss d in this study lower than 11 37 mg n g mlvss d by activated sludge with enriched nitrogen fixing bacteria treating thermomechanical pulping wastewater slade et al 2003 the n assimilation rate of phototrophs was estimated as 3 26 mg n g mlvss d table 2 indicating that bacteria in this system contributed about half of n assimilation as illustrated in fig 5d the photosynthetic o2 can help remove n faster with a higher n removal efficiency when compared to the mechanical aeration suggesting less contribution of nitrifiers to n removal in this algal bacterial ags system however a similar nitrification efficiency of 14 was observed under the two o2 supply strategies implying that the n species assimilated by phototrophs include both nh4 n and no3 n since whichever n species was utilized alone by phototrophs would contribute to their difference in nitrification efficiency fig 5d simultaneous nitrification and denitrification are considered other competitive contributors to n removal since about 42 of input n was emitted from the system according to the n balance analysis although a low no2 n and no3 n during nh4 n removal process may imply the possibility of shortcut denitrification during stage ⅲ the enriched nitrospiraceae directly indicated a stable nitrite oxidizing process therefore shortcut denitrification is not considered a major n emission pathway the low do concentration increasing granular size fig s2 and short oxic time may favor denitrification in the ags systems abouhend et al 2023 he et al 2018b mosquera corral et al 2005 probably accounting for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in the present system on the other hand the doc concentrations during the illumination phase were statistically p 0 05 higher than those under the mechanical aeration condition fig 3c and d which may be utilized as carbon sources to some extent thus the relatively high phototroph content and the photosynthetically produced doc or organic matter may favor simultaneous nitrification and denitrification it is worth mentioning that the removal of nh4 n by ammonia precipitation struvite was excluded since struvite is unsaturated under the low ph value 8 0 estimated by visual minteq 3 1 software on the other hand during the nh4 n removal process the set do range of 3 4 mg l still maintained an oxic condition with almost no no2 accumulation fig 5 in addition the typical anammox bacteria such as genera brocadia kuenenia anammoxoglobus jettenia and scalindua were not detected in the granules fig 2 the anammox process is thus not considered as the primary n removal pathway in this study 3 5 p removal 3 5 1 p removal efficiency and removal rate a highly efficient p removal was achieved through photosynthetic o2 production that supports aerobic p uptake during stage ⅰ the tp removal efficiency rapidly increased from 42 on day 1 to 98 on day 7 fig 6 a indicating that the algal bacterial ags quickly adapted to the new environment under the adopted ph control strategy the controlled do and shortened illumination time also showed little adverse impact on tp removal efficiency which remained at 97 2 and 92 8 during stages ⅱ and ⅲ respectively the p release and uptake functioned well during the test period fig 6b and fig s4b the p uptake process was completed within 2 h illumination during stages ⅱ and ⅲ corresponding to the stable do concentration step 2 in fig 1c during this period the o2 generated by phototrophic organisms was used for aerobic p uptake and nitrification the p release rate of the seed granules was about 27 57 mg g mlvss h much higher than 2 87 0 29 mg g mlss h from the bacterial ags he et al 2016 and 16 24 0 91 mg g mlvss h from the algal bacterial ags system under no ph control li et al 2022 during stage ⅰ the p release rate decreased quickly to 16 55 mg g mlvss h on day 7 accompanied by the decrease of maximum p release this decreasing trend continued during stage ⅱ with a lower decrease rate till day 25 fig 6b finally the p release rate remained around 10 84 0 41 mg g mlvss h during the subsequent operation during stages ⅰ and ⅱ the growth of phototrophic bacteria and higher effluent biomass figs 1a and 2 possibly led to the low granular polyp content that accounts for the decrease in p release rate this deduction is partially evidenced by the decrease in granular naip content fig 7 d in contrast the variation of p uptake rate was insignificant averagely 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h during the entire test period li et al 2022 pointed out that aerobic p uptake is limited by intra particle diffusion including macropore and micropore diffusion in the algal bacterial ags luo et al 2014 claimed that flocculent sludge had a higher surface area than ags according to the morphological changes of the algal bacterial ags fig s2 the granules became more significant with more filamentous matter attached along with the operation this morphological change may increase granular surface area and improve intra particle diffusion limitation maintaining the stable granular p uptake rate under the controlled do ph operation conditions 3 5 2 p removal pathway all the plots of δp against δc achieved high linear correlation coefficients r2 fig 7a similar to the changes in p release rate the molar δp δc ratio significantly decreased during stages ⅰ and ⅱ implying the decreased paos activity in the granules acevedo et al 2012 during stage ⅲ the molar δp δc ratio was 0 36 0 03 lower than 0 48 0 80 for paos enriched cultures but much higher than 0 0 02 for gaos enriched cultures acevedo et al 2012 meanwhile the genus candidatus accumulibacter of paos slightly decreased from 4 on day 1 to 3 on day 43 fig 2 this observation suggests that the paos primarily contributing to p removal were still active in the present study k and mg2 as the counterions of po4 3 are known to participate in anaerobic hydrolysis and aerobic synthesis of polyp at an assumed stoichiometry of k0 33mg0 33po3 n the increase in phototrophs abundance may change their quantitative relationship from the cycle tests the molar δk δp and δmg δp ratios were relatively stable fig 7b averagely 0 23 0 02 and 0 28 0 03 lower than the theoretical value of 0 33 this observation may support p assimilation by phototrophic organisms that result in low δk δp and δmg δp ratios according to the tp removal efficiency and the assumed stoichiometry of polyp the maximum contributions of paos to k and mg2 reduction can be up to 7 and 4 respectively the latter estimation is close to the measured mg2 reduction about 4 2 except on day 1 fig 7b but the former significantly deviated from the measured k reduction 24 11 except on day 1 such a deviation is probably associated with active assimilation by phototrophic organisms that require more k which needs further confirmation in the case of ca2 besides the low ph condition its negligible reduction in concentration may exclude ca p precipitation from the p removal pathway fig 7c presents the apparent advantage of the photosynthetic o2 on p removal compared to the mechanical aeration due to a higher p uptake rate detected in the former however similar molar ratios under the two o2 supply strategies did not support the phototrophs p assimilation a previous study found that microalgal p assimilation during aerobic p uptake from the liquid was negligible in the algal bacterial ags system p for microalgae growth was from the solid granules instead of the liquid li et al 2022 generally p assimilation by phototrophs requires a long hrt the adopted short hrt of 6 h during stage ⅲ in the present study may not highlight the contribution of assimilation as shown in table 2 according to the estimated contribution 0 60 mg g mlss d of phototrophs to p assimilation namely 0 1 mg g mlss is required for each cycle this value is significantly lower than the anaerobically released p 5 9 1 1 mg g mlss based on mlss concentration during the last 12 days operation this study determined the p assimilation rate as 2 08 mg g mlss d mainly attributable to paos as noted in table 2 the measured output tp cannot cover the input tp probably due to tp dissolution from the effluent biomass during the collection and storage stages for final determination 3 6 energy consumption and implications the energy requirement by the biological treatment especially the aeration unit generally accounts for 50 70 of the total operating costs in wwtps vergara araya et al 2021 according to the ideal mixing energy requirement of 1 5 w m3 and the mixing energy of 5 w m3 in an example wwtp vergara araya et al 2021 the energy consumption for only mixing applied in this study was about 5 75 wh m3 during the oxic phase significantly lower than 180 800 wh m3 for the commonly mechanical aeration operation silva and rosa 2021 this observation implies that only mixing instead of mechanical aeration to suspend algal bacterial granules is economically feasible however the energy consumption by stirring should be carefully re examined when the reactor system is scaled up since the energy consumption may not increase linearly with the increase in system treatment capacity on the other hand a high electricity consumption of 36 73 kwh m3 for the led lights is required supplementary material which can be replaced by natural sunlight and designed correspondingly in the followed up research works the algal bacterial ags system is promising for c fixation and co2 emission reduction from wwtps which successfully assimilated 52 of the total input c the fixed c estimated by the assumed formula of phototrophs table 2 can be used to produce a maximum 55 mg o2 per cycle enough to complete the high o2 requirement by the nitrification process 35 mg o2 assimilated n was not counted and aerobic p uptake process 15 mg o2 according to eqs 2 and 3 and nutrient removal performance this observation indicates that a higher c fixation could be achieved when treating wastewater with a higher nh4 n concentration that requires more o2 in addition the do control by switching on off the light reduces illumination time from 115 min to 80 104 min saving 10 30 of light energy requirement as noted compared to the energy intensive mechanical aeration the photosynthetic o2 is more efficient for nutrients removal as the o2 molecules generated by the coexisting microalgae inside or on the granule surface may avoid the resistance to gas diffusion and transfer from the gas phase to liquid phase and then into the granules 4 conclusions the feasibility of using photosynthetic o2 from phototrophic organisms for simultaneous aerobic nitrification and p uptake by paos in an algal bacterial ags system has been demonstrated the energy consumption of 5 75 wh m3 for mixing required only for the proposed system is more economical than that of mechanical aeration commonly used for ags systems although the additional illumination cost by artificial lights was relatively high in this study the do control strategy involving switching the lights on and off could reduce light energy consumption by 10 30 in a short hrt of 6 h the coexisting phototrophic organisms in algal bacterial ags could photosynthesize enough o2 production to implement nitrification and aerobic p uptake the system achieved a highly efficient tn removal of 81 7 with an n assimilation rate of 7 55 mg g mlvss d mainly due to microbial assimilation and simultaneous nitrification denitrification under the test conditions in the proposed ph do controlled algal bacterial ags system paos dominated p removal process and exhibited high activity as indicated by a high p release rate of 10 84 0 41 mg g mlvss h p uptake rate of 7 18 0 24 mg g mlvss h and a molar δp δc ratio of 0 36 0 03 resulting in tp removal greater than 92 considering the scale up and better o m of the proposed algal bacterial ags system a more in depth research is demanded c n p assimilation and removal mechanisms contributions of microalgae phototrophs and bacteria light system design the sensitivity of co2 emission to do ph control range and influence of influent characteristics should be further explored during the long term operation

14801,the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of microplastics mps in drinking water in spain by comparing tap water from different locations using common sampling and identification procedures we sampled tap water from 24 points in 8 different locations from continental spain and the canary islands by means of 25 μm opening size steel filters coupled to household connections all particles were measured and spectroscopically characterized including not only mps but also particles consisting of natural materials with evidence of industrial processing such as dyed natural fibres referred insofar as artificial particles aps the average concentration of mps was 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and that of anthropogenic particles 32 2 12 5 aps m3 the main synthetic polymers detected were polyamide polyester and polypropylene with lower counts of other polymers including the biopolymer poly lactic acid particle size and mass distributions were parameterized by means of power law distributions which allowed performing estimations of the concentration of smaller particles provided the same scaling parameter of the power law applies the calculated total mass concentration of the identified mps was 45 5 ng l the observed size distribution of mps allowed an estimation for the concentration of nanoplastics 1 µm well below the ng l range higher concentrations are not consistent with scale invariant fractal fragmentation our findings showed that mps in the drinking water sampled in this work do not represent a significant way of exposure to mps and would probably pose a negligible risk for human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nanoplastics drinking water particle size distribution number concentration mass concentration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution has become ubiquitous and a major cause for concern with a global production capacity approaching 400 million tonnes per year the leakage of plastic to the environment has been estimated at 22 million tonnes oecd 2022 plastics europe 2022 the obvious reason for the spreading of plastic pollution is the lack of circularity in the current use of plastics the main contribution is waste mismanagement with lower inputs from abrasion of plastic goods during use such as the wearing of tyres and textiles and pellet losses at production stage walker 2021 both aquatic and soil ecosystems are a transportation route and sink for most of the plastic that ends up in the environment once in the atmosphere water bodies and other environments plastics suffer from uncontrolled mechanical oxidative and photochemical degradation that generates smaller and smaller fragments that may reach different environments and interact with the biota and with other particles and substances in a variety of ways du et al 2021 the widespread presence of plastic debris results in risks due to the exposure to chemical additives and to the microorganisms traveling on plastic surfaces as well as a consequence of the possible internalization of small plastic fragments who 2022 eventually plastic particles can reach foods and beverages exposing humans to a new kind of pollution with unknown health implications van der laan et al 2022 the exposure of humans to microplastics mps is not easy to quantify making it difficult to identify health risks and to define management policies several problems exist for it the lack of standard procedures common metrics and contrasted quality assurance criteria have been widely recognized koelmans et al 2019 the use of different size cutoffs in sampling campaigns contributes to a huge variability among reported results specifically concerning drinking water the results reported in the literature span over orders of magnitude ranging from a few plastic particles per cubic meter to thousands per litre eerkes medrano et al 2019 mortensen et al 2021 the exclusive use of number concentration represents an important obstacle for quantifying plastics the exposure of humans to microplastics in mass concentration units has been estimated in different studies that appeared during last years but conversion from number to mass concentration may lead to huge errors pletz 2022 besides the evidence of adverse outcomes from the exposure to plastic debris is still weak due to the difficulty of evaluating sublethal and long term effects rodrigues et al 2019 some efforts have been paid to estimate the biodistribution of mps in humans assuming a certain rate of internalization based on studies performed with engineered nanoparticles but the current lack of experimental data do not allow to validate model estimations mohamed nor et al 2021 the existing data on the occurrence of mps in drinking water are controversial some results from bottled water are particularly high oßmann et al reported concentrations of mps in mineral water of 2649 2857 mps l in polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and even higher 6292 10 521 mps l in glass bottles reported mps in tap water tend to be larger in size and lower in abundance compared to bottled water but there is a methodological bias due to the use of two different spectroscopic techniques micro raman and micro ftir that differ one order of magnitude in their detection limit zhang et al 2020 in some cases higher abundances can be probably attributed to the small size sampled thank to the use of micro raman oßmann et al 2018 wang et al 2020 however some studies using micro raman with the same detection limit as low as 1 μm reported relatively low concentrations pivokonsky et al 2020 schymanski et al 2018 it has also been suggested that the mps in drinking water are generally smaller than those found in other food products mortensen et al 2021 there is a general agreement however in the type of polymers detected which generally show higher prevalence of the most commonly used materials including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and pet koelmans et al 2019 senathirajah et al 2021 as expected a significant fraction of the mps found in plastic bottles correspond to pet and pp the materials used for bottles and caps respectively schymanski et al 2018 the purpose of this study was to compare tap water from different spanish locations using common sampling and identification procedures we sampled tap water from 8 different locations in continental spain and the canary islands by means of 25 μm opening size stainless steel filters coupled to household connections all particles were measured and spectroscopically characterized including not only plastic particles but also natural materials with evidence of industrial processing such as dyed natural fibres particle size and mass distributions were parameterized by means of power law distributions and the findings discussed and compared with recent data provided by other groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations and methodology two simultaneous sampling campaigns were performed in 8 different locations in continental spain and the canary islands in spring may and summer july 2022 the locations chosen consisted of medium sized towns ranging from san cristobal de la laguna 155 000 inhab to murcia 450 000 inhab plus the metropolitan areas of madrid 7 3 million inhab and barcelona 5 5 million inhab the sampling points 24 were distributed through the different locations avoiding excessive proximity the locations and number of sampling points per location are shown in fig 1 table s1 supplementary material sm lists the characteristics of the drinking water treatment plants dwtp located closer to the sampling points in every location a series of 25 µm opening size and 25 µm diameter wire stainless steel filters were adapted into a brass 1 2 in pipe thread adapter that fitted the usual domestic connectors fig s1 sm the set was prepared in the facilities of segainvex universidad autónoma de madrid and was distributed to the different persons participating in the sampling campaigns all metal steel and glass materials were carefully cleaned with milli q water wrapped with aluminium foil and heated to 300 ºc for 4 h in order to remove all possible rests of organic matter or any contamination from plastic material or fibres prior to sampling the filter was assembled at the end of domestic bathroom connectors without using any joints in all samples 150 l of water were allowed to flow through the filters amounting 3600 l per campaign 7200 l overall the volume of water was chosen based on a pilot test to avoid filter clogging due to the presence of sand and other particulate material in tap water after sampling the filters were disassembled put inside clean glass petri dishes carefully closed and sent to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 analyses all samples were processed in the same laboratory once received the stainless steel filters were recovered washed with milli q water and the water filtered again using 25 µm stainless steel filters as well as 1 µm glass fibre filters these measures were intended to recover any plastic that could have migrated from the filters during transportation or could get lost during re filtration subsequently all filters were stored in petri dishes and dried at 60 ºc for 24 h for later visualization and analyses suspected plastic particles were individually picked up using metal tweezers or a needle depending on their size photographed and measured using a euromex edublue stereomicroscope equipped with image focus software and kept in closed clean containers until spectroscopic characterization particles were classified as fibres fragments and films particles with aspect ratio equal to or greater than 3 1 as traditionally established for man made mineral fibres were considered fibres if not they were categorized as fragments except if one dimension was at least one tenth lower than the other two in which case they were classified as films the identification of plastic materials was carried out by means of micro fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy micro ftir using a perkin elmer spotlight 200i micro ftir apparatus equipped with an mct detector the micro ftir equipment was operated in transmission mode in the 550 4000 cm 1 range with spectral resolution 8 cm 1 the selected particles were transferred one by one to kbr discs and spectra were individually recorded this procedure allowed obtaining high quality spectra for most particles which were compared with the databases existing in software omnic 9 thermo scientific and with our own databases which have been created with aged plastics of different origins by our group pearson correlation was used with a minimum of 65 matching for positive identification as stated elsewhere gonzález pleiter et al 2021 all suspected plastic particles found in samples and controls were spectroscopically analysed the actions taken upon the finding of particles in the controls are explained below 2 3 particle size and mass distributions the abundance of plastic particles in environmental samples has been shown to follow a power law with size kooi and koelmans 2019 the reason is that fragmentation originates a high number of small particles from a few larger ones cózar et al 2014 mathematically the relationship can be expressed by a probability density function denoted as p x 1 p x p x x x d x x α where x is the observed value and α the scaling parameter the scaling parameter has been interpreted as the dimension of a fractal fragmentation process that creates a given distribution and when followed the evidence of a scale invariant fragmentation mechanism the scaling parameter also depends on the fragility the probability of fragmentation of the material turcotte 1986 estimating power law distributions from experimental data is not trivial maximum likelihood estimation mle is the method of choice to avoid large errors in the fitting of experimental data clauset et al 2009 the details on the derivation of the scaling parameter using mle and bootstrapping for its uncertainty are given as supplementary materials additional details can be found elsewhere gillespie 2015 in this work all mps were characterized particle by particle based on their two representative projected dimensions length and width for fragments and films and length and diameter for fibres the representative size for fragments and films was taken as that of the circle with the same projected area for fibres the diameter of the sphere with the same volume as the fibre considered as a cylinder with particle s diameter and length happel and brenner 2012 rosal 2021 for fragments the volume was estimated as that of sphere with the same projected area for films assuming that the lowest non recorded dimension was one tenth the lower of the other two and for fibres the volume of the cylinder with the same diameter and length the mass of individual particles was estimated using the tabulated average density for each polymer table s2 sm 2 4 quality assurance quality control the measures taken during sampling and laboratory handling to ensure the quality of the data obtained followed the general recommendations stated elsewhere who 2022 sample collection was performed by trained personnel belonging to the groups participating in the spanish network of micro and nanoplastics in the environment www enviroplanet net during all the sampling and processing stages plastic material was avoided filters were sent closed to the sampling points in closed aluminium foil together with two clean petri dishes one for returning the filter and the other to act as procedural sampling control sampling controls were kept open during the sampling procedure closed afterwards and returned to the laboratory together with the filter all material used during sampling and processing was previously cleaned carefully with ultrapure water and heated at 450 c for 4 h shipped materials were covered with aluminium foil also heated to 450 c for 4 h to remove all possible contamination laboratory clothes were made of cotton during laboratory manipulation contamination controls consisted of petri dishes which were kept open during all procedures in addition during vacuum filtration processes 2 l of milli q water were filtered 3 times through a 1 µm filter to assess the contamination of water and laboratory devices the total number of particles found in controls was 21 5 fragments and 16 fibres as detailed in table s3 sm fragments films or fibres with the same typology and composition were not considered in the corresponding samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 number concentration and chemical composition the separation process described before allowed the identification of 570 particles with possible anthropogenic origin all of them were numbered photographed and spectroscopically characterized by micro ftir 84 particles 39 fragments 6 films and 39 fibres were positively identified as mps synthetic polymers 132 7 fragments 7 films and 118 fibres were identified as artificial non plastic materials and the rest 360 particles were natural materials without evidence of anthropogenic processing or particles that could not be identified with the minimum matching established artificial particles mainly consisted of cellulose fibres with non natural colours regenerated cellulose materials such as rayon or cellophane and dyed wool in what follows such anthropogenic non plastic materials are denoted as aps standing for artificial particles fig 2 shows the concentration measured for mps fig 2a and artificial particles ap fig 2b in all sampling locations for the two campaigns performed the concentration of fibres and fragments and films are separately given in fig s2 sm the error bars represent the variability considering the different sampling points studied per location the average concentrations of mps and aps for all locations were 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and 32 2 12 5 aps m3 as indicated before there is a large variability in studies reporting the presence of mps in drinking water table 1 summarizes the main details of some recent works on the occurrence of mps at the outlet of drinking water treatment plants dwtp or at the end of distribution systems including houses and other end of pipe users mintenig et al obtained an average concentration of 0 7 mps m3 ranging from 0 to 7 mps m3 in the area covered by oldenburg east frisian water board lower saxony germany all of them in the 50 150 μm size range mintenig et al 2019 semmouri et al studied the presence of mps 25 1000 μm in drinking water from different dwtps in flanders belgium a highly urbanized region and reported number concentrations in the tens of mps per cubic meter range semmouri et al 2022 weber et al sampled the drinking water of a german city sampled in 8 end of pipe points and one transfer station and found number concentrations 7 mps m3 weber et al 2021 incidentally weber et al used micro raman spectrometry with 10 μm detection limit and a methodology similar to that used in other works reporting much higher concentrations of mps barbier et al studied dwtps using conventional treatments in the region of paris plus one implementing microfiltration and nanofiltration the authors found concentrations 260 mp m3 at the outlet with high removal efficiency 99 with respect to inlet water incidentally the outlet of the plant using membrane processes did not show plastic above blank levels barbier et al 2022 other studies in conventional dwtps showed low concentrations of mps in the order of a few mps m3 or lower johnson et al 2020 negrete velasco et al 2022 other results however report much higher concentration of mps chu et al sampled one dwtp and its distribution system and found concentrations ranging from 13 2 to 134 8 mps l with sizes generally 200 μm surprisingly the concentration observed in tap water was lower than that recorded at the exit of the dwtp 13 2 mps l versus 95 6 mps l which is probably the consequence of sample inhomogeneity or the mixture of tap water from different dwtps chu et al 2022 in another study performed in several chinese cities an average 440 mps l was obtained although some samples did not contain any mps with an average size of 66 μm mostly fragments and the most abundant size category being 1 50 μm tong et al 2020 also in the upper range pivonkonsky et al sampled dwtps in the czech republic and reported number concentrations in the 4 1 mps l to 628 28 mps l the most abundant size category corresponding to the smaller particles 1 5 μm pivokonsky et al 2018 2020 the differences among reported concentrations may be caused by several factors that include the use of too small sample volumes inadequate methodologies for determining mps or the improper use of blanks and contamination controls but other probable reasons are the different characteristics of the source water and the different type of treatment technologies used in dwtps the composition of the particles found in our study was dominated by common polymers as shown in fig 3 the most frequently found were polyamide pa and polyester pes which include pet both predominant in fibres and pp these three polymers accounted for 70 of the total number of mps found in this study other polymers detected in lower amounts were acrylic materials acr polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe pe ps polyurethane pu polyvinyl chloride pvc and noticeably the biopolymer polylactic acid pla which is reported in drinking water by the first time fig s2 sm shows pictures and ftir spectra of a pes fragment an acr fibre and a pla fragment the predominance of pa pes and the polyolefins pe and pp agrees well with others results koelmans et al 2019 menon et al 2023 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 senathirajah et al 2021 tong et al 2020 fig 2b shows the number concentration of artificial non plastic pollutants which was in the 13 3 43 3 aps m3 range the materials included in this category exclude mps and consist of a wide range of artificial particles the most abundant class is that of industrially processed natural polymers like regenerated cellulose and a variety of natural materials that underwent industrial processing such as fibres from cotton or wool textiles as revealed by non natural colours most of these artificial materials are fibres 89 4 mainly of cellulosic composition 85 such artificial particles are generally sampled together with mps and share some of their characteristics specifically the textile industry uses a wide variety of additives for a number of different functions that become dispersed into the environment upon landfilling or after fibre detaching from clothes during use or washing chemicals of concern include persistent and bioaccumulable compounds such as ultraviolet filters brominated compounds or perfluorocarbon additives darbra et al 2012 besides some characteristics of processed fibres like hydrophobicity and microroughness favour the attachment of microorganisms which find a way to spread thanks to the high mobility of individual fibres stanton et al 2019 varshney et al 2021 the contamination with this type of artificial materials has been seldom reported in the literature gonzález pleiter et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2020 the total concentration of microplastics from all sampled sizes from 41 0 µm to 379 5 µm the largest sampled mp particle could be computed from the recorded dimensions of plastic particles and the density of each polymer the total concentration of the mps sampled in this study was 45 5 ng l calculated from the estimated particle volume and the tabulated average density for each polymer as indicated in table s2 for this calculation fragments were assumed spherical with the diameter as the sphere with the same projected area for films slab shape assuming that the non recorded dimension was one tenth the lower recorded and for fibres cylindrical shape the experimental mass concentration of mps corresponds to usual concentration range reported for other micropollutants in water resources this includes pesticides other persistent chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products tröger et al 2018 some studies reported mass concentration instead of the usual number concentration for mps in drinking water gomiero et al used pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pyr gc ms to analyse the content of nps 1 µm in the drinking water from a medium sized norwegian city and reported a total mass concentration in the 6 1 93 1 ng l range in line with our results gomiero et al 2021 kirstein et al tracked mps down to 6 6 µm in drinking water distribution systems by micro ftir and pyr gc ms and found average mps concentrations between zero and 22 19 mps m3 and mass concentrations in the 0 14 5 43 µg l kirstein et al 2021 3 2 particle size distributions particle size distributions for all the mps sampled in this work is given in fig 5 as cfd plots for size and mass the results showed that the power law can be applied for the lower sizes and separately for the larger ones the boundary was established using mle as indicated before the last particle for which the power law was applied included was a pes fragment of 192 7 µm and 5 2 µg the scaling parameter α was 1 78 0 14 for particle size and 1 25 0 10 for particle mass the intervals represent 95 confidence intervals calculated using bootstrapping with n 50 it is to be noted that the environmental concentrations documented so far in marine studies also follow a power law with exponents 1 6 as determined elsewhere kooi and koelmans 2019 it has been shown that in some cases the experimental data on mps abundance follow a power law distribution only for sizes above a given lower boundary cózar et al 2014 in such cases particle size distributions as number distributions or as probability density function usually display a maximum with a lower number of small particles than expected if all the distribution followed the same power law the maximum corresponds to different sizes depending on the study a fact that has been attributed to the difficulty of counting small particles or other variables like the distance to the nearest coast kaandorp et al 2021 in our case the power law behaviour applies for all particles 192 7 µm or 5 2 µg which allows performing estimations about the number and mass of particles in different size or mass ranges the procedure is based on the integration of the size distribution function which is obtained from the density function p x as follows 2 n x n p x where n is total number or number concentration of particles and n x the number of particles with sizes between x and x dx the mass of every individual particle is calculated from its equivalent diameter and the density of each polymer the details of the derivation are given as supplementary materials using the experimental data from our study the mass or particles between 40 9 µm the smaller one and 192 7 µm calculated as 55 1 µg the mass for other size ranges can be estimated even outside the experimental range by extrapolation to lower sizes assuming the same scaling parameter 1 78 0 14 can be applied our results predicted 1 8 1 7 2 0 ng l for particles 100 µm but only 68 31 140 fg l for nanoplastics nps 1 µm with boundaries calculated using the uncertainty of the scaling parameter it is well established that a series of entities satisfying eq 1 define a fractal the dimension of which is the exponent of its number size distribution turcotte 1986 a fragmentation process that gives rise to a fractal distribution is taken as evidence of scale invariance this means that fragments behave in a similar way was as parent particles or in other words they constitute a fractal because all parts are similar to the whole xu 2005 fractal fragmentation approaches based on multi step iterations foresee that the slope should approach 3 in 3d fragmentation as the probability of fragmentation increases therefore the slope relating the number of fragments with their size in double logarithmic coordinate system depends on the dimensionality of the fragmentation process and on the probability of fracturing which in turn depends on the fragility of the material a change in slope may mean a change in fractal dimension of in the probability of fragmentation but there are other possibilities for example the action of mechanisms draining small particles ingestion or large particles sedimentation also numerical bias due to the influence of a few large fragments the exact reason is still not clear and requires further studies mps break down eventually giving rise to nanoplastics nps which may induce toxicity after their internalization in living organisms and their cells li et al studied the presence of nps of different sizes 450 nm in tap water and quantified them using pyr gc ms the reported abundance for the size range 58 255 nm was 1 67 2 08 μg l li et al 2022 pyr gc ms is a complex technique still under development and the results are scarce and difficult to compare xu et al studied the presence of six synthetic polymers in ultrafiltrated 100 kda approx 10 nm surface water and groundwater and reported mass concentrations from 21 ng l to 0 793 μg l xu et al 2022 even if the scaling parameter reached 3 the limit of high fracture probability in 3d fragmentation our set of observed data would yield 5 ng l x 100 µm or 50 pg l x 1 µm from particle mass distribution fig 2b the total mass concentration of particles 5 µg would be 8 6 ng l in line with the estimations based on particle size distribution therefore our results suggest that the concentrations of nps in drinking water should be much below the ng l level to be consistent with scale invariant fractal fragmentation which would predict concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in the tens of pg l level or less this is true not only for the concentration of mps observed in this study but for most reported in the literature higher concentrations of nps can only be explained by some process that concentrates nps or assuming nps are directly produced from larger plastic particles following a non fractal mechanism in both cases the power law would not apply to nps and the abundance of nps would contradict the general assumption that small plastic fragments interact preferably with the biota and with other particles so that their concentration should be lower than expected from a scale invariant fragmentation pattern however this discussion is far to be closed because the fate of nps in aqueous matrixes is still poorly known and requires more research efforts the median mp concentration in untreated water sources was estimated in the thousands of particles per cubic meter with sizes usually 50 μm li et al 2020 the removal efficiency of mps dwtps using traditional technologies which include coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration is generally high typically 60 80 pivokonsky et al 2018 coagulation sedimentation alone has a removal efficiency of about 50 and performed better for the removal of fibres wang et al 2020 granular activated carbon gac filtration is more efficient for small sized mps so that mps 10 μm are not expected to be found in the effluents of sand filtration dalmau soler et al 2021 oxidation processes such as ozonation may increase the abundance of small 1 5 μm mps probably due to the fragmentation of larger particles cheng et al 2021 membrane filtration although more expensive is the preferred process to remove very small mps and nps from drinking water barbier et al 2022 shen et al 2020 our results included locations receiving water from desalination plants table s1 sm locations 4 and 6 did not show significant differences with other locations in which dwtps do not use membrane processes the fact that water treated by ultrafiltration reverse osmosis still contains mps has been noticed elsewhere and can be attributed to operational reasons like plastic unintentionally added during remineralization or plastic detached from polymeric membranes dalmau soler et al 2021 in our study the highest concentration of mps 77 mps m3 were obtained in tap water from a town receiving drinking water from the dwtp of santillana madrid that takes water from the same reservoir that receives wastewater at a distance of just 4 km this situation is common as most dwtps in our study take water from rivers or reservoirs receiving discharges from wwtps in this work we did not find any relationship between plastic concentration and water quality parameters including the use of water desalted by reverse osmosis our results suggest that the quality of water discharged by wastewater treatment plants is an important parameter influencing that of the drinking water produced after potabilization processes according to our study and considering a daily consumption of 1 5 l of tap water per day the annual intake would represent 6 8 mps per person and per year and per person with a global weight of 24 9 µg and somewhat higher amount of artificial fibres 17 6 per person and per year mainly dyed natural fibres and regenerated cellulose our results showed that tap water delivered by dwtps and conventional distribution systems under study do not represent a significant way of exposure to mp pollution and would probably pose a low risk for human health however it is true that the actual concentrations of mps and nps in drinking water are controversial because of reports differing orders of magnitude although part of the differences could be attributed to methodological reasons a high variability due to differences in water sources cannot be discarded besides the risks associated to mps in drinking are complex and can also be due to the increased exposure to pathogenic colonizing microorganisms including the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes to the internalization and possible accumulation of nps particles small enough to cross epithelial barriers and to the exposure to chemicals used as additives in the formulation of plastic materials martínez campos et al 2021 4 conclusions mps have received increasing attention as emerging pollutants in drinking water however the dispersion of results and methodological discrepancies among studies make it difficult to derive conclusions on their possible effects and risks for human health herein we performed an estimation of the total amount on plastic in drinking water both in number and mass concentration from the municipal water supply of eight locations in continental spain and the canary islands our results allowed identifying 10 types of synthetic polymers the most abundant of which were pa pes pp and with lower counts acr pe ptfe ps pu pvc and notably the biopolymer pla we also identified other anthropogenic materials mainly consisting of cellulose fibres with non natural colours and regenerated cellulose materials such as rayon or cellophane the average concentration of mps was 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and that of other artificial particles 32 2 12 5 aps m3 the particles identified as mps displayed sizes in the 41 0 379 5 µm range with a calculated total mass concentration of 45 5 ng l particle size and mass distributions followed a power law for sizes 192 7 µm which allowed performing estimations for the concentration of smaller particles provided the same scaling parameter of the power law applies the scaling parameter can be interpreted as the dimension of the fragmentation process based on this assumption the concentration of nps would be extremely low far below the ng l range our results showed that mps in drinking water do not represent a significant way of exposure to mps and would probably pose a low risk for human health besides results reporting concentrations of nps in drinking water in the ng l level are not consistent with scale invariant

14801,the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of microplastics mps in drinking water in spain by comparing tap water from different locations using common sampling and identification procedures we sampled tap water from 24 points in 8 different locations from continental spain and the canary islands by means of 25 μm opening size steel filters coupled to household connections all particles were measured and spectroscopically characterized including not only mps but also particles consisting of natural materials with evidence of industrial processing such as dyed natural fibres referred insofar as artificial particles aps the average concentration of mps was 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and that of anthropogenic particles 32 2 12 5 aps m3 the main synthetic polymers detected were polyamide polyester and polypropylene with lower counts of other polymers including the biopolymer poly lactic acid particle size and mass distributions were parameterized by means of power law distributions which allowed performing estimations of the concentration of smaller particles provided the same scaling parameter of the power law applies the calculated total mass concentration of the identified mps was 45 5 ng l the observed size distribution of mps allowed an estimation for the concentration of nanoplastics 1 µm well below the ng l range higher concentrations are not consistent with scale invariant fractal fragmentation our findings showed that mps in the drinking water sampled in this work do not represent a significant way of exposure to mps and would probably pose a negligible risk for human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nanoplastics drinking water particle size distribution number concentration mass concentration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution has become ubiquitous and a major cause for concern with a global production capacity approaching 400 million tonnes per year the leakage of plastic to the environment has been estimated at 22 million tonnes oecd 2022 plastics europe 2022 the obvious reason for the spreading of plastic pollution is the lack of circularity in the current use of plastics the main contribution is waste mismanagement with lower inputs from abrasion of plastic goods during use such as the wearing of tyres and textiles and pellet losses at production stage walker 2021 both aquatic and soil ecosystems are a transportation route and sink for most of the plastic that ends up in the environment once in the atmosphere water bodies and other environments plastics suffer from uncontrolled mechanical oxidative and photochemical degradation that generates smaller and smaller fragments that may reach different environments and interact with the biota and with other particles and substances in a variety of ways du et al 2021 the widespread presence of plastic debris results in risks due to the exposure to chemical additives and to the microorganisms traveling on plastic surfaces as well as a consequence of the possible internalization of small plastic fragments who 2022 eventually plastic particles can reach foods and beverages exposing humans to a new kind of pollution with unknown health implications van der laan et al 2022 the exposure of humans to microplastics mps is not easy to quantify making it difficult to identify health risks and to define management policies several problems exist for it the lack of standard procedures common metrics and contrasted quality assurance criteria have been widely recognized koelmans et al 2019 the use of different size cutoffs in sampling campaigns contributes to a huge variability among reported results specifically concerning drinking water the results reported in the literature span over orders of magnitude ranging from a few plastic particles per cubic meter to thousands per litre eerkes medrano et al 2019 mortensen et al 2021 the exclusive use of number concentration represents an important obstacle for quantifying plastics the exposure of humans to microplastics in mass concentration units has been estimated in different studies that appeared during last years but conversion from number to mass concentration may lead to huge errors pletz 2022 besides the evidence of adverse outcomes from the exposure to plastic debris is still weak due to the difficulty of evaluating sublethal and long term effects rodrigues et al 2019 some efforts have been paid to estimate the biodistribution of mps in humans assuming a certain rate of internalization based on studies performed with engineered nanoparticles but the current lack of experimental data do not allow to validate model estimations mohamed nor et al 2021 the existing data on the occurrence of mps in drinking water are controversial some results from bottled water are particularly high oßmann et al reported concentrations of mps in mineral water of 2649 2857 mps l in polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and even higher 6292 10 521 mps l in glass bottles reported mps in tap water tend to be larger in size and lower in abundance compared to bottled water but there is a methodological bias due to the use of two different spectroscopic techniques micro raman and micro ftir that differ one order of magnitude in their detection limit zhang et al 2020 in some cases higher abundances can be probably attributed to the small size sampled thank to the use of micro raman oßmann et al 2018 wang et al 2020 however some studies using micro raman with the same detection limit as low as 1 μm reported relatively low concentrations pivokonsky et al 2020 schymanski et al 2018 it has also been suggested that the mps in drinking water are generally smaller than those found in other food products mortensen et al 2021 there is a general agreement however in the type of polymers detected which generally show higher prevalence of the most commonly used materials including polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and pet koelmans et al 2019 senathirajah et al 2021 as expected a significant fraction of the mps found in plastic bottles correspond to pet and pp the materials used for bottles and caps respectively schymanski et al 2018 the purpose of this study was to compare tap water from different spanish locations using common sampling and identification procedures we sampled tap water from 8 different locations in continental spain and the canary islands by means of 25 μm opening size stainless steel filters coupled to household connections all particles were measured and spectroscopically characterized including not only plastic particles but also natural materials with evidence of industrial processing such as dyed natural fibres particle size and mass distributions were parameterized by means of power law distributions and the findings discussed and compared with recent data provided by other groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations and methodology two simultaneous sampling campaigns were performed in 8 different locations in continental spain and the canary islands in spring may and summer july 2022 the locations chosen consisted of medium sized towns ranging from san cristobal de la laguna 155 000 inhab to murcia 450 000 inhab plus the metropolitan areas of madrid 7 3 million inhab and barcelona 5 5 million inhab the sampling points 24 were distributed through the different locations avoiding excessive proximity the locations and number of sampling points per location are shown in fig 1 table s1 supplementary material sm lists the characteristics of the drinking water treatment plants dwtp located closer to the sampling points in every location a series of 25 µm opening size and 25 µm diameter wire stainless steel filters were adapted into a brass 1 2 in pipe thread adapter that fitted the usual domestic connectors fig s1 sm the set was prepared in the facilities of segainvex universidad autónoma de madrid and was distributed to the different persons participating in the sampling campaigns all metal steel and glass materials were carefully cleaned with milli q water wrapped with aluminium foil and heated to 300 ºc for 4 h in order to remove all possible rests of organic matter or any contamination from plastic material or fibres prior to sampling the filter was assembled at the end of domestic bathroom connectors without using any joints in all samples 150 l of water were allowed to flow through the filters amounting 3600 l per campaign 7200 l overall the volume of water was chosen based on a pilot test to avoid filter clogging due to the presence of sand and other particulate material in tap water after sampling the filters were disassembled put inside clean glass petri dishes carefully closed and sent to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 analyses all samples were processed in the same laboratory once received the stainless steel filters were recovered washed with milli q water and the water filtered again using 25 µm stainless steel filters as well as 1 µm glass fibre filters these measures were intended to recover any plastic that could have migrated from the filters during transportation or could get lost during re filtration subsequently all filters were stored in petri dishes and dried at 60 ºc for 24 h for later visualization and analyses suspected plastic particles were individually picked up using metal tweezers or a needle depending on their size photographed and measured using a euromex edublue stereomicroscope equipped with image focus software and kept in closed clean containers until spectroscopic characterization particles were classified as fibres fragments and films particles with aspect ratio equal to or greater than 3 1 as traditionally established for man made mineral fibres were considered fibres if not they were categorized as fragments except if one dimension was at least one tenth lower than the other two in which case they were classified as films the identification of plastic materials was carried out by means of micro fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy micro ftir using a perkin elmer spotlight 200i micro ftir apparatus equipped with an mct detector the micro ftir equipment was operated in transmission mode in the 550 4000 cm 1 range with spectral resolution 8 cm 1 the selected particles were transferred one by one to kbr discs and spectra were individually recorded this procedure allowed obtaining high quality spectra for most particles which were compared with the databases existing in software omnic 9 thermo scientific and with our own databases which have been created with aged plastics of different origins by our group pearson correlation was used with a minimum of 65 matching for positive identification as stated elsewhere gonzález pleiter et al 2021 all suspected plastic particles found in samples and controls were spectroscopically analysed the actions taken upon the finding of particles in the controls are explained below 2 3 particle size and mass distributions the abundance of plastic particles in environmental samples has been shown to follow a power law with size kooi and koelmans 2019 the reason is that fragmentation originates a high number of small particles from a few larger ones cózar et al 2014 mathematically the relationship can be expressed by a probability density function denoted as p x 1 p x p x x x d x x α where x is the observed value and α the scaling parameter the scaling parameter has been interpreted as the dimension of a fractal fragmentation process that creates a given distribution and when followed the evidence of a scale invariant fragmentation mechanism the scaling parameter also depends on the fragility the probability of fragmentation of the material turcotte 1986 estimating power law distributions from experimental data is not trivial maximum likelihood estimation mle is the method of choice to avoid large errors in the fitting of experimental data clauset et al 2009 the details on the derivation of the scaling parameter using mle and bootstrapping for its uncertainty are given as supplementary materials additional details can be found elsewhere gillespie 2015 in this work all mps were characterized particle by particle based on their two representative projected dimensions length and width for fragments and films and length and diameter for fibres the representative size for fragments and films was taken as that of the circle with the same projected area for fibres the diameter of the sphere with the same volume as the fibre considered as a cylinder with particle s diameter and length happel and brenner 2012 rosal 2021 for fragments the volume was estimated as that of sphere with the same projected area for films assuming that the lowest non recorded dimension was one tenth the lower of the other two and for fibres the volume of the cylinder with the same diameter and length the mass of individual particles was estimated using the tabulated average density for each polymer table s2 sm 2 4 quality assurance quality control the measures taken during sampling and laboratory handling to ensure the quality of the data obtained followed the general recommendations stated elsewhere who 2022 sample collection was performed by trained personnel belonging to the groups participating in the spanish network of micro and nanoplastics in the environment www enviroplanet net during all the sampling and processing stages plastic material was avoided filters were sent closed to the sampling points in closed aluminium foil together with two clean petri dishes one for returning the filter and the other to act as procedural sampling control sampling controls were kept open during the sampling procedure closed afterwards and returned to the laboratory together with the filter all material used during sampling and processing was previously cleaned carefully with ultrapure water and heated at 450 c for 4 h shipped materials were covered with aluminium foil also heated to 450 c for 4 h to remove all possible contamination laboratory clothes were made of cotton during laboratory manipulation contamination controls consisted of petri dishes which were kept open during all procedures in addition during vacuum filtration processes 2 l of milli q water were filtered 3 times through a 1 µm filter to assess the contamination of water and laboratory devices the total number of particles found in controls was 21 5 fragments and 16 fibres as detailed in table s3 sm fragments films or fibres with the same typology and composition were not considered in the corresponding samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 number concentration and chemical composition the separation process described before allowed the identification of 570 particles with possible anthropogenic origin all of them were numbered photographed and spectroscopically characterized by micro ftir 84 particles 39 fragments 6 films and 39 fibres were positively identified as mps synthetic polymers 132 7 fragments 7 films and 118 fibres were identified as artificial non plastic materials and the rest 360 particles were natural materials without evidence of anthropogenic processing or particles that could not be identified with the minimum matching established artificial particles mainly consisted of cellulose fibres with non natural colours regenerated cellulose materials such as rayon or cellophane and dyed wool in what follows such anthropogenic non plastic materials are denoted as aps standing for artificial particles fig 2 shows the concentration measured for mps fig 2a and artificial particles ap fig 2b in all sampling locations for the two campaigns performed the concentration of fibres and fragments and films are separately given in fig s2 sm the error bars represent the variability considering the different sampling points studied per location the average concentrations of mps and aps for all locations were 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and 32 2 12 5 aps m3 as indicated before there is a large variability in studies reporting the presence of mps in drinking water table 1 summarizes the main details of some recent works on the occurrence of mps at the outlet of drinking water treatment plants dwtp or at the end of distribution systems including houses and other end of pipe users mintenig et al obtained an average concentration of 0 7 mps m3 ranging from 0 to 7 mps m3 in the area covered by oldenburg east frisian water board lower saxony germany all of them in the 50 150 μm size range mintenig et al 2019 semmouri et al studied the presence of mps 25 1000 μm in drinking water from different dwtps in flanders belgium a highly urbanized region and reported number concentrations in the tens of mps per cubic meter range semmouri et al 2022 weber et al sampled the drinking water of a german city sampled in 8 end of pipe points and one transfer station and found number concentrations 7 mps m3 weber et al 2021 incidentally weber et al used micro raman spectrometry with 10 μm detection limit and a methodology similar to that used in other works reporting much higher concentrations of mps barbier et al studied dwtps using conventional treatments in the region of paris plus one implementing microfiltration and nanofiltration the authors found concentrations 260 mp m3 at the outlet with high removal efficiency 99 with respect to inlet water incidentally the outlet of the plant using membrane processes did not show plastic above blank levels barbier et al 2022 other studies in conventional dwtps showed low concentrations of mps in the order of a few mps m3 or lower johnson et al 2020 negrete velasco et al 2022 other results however report much higher concentration of mps chu et al sampled one dwtp and its distribution system and found concentrations ranging from 13 2 to 134 8 mps l with sizes generally 200 μm surprisingly the concentration observed in tap water was lower than that recorded at the exit of the dwtp 13 2 mps l versus 95 6 mps l which is probably the consequence of sample inhomogeneity or the mixture of tap water from different dwtps chu et al 2022 in another study performed in several chinese cities an average 440 mps l was obtained although some samples did not contain any mps with an average size of 66 μm mostly fragments and the most abundant size category being 1 50 μm tong et al 2020 also in the upper range pivonkonsky et al sampled dwtps in the czech republic and reported number concentrations in the 4 1 mps l to 628 28 mps l the most abundant size category corresponding to the smaller particles 1 5 μm pivokonsky et al 2018 2020 the differences among reported concentrations may be caused by several factors that include the use of too small sample volumes inadequate methodologies for determining mps or the improper use of blanks and contamination controls but other probable reasons are the different characteristics of the source water and the different type of treatment technologies used in dwtps the composition of the particles found in our study was dominated by common polymers as shown in fig 3 the most frequently found were polyamide pa and polyester pes which include pet both predominant in fibres and pp these three polymers accounted for 70 of the total number of mps found in this study other polymers detected in lower amounts were acrylic materials acr polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe pe ps polyurethane pu polyvinyl chloride pvc and noticeably the biopolymer polylactic acid pla which is reported in drinking water by the first time fig s2 sm shows pictures and ftir spectra of a pes fragment an acr fibre and a pla fragment the predominance of pa pes and the polyolefins pe and pp agrees well with others results koelmans et al 2019 menon et al 2023 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 senathirajah et al 2021 tong et al 2020 fig 2b shows the number concentration of artificial non plastic pollutants which was in the 13 3 43 3 aps m3 range the materials included in this category exclude mps and consist of a wide range of artificial particles the most abundant class is that of industrially processed natural polymers like regenerated cellulose and a variety of natural materials that underwent industrial processing such as fibres from cotton or wool textiles as revealed by non natural colours most of these artificial materials are fibres 89 4 mainly of cellulosic composition 85 such artificial particles are generally sampled together with mps and share some of their characteristics specifically the textile industry uses a wide variety of additives for a number of different functions that become dispersed into the environment upon landfilling or after fibre detaching from clothes during use or washing chemicals of concern include persistent and bioaccumulable compounds such as ultraviolet filters brominated compounds or perfluorocarbon additives darbra et al 2012 besides some characteristics of processed fibres like hydrophobicity and microroughness favour the attachment of microorganisms which find a way to spread thanks to the high mobility of individual fibres stanton et al 2019 varshney et al 2021 the contamination with this type of artificial materials has been seldom reported in the literature gonzález pleiter et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2020 the total concentration of microplastics from all sampled sizes from 41 0 µm to 379 5 µm the largest sampled mp particle could be computed from the recorded dimensions of plastic particles and the density of each polymer the total concentration of the mps sampled in this study was 45 5 ng l calculated from the estimated particle volume and the tabulated average density for each polymer as indicated in table s2 for this calculation fragments were assumed spherical with the diameter as the sphere with the same projected area for films slab shape assuming that the non recorded dimension was one tenth the lower recorded and for fibres cylindrical shape the experimental mass concentration of mps corresponds to usual concentration range reported for other micropollutants in water resources this includes pesticides other persistent chemicals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products tröger et al 2018 some studies reported mass concentration instead of the usual number concentration for mps in drinking water gomiero et al used pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pyr gc ms to analyse the content of nps 1 µm in the drinking water from a medium sized norwegian city and reported a total mass concentration in the 6 1 93 1 ng l range in line with our results gomiero et al 2021 kirstein et al tracked mps down to 6 6 µm in drinking water distribution systems by micro ftir and pyr gc ms and found average mps concentrations between zero and 22 19 mps m3 and mass concentrations in the 0 14 5 43 µg l kirstein et al 2021 3 2 particle size distributions particle size distributions for all the mps sampled in this work is given in fig 5 as cfd plots for size and mass the results showed that the power law can be applied for the lower sizes and separately for the larger ones the boundary was established using mle as indicated before the last particle for which the power law was applied included was a pes fragment of 192 7 µm and 5 2 µg the scaling parameter α was 1 78 0 14 for particle size and 1 25 0 10 for particle mass the intervals represent 95 confidence intervals calculated using bootstrapping with n 50 it is to be noted that the environmental concentrations documented so far in marine studies also follow a power law with exponents 1 6 as determined elsewhere kooi and koelmans 2019 it has been shown that in some cases the experimental data on mps abundance follow a power law distribution only for sizes above a given lower boundary cózar et al 2014 in such cases particle size distributions as number distributions or as probability density function usually display a maximum with a lower number of small particles than expected if all the distribution followed the same power law the maximum corresponds to different sizes depending on the study a fact that has been attributed to the difficulty of counting small particles or other variables like the distance to the nearest coast kaandorp et al 2021 in our case the power law behaviour applies for all particles 192 7 µm or 5 2 µg which allows performing estimations about the number and mass of particles in different size or mass ranges the procedure is based on the integration of the size distribution function which is obtained from the density function p x as follows 2 n x n p x where n is total number or number concentration of particles and n x the number of particles with sizes between x and x dx the mass of every individual particle is calculated from its equivalent diameter and the density of each polymer the details of the derivation are given as supplementary materials using the experimental data from our study the mass or particles between 40 9 µm the smaller one and 192 7 µm calculated as 55 1 µg the mass for other size ranges can be estimated even outside the experimental range by extrapolation to lower sizes assuming the same scaling parameter 1 78 0 14 can be applied our results predicted 1 8 1 7 2 0 ng l for particles 100 µm but only 68 31 140 fg l for nanoplastics nps 1 µm with boundaries calculated using the uncertainty of the scaling parameter it is well established that a series of entities satisfying eq 1 define a fractal the dimension of which is the exponent of its number size distribution turcotte 1986 a fragmentation process that gives rise to a fractal distribution is taken as evidence of scale invariance this means that fragments behave in a similar way was as parent particles or in other words they constitute a fractal because all parts are similar to the whole xu 2005 fractal fragmentation approaches based on multi step iterations foresee that the slope should approach 3 in 3d fragmentation as the probability of fragmentation increases therefore the slope relating the number of fragments with their size in double logarithmic coordinate system depends on the dimensionality of the fragmentation process and on the probability of fracturing which in turn depends on the fragility of the material a change in slope may mean a change in fractal dimension of in the probability of fragmentation but there are other possibilities for example the action of mechanisms draining small particles ingestion or large particles sedimentation also numerical bias due to the influence of a few large fragments the exact reason is still not clear and requires further studies mps break down eventually giving rise to nanoplastics nps which may induce toxicity after their internalization in living organisms and their cells li et al studied the presence of nps of different sizes 450 nm in tap water and quantified them using pyr gc ms the reported abundance for the size range 58 255 nm was 1 67 2 08 μg l li et al 2022 pyr gc ms is a complex technique still under development and the results are scarce and difficult to compare xu et al studied the presence of six synthetic polymers in ultrafiltrated 100 kda approx 10 nm surface water and groundwater and reported mass concentrations from 21 ng l to 0 793 μg l xu et al 2022 even if the scaling parameter reached 3 the limit of high fracture probability in 3d fragmentation our set of observed data would yield 5 ng l x 100 µm or 50 pg l x 1 µm from particle mass distribution fig 2b the total mass concentration of particles 5 µg would be 8 6 ng l in line with the estimations based on particle size distribution therefore our results suggest that the concentrations of nps in drinking water should be much below the ng l level to be consistent with scale invariant fractal fragmentation which would predict concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in the tens of pg l level or less this is true not only for the concentration of mps observed in this study but for most reported in the literature higher concentrations of nps can only be explained by some process that concentrates nps or assuming nps are directly produced from larger plastic particles following a non fractal mechanism in both cases the power law would not apply to nps and the abundance of nps would contradict the general assumption that small plastic fragments interact preferably with the biota and with other particles so that their concentration should be lower than expected from a scale invariant fragmentation pattern however this discussion is far to be closed because the fate of nps in aqueous matrixes is still poorly known and requires more research efforts the median mp concentration in untreated water sources was estimated in the thousands of particles per cubic meter with sizes usually 50 μm li et al 2020 the removal efficiency of mps dwtps using traditional technologies which include coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration is generally high typically 60 80 pivokonsky et al 2018 coagulation sedimentation alone has a removal efficiency of about 50 and performed better for the removal of fibres wang et al 2020 granular activated carbon gac filtration is more efficient for small sized mps so that mps 10 μm are not expected to be found in the effluents of sand filtration dalmau soler et al 2021 oxidation processes such as ozonation may increase the abundance of small 1 5 μm mps probably due to the fragmentation of larger particles cheng et al 2021 membrane filtration although more expensive is the preferred process to remove very small mps and nps from drinking water barbier et al 2022 shen et al 2020 our results included locations receiving water from desalination plants table s1 sm locations 4 and 6 did not show significant differences with other locations in which dwtps do not use membrane processes the fact that water treated by ultrafiltration reverse osmosis still contains mps has been noticed elsewhere and can be attributed to operational reasons like plastic unintentionally added during remineralization or plastic detached from polymeric membranes dalmau soler et al 2021 in our study the highest concentration of mps 77 mps m3 were obtained in tap water from a town receiving drinking water from the dwtp of santillana madrid that takes water from the same reservoir that receives wastewater at a distance of just 4 km this situation is common as most dwtps in our study take water from rivers or reservoirs receiving discharges from wwtps in this work we did not find any relationship between plastic concentration and water quality parameters including the use of water desalted by reverse osmosis our results suggest that the quality of water discharged by wastewater treatment plants is an important parameter influencing that of the drinking water produced after potabilization processes according to our study and considering a daily consumption of 1 5 l of tap water per day the annual intake would represent 6 8 mps per person and per year and per person with a global weight of 24 9 µg and somewhat higher amount of artificial fibres 17 6 per person and per year mainly dyed natural fibres and regenerated cellulose our results showed that tap water delivered by dwtps and conventional distribution systems under study do not represent a significant way of exposure to mp pollution and would probably pose a low risk for human health however it is true that the actual concentrations of mps and nps in drinking water are controversial because of reports differing orders of magnitude although part of the differences could be attributed to methodological reasons a high variability due to differences in water sources cannot be discarded besides the risks associated to mps in drinking are complex and can also be due to the increased exposure to pathogenic colonizing microorganisms including the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes to the internalization and possible accumulation of nps particles small enough to cross epithelial barriers and to the exposure to chemicals used as additives in the formulation of plastic materials martínez campos et al 2021 4 conclusions mps have received increasing attention as emerging pollutants in drinking water however the dispersion of results and methodological discrepancies among studies make it difficult to derive conclusions on their possible effects and risks for human health herein we performed an estimation of the total amount on plastic in drinking water both in number and mass concentration from the municipal water supply of eight locations in continental spain and the canary islands our results allowed identifying 10 types of synthetic polymers the most abundant of which were pa pes pp and with lower counts acr pe ptfe ps pu pvc and notably the biopolymer pla we also identified other anthropogenic materials mainly consisting of cellulose fibres with non natural colours and regenerated cellulose materials such as rayon or cellophane the average concentration of mps was 12 5 4 9 mps m3 and that of other artificial particles 32 2 12 5 aps m3 the particles identified as mps displayed sizes in the 41 0 379 5 µm range with a calculated total mass concentration of 45 5 ng l particle size and mass distributions followed a power law for sizes 192 7 µm which allowed performing estimations for the concentration of smaller particles provided the same scaling parameter of the power law applies the scaling parameter can be interpreted as the dimension of the fragmentation process based on this assumption the concentration of nps would be extremely low far below the ng l range our results showed that mps in drinking water do not represent a significant way of exposure to mps and would probably pose a low risk for human health besides results reporting concentrations of nps in drinking water in the ng l level are not consistent with scale invariant

14802,perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas are continuously accumulated in surface sediments due to extensive and long term application however the mechanisms through which disturbances induced by ship propeller jets at the riverbed cause secondary release of pfaas from sediments remain unclear in this study the effects of different propeller rotational speeds on pfaa migration release and distribution in multiphase media were investigated by performing indoor flume experiments combined with particle tracking velocimetry moreover key factors influencing pfaa migration and distribution were identified and partial least squares regression pls method was applied to develop quantitative prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics physicochemical parameters and pfaa distribution coefficients the total pfaa concentrations σpfaas in overlying water under propeller jet action exhibited transient characteristics and hysteresis with time after the disturbance in contrast the σpfaas in suspended particulate matter spm exhibited an upward trend throughout the process with consistent characteristics the spatial distribution trends of pfaas in overlying water and spm at different propeller rotational speeds featured vertical variability and axial consistency furthermore pfaa release from sediments was driven by axial flow velocity vx and reynolds normal stress ryy while pfaa release from porewater was inextricably linked to reynolds stresses rxx rxy and rzz p 0 05 pls regression models showed that variations in vorticity dissolved organic carbon and ph influenced the decreases in pfaa distribution coefficients between spm and overlying water kd sw as propeller rotational speed increased except for very long chain pfaas c 10 the increases in pfaa distribution coefficients between sediment and porewater kd sp were mainly determined by physicochemical parameters of sediments and the direct effect of hydrodynamics was relatively weak our study provides valuable information regarding the migration and distribution of pfaas in multiphase media under propeller jet disturbance both during and after disturbance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfaas hydrodynamic disturbance multiphase distribution particle tracking velocimetry environmental fate data availability i have shared data in the supplementary material 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have had widespread industrial and consumer applications since the second half of the 20th century due to the unique amphiphilicity caused by the hydrophilic heads functional groups and hydrophobic tail fluoroalkyl carbon chains savoca and pace 2021 tian et al 2018 as synthetic organic compounds with a long history of use pfaas which have emerged as global contaminants feature extremely stable chemical properties bioaccumulative effects and toxicity tian et al 2018 xiao 2017 pfaas have lower volatility and higher water solubility than other volatile organic pollutants which lead to the direct discharge of large quantities of pfaas into aquatic environments during long term production use and disposal yu et al 2022 subsequently pfaas gradually accumulate in sediments through sedimentation and adsorption making sediments the main sink and ultimately a receiving medium for pfaas ahmed et al 2020 hua et al 2021 however pfaas in contaminated sediments are highly susceptible to release through dissolution diffusion and resuspension processes chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020 resulting in the uncertain fate of pfaas in aquatic environments hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in the secondary release migration and transformation of contaminants tang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 presently the effects of natural hydrodynamics such as wind waves and currents which occur everywhere on conventional contaminants and some organic compounds have been extensively studied cheng and hua 2018 ding et al 2018 li and hua 2021 xu et al 2018 for example xu et al 2018 and ding et al 2018 reported the effects of wave induced liquefaction and wave heights on phosphorus release from sediments cheng and hua 2018 systematically explored the impacts of wind driven disturbances on the distribution release and removal of tetrabromobisphenol a however few studies have investigated the impact of unique hydrodynamic forces associated with anthropogenic activities including ship propeller jets on pfaa release a rotating propeller induces three types of velocity components in the axial tangential and radial directions causing the jet to scour the riverbed in addition to vortex and diffusion lam et al 2013 ryan et al 2013 the process is associated with high dynamic energy and significantly differs from the natural hydrodynamic forces that act in a single way hong et al 2016 tan and yüksel 2018 naturally exchange of pfaas at the sediment water interface can reach a dynamic equilibrium state after a certain period ahmed et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 a strong scour most likely triggers the secondary release of pfaas from the bottom sediment when the propeller jet breaks the equilibrium which are then continuously redistributed among multiphase media under the action of adsorption desorption partition dissolution and suspension precipitation processes feng et al 2020 a dense water system highly developed ship transportation industry and limited river width and water depth make it easier for propeller jets to reach the riverbed especially in a plain river network prn ma et al 2021 wei et al 2020 vertical walls constrain jet development in the lateral direction resulting in the slow decay of energy and increased disturbance distance however the changes in the environmental behavior of pfaas under such synergistic influences remain unknown therefore it is imperative to explore the migration and release of pfaas in sediment water systems under propeller jet disturbance to understand pfaa transport and fate in inland aquatic environments flow field measurement is essential for a clear description of flow phenomena the flow field induced by a propeller jet is complex and nonconstant and its development can be divided into flow establishment and established flow zones hamill and johnston 1993 currently single point measurement methods using laser doppler velocimetry ldv or acoustic doppler velocimetry adv are commonly applied to analyze variations in propeller jet velocities several indoor and field experiments have used ldv or adv to determine propeller jet velocity magnitude and a series of related prediction formulas have been proposed lam et al 2012 llull et al 2020 tan and yüksel 2018 in addition as a noncontact measurement technique particle image velocimetry piv can measure instantaneous velocity vectors on a fluid cross section and has been applied to propeller jet flow field measurements for example nardone et al 2014 used the piv technique to measure velocity distribution over a fixed bottom surface induced by a propeller jet in a flume liao et al 2015 used piv to calculate the mean flow velocity and reynolds stress in a near bed profile under propeller wash in a us navy harbor however such traditional techniques can only perform single point or planar measurements which do not capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of a propeller jet to completely reflect its complex three dimensional 3d flow field structure furthermore the unique dynamic features of the propeller jet suggest that it comprises various hydrodynamic elements including three velocity components vx vy and vz and mean velocity v which represent the velocity of the fluid average kinetic energy ake and reynolds stress that characterize turbulent flows and vorticity that reflects vortex characteristics johnston et al 2013 lam et al 2013 however the current findings do not specify which hydrodynamic elements trigger pfaa migration at the sediment water interface during propeller jet disturbances therefore a full flow field measurement for a transient flow is required to resolve the 3d flow field characteristics of the propeller jet particle tracking velocimetry ptv is a time resolved volumetric flow field measurement technique that uses the most advanced lagrangian particle tracking method shake the box to accurately track and characterize tracer particles bernhard 2012 daniel et al 2016 ptv resolution can be increased to the pixel level using numerous camera snapshots up to four cameras kähler et al 2012 which is particularly suitable for transient 3d measurements of propeller jet flow field characteristics however few studies have used ptv technology to measure hydraulic parameters of propeller jets and establish the relationship between hydraulic parameters and pfaa release in this study three model propeller rotational speeds were adjusted to simulate weak medium and strong jet disturbance strengths respectively and the flow fields induced by the rotational speeds were measured afterward overlying water suspended particulate matter spm porewater and sediment samples were collected and pfaa concentrations determined at several predetermined times and sections we aimed to investigate pfaa migration and release patterns and associated intrinsic mechanisms in a sediment water system under propeller jet disturbance by combining indoor flume tests with ptv technology the specific objectives were to 1 characterize the key hydrodynamic elements induced by the rotating propeller 2 investigate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of pfaas in overlying water and spm during and after propeller jet disturbance 3 elucidate the mechanisms associated with migration and distribution of pfaas in multiphase media and 4 develop quantitative prediction models of propeller jet characteristic parameters and pfaa distribution coefficients the results of this study provide insights into the release of endogenous organic pollutants and could facilitate the development of models for pfaa transport and fate in inland waterways 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the target pfaa standards 98 purity included four perfluorosulfonic acids c4 c8 pfsas pfbs pfhxs pfhps and pfos and seven perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids c6 c13 pfcas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfuda and pftrda isotopically labeled 13c4 pfos and 13c4 pfoa 98 purity were used as internal standards for calibration and standardization of all target pfaas shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 detailed information on the chemicals including abbreviations full names molecular structures and suppliers are provided in table s1 the solvents used for sample extraction and analyses were of hplc grade the sediments used in the experiments were collected in august 2020 from wangyu river 120 60 e 31 62 n in the taihu lake basin china all sediments were immediately transported to the laboratory in polypropylene pp buckets stones animals and plant residues were removed from the sediments which were then mixed thoroughly and stored at 4 subsequently the physicochemical parameters and target pfaa background concentrations 14 07 1 41 ng g dw of the mixed sediments were determined table s2 to better reflect the effect of propeller jet disturbance on pfaa release from the bottom sediment target pfaas were added to the sediments and then mixed uniformly so that the initial concentration of the various pfaas was approximately 200 ng g dw liu et al 2021 finally the homogenized sediments were used for subsequent experiments 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 contaminant release experiment the taihu lake basin in china which is a typical prn was selected to obtain basic information including waterway grade navigable capacity and ship tonnage and type that was used to determine the relevant parameters for the contaminant release experiment most waterways in the selected basin are classified as low grade waterways below class iii with narrow widths and shallow water depths china s inland navigation standard gb 50 139 2014 the ships navigating the waterway are dry bulk carriers of less than 1000 tons equipped with single three or four blade propellers with diameters of 0 80 1 60 m and draft depths of 1 30 2 90 m table s3 the limited water depth and successive passing ships cause continuous disturbance to the bottom sediment based on the information a four blade model propeller with a diameter of 6 cm was selected for the experiment and rotated at a fixed position to simulate continuous disturbance effects on the bottom sediment caused by the successive passage of ships in inland waterways afterward the draft depth of the model propeller under full load 9 20 11 25 cm was calculated using the diameter ratios of the evaluated and model propellers the rotational speed of the model propeller was determined based on the froude number similarity criterion penna et al 2019 that is the speed ratio is equal to the 0 5th power of the inverse ratio of the propeller diameter whereby the range of the model propeller speed was 730 30 1032 80 rpm three propeller rotational speeds n of 500 750 and 1000 rpm counterclockwise which corresponded to three experimental tests were selected to simulate weak medium and strong propeller jet strengths water flow in the prn is generally slow with a velocity of 0 30 0 50 m s even during the flood season lake taihu basin authority 2021 which is much lower than the initial velocity of the propeller jet therefore the present study focused on the effect of various hydrodynamic conditions on pfaa migration and release in a sediment water system under static water flow conditions thereafter a controllable flume experiment system was developed for simulating contaminant release under propeller jet disturbance the system included a flume l w h 1000 40 20 cm3 model propeller driving device and vertical lifting device energy dissipation measures for smooth water flow were set at the flume entrance and the water level was adjusted by controlling the tailgate discharge flow the experimental water depth and width of the flume were set to 15 cm and 40 cm respectively to simulate an inland waterway with a shallow water depth and narrow width the two ends of the flume were connected by pipes to maintain a constant water level during the experiment furthermore to prevent the influence of the hull on the propeller jet flow field structure the propeller was directly connected to the driving device and the propeller rotational speed was controlled by adjusting the motor speed the vertical distance between the propeller shaft center and the water surface was defined as the draft depth and could be adjusted using the vertical lifting device the homogenized sediments for the experiments were placed in a flat tank l w h 140 40 5 cm3 at the bottom of the flume fig 1a the pump was then turned on to gradually fill the flume with tap water to a depth of 15 cm the propeller shaft was positioned in the middle of the flume and 11 cm away from the water surface while the propeller tail was fixed at the beginning of the sediment laying area in each test overlying water and sediment samples were collected after 12 h of sediment resting under water pressure to determine the background concentrations of pfaas in multiphase media the sampling time points were set according to the variations in the entire sediment initiation resuspension and sedimentation processes in a pre experiment specifically five collection sections were set in the axial direction at 10 40 60 100 and 140 cm from the propeller surface after the propeller was rotated continuously for 2 min and three sampling sites were set in each section at 2 8 and 14 cm from the riverbed in addition a 100 cm section was selected and water samples were collected again after 10 min of disturbance and at 5 and 30 min after propeller disturbance was stopped a water suction pump was designed to collect water samples and a vacuum pump was connected to three pp tubes diameter of 6 mm using a four way valve each tube corresponded to a sampling site and was connected to a separate pp bottle water samples were collected automatically for approximately 40 s when the vacuum pump was turned on sediment samples were collected 30 min after propeller disturbance was stopped at 1 4 and 1 2 of the flume width in the transverse direction of the five collection sections a cylindrical sampler diameter of 28 mm was designed and used for sediment sample collection relevant water quality parameters were immediately measured in situ using a portable multiparameter meter sonde hq30d hach loveland co usa all samples were immediately sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for pfaa analysis 2 2 2 hydrodynamic shooting experiment ptv flowmaster 4d ptv lavision gmbh göttingen germany was used to measure 3d velocity vectors of the fluid induced by the propeller jet in the flume fig 1b the ptv velocity measurement system mainly consisted of a minishaker module led flashlight 300 calibration plate type 204 15 20 20 cm2 tracer particles 60 μm and davis 10 0 the minishaker module was equipped with five sets of lenses with focal lengths of 4 8 12 16 and 25 mm which required to be selected based on the volume measurements the area of interest aoi was adjusted to 896 656 pixels corresponding to a measurement volume of 23 16 15 cm3 l w h in davis 10 0 to achieve a frame rate of 510 fps notably a high frame rate can be achieved to capture high displacement particles with a reduced aoi although the measured volume reduces therefore to capture the high speed jet near the propeller and ensure a specific shooting range we selected 8 mm lenses and set the aoi size appropriate amounts of tracer particles were then poured and evenly distributed in the flume to characterize water flow a perspective camera calibration was performed to complete mapping between camera image coordinates and world coordinates the average deviation of each lens in all views was 0 10 pixels after the calculation of mapping functions indicating that the calibration results were reliable afterward the four lenses were set to single frame mode with an exposure time of 1000 μs and a pulse intensity of 700 μs for the led flashlight two thousand particle images were recorded in approximately 4 s for each test the recorded files were selected and the time filter used to delete background noise from the images subsequently the pre processed particle images were subjected to volume self calibration to eliminate any remaining calibration errors volume self calibration quality was evaluated based on average and maximum disparity values which were 0 06 and 0 09 voxels respectively and were within acceptable limits finally shake the box procedure was conducted to calculate particle tracks and other parameters within 20 10 15 cm3 l w h due to the high speed of the propeller jet and the long development distance in the axial direction the entire flow field could not be displayed within the scope of one shoot therefore each test was shot again behind the initial measurement position with the same test conditions thereby recording a total of 4000 sets of data moreover the average flow field of each test in 40 10 15 cm3 l w h was obtained by averaging the 4000 sets of data which represented the actual flow field of the propeller jet all flow field files were exported into tecplot 2021 for subsequent plotting 2 3 sample extraction and analysis the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filters whatman gf c sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to obtain spm and overlying water samples the concentrations of suspended solids css were calculated by weighing the fiber membranes before and after filtration dissolved organic carbon doc ca2 and mg2 contents in overlying water were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena gmbh thuringia germany and an atomic absorption spectrometer pinaacle 500 perkinelmer singapore in addition wet sediment samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to separate porewater and sediment samples detailed sample separation and pfaa extraction methods can be found in our previous study ma et al 2021 briefly the filtered overlying water and porewater samples were extracted using waters oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg waters corporation milford ma usa while spm and sediment samples were extracted by ultrasonic extraction based on the method described by tian et al 2018 the extracts were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer triple quad 4500 ab sciex foster city ca usa details of the instrumental analysis and mass spectrometric analysis parameters of pfaas are provided in text s1 and table s4 respectively particle size distributions of sediments were measured using mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the abbreviations and description of the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 field membrane solvent and procedure blanks were used to monitor potential contamination during transport pretreatment and instrumental analysis in which no target contaminants exceeding the limits of detection lods were detected native compounds were quantified based on a standard series of 5 400 μg l with regression coefficients of each pfaa standard curve being 0 99 and relative standard deviation 20 the internal standards were used to calibrate and standardize target pfaas the lods and limits of quantification were set as signal to noise ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively table s5 the matrix spiked recoveries in the solid and dissolved phases were within the acceptable ranges of 82 55 127 04 and 79 30 113 50 respectively table s5 2 4 data analyses pfaa content per unit area in each phase was quantified based on pfaa concentrations in

propeller axis direction corresponding to the propeller surface and the y and z axes indicating the vertical and lateral directions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 propeller jet characteristics and physicochemical properties 3 1 1 propeller jet characteristics the flow field structure characteristics of the propeller jet can be preliminarily understood by observing tracer particle trajectories particle trajectories observed in the three tests at a specific time period are illustrated in fig s1 the particles near the riverbed moved in the positive direction along the x axis while particles in the upper layer moved in the opposite direction resulting in a counterclockwise flow cycle vortices were generated between the two layers of particles moving in opposite directions particle paths moving at high speed along the x axis in both the forward and reverse directions increased significantly white particles with an increase in n and the stratification between the bottom and upper particle layers became more pronounced to elucidate the changes in the structural characteristics of the flow field at different rotational speeds ten and six slices of the axial velocity field were intercepted at equal distances along the x and y axes respectively fig 2 a comparison of different slices in the same test revealed that hydrodynamic actions e g scour turbulent diffusion shear and vortices gradually weakened as the propeller jet developed along the x axis figs 2a and s2 for example when n 500 rpm the maximum values of vx ake rxx and vorticity decreased by 93 02 92 86 94 44 and 69 68 respectively as the distance from the paddle surface increased from 0 to 40 cm a comparison of the same slice in different tests showed that hydrodynamic strength was significantly enhanced with an increase in n for example the maximum values of vx ake rxx and vorticity for the first slice increased by 39 53 242 86 161 11 and 68 34 figs 2a and s2 respectively as n increased from 500 to 1000 rpm with regard to the vertical distribution of the propeller jet flow field y 100 50 cm the structural characteristics at different rotational speeds were relatively consistent fig 2b water flow was almost positive along the x axis when y was in the 100 30 cm range and hydrodynamic strength was gradually weakened from the bed surface to the upper layer water flow was reversed along the x axis when y was in the 30 50 cm range and hydrodynamic strength was weaker at the water surface the development distances of the propeller jet along the x and y axes in the three tests were approximately 30 and 7 cm respectively indicating that jet development ranges induced by different rotational speeds were relatively stable at the same draft depth however hydrodynamic force acting on the same horizontal slice was significantly enhanced with an increase in n to better reflect the changes in hydrodynamic strengths in the vertical direction the ranges 100 50 cm 50 0 cm and 0 50 cm along the y axis were defined as the bottom middle and upper flow field zones respectively the relevant statistical values mean maximum minimum and median values of vx ake rxx vorticity and others of each hydrodynamic parameter in the corresponding zone at different rotational speeds are listed in table s6 for example the mean values of vx ake rxx and vorticity at 1000 rpm in the bottom zone were 1 66 2 39 2 89 and 1 06 times higher than those at 500 rpm respectively notably jet strength on the left side of the propeller facing upstream from the propeller surface was stronger than that on the right side in all tests fig 2 the phenomenon could be attributed to the counterclockwise rotation of the propeller used in this study in turn resulting in more pronounced scour on the left side of the propeller due to the synergistic effect of the tangential velocity component the observation was verified by a relatively large scour hole on the left side of the propeller in the experiment fig 1c a similar phenomenon has been reported by penna et al 2019 who observed that scour topographic profile is related to the rotation direction of propellers 3 1 2 physicochemical properties to analyze changes in the physicochemical properties of overlying water under different hydrodynamic conditions the values obtained in each test for samples collected at the five sections at 2 min of propeller disturbance were averaged table s7 the dissolved oxygen do values obtained at 500 750 and 1000 rpm were 6 93 0 18 7 32 0 04 and 7 42 0 04 mg l respectively due to intense propeller jet disturbance that rapidly replenished oxygen in overlying water similarly the oxidation reduction potential orp in overlying water increased from 157 33 14 23 to 216 97 4 08 mv while ph decreased from 7 63 0 01 to 7 27 0 02 in addition sediment resuspension characteristics were significantly affected by hydrodynamics the bottom sediments were suspended in large quantities as jet strength was enhanced with css values at 750 rpm 184 38 29 90 mg l and 1000 rpm 615 85 132 04 mg l being 5 60 and 18 70 times higher than those at 500 rpm 32 94 11 14 mg l respectively in addition to the intensification of the resuspension process inorganic salts and organic matter in bottom sediments were released into overlying water in turn resulting in decreases in salinity sal total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec in the sediment to varying degrees table s8 ca2 mg2 and doc concentrations in overlying water increased by 16 94 37 29 and 26 45 respectively notably the orp in the sediment increased from 84 91 17 99 to 174 54 61 17 mv with an increase in n which may be due to the severe damage of the sediment surface caused by enhanced jet strengths leading to supplementation of sediment oxygen with do and ultimately an increase in orp the results indicate that variations in jet strength induced by different propeller rotational speeds affect the physicochemical properties of the sediment water system the variations in physicochemical properties of overlying water with time 0 2 10 s5 and s30 min in each test are listed in table s9 the physicochemical parameters of the overlying water before and after the propeller jet disturbance varied considerably the variations in orp do doc and css gradually stabilized after the propeller was stopped until they basically returned to the undisturbed levels after 30 min however ph mg2 and ca2 levels in each test exhibited gradual increasing trends after the propeller was stopped 3 2 jet induced spatiotemporal trends of pfaas in overlying water and spm the background concentrations of pfaas in overlying water and spm which were determined before propeller jet disturbance were relatively low background concentrations were deducted from the experiment data to determine the net pfaa concentrations and contents in spm and overlying water at various propeller rotational speeds 3 2 1 dissolution of pfaas into overlying water and key drivers the variations in pfaa concentrations cw and contents φw in overlying water with rotational speed at each time point 2 10 s5 and s30 min are shown in fig 3 a comparison of the different time points revealed that the most significant time point with differences in cw and φw among the three tests was at 2 min of propeller disturbance during which the total concentrations σcw and contents of pfaas σφw at 1000 rpm were 4 37 and 3 66 times higher than those observed at 500 rpm and 750 rpm respectively based on the composition profile of pfaas fig s3a the contribution of pfsas 45 was smaller than that of pfcas 55 at 500 rpm which is associated with the heavy molecular weight and hydrophobic nature of the sulfonic acid group so3h of pfsas when compared to the carboxylic acid group cooh of pfcas gao et al 2020 however the contribution of pfsas 50 was comparable to that of pfcas 50 at high propeller rotational speeds suggesting that the enhanced propeller jet disturbance caused an almost equal dissolution of pfsas and pfcas into the overlying water furthermore the proportions of long chain pfaas c 7 at 500 750 and 1000 rpm were 49 59 and 63 respectively which were progressively greater than those of short chain pfaas c 7 51 41 and 36 the results indicate that long chain pfaas c 7 were more sensitive to the changes in propeller jet strengths the σcpfaas c 7 was lower than σcpfaas c 7 at weak propeller jet strength but gradually increased and exceeded σcpfaas c 7 as the jet strength was enhanced the phenomenon could be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of long chain pfaas c 7 which makes them require high threshold conditions for release liu et al 2021 the dissolution of large amounts of long chain pfaas c 7 into overlying water was only triggered when the propeller jet strength reached the threshold in addition the variations in cw and φw among the three tests decreased with disturbance time but maintained overall differences of 1 34 3 75 times the differences decreased further when the propeller was stopped until the variations in σφw were 64 71 143 37 μg m2 30 min after the propeller was stopped the variations in cw and φw with time in each test were consistent fig 4a during disturbance the σcw and σφw values at 2 min were higher than those observed at 10 min indicating that the propeller jet triggered rapid dissolution of high concentrations of pfaas into overlying water cw and φw decreased rapidly within 5 min after stopping propeller disturbance the reason for the observation could be because the bottom sediments were no longer resuspended after propeller disturbance was stopped however the already dissolved pfaas in overlying water diffused in all directions and were partially adsorbed onto spm thereby causing decreases in cw and φw however cw and φw increased after stopping propeller disturbance for 30 min which could be explained by the following aspects first intense propeller disturbance destroyed the initially stable physical structure of the sediment forming scour holes with varying depths and leading to the exposure of sediment surface to varying degrees fig 1c pfaas in sediment and porewater were then consistently released into overlying water through the exposed areas second the downward scouring by the rotating propeller extruded the sediment hong et al 2016 liao et al 2015 pressure accumulated as scour time increased and in turn enhanced pfaa dissolution into overlying water after the disturbance ended the diffusion and adsorption of pfaas in overlying water gradually stabilized and the overall dilution effect was not as strong as the bottom release which eventually led to increases in cw and φw the corresponding vertical distribution of cw at each time point further verified our observation fig 4b a negligible difference was observed in cw among the three overlying water layers during disturbance due to the violent mixing effect caused by the propeller cw in the bottom layer began to increase gradually when the propeller was stopped and was significantly higher than that in the middle and upper layers after 30 min p 0 05 however cw in the middle and upper layers varied slightly after stopping the propeller the observations suggest that sediment and porewater consistently released pfaas into overlying water after the propeller was stopped causing cw in the bottom layer to rebound significantly therefore increases in cw and φw were observed 30 min after stopping propeller disturbance fig 4a the distribution process of pfaas in overlying water during the whole time period indicates that pfaa dissolution into overlying water under propeller jet disturbance was characterized by instantaneous scouring and hysteresis after disturbance to further investigate the variations in φw per unit time the absolute rates of φw φw for each test were calculated fig s4a according to the results the variations in φw with propeller rotational speed during disturbance followed the order of φw3 φw2 φw1 indicating that a high propeller rotational speed triggered rapid pfaa dissolution into overlying water the φw value decreased continuously after stopping propeller disturbance and was almost the same in the three tests suggesting that φw remained constant after propeller jet disturbance ended regardless of the jet strength during the disturbance the distribution of cw in the vertical direction at 2 min of disturbance was relatively uniform whereas slight variations were observed among the different sections fig 4c during the initial propeller jet development a low velocity zone occurred at the shaft centerline due to the paddle hub lam et al 2011 resulting in uneven mixing of overlying water among the bottom middle and upper layers of the sections at 10 cm consequently a significantly lower cw was observed in the bottom layer than in the middle and upper layers owing to its proximity to the paddle shaft as the jet continued to develop in the axial direction paddle hub influence decreased gradually the laterally diffused high velocity flow mixed with the low velocity flow and the cross sectional cw became uniform the cw in the bottom layer gradually began to dominate until the influence completely disappeared after more than 10 d 60 cm based on the overall distribution trend the variation trends of cw and φw in the various sections plateaued 750 rpm from a gradually increasing trend 500 rpm with an increase in n and finally exhibited an initial increasing trend and then a decreasing trend at 1000 rpm the observation could be associated with the counterclockwise water circulation caused by the propeller jet figs 2 and s1 pfaas in the downstream section supplemented the upstream section during disturbance and the backflow phenomenon became increasingly evident with an increase in n in turn making the peak sections of cw and φw to gradually approach the paddle surface to identify the key hydrodynamic and physicochemical parameters affecting φw at different rotational speeds a correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between each parameter and the mean σφw in the five collection sections the results showed that the normal additional stress ryy and tangential additional stress rxy were significantly positively correlated with φw p 0 05 indicating that the variations in φw at different rotational speeds were mainly influenced by ryy and rxy the observation could be attributed to the pulsating turbulent water flow caused by rotating propeller blades and reynolds stresses with six independent components were generated during momentum transport table s6 among them the ryy and rxy in the water depth direction y axis promoted pfaa dissolution into the overlying water furthermore css mg2 and ca2 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with φw while ph was negatively correlated with φw p 0 01 as described in section 3 1 css mg2 and ca2 concentrations in overlying water increased significantly with an increase in n while ph exhibited a decreasing trend css reflected the degree of sediment resuspension and high pfaa amounts in the sediment and porewater were released into overlying water as resuspension intensified the mg2 and ca2 released into overlying water exerted a bridging effect that caused an increase in φw du et al 2014 in addition ph changes in water mainly depended on the carbonic acid balance conrads et al 2018 the fast rotating propeller blades introduced abundant oxygen and carbon dioxide into the overlying water from the air carbon dioxide reacted with water to produce h leading to a decrease in ph fassbender et al 2017 the availability of supplemental oxygen accelerated oxidative decomposition of organic matter in turn producing more carbon dioxide that dissolved in water taguchi and fujiwara 2010 the low ph of water facilitated electrostatic attraction of dissolved substances to anionic pfaas du et al 2014 the results indicate that a high rotational speed can affect φw by simultaneously enhancing turbulence pulsation and modifying the physicochemical parameters of overlying water 3 2 2 adsorption of pfaas onto spm and key drivers the concentrations cs and contents φs of various pfaas in spm exhibited an upward trend with an increase in n at all time points 2 10 s5 and s30 min fig 5 cs among the three tests varied slightly however φs exhibited significant differences p 0 05 which could be because φs is determined by both cs and css eq 2 and a considerable increase in css was the primary reason for the significant increase in φs pfaa composition and distribution patterns in each test were similar and were dominated by long chain pfaas c 7 the average proportion of short chain pfaas c 7 was 11 54 for example based on pfaa concentration profiles at 2 min of propeller disturbance fig s3b long chain pfaas c 7 accounted for 82 94 of the total pfaa concentrations with an increase in n while the proportion of short chain pfsas c 7 decreased from 18 to 5 and the proportion of short chain pfcas c 7 was negligible the results could be attributed to the weak adsorption capacity of short chain pfaas c 7 pereira et al 2018 which was not conducive to their adsorption onto spm under enhanced jet strength contrary to the temporal distribution pattern of pfaas in overlying water cs values obtained in each test exhibited an increasing trend from the beginning to the end of the disturbance while φs values decreased fig 6a the variation trend of φs was consistent with that of css fig s5 with a maximum value being observed 2 min at propeller jet disturbance subsequently spm diffusion and sedimentation occurred to varying degrees and css decreased continuously the average css 30 min at stopping the propeller was 87 88 lower than that observed at 2 min at propeller disturbance furthermore the continuous increase in cs could be due to the fact that spm gradually disintegrated into smaller particles under strong hydrodynamic action of the propeller jet cheng and hua 2016 although some spm with relatively large particle sizes was deposited due to gravity spm with relatively small particles and large specific surface areas in overlying water continued to adsorb pfaas especially the more hydrophobic long chain pfaas c 7 regarding vertical distribution fig 6b cs followed the bottom middle upper trend during disturbance the cs in the middle and upper layers was stable when propeller disturbance was stopped while cs in the bottom layer increased the results revealed that the continuous release of pfaas from sediment and porewater after the disturbance was stopped led to the increase in cs in the bottom layer the distribution process of pfaas in spm during the whole time period suggests that pfaa adsorption onto spm under propeller jet disturbance was characterized by persistence the variation trend of φs in spm per unit time φs was similar to that in overlying water fig s4b with a maximum value being observed at 2 min of propeller jet disturbance followed by a decrease however φs exhibited significant differences in φs3 φs2 φs1 among the three propeller rotational speeds both during and after propeller jet disturbance p 0 05 the results suggest that the variations in jet strength induced by different propeller rotational speeds consistently affected φs with strong jet strength resulting in rapid φs the observation could be attributed to the enhanced hydrodynamic forces leading to increased spm fragmentation which in turn increased adsorption sites for pfaas notably sediment resuspension ended after propeller jet disturbance was stopped and pfaas with increased proportions in spm mainly originated from overlying water however φw was almost the same at this time point among the three propeller rotational speeds fig s4a suggesting that pfaa replenishment rate in overlying water from sediment and porewater was comparable to the adsorption rate of pfaas onto spm from overlying water therefore φs exhibited significant differences among the three propeller rotational speeds after stopping propeller disturbance while φw varied slightly the vertical distribution characteristics of cs at different rotational speeds varied considerably at 2 min of propeller jet disturbance fig 6c the cs in the bottom layer of each collection section increased significantly as the n value increased and cs stratification among the bottom middle and upper layers gradually became pronounced which could be due to the variations in time and amount of sediment resuspended at different levels of jet strength relatively strong jet strengths can rapidly damage the water sediment interface thereby prompting the release of more pfaas from sediment and porewater at the same disturbance time 2 min the advantage of the proximity of the bottom spm to the source was manifested when more pfaas were adsorbed per gram of spm in addition the overall variation trend of φs in the axial direction was consistent with that of φw where the peak section gradually approached the paddle surface as the n value increased similar to overlying water correlation analysis showed that the mean σφs in the five collection sections was significantly positively correlated with ryy and rxy at different rotational speeds p 0 05 ake which comprehensively reflects the velocity of water flow in all directions exhibited a strong correlation with φs p 0 05 the average ake increased by 134 82 as the n value increased leading to substantial sediment resuspension and a significant increase in φs significant correlations were observed between physicochemical parameters and φs in which css mg2 and ca2 concentrations were positively correlated with φs while ph exhibited a negative correlation with φs p 0 05 3 3 jet driven release of pfaas from sediment and porewater pfaa concentrations and contents released from sediment and porewater in each test are shown in fig s6 and were calculated by subtracting values obtained after disturbance from background values measured before disturbance the values of the total pfaas released from the sediment σφd at the end of propeller jet disturbance at 500 750 and 1000 rpm ranged from 25 47 to 32 58 mg m2 50 50 to 85 44 mg m2 and 119 30 to 137 61 mg m2 fig s6a respectively the σφd increased significantly with an increase in n p 0 05 and exhibited an overall exponentially increasing trend in addition pfca release was constantly higher than that of pfsas in all tests indicating that pfcas were more readily released from the sediment under propeller jet disturbance which is consistent with previous findings liu et al 2021 however the proportion of pfcas decreased gradually from 61 to 53 as n increased whereas that of pfsas increased from 38 to 47 fig s3c the results corresponded to the trends of pfsa and pfca dissolved into overlying water suggesting that enhanced propeller jet strength reduced the effects resulting from differences in physicochemical properties between pfsas and pfcas upon their release regarding planar distribution the φd at the 1 2 axis was significantly higher than at the 1 4 axis at 500 rpm p 0 05 with the mean σφd of each collection section at the 1 2 axis being 1 96 times higher than that at the 1 4 axis fig s7 the results suggest that propeller jet scours on the sediment at the 1 2 axis were stronger than those at the 1 4 axis at 500 rpm resulting in a high φd at the 1 2 axis in contrast the variations in φd between the 1 4 and 1 2 axes decreased gradually as n increased and the variations in φd were almost identical at 1000 rpm fig s7 this could be due to the uniformity of jet strength in the transverse direction as the n value increased fig 2b thereby reducing the variations in φd in the transverse direction the variations in pfaa concentrations cp and contents φp released from porewater in the three tests are shown in fig s6b generally contaminant concentration in porewater is determined based on the competition between its diffusion and desorption rates xie et al 2016 pfaas in porewater continuously diffused into overlying water due to the concentration gradient and sediment resuspension thereby resulting in a decrease in cp pfaas in the sediment desorbed to a certain extent to replenish pfaa content in porewater chen et al 2016 the cp and φp values obtained in all the three tests were positive indicating that pfaa content in porewater generally reduced after the propeller jet effect that is pfaa diffusion rate was greater than the desorption rate notably the enhanced jet strength substantially promoted pfaa release from porewater with linear increases of 1863 70 365 47 μg m2 3146 07 502 74 μg m2 and 4279 50 279 25 μg m2 being observed in σφp at 500 750 and 1000 rpm respectively p 0 05 the φp of short chain pfsas c 7 exhibited significant changes increasing by 105 34 and 285 26 at 750 rpm and 1000 rpm respectively when compared to those observed at 500 rpm fig s3d the release of contaminants from sediments and porewater is primarily associated with hydrodynamic actions at the sediment water interface cheng and hua 2018 therefore correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters at the bottom zone y 100 70 cm and σφd and σφp the results showed that σφd was significantly positively correlated with vx and ryy while σφp was inextricably linked to reynolds stresses rxx rxy and rzz p 0 05 previous studies have revealed that vx is the primary cause of sediment surface scour initiation and resuspension induced by the propeller jet lam et al 2010 ryan et al 2013 the effect of ryy on pfaa release from sediments was also taken into consideration in addition increases in rxx rzz and rxy with an increase in jet strength facilitated advective porewater flow and diffusion xie et al 2016 in turn promoting the exchange and release of pfaas from porewater no significant correlation was observed between physicochemical parameters of sediments and σφd and σφp suggesting that pfaa release from sediment and porewater was only associated with jet strength 3 4 variations in jet strength affect pfaa partitioning behavior the distribution coefficients kd sw and kd sp were used to describe pfaa distribution between spm overlying water and sediment porewater respectively at the end of the experiment fig 7 pfhxa and pftrda had the minimum and maximum log kd sw values in all the tests fig 7a specifically the log kd sw values with a high n value ranged from 1 25 0 34 to 3 90 0 21 l kg 1 13 0 19 to 4 42 0 15 l kg and 0 78 0 22 to 5 13 0 17 l kg the averaged log kd sw values of both c4 c8 pfsas pfbs pfos and c6 c13 pfcas pfhxa pftrda exhibited significant positive correlations with carbon chain lengths at the three propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic effects influenced pfaa distribution between spm and overlying water under propeller jet disturbance a comparison of the distribution coefficients of pfsas and pfcas with the same cf2 groups such as pfhxs pfhpa cf2 5 pfhps pfoa cf2 6 and pfos pfna cf2 7 revealed that pfsas consistently exhibited high log kd sw values the observation could be attributed to the fact that sulfonic acid groups possess a higher adsorption potential than carboxylic acid groups thereby enhancing pfsa adsorption onto oxide surfaces when compared to pfcas under the same conditions gao et al 2020 the results suggest that the variations in the distribution of different types of pfaas between spm and overlying water are closely associated with the functional groups sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups however the log kd sw values of the same pfaas exhibited considerable variations at different propeller rotational speeds the log kd sw values of each pfaa c 10 significantly decreased with an increase in propeller rotational speed especially for pfbs pfhxs pfhps pfoa and pfna p 0 05 in contrast the log kd sw values of the very long chain pfaas c 10 increased significantly with an increase in propeller rotational speed p 0 05 the results indicate that jet disturbance significantly affected the partitioning behavior of pfaas between spm and overlying water with enhanced jet strength promoting the adsorption of very long chain pfaas c 10 onto spm while the remaining pfaas c 10 tended to dissolve into the overlying water the log kd sp values obtained at 500 750 and 1000 rpm ranged from 0 23 0 07 pfbs to 2 21 0 34 pftrda l kg 0 42 0 16 pfhxa to 2 77 0 09 pftrda l kg and 0 41 0 10 pfoa to 2 91 0 02 pftrda l kg fig 7b respectively similarly significant positive correlations were observed between log kd sp values and carbon chain lengths of pfaas at the three propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 the results suggest that pfaa distribution between the sediment and porewater was also influenced by hydrophobicity the log kd sp values of pfaas except for pfhpa and pfoa increased significantly with an increase in n p 0 05 suggesting that enhanced propeller jet strength promoted pfaa distribution in porewater furthermore the target pfaas did not include c4 pfcas perfluorobutanoic acid pfba which exhibits a specific partitioning behavior in the environment rahman et al 2014 previous studies have reported that the distribution coefficients of pfba between solid and dissolved phases including kd sw and kd sp are higher than those of pfhxa li and hua 2021 ma et al 2021 indicating that pfba is more readily adsorbed onto the solid phase than pfhxa therefore it is speculated that the tendency of pfba distribution in the dissolved phase will be weaker than that of pfhxa under enhanced jet strength 3 5 prediction models of pfaa distribution coefficients to elucidate the partitioning behavior of pfaas between spm overlying water and sediment porewater prediction models were developed with log kd sw and log kd sp values of five types of pfaas as the dependent variables 10 hydrodynamic parameters and several physicochemical parameters as the independent variables as shown in tables s10 and s11 the r2x cum r2y cum and q2 cum values of the models were 0 50 and the differences between r2y cum and q2 cum were 0 30 the results of 200 permutation tests showed that the r2y cum and q2 cum intercepts were 0 40 and 0 05 respectively regression analysis between the observed and predicted values of log kd sw and log kd sp for five types of pfaas revealed that the values were distributed around the 1 1 line and within the 95 prediction band r 0 80 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicate that the developed models were accurate and feasible for the prediction of distribution coefficients of pfaas between spm overlying water and sediment porewater under propeller jet disturbance the developed prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics and physicochemical parameters of overlying water and log kd sw values for five types of pfaas were as follows log k d s w pfsas c 7 4 66 11 23 r x x 62 24 r x y 8 98 r y y 0 25 v o r t

projection vip value represents the explanatory importance of the independent variable to all dependent variables and a vip 1 indicates a critical independent variable tang et al 2019 based on the vip values of each variable table s10 vorticity doc and ph were identified as the key variables that significantly affected pfaa distribution between spm overlying water at different propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 the correlations between log kd sw values and vorticity doc and ph were determined based on their signs in the corresponding prediction equation the signs for vorticity were negative in the prediction equations for pfaas except for the very long chain pfaas c 10 suggesting that their log kd sw values decreased with an increase in vorticity vorticity characterizes the speed of fluid rotation and its mean value increased from 6 05 to 7 73 1 s as n value increased table s6 indicating an acceleration of the rotational water flow rosi et al 2014 although the process intensified mutual contact between spm and overlying water only very long chain pfaas c 10 with strong hydrophobicity were readily adsorbed onto spm while the remaining pfaas that were relatively less hydrophobic tended to be distributed in overlying water the negative sign of doc observed in all equations indicates that the increase in doc concentrations in overlying water caused more pfaas to dissolve which is consistent with the findings of previous study hua et al 2022 large amounts of macromolecular organic matter released as adsorbents compete with spm for the sorption of pfaas du et al 2014 furthermore dissolved organic matter can spontaneously aggregate to form microgels that capture pfaas under high doc concentrations li et al 2022 the positive sign for ph in the predicted equations for pfaas except for the very long chain pfaas c 10 indicated that their log kd sw values decreased with decreasing ph which could be associated with the abundant divalent cations in overlying water studies have shown that a decrease in ph decreases the basic sites on the adsorbent surface for binding divalent cations du et al 2014 therefore ca2 and mg2 released in large quantities along with sediment resuspension cannot efficiently bind to the spm surface however they dissociate in overlying water to increase pfaa dissolution by a bridging effect overall the variations in vorticity doc and ph with increasing n led to the distribution of most target pfaas except for very long chain pfaas c 10 in overlying water which was indicated by a decrease in log kd sw values the developed prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics and physicochemical parameters of sediments and log kd sp values for five types of pfaas were as follows log k d s p pfsas c 7 0 68 24 56 r x y

criterion of vip 1 the key factors influencing pfaa distribution between sediment and porewater at different propeller rotational speeds were identified as sal tds and ec p 0 05 table s11 the increases in log kd sp values of pfaas with increasing n values were mainly associated with the variations in physicochemical parameters of sediments while the direct effect of hydrodynamics was relatively weak the negative signs for sal tds and ec in the equations implied that soluble inorganic salts and organic matter content in sediments significantly decreased as n increased table s8 thereby resulting in preferential pfaa distribution in porewater this could be because soluble inorganic salts can enhance pfaa adsorption onto sediments through electrical double layer compression surface charge neutralization and divalent cation bridging du et al 2014 the enrichment of pfaas by soluble organic matter has been widely reported higgins and luthy 2006 li et al 2022 the progressively enhanced jet strength resulted in a continuous flow of soluble inorganic salts and organic matter from the sediment into the dissolved phase in addition to substantial loss of pfaas another possible explanation could be that the experimental sediments largely consisted of silt and sand table s2 which were easily liquefied into fine particles and suspended in porewater under strong jet scour leading to the distribution of pfaas in porewater jia et al 2014 xu et al 2018 3 6 applications our results suggest that although the transient rapid release of pfaas during propeller jet disturbance occurred mainly through resuspension and turbulent diffusion we observed that the slow and sustained pfaa release caused by molecular diffusion after propeller disturbance was critical to the overall distribution of pfaas in overlying water and spm although the total pfaa contents in spm were not as high as those in overlying water under propeller jet disturbance the continuous increase in pfaa concentrations with time implies that the spm likely retained pfaas released from sediment and porewater in the water column for a long time and then transported with flowing water in practice waterway sediments may be subject to frequent and violent ship propeller disturbances therefore the effects of ship propeller jets during and after disturbance are expected to strongly influence the migration and transportation of pfaas in inland waterway sediment water systems which may pose additional risks to aquatic environments 4 conclusion the present study established the link between propeller jet characteristics and pfaa release and distribution using indoor flume experiments and ptv as well as comprehensively analyzed pfaa migration and partitioning behavior under propeller jet disturbance our results showed that flow field structures at low medium and high propeller rotational speeds were similar whereas jet induced scours turbulent diffusion shear and vortex strengths increased significantly the progressive increase in jet strength substantially promoted pfaa release from sediment and porewater and reduced the effect resulting from differences in physicochemical properties between pfsas and pfcas upon their release however the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of the released pfaas in overlying water and spm exhibited considerable differences moreover variations in vorticity doc and ph promoted the adsorption of very long chain pfaas c 10 onto spm as the propeller rotational speed increased while the other pfaas tended to dissolve into overlying water the decreases in sal tds and ec in sediments resulted in the preferential distribution of pfaas in porewater rather than sediments our study reveals the mechanisms underlying propeller jet induced release and distribution of pfaas in sediment water systems which enhances our understanding of pfaa transport and fate in inland waterways credit authorship

14802,perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas are continuously accumulated in surface sediments due to extensive and long term application however the mechanisms through which disturbances induced by ship propeller jets at the riverbed cause secondary release of pfaas from sediments remain unclear in this study the effects of different propeller rotational speeds on pfaa migration release and distribution in multiphase media were investigated by performing indoor flume experiments combined with particle tracking velocimetry moreover key factors influencing pfaa migration and distribution were identified and partial least squares regression pls method was applied to develop quantitative prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics physicochemical parameters and pfaa distribution coefficients the total pfaa concentrations σpfaas in overlying water under propeller jet action exhibited transient characteristics and hysteresis with time after the disturbance in contrast the σpfaas in suspended particulate matter spm exhibited an upward trend throughout the process with consistent characteristics the spatial distribution trends of pfaas in overlying water and spm at different propeller rotational speeds featured vertical variability and axial consistency furthermore pfaa release from sediments was driven by axial flow velocity vx and reynolds normal stress

abstract keywords pfaas hydrodynamic disturbance multiphase distribution particle tracking velocimetry environmental fate data availability i have shared data in the supplementary material 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have had widespread industrial and consumer applications since the second half of the 20th century due to the unique amphiphilicity caused by the hydrophilic heads functional groups and hydrophobic tail fluoroalkyl carbon chains savoca and pace 2021 tian et al 2018 as synthetic organic compounds with a long history of use pfaas which have emerged as global contaminants feature extremely stable chemical properties bioaccumulative effects and toxicity tian et al 2018 xiao 2017 pfaas have lower volatility and higher water solubility than other volatile organic pollutants which lead to the direct discharge of large quantities of pfaas into aquatic environments during long term production use and disposal yu et al 2022 subsequently pfaas gradually accumulate in sediments through sedimentation and adsorption making sediments the main sink and ultimately a receiving medium for pfaas ahmed et al 2020 hua et al 2021 however pfaas in contaminated sediments are highly susceptible to release through dissolution diffusion and resuspension processes chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020 resulting in the uncertain fate of pfaas in aquatic environments hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in the secondary release migration and transformation of contaminants tang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 presently the effects of natural hydrodynamics such as wind waves and currents which occur everywhere on conventional contaminants and some organic compounds have been extensively studied cheng and hua 2018 ding et al 2018 li and hua 2021 xu et al 2018 for example xu et al 2018 and ding et al 2018 reported the effects of wave induced liquefaction and wave heights on phosphorus release from sediments cheng and hua 2018 systematically explored the impacts of wind driven disturbances on the distribution release and removal of tetrabromobisphenol a however few studies have investigated the impact of unique hydrodynamic forces associated with anthropogenic activities including ship propeller jets on pfaa release a rotating propeller induces three types of velocity components in the axial tangential and radial directions causing the jet to scour the riverbed in addition to vortex and diffusion lam et al 2013 ryan et al 2013 the process is associated with high dynamic energy and significantly differs from the natural hydrodynamic forces that act in a single way hong et al 2016 tan and yüksel 2018 naturally exchange of pfaas at the sediment water interface can reach a dynamic equilibrium state after a certain period ahmed et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 a strong scour most likely triggers the secondary release of pfaas from the bottom sediment when the propeller jet breaks the equilibrium which are then continuously redistributed among multiphase media under the action of adsorption desorption partition dissolution and suspension precipitation processes feng et al 2020 a dense water system highly developed ship transportation industry and limited river width and water depth make it easier for propeller jets to reach the riverbed especially in a plain river network prn ma et al 2021 wei et al 2020 vertical walls constrain jet development in the lateral direction resulting in the slow decay of energy and increased disturbance distance however the changes in the environmental behavior of pfaas under such synergistic influences remain unknown therefore it is imperative to explore the migration and release of pfaas in sediment water systems under propeller jet disturbance to understand pfaa transport and fate in inland aquatic environments flow field measurement is essential for a clear description of flow phenomena the flow field induced by a propeller jet is complex and nonconstant and its development can be divided into flow establishment and established flow zones hamill and johnston 1993 currently single point measurement methods using laser doppler velocimetry ldv or acoustic doppler velocimetry adv are commonly applied to analyze variations in propeller jet velocities several indoor and field experiments have used ldv or adv to determine propeller jet velocity magnitude and a series of related prediction formulas have been proposed lam et al 2012 llull et al 2020 tan and yüksel 2018 in addition as a noncontact measurement technique particle image velocimetry piv can measure instantaneous velocity vectors on a fluid cross section and has been applied to propeller jet flow field measurements for example nardone et al 2014 used the piv technique to measure velocity distribution over a fixed bottom surface induced by a propeller jet in a flume liao et al 2015 used piv to calculate the mean flow velocity and reynolds stress in a near bed profile under propeller wash in a us navy harbor however such traditional techniques can only perform single point or planar measurements which do not capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of a propeller jet to completely reflect its complex three dimensional 3d flow field structure furthermore the unique dynamic features of the propeller jet suggest that it comprises various hydrodynamic elements including three velocity components vx vy and vz and mean velocity v which represent the velocity of the fluid average kinetic energy ake and reynolds stress that characterize turbulent flows and vorticity that reflects vortex characteristics johnston et al 2013 lam et al 2013 however the current findings do not specify which hydrodynamic elements trigger pfaa migration at the sediment water interface during propeller jet disturbances therefore a full flow field measurement for a transient flow is required to resolve the 3d flow field characteristics of the propeller jet particle tracking velocimetry ptv is a time resolved volumetric flow field measurement technique that uses the most advanced lagrangian particle tracking method shake the box to accurately track and characterize tracer particles bernhard 2012 daniel et al 2016 ptv resolution can be increased to the pixel level using numerous camera snapshots up to four cameras kähler et al 2012 which is particularly suitable for transient 3d measurements of propeller jet flow field characteristics however few studies have used ptv technology to measure hydraulic parameters of propeller jets and establish the relationship between hydraulic parameters and pfaa release in this study three model propeller rotational speeds were adjusted to simulate weak medium and strong jet disturbance strengths respectively and the flow fields induced by the rotational speeds were measured afterward overlying water suspended particulate matter spm porewater and sediment samples were collected and pfaa concentrations determined at several predetermined times and sections we aimed to investigate pfaa migration and release patterns and associated intrinsic mechanisms in a sediment water system under propeller jet disturbance by combining indoor flume tests with ptv technology the specific objectives were to 1 characterize the key hydrodynamic elements induced by the rotating propeller 2 investigate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of pfaas in overlying water and spm during and after propeller jet disturbance 3 elucidate the mechanisms associated with migration and distribution of pfaas in multiphase media and 4 develop quantitative prediction models of propeller jet characteristic parameters and pfaa distribution coefficients the results of this study provide insights into the release of endogenous organic pollutants and could facilitate the development of models for pfaa transport and fate in inland waterways 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the target pfaa standards 98 purity

pfos and 13c4 pfoa 98 purity were used as internal standards for calibration and standardization of all target pfaas shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 detailed information on the chemicals including abbreviations full names molecular structures and suppliers are provided in table s1 the solvents used for sample extraction and analyses were of hplc grade the sediments used in the experiments were collected in august 2020 from wangyu river 120 60 e 31 62 n in the taihu lake basin china all sediments were immediately transported to the laboratory in polypropylene pp buckets stones animals and plant residues were removed from the sediments which were then mixed thoroughly and stored at 4 subsequently the physicochemical parameters and target pfaa background concentrations 14 07 1 41 ng g dw of the mixed sediments were determined table s2 to better reflect the effect of propeller jet disturbance on pfaa release from the bottom sediment target pfaas were added to the sediments and then mixed uniformly so that the initial concentration of the various pfaas was approximately 200 ng g dw liu et al 2021 finally the homogenized sediments were used for subsequent experiments 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 contaminant release experiment the taihu lake basin in china which is a typical prn was selected to obtain basic information including waterway grade navigable capacity and ship tonnage and type that was used to determine the relevant parameters for the contaminant release experiment most waterways in the selected basin are classified as low grade waterways below class iii with narrow widths and shallow water depths china s inland navigation standard gb 50 139 2014 the ships navigating the waterway are dry bulk carriers of less than 1000 tons equipped with single three or four blade propellers with diameters of 0 80 1 60 m and draft depths of 1 30 2 90 m table s3 the limited water depth and successive passing ships cause continuous disturbance to the bottom sediment based on the information a four blade model propeller with a diameter of 6 cm was selected for the experiment and rotated at a fixed position to simulate continuous disturbance effects on the bottom sediment caused by the successive passage of ships in inland waterways afterward the draft depth of the model propeller under full load 9 20 11 25 cm was calculated using the diameter ratios of the evaluated and model propellers the rotational speed of the model propeller was determined based on the froude number similarity criterion penna et al 2019 that is the speed ratio is equal to the 0 5th power of the inverse ratio of the propeller diameter whereby the range of the model propeller speed was 730 30 1032 80 rpm three propeller rotational speeds n of 500 750 and 1000 rpm counterclockwise which corresponded to three experimental tests were selected to simulate weak medium and strong propeller jet strengths water flow in the prn is generally slow with a velocity of 0 30 0 50 m s even during the flood season lake taihu basin authority 2021 which is much lower than the initial velocity of the propeller jet therefore the present study focused on the effect of various hydrodynamic conditions on pfaa migration and release in a sediment water system under static water flow conditions thereafter a controllable flume experiment system was developed for simulating contaminant release under propeller jet disturbance the system included a flume l w h 1000 40 20 cm3 model propeller driving device and vertical lifting device energy dissipation measures for smooth water flow were set at the flume entrance and the water level was adjusted by controlling the tailgate discharge flow the experimental water depth and width of the flume were set to 15 cm and 40 cm respectively to simulate an inland waterway with a shallow water depth and narrow width the two ends of the flume were connected by pipes to maintain a constant water level during the experiment furthermore to prevent the influence of the hull on the propeller jet flow field structure the propeller was directly connected to the driving device and the propeller rotational speed was controlled by adjusting the motor speed the vertical distance between the propeller shaft center and the water surface was defined as the draft depth and could be adjusted using the vertical lifting device the homogenized sediments for the experiments were placed in a flat tank l w h 140 40 5 cm3 at the bottom of the flume fig 1a the pump was then turned on to gradually fill the flume with tap water to a depth of 15 cm the propeller shaft was positioned in the middle of the flume and 11 cm away from the water surface while the propeller tail was fixed at the beginning of the sediment laying area in each test overlying water and sediment samples were collected after 12 h of sediment resting under water pressure to determine the background concentrations of pfaas in multiphase media the sampling time points were set according to the variations in the entire sediment initiation resuspension and sedimentation processes in a pre experiment specifically five collection sections were set in the axial direction at 10 40 60 100 and 140 cm from the propeller surface after the propeller was rotated continuously for 2 min and three sampling sites were set in each section at 2 8 and 14 cm from the riverbed in addition a 100 cm section was selected and water samples were collected again after 10 min of disturbance and at 5 and 30 min after propeller disturbance was stopped a water suction pump was designed to collect water samples and a vacuum pump was connected to three pp tubes diameter of 6 mm using a four way valve each tube corresponded to a sampling site and was connected to a separate pp bottle water samples were collected automatically for approximately 40 s when the vacuum pump was turned on sediment samples were collected 30 min after propeller disturbance was stopped at 1 4 and 1 2 of the flume width in the transverse direction of the five collection sections a cylindrical sampler diameter of 28 mm was designed and used for sediment sample collection relevant water quality parameters were immediately measured in situ using a portable multiparameter meter sonde hq30d hach loveland co usa all samples were immediately sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for pfaa analysis 2 2 2 hydrodynamic shooting experiment ptv flowmaster 4d ptv lavision gmbh göttingen germany was used to measure 3d velocity vectors of the fluid induced by the propeller jet in the flume fig 1b the ptv velocity measurement system mainly consisted of a minishaker module led flashlight 300 calibration plate type 204 15 20 20 cm2 tracer particles 60 μm and davis 10 0 the minishaker module was equipped with five sets of lenses with focal lengths of 4 8 12 16 and 25 mm which required to be selected based on the volume measurements the area of interest aoi was adjusted to 896 656 pixels corresponding to a measurement volume of 23 16 15 cm3 l w h in davis 10 0 to achieve a frame rate of 510 fps notably a high frame rate can be achieved to capture high displacement particles with a reduced aoi although the measured volume reduces therefore to capture the high speed jet near the propeller and ensure a specific shooting range we selected 8 mm lenses and set the aoi size appropriate amounts of tracer particles were then poured and evenly distributed in the flume to characterize water flow a perspective camera calibration was performed to complete mapping between camera image coordinates and world coordinates the average deviation of each lens in all views was 0 10 pixels after the calculation of mapping functions indicating that the calibration results were reliable afterward the four lenses were set to single frame mode with an exposure time of 1000 μs and a pulse intensity of 700 μs for the led flashlight two thousand particle images were recorded in approximately 4 s for each test the recorded files were selected and the time filter used to delete background noise from the images subsequently the pre processed particle images were subjected to volume self calibration to eliminate any remaining calibration errors volume self calibration quality was evaluated based on average and maximum disparity values which were 0 06 and 0 09 voxels respectively and were within acceptable limits finally shake the box procedure was conducted to calculate particle tracks and other parameters within 20 10 15 cm3 l w h due to the high speed of the propeller jet and the long development distance in the axial direction the entire flow field could not be displayed within the scope of one shoot therefore each test was shot again behind the initial measurement position with the same test conditions thereby recording a total of 4000 sets of data moreover the average flow field of each test in 40 10 15 cm3 l w h was obtained by averaging the 4000 sets of data which represented the actual flow field of the propeller jet all flow field files were exported into tecplot 2021 for subsequent plotting 2 3 sample extraction and analysis the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane filters whatman gf c sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to obtain spm and overlying water samples the concentrations of suspended solids css were calculated by weighing the fiber membranes before and after filtration dissolved organic carbon doc ca2 and mg2 contents in overlying water were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena gmbh thuringia germany and an atomic absorption spectrometer pinaacle 500 perkinelmer singapore in addition wet sediment samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to separate porewater and sediment samples detailed sample separation and pfaa extraction methods can be found in our previous study ma et al 2021 briefly the filtered overlying water and porewater samples were extracted using waters oasis wax cartridges 6 cc 150 mg waters corporation milford ma usa while spm and sediment samples were extracted by ultrasonic extraction based on the method described by tian et al 2018 the extracts were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer triple quad 4500 ab sciex foster city ca usa details of the instrumental analysis and mass spectrometric analysis parameters of pfaas are provided in text s1 and table s4 respectively particle size distributions of sediments were measured using mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the abbreviations and description of the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 field membrane solvent and procedure blanks were used to monitor potential contamination during transport pretreatment and instrumental analysis in which no target contaminants exceeding the limits of detection lods were detected native compounds were quantified based on a standard series of 5 400 μg l with regression coefficients of each pfaa standard curve being 0 99 and relative standard deviation 20 the internal standards were used to calibrate and standardize target pfaas the lods and limits of quantification were set as signal to noise ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively table s5 the matrix spiked recoveries in the solid and dissolved phases were within the acceptable ranges of 82 55 127 04 and 79 30 113 50 respectively table s5 2 4 data analyses pfaa content per unit area in each phase was quantified based on pfaa concentrations in

used to solve practical problems such as small sample sizes and multiple correlations among variables zhu et al 2010 in this study pls prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics physicochemical parameters and pfaa distribution coefficients were developed using simca p 14 1 umetrics ab umea sweden the default settings of seven cross validations 95 confidence level for the selected parameters and 50 tolerance level for missing values for variables were maintained during model construction the lowest importance independent variables were removed from the initial model a new pls regression was subsequently performed until an optimal model consisting of only significant independent variables was obtained a series of parameters including cumulative x variance r2x cum cumulative y variance r2y cum cumulative cross validation regression coefficient q2 cum correlation coefficient r between the observed and predicted values and significance level p were used to assess

corporation northampton ma usa the relevant results are presented as means standard deviation in addition the right handed coordinate system was used in this study with the origin of the x axis propeller axis direction corresponding to the propeller surface and the y and z axes indicating the vertical and lateral directions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 propeller jet characteristics and physicochemical properties 3 1 1 propeller jet characteristics the flow field structure characteristics of the propeller jet can be preliminarily understood by observing tracer particle trajectories particle trajectories observed in the three tests at a specific time period are illustrated in fig s1 the particles near the riverbed moved in the positive direction along the x axis while particles in the upper layer moved in the opposite direction resulting in a counterclockwise flow cycle vortices were generated between the two layers of particles moving in opposite directions particle paths moving at high speed along the x axis in both the forward and reverse directions increased significantly white particles with an increase in n and the stratification between the bottom and upper particle layers became more pronounced to elucidate the changes in the structural characteristics of the flow field at different rotational speeds ten and six slices of the axial velocity field were intercepted at equal distances along the x and y axes respectively fig 2 a comparison of different slices in the same test revealed that hydrodynamic actions e g scour turbulent diffusion shear and vortices gradually weakened as the propeller jet developed along the x axis figs 2a and s2 for example when n 500 rpm the maximum values of vx ake rxx and vorticity decreased by 93 02 92 86 94 44 and 69 68 respectively as the distance from the paddle surface increased from 0 to 40 cm a comparison of the same slice in different tests showed that hydrodynamic strength was significantly enhanced with an increase in n for example the maximum values of vx ake rxx and vorticity for the first slice increased by 39 53 242 86 161 11 and 68 34 figs 2a and s2 respectively as n increased from 500 to 1000 rpm with regard to the vertical distribution of the propeller jet flow field y 100 50 cm the structural characteristics at different rotational speeds were relatively consistent fig 2b water flow was almost positive along the x axis when y was in the 100 30 cm range and hydrodynamic strength was gradually weakened from the bed surface to the upper layer water flow was reversed along the x axis when y was in the 30 50 cm range and hydrodynamic strength was weaker at the water surface the development distances of the propeller jet along the x and y axes in the three tests were approximately 30 and 7 cm respectively indicating that jet development ranges induced by different rotational speeds were relatively stable at the same draft depth however hydrodynamic force acting on the same horizontal slice was significantly enhanced with an increase in n to better reflect the changes in hydrodynamic strengths in the vertical direction the ranges 100 50 cm 50 0 cm and 0 50 cm along the y axis were defined as the bottom middle and upper flow field zones respectively the relevant statistical values mean maximum minimum and median values of vx ake rxx vorticity and others of each hydrodynamic parameter in the corresponding zone at different rotational speeds are listed in table s6 for example the mean values of vx ake rxx and vorticity at 1000 rpm in the bottom zone were 1 66 2 39 2 89 and 1 06 times higher than those at 500 rpm respectively notably jet strength on the left side of the propeller facing upstream from the propeller surface was stronger than that on the right side in all tests fig 2 the phenomenon could be attributed to the counterclockwise rotation of the propeller used in this study in turn resulting in more pronounced scour on the left side of the propeller due to the synergistic effect of the tangential velocity component the observation was verified by a relatively large scour hole on the left side of the propeller in the experiment fig 1c a similar phenomenon has been reported by penna et al 2019 who observed that scour topographic profile is related to the rotation direction of propellers 3 1 2 physicochemical properties to analyze changes in the physicochemical properties of overlying water under different hydrodynamic conditions the values obtained in each test for samples collected at the five sections at 2 min of propeller disturbance were averaged table s7 the dissolved oxygen do values obtained at 500 750 and 1000 rpm were 6 93 0 18 7 32 0 04 and 7 42 0 04 mg l respectively due to intense propeller jet disturbance that rapidly replenished oxygen in overlying water similarly the oxidation reduction potential orp in overlying water increased from 157 33 14 23 to 216 97 4 08 mv while ph decreased from 7 63 0 01 to 7 27 0 02 in addition sediment resuspension characteristics were significantly affected by hydrodynamics the bottom sediments were suspended in large quantities as jet strength was enhanced with css values at 750 rpm 184 38 29 90 mg l and 1000 rpm 615 85 132 04 mg l being 5 60 and 18 70 times higher than those at 500 rpm 32 94 11 14 mg l respectively in addition to the intensification of the resuspension process inorganic salts and organic matter in bottom sediments were released into overlying water in turn resulting in decreases in salinity sal total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec in the sediment to varying degrees table s8 ca2 mg2 and doc concentrations in overlying water increased by 16 94 37 29 and 26 45 respectively notably the orp in the sediment increased from 84 91 17 99 to 174 54 61 17 mv with an increase in n which may be due to the severe damage of the sediment surface caused by enhanced jet strengths leading to supplementation of sediment oxygen with do and ultimately an increase in orp the results indicate that variations in jet strength induced by different propeller rotational speeds affect the physicochemical properties of the sediment water system the variations in physicochemical properties of overlying water with time 0 2 10 s5 and s30 min in each test are listed in table s9 the physicochemical parameters of the overlying water before and after the propeller jet disturbance varied considerably the variations in orp do doc and css gradually stabilized after the propeller was stopped until they basically returned to the undisturbed levels after 30 min however ph mg2 and ca2 levels in each test exhibited gradual increasing trends after the propeller was stopped 3 2 jet induced spatiotemporal trends of pfaas in overlying water and spm the background concentrations of pfaas in overlying water and spm which were determined before propeller jet disturbance were relatively low background concentrations were deducted from the experiment data to determine the net pfaa concentrations and contents in spm and overlying water at various propeller rotational speeds 3 2 1 dissolution of pfaas into overlying water and key drivers the variations in pfaa concentrations cw and contents φw in overlying water with rotational speed at each time point 2 10 s5 and s30 min are shown in fig 3 a comparison of the different time points revealed that the most significant time point with differences in cw and φw among the three tests was at 2 min of propeller disturbance during which the total concentrations σcw and contents of pfaas σφw at 1000 rpm were 4 37 and 3 66 times higher than those observed at 500 rpm and 750 rpm respectively based on the composition profile of pfaas fig s3a the contribution of pfsas 45 was smaller than that of pfcas 55 at 500 rpm which is associated with the heavy molecular weight and hydrophobic nature of the sulfonic acid group so3h of pfsas when compared to the carboxylic acid group cooh of pfcas gao et al 2020 however the contribution of pfsas 50 was comparable to that of pfcas 50 at high propeller rotational speeds suggesting that the enhanced propeller jet disturbance caused an almost equal dissolution of pfsas and pfcas into the overlying water furthermore the proportions of long chain pfaas c 7 at 500 750 and 1000 rpm were 49 59 and 63 respectively which were progressively greater than those of short chain pfaas c 7 51 41 and 36 the results indicate that long chain pfaas c 7 were more sensitive to the changes in propeller jet strengths the σcpfaas c 7 was lower than σcpfaas c 7 at weak propeller jet strength but gradually increased and exceeded σcpfaas c 7 as the jet strength was enhanced the phenomenon could be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of long chain pfaas c 7 which makes them require high threshold conditions for release liu et al 2021 the dissolution of large amounts of long chain pfaas c 7 into overlying water was only triggered when the propeller jet strength reached the threshold in addition the variations in cw and φw among the three tests decreased with disturbance time but maintained overall differences of 1 34 3 75 times the differences decreased further when the propeller was stopped until the variations in σφw were 64 71 143 37 μg m2 30 min after the propeller was stopped the variations in cw and φw with time in each test were consistent fig 4a during disturbance the σcw and σφw values at 2 min were higher than those observed at 10 min indicating that the propeller jet triggered rapid dissolution of high concentrations of pfaas into overlying water cw and φw decreased rapidly within 5 min after stopping propeller disturbance the reason for the observation could be because the bottom sediments were no longer resuspended after propeller disturbance was stopped however the already dissolved pfaas in overlying water diffused in all directions and were partially adsorbed onto spm thereby causing decreases in cw and φw however cw and φw increased after stopping propeller disturbance for 30 min which could be explained by the following aspects first intense propeller disturbance destroyed the initially stable physical structure of the sediment forming scour holes with varying depths and leading to the exposure of sediment surface to varying degrees fig 1c pfaas in sediment and porewater were then consistently released into overlying water through the exposed areas second the downward scouring by the rotating propeller extruded the sediment hong et al 2016 liao et al 2015 pressure accumulated as scour time increased and in turn enhanced pfaa dissolution into overlying water after the disturbance ended the diffusion and adsorption of pfaas in overlying water gradually stabilized and the overall dilution effect was not as strong as the bottom release which eventually led to increases in cw and φw the corresponding vertical distribution of cw at each time point further verified our observation fig 4b a negligible difference was observed in cw among the three overlying water layers during disturbance due to the violent mixing effect caused by the propeller cw in the bottom layer began to increase gradually when the propeller was stopped and was significantly higher than that in the middle and upper layers after 30 min p 0 05 however cw in the middle and upper layers varied slightly after stopping the propeller the observations suggest that sediment and porewater consistently released pfaas into overlying water after the propeller was stopped causing cw in the bottom layer to rebound significantly therefore increases in cw and φw were observed 30 min after stopping propeller disturbance fig 4a the distribution process of pfaas in overlying water during the whole time period indicates that pfaa dissolution into overlying water under propeller jet disturbance was characterized by instantaneous scouring and hysteresis after disturbance to further investigate the variations in φw per unit time the absolute rates of φw φw for each test were calculated fig s4a according to the results the variations in φw with propeller rotational speed during disturbance followed the order of φw3 φw2 φw1 indicating that a high propeller rotational speed triggered rapid pfaa dissolution into overlying water the φw value decreased continuously after stopping propeller disturbance and was almost the same in the three tests suggesting that φw remained constant after propeller jet disturbance ended regardless of the jet strength during the disturbance the distribution of cw in the vertical direction at 2 min of disturbance was relatively uniform whereas slight variations were observed among the different sections fig 4c during the initial propeller jet development a low velocity zone occurred at the shaft centerline due to the paddle hub lam et al 2011 resulting in uneven mixing of overlying water among the bottom middle and upper layers of the sections at 10 cm consequently a significantly lower cw was observed in the bottom layer than in the middle and upper layers owing to its proximity to the paddle shaft as the jet continued to develop in the axial direction paddle hub influence decreased gradually the laterally diffused high velocity flow mixed with the low velocity flow and the cross sectional cw became uniform the cw in the bottom layer gradually began to dominate until the influence completely disappeared after more than 10 d 60 cm based on the overall distribution trend the variation trends of cw and φw in the various sections plateaued 750 rpm from a gradually increasing trend 500 rpm with an increase in n and finally exhibited an initial increasing trend and then a decreasing trend at 1000 rpm the observation could be associated with the counterclockwise water circulation caused by the propeller jet figs 2 and s1 pfaas in the downstream section supplemented the upstream section during disturbance and the backflow phenomenon became increasingly evident with an increase in n in turn making the peak sections of cw and φw to gradually approach the paddle surface to identify the key hydrodynamic and physicochemical parameters affecting φw at different rotational speeds a correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between each parameter and the mean σφw in the five collection sections the results showed that the normal additional stress ryy and tangential additional stress rxy were significantly positively correlated with φw p 0 05 indicating that the variations in φw at different rotational speeds were mainly influenced by ryy and rxy the observation could be attributed to the pulsating turbulent water flow caused by rotating propeller blades and reynolds stresses with six independent components were generated during momentum transport table s6 among them the ryy and rxy in the water depth direction y axis promoted pfaa dissolution into the overlying water furthermore css mg2 and ca2 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with φw while ph was negatively correlated with φw p 0 01 as described in section 3 1 css mg2 and ca2 concentrations in overlying water increased significantly with an increase in n while ph exhibited a decreasing trend css reflected the degree of sediment resuspension and high pfaa amounts in the sediment and porewater were released into overlying water as resuspension intensified the mg2 and ca2 released into overlying water exerted a bridging effect that caused an increase in φw du et al 2014 in addition ph changes in water mainly depended on the carbonic acid balance conrads et al 2018 the fast rotating propeller blades introduced abundant oxygen and carbon dioxide into the overlying water from the air carbon dioxide reacted with water to produce h leading to a decrease in ph fassbender et al 2017 the availability of supplemental oxygen accelerated oxidative decomposition of organic matter in turn producing more carbon dioxide that dissolved in water taguchi and fujiwara 2010 the low ph of water facilitated electrostatic attraction of dissolved substances to anionic pfaas du et al 2014 the results indicate that a high rotational speed can affect φw by simultaneously enhancing turbulence pulsation and modifying the physicochemical parameters of overlying water 3 2 2 adsorption of pfaas onto spm and key drivers the concentrations cs and contents φs of various pfaas in spm exhibited an upward trend with an increase in n at all time points 2 10 s5 and s30 min fig 5 cs among the three tests varied slightly however φs exhibited significant differences p 0 05 which could be because φs is determined by both cs and css eq 2 and a considerable increase in css was the primary reason for the significant increase in φs pfaa composition and distribution patterns in each test were similar and were dominated by long chain pfaas c 7 the average proportion of short chain pfaas c 7 was 11 54 for example based on pfaa concentration profiles at 2 min of propeller disturbance fig s3b long chain pfaas c 7 accounted for 82 94 of the total pfaa concentrations with an increase in n while the proportion of short chain pfsas c 7 decreased from 18 to 5 and the proportion of short chain pfcas c 7 was negligible the results could be attributed to the weak adsorption capacity of short chain pfaas c 7 pereira et al 2018 which was not conducive to their adsorption onto spm under enhanced jet strength contrary to the temporal distribution pattern of pfaas in overlying water cs values obtained in each test exhibited an increasing trend from the beginning to the end of the disturbance while φs values decreased fig 6a the variation trend of φs was consistent with that of css fig s5 with a maximum value being observed 2 min at propeller jet disturbance subsequently spm diffusion and sedimentation occurred to varying degrees and css decreased continuously the average css 30 min at stopping the propeller was 87 88 lower than that observed at 2 min at propeller disturbance furthermore the continuous increase in cs could be due to the fact that spm gradually disintegrated into smaller particles under strong hydrodynamic action of the propeller jet cheng and hua 2016 although some spm with relatively large particle sizes was deposited due to gravity spm with relatively small particles and large specific surface areas in overlying water continued to adsorb pfaas especially the more hydrophobic long chain pfaas c 7 regarding vertical distribution fig 6b cs followed the bottom middle upper trend during disturbance the cs in the middle and upper layers was stable when propeller disturbance was stopped while cs in the bottom layer increased the results revealed that the continuous release of pfaas from sediment and porewater after the disturbance was stopped led to the increase in cs in the bottom layer the distribution process of pfaas in spm during the whole time period suggests that pfaa adsorption onto spm under propeller jet disturbance was characterized by persistence the variation trend of φs in spm per unit time φs was similar to that in overlying water fig s4b with a maximum value being observed at 2 min of propeller jet disturbance followed by a decrease however φs exhibited significant differences in φs3 φs2 φs1 among the three propeller rotational speeds both during and after propeller jet disturbance p 0 05 the results suggest that the variations in jet strength induced by different propeller rotational speeds consistently affected φs with strong jet strength resulting in rapid φs the observation could be attributed to the enhanced hydrodynamic forces leading to increased spm fragmentation which in turn increased adsorption sites for pfaas notably sediment resuspension ended after propeller jet disturbance was stopped and pfaas with increased proportions in spm mainly originated from overlying water however φw was almost the same at this time point among the three propeller rotational speeds fig s4a suggesting that pfaa replenishment rate in overlying water from sediment and porewater was comparable to the adsorption rate of pfaas onto spm from overlying water therefore φs exhibited significant differences among the three propeller rotational speeds after stopping propeller disturbance while φw varied slightly the vertical distribution characteristics of cs at different rotational speeds varied considerably at 2 min of propeller jet disturbance fig 6c the cs in the bottom layer of each collection section increased significantly as the n value increased and cs stratification among the bottom middle and upper layers gradually became pronounced which could be due to the variations in time and amount of sediment resuspended at different levels of jet strength relatively strong jet strengths can rapidly damage the water sediment interface thereby prompting the release of more pfaas from sediment and porewater at the same disturbance time 2 min the advantage of the proximity of the bottom spm to the source was manifested when more pfaas were adsorbed per gram of spm in addition the overall variation trend of φs in the axial direction was consistent with that of φw where the peak section gradually approached the paddle surface as the n value increased similar to overlying water correlation analysis showed that the mean σφs in the five collection sections was significantly positively correlated with ryy and rxy at different rotational speeds p 0 05 ake which comprehensively reflects the velocity of water flow in all directions exhibited a strong correlation with φs p 0 05 the average ake increased by 134 82 as the n value increased leading to substantial sediment resuspension and a significant increase in φs significant correlations were observed between physicochemical parameters and φs in which css mg2 and ca2 concentrations were positively correlated with φs while ph exhibited a negative correlation with φs p 0 05 3 3 jet driven release of pfaas from sediment and porewater pfaa concentrations and contents released from sediment and porewater in each test are shown in fig s6 and were calculated by subtracting values obtained after disturbance from background values measured before disturbance the values of the total pfaas released from the sediment σφd at the end of propeller jet disturbance at 500 750 and 1000 rpm ranged from 25 47 to 32 58 mg m2 50 50 to 85 44 mg m2 and 119 30 to 137 61 mg m2 fig s6a respectively the σφd increased significantly with an increase in n p 0 05 and exhibited an overall exponentially increasing trend in addition pfca release was constantly higher than that of pfsas in all tests indicating that pfcas were more readily released from the sediment under propeller jet disturbance which is consistent with previous findings liu et al 2021 however the proportion of pfcas decreased gradually from 61 to 53 as n increased whereas that of pfsas increased from 38 to 47 fig s3c the results corresponded to the trends of pfsa and pfca dissolved into overlying water suggesting that enhanced propeller jet strength reduced the effects resulting from differences in physicochemical properties between pfsas and pfcas upon their release regarding planar distribution the φd at the 1 2 axis was significantly higher than at the 1 4 axis at 500 rpm p 0 05 with the mean σφd of each collection section at the 1 2 axis being 1 96 times higher than that at the 1 4 axis fig s7 the results suggest that propeller jet scours on the sediment at the 1 2 axis were stronger than those at the 1 4 axis at 500 rpm resulting in a high φd at the 1 2 axis in contrast the variations in φd between the 1 4 and 1 2 axes decreased gradually as n increased and the variations in φd were almost identical at 1000 rpm fig s7 this could be due to the uniformity of jet strength in the transverse direction as the n value increased fig 2b thereby reducing the variations in φd in the transverse direction the variations in pfaa concentrations cp and contents φp released from porewater in the three tests are shown in fig s6b generally contaminant concentration in porewater is determined based on the competition between its diffusion and desorption rates xie et al 2016 pfaas in porewater continuously diffused into overlying water due to the concentration gradient and sediment resuspension thereby resulting in a decrease in cp pfaas in the sediment desorbed to a certain extent to replenish pfaa content in porewater chen et al 2016 the cp and φp values obtained in all the three tests were positive indicating that pfaa content in porewater generally reduced after the propeller jet effect that is pfaa diffusion rate was greater than the desorption rate notably the enhanced jet strength substantially promoted pfaa release from porewater with linear increases of 1863 70 365 47 μg m2 3146 07 502 74 μg m2 and 4279 50 279 25 μg m2 being observed in σφp at 500 750 and 1000 rpm respectively p 0 05 the φp of short chain pfsas c 7 exhibited significant changes increasing by 105 34 and 285 26 at 750 rpm and 1000 rpm respectively when compared to those observed at 500 rpm fig s3d the release of contaminants from sediments and porewater is primarily associated with hydrodynamic actions at the sediment water interface cheng and hua 2018 therefore correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters at the bottom zone y 100 70 cm and σφd and σφp the results showed that σφd was significantly positively correlated with vx and ryy while σφp was inextricably linked to reynolds stresses rxx rxy and rzz p 0 05 previous studies have revealed that vx is the primary cause of sediment surface scour initiation and resuspension induced by the propeller jet lam et al 2010 ryan et al 2013 the effect of ryy on pfaa release from sediments was also taken into consideration in addition increases in rxx rzz and rxy with an increase in jet strength facilitated advective porewater flow and diffusion xie et al 2016 in turn promoting the exchange and release of pfaas from porewater no significant correlation was observed between physicochemical parameters of sediments and σφd and σφp suggesting that pfaa release from sediment and porewater was only associated with jet strength 3 4 variations in jet strength affect pfaa partitioning behavior the distribution coefficients kd sw and kd sp were used to describe pfaa distribution between spm overlying water and sediment porewater respectively at the end of the experiment fig 7 pfhxa and pftrda had the minimum and maximum log kd sw values in all the tests fig 7a specifically the log kd sw values with a high n value ranged from 1 25 0 34 to 3 90 0 21 l kg 1 13 0 19 to 4 42 0 15 l kg and 0 78 0 22 to 5 13 0 17 l kg the averaged log kd sw values of both c4 c8 pfsas pfbs pfos and c6 c13 pfcas pfhxa pftrda exhibited significant positive correlations with carbon chain lengths at the three propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic effects influenced pfaa distribution between spm and overlying water under propeller jet disturbance a comparison of the distribution coefficients of pfsas and pfcas with the same cf2 groups such as pfhxs pfhpa cf2 5 pfhps pfoa cf2 6 and pfos pfna cf2 7 revealed that pfsas consistently exhibited high log kd sw values the observation could be attributed to the fact that sulfonic acid groups possess a higher adsorption potential than carboxylic acid groups thereby enhancing pfsa adsorption onto oxide surfaces when compared to pfcas under the same conditions gao et al 2020 the results suggest that the variations in the distribution of different types of pfaas between spm and overlying water are closely associated with the functional groups sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups however the log kd sw values of the same pfaas exhibited considerable variations at different propeller rotational speeds the log kd sw values of each pfaa c 10 significantly decreased with an increase in propeller rotational speed especially for pfbs pfhxs pfhps pfoa and pfna p 0 05 in contrast the log kd sw values of the very long chain pfaas c 10 increased significantly with an increase in propeller rotational speed p 0 05 the results indicate that jet disturbance significantly affected the partitioning behavior of pfaas between spm and overlying water with enhanced jet strength promoting the adsorption of very long chain pfaas c 10 onto spm while the remaining pfaas c 10 tended to dissolve into the overlying water the log kd sp values obtained at 500 750 and 1000 rpm ranged from 0 23 0 07 pfbs to 2 21 0 34 pftrda l kg 0 42 0 16 pfhxa to 2 77 0 09 pftrda l kg and 0 41 0 10 pfoa to 2 91 0 02 pftrda l kg fig 7b respectively similarly significant positive correlations were observed between log kd sp values and carbon chain lengths of pfaas at the three propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 the results suggest that pfaa distribution between the sediment and porewater was also influenced by hydrophobicity the log kd sp values of pfaas except for pfhpa and pfoa increased significantly with an increase in n p 0 05 suggesting that enhanced propeller jet strength promoted pfaa distribution in porewater furthermore the target pfaas did not include c4 pfcas perfluorobutanoic acid pfba which exhibits a specific partitioning behavior in the environment rahman et al 2014 previous studies have reported that the distribution coefficients of pfba between solid and dissolved phases including kd sw and kd sp are higher than those of pfhxa li and hua 2021 ma et al 2021 indicating that pfba is more readily adsorbed onto the solid phase than pfhxa therefore it is speculated that the tendency of pfba distribution in the dissolved phase will be weaker than that of pfhxa under enhanced jet strength 3 5 prediction models of pfaa distribution coefficients to elucidate the partitioning behavior of pfaas between spm overlying water and sediment porewater prediction models were developed with log kd sw and log kd sp values of five types of pfaas as the dependent variables 10 hydrodynamic parameters and several physicochemical parameters as the independent variables as shown in tables s10 and s11 the r2x cum r2y cum and q2 cum values of the models were 0 50 and the differences between r2y cum and q2 cum were 0 30 the results of 200 permutation tests showed that the r2y cum and q2 cum intercepts were 0 40 and 0 05 respectively regression analysis between the observed and predicted values of log kd sw and log kd sp for five types of pfaas revealed that the values were distributed around the 1 1 line and within the 95 prediction band r 0 80 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicate that the developed models were accurate and feasible for the prediction of distribution coefficients of pfaas between spm overlying water and sediment porewater under propeller jet disturbance the developed prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics and physicochemical parameters of overlying water and log kd sw values for five types of pfaas were as follows log k d s w pfsas c 7 4 66 11 23 r x x 62 24 r x y 8 98 r y y 0 25 v o r t

projection vip value represents the explanatory importance of the independent variable to all dependent variables and a vip 1 indicates a critical independent variable tang et al 2019 based on the vip values of each variable table s10 vorticity doc and ph were identified as the key variables that significantly affected pfaa distribution between spm overlying water at different propeller rotational speeds p 0 05 the correlations between log kd sw values and vorticity doc and ph were determined based on their signs in the corresponding prediction equation the signs for vorticity were negative in the prediction equations for pfaas except for the very long chain pfaas c 10 suggesting that their log kd sw values decreased with an increase in vorticity vorticity characterizes the speed of fluid rotation and its mean value increased from 6 05 to 7 73 1 s as n value increased table s6 indicating an acceleration of the rotational water flow rosi et al 2014 although the process intensified mutual contact between spm and overlying water only very long chain pfaas c 10 with strong hydrophobicity were readily adsorbed onto spm while the remaining pfaas that were relatively less hydrophobic tended to be distributed in overlying water the negative sign of doc observed in all equations indicates that the increase in doc concentrations in overlying water caused more pfaas to dissolve which is consistent with the findings of previous study hua et al 2022 large amounts of macromolecular organic matter released as adsorbents compete with spm for the sorption of pfaas du et al 2014 furthermore dissolved organic matter can spontaneously aggregate to form microgels that capture pfaas under high doc concentrations li et al 2022 the positive sign for ph in the predicted equations for pfaas except for the very long chain pfaas c 10 indicated that their log kd sw values decreased with decreasing ph which could be associated with the abundant divalent cations in overlying water studies have shown that a decrease in ph decreases the basic sites on the adsorbent surface for binding divalent cations du et al 2014 therefore ca2 and mg2 released in large quantities along with sediment resuspension cannot efficiently bind to the spm surface however they dissociate in overlying water to increase pfaa dissolution by a bridging effect overall the variations in vorticity doc and ph with increasing n led to the distribution of most target pfaas except for very long chain pfaas c 10 in overlying water which was indicated by a decrease in log kd sw values the developed prediction models of relationships among hydrodynamics and physicochemical parameters of sediments and log kd sp values for five types of pfaas were as follows log k d s p pfsas c 7 0 68 24 56 r x y

criterion of vip 1 the key factors influencing pfaa distribution between sediment and porewater at different propeller rotational speeds were identified as sal tds and ec p 0 05 table s11 the increases in log kd sp values of pfaas with increasing n values were mainly associated with the variations in physicochemical parameters of sediments while the direct effect of hydrodynamics was relatively weak the negative signs for sal tds and ec in the equations implied that soluble inorganic salts and organic matter content in sediments significantly decreased as n increased table s8 thereby resulting in preferential pfaa distribution in porewater this could be because soluble inorganic salts can enhance pfaa adsorption onto sediments through electrical double layer compression surface charge neutralization and divalent cation bridging du et al 2014 the enrichment of pfaas by soluble organic matter has been widely reported higgins and luthy 2006 li et al 2022 the progressively enhanced jet strength resulted in a continuous flow of soluble inorganic salts and organic matter from the sediment into the dissolved phase in addition to substantial loss of pfaas another possible explanation could be that the experimental sediments largely consisted of silt and sand table s2 which were easily liquefied into fine particles and suspended in porewater under strong jet scour leading to the distribution of pfaas in porewater jia et al 2014 xu et al 2018 3 6 applications our results suggest that although the transient rapid release of pfaas during propeller jet disturbance occurred mainly through resuspension and turbulent diffusion we observed that the slow and sustained pfaa release caused by molecular diffusion after propeller disturbance was critical to the overall distribution of pfaas in overlying water and spm although the total pfaa contents in spm were not as high as those in overlying water under propeller jet disturbance the continuous increase in pfaa concentrations with time implies that the spm likely retained pfaas released from sediment and porewater in the water column for a long time and then transported with flowing water in practice waterway sediments may be subject to frequent and violent ship propeller disturbances therefore the effects of ship propeller jets during and after disturbance are expected to strongly influence the migration and transportation of pfaas in inland waterway sediment water systems which may pose additional risks to aquatic environments 4 conclusion the present study established the link between propeller jet characteristics and pfaa release and distribution using indoor flume experiments and ptv as well as comprehensively analyzed pfaa migration and partitioning behavior under propeller jet disturbance our results showed that flow field structures at low medium and high propeller rotational speeds were similar whereas jet induced scours turbulent diffusion shear and vortex strengths increased significantly the progressive increase in jet strength substantially promoted pfaa release from sediment and porewater and reduced the effect resulting from differences in physicochemical properties between pfsas and pfcas upon their release however the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of the released pfaas in overlying water and spm exhibited considerable differences moreover variations in vorticity doc and ph promoted the adsorption of very long chain pfaas c 10 onto spm as the propeller rotational speed increased while the other pfaas tended to dissolve into overlying water the decreases in sal tds and ec in sediments resulted in the preferential distribution of pfaas in porewater rather than sediments our study reveals the mechanisms

14803,micropollutant mp abatement efficiencies are critical information for optimizing water treatment process for cost effective operations nevertheless due to the vast number of mps in real water matrices it is infeasible to measure their abatement efficiencies individually in practical applications in this study a probe compound based kinetic model was developed for generalized prediction of mp abatement in various water matrices by the ultraviolet uv chlorine process the results show that by measuring the depletion of three probe compounds ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole spiked in the water matrix the exposures of main reactive chlorine species rcs including chlorine radicals cl dichloride radicals cl 2 and chlorine oxide radicals clo and hydroxyl radicals oh during the uv chlorine process could be calculated using the model based on the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of various mps in different water matrices e g surface water groundwater and wastewater could generally be predicted with acceptable accuracy by the model without prior water specific calibration in addition the relative contribution of uv photolysis and oxidation with active chlorine rcs and oh to mp abatement could be quantitatively simulated using the model to clarify the abatement mechanism of mps during the uv chlorine process the probe based kinetic model can thus offer a useful tool to guide practical water and wastewater treatment for mp abatement and to explore the mechanism of uv chlorine process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet chlorine micropollutant kinetic model water and wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the wide detection of numerous micropollutants mps e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and personal care products in potable water sources and wastewater has caused considerable concerns michael et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 although most mps are present at ng µg l concentrations in the water matrices they can pose risks to human health and ecological systems due to possible additive or even synergistic toxic effects daughton and ternes 1999 ultraviolet photolysis of chlorine uv chlorine is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop for mp abatement in water and wastewater treatment guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 von gunten 2018 during the uv chlorine process photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl and ensuing reactions eqs 1 9 can generate a variety of reactive radicals including hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as chlorine radicals cl chlorine oxide radicals clo and dichloride radicals cl 2 guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 1 hocl h ν oh cl 2 oc l h ν o cl 3 oh hocl clo h 2 o 4 oh oc l clo o h 5 cl hocl clo h c l 6 cl oc l clo c l 7 cl c l cl 2 8 cl 2 hocl clo 2 c l h 9 cl 2 oc l clo 2 c l these radicals together with hocl ocl can oxidize a broad range of mps with different reactivity in addition direct uv photolysis can degrade photoreactive mps during the uv chlorine process therefore the uv chlorine process can offer a robust way to abate the various mps commonly present in the water matrices e g pharmaceuticals personal care products and pesticides guo et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 yang et al 2021 2016 to optimize the uv chlorine process for cost effective mp abatement e g effective abatement of most mps with minimal chlorine and uv doses it is necessary to know mp abatement efficiencies during water and wastewater treatment however the great number of mps in real water matrices makes it infeasible to experimentally measure their abatement efficiency individually during practical applications therefore some researchers have tried to simulate mp abatement during the uv chlorine process using kinetic models developed based on hypothesized mechanisms guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 szczuka et al 2020 nevertheless due to the complex mechanism of the uv chlorine process the development of mechanistic kinetic models is challenging for instance several tens or even hundreds of equations are usually needed for the models to describe the reactions involved in the uv chlorine process including the formation of various radicals e g eqs 1 9 the reactions of radicals with target mps and the quenching of radicals by background water constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom carbonate and bromide see table s2 in supporting information si more importantly because the rate constants of many reactions are unknown or water specific e g the rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and radicals with dom in the water matrix they have to be experimentally measured or estimated by data fitting for each water matrix the need of prior water specific calibration restricts the application of mechanistic kinetic models in real water and wastewater treatment where the constituents e g dom of source waters changes constantly hence while the mechanistically based kinetic models are very useful in evaluating the mechanism of uv chlorine process they are unlikely to be used for generalized prediction of mp abatement in real water and wastewater treatment to circumvent the difficulty in model development and water specific calibration this study tested combining kinetic modelling with probe compound based experiments to predict micropollutant abatement during the uv chlorine process this approach has been successfully applied to predict mp abatement during water treatment by several aops such as ozonation guo et al 2021 lee et al 2013 2014 catalytic ozonation guo et al 2018b 2019 uv h2o2 gerrity et al 2016 wünsch et al 2021 and the persulfate process gao et al 2022 but has not been well explored for the uv chlorine process yet based on the assumption that pollutants are mainly abated through several parallel pathways during the uv chlorine process including uv photolysis direct oxidation with hocl ocl and oxidation with oh cl clo and cl 2 generated from chlorine photolysis guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 a kinetic model eq 10 is proposed in this study to describe the kinetics of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process 10 d p dt k uv p e p k chlorine p chlorine p k oh p oh p k cl p cl p k clo p clo p k cl 2 p cl 2 p where e is the average uv fluence rate w m 2 k uv is fluence based rate constant for direct photolysis of the mp p m2 j 1 k chlorine p k oh p k cl p k clo p and k cl 2 p are second order rate constants for the reaction of mp with hocl ocl oh cl clo and cl 2 respectively m 1 s 1 note that secondary radicals such as co 3 and br may contribute non negligibly to pollutant abatement during the uv chlorine process when the water matrix contains high concentrations of carbonate and bromide e g 10 mm for carbonate and 20 µm bromide pan et al 2020 however such high carbonate and bromide concentrations are rarely encountered in typical water and wastewater treatment therefore the role of co 3 and br for mp abatement is not considered in the modelling process in this study rearranging and integrating eq 10 yields eq 11 11 ln p 0 p t h k uv p k chlorine p t 0 chlorine dt k oh p t 0 oh dt k cl p t 0 cl dt k clo p t 0 clo dt k cl 2 p t 0 cl 2 dt where h is the average fluence j m 2 p 0 and p t mol l 1 are mp concentrations at treatment time 0

clo and cl 2 over a given reaction period respectively it is hypothesized that by measuring the abatement of several probe compounds spiked or indigenously present in the water matrix the exposures of rcs and oh during the uv chlorine process can be determined using the developed kinetic models with the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of mps during the process can then possibly be predicted using the models if second order rate constants for their reactions with the reactive species are known therefore the aim of this study was to assess the probe based kinetic model for generalized prediction of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process the validity of the model was evaluated with data obtained from own experiments of uv chlorine treatment of surface water and groundwater as well as data reported in literature representing different water matrices synthetic solutions simulated drinking water and wastewater effluent in addition the developed model was compared with a widely used mechanistic kinetic model to get more insight into the mechanism of the uv chlorine process 2 experiments and model simulation 2 1 chemical and reagents ibuprofen primidone naproxen and diclofenac with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa metoprolol dimetridazole and atenolol with purity 98 were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china the second

cellulose acetate filters and used within one week for the uv chlorine experiments main parameters of the selected sw and gw are shown in table 2 the background concentrations of the model mps in the surface water and groundwater are generally 1 μg l to facilitate the evaluation of mp abatement kinetics mp stock solutions were spiked in the surface water and groundwater to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l for each model mp 2 3 uv chlorine treatment uv chlorine treatments of the selected sw and gw were conducted in a cylindrical grass reactor see fig s1 in si for the experimental setup for uv irradiation a low pressure uv lamp gph265t5l 4 heraeus 254 nm was installed in the centre of the reactor the average uv fluence rate was 0 87 mw cm2 measured by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry frangos et al 2016 rahn 1997 after the selected sw or gw 700 ml was added in the reactor appropriate volumes of naocl solutions were spiked in the water to initiate the uv chlorine process with varying initial chlorine doses of 1 2 3 and 5 mg l during the treatment the solutions were agitated with magnetic stirring bar all experiments were conducted twice and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 analytical methods free chlorine was measured with a hach chlorine spectrophotometer pocket colorimeter using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method mao et al 2018 for mp analysis water samples were quenched with sodium sulfite then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system using a previously described method zhang et al 2022 2 5 prediction of mp abatement by the probe based kinetic model based on eq 11 the abatement efficiency of a mp during the uv

concentrations over a given treatment time during the uv chlorine process zhang et al 2020 to determine the exposures of oh cl clo and cl 2 the model mps ibuprofen ibu primidone pmd and dimetridazole dmz spiked in the water matrix were selected as the probe compounds because their moderate abatement kinetics during the uv chlorine process allows the oh and rcs exposures to be reliably determined note that the concentrations of other mps were quickly abated to very low concentrations 10 μg l in a few minutes of the uv chlorine process see fig 1 b and f which would increase the uncertainties in back calculating the exposures of oh and rcs reactive species due to experimental errors in measuring such low concentrations guo et al 2019 zucker et al 2016 based on the measured abatement efficiencies of ibu pmd and dmz as well as the equilibrium constant for the reversible reaction between cl and cl 2 eq 7 k 5 9 104 m 1 kishimoto et al 2018 the exposures of oh cl clo and cl 2 during

validation 2 6 simulation of mp abatement with mechanistic kinetic model mp abatement during the uv chlorine process was also modelled with a mechanistic kinetic model this model was modified from a kinetic model that has been commonly used to simulate the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 and contains 135 reactions to describe the reactions involved in the process including the formation of various radicals and their reactions with background water constituents e g dom and carbonate and target mps see si table s2 the model was implemented using kintecus software version 6 80 ianni 2020 based on rate constants collected from relevant literature or experimentally measured in this study si table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the uv chlorine process with the probe based kinetic model the applicability of the probe based kinetic model for generalized prediction of mp abatement was firstly evaluated for uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water fig 1a shows that for an initial chlorine dose of 1 5 mg l chlorine was completely depleted within 5 13 min during the uv chlorine process simultaneous with chlorine depletion the spiked mps were abated at different kinetics during the uv chlorine process see fig 1b and si fig s5 for instance with the applied chlorine dose of 2 mg l diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol were quickly eliminated with 5 10 min whereas ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole were only abated by 33 71 when chlorine was completely depleted at 10 min fig 1b with increasing chlorine doses from 1 to 5 mg l mps were more quickly abated during the uv chlorine process and higher abatement efficiencies could be obtained at complete chlorine depletion si fig s4 however the energy consumption of water treatment increased considerably due to the higher chlorine doses and the longer uv irradiation time required to obtain complete chlorine depletion si fig s6 these results indicate that for cost effective water treatment the uv chlorine process needs to be carefully optimized to balance the abatement efficiencies of mps and energy consumption according to the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole observed during the uv chlorine process the evolutions of oh cl clo and cl 2 exposures were calculated using eqs 13 16 see fig 1c for the result with cl2 0 2 mg l and si fig s7 for the results with cl2 0 1 3 and 5 mg l in addition the chlorine exposures were calculated from the area under chlorine depletion curves see fig 1a inset based on the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol during uv chlorine treatment of the selected sw with varying chlorine doses 1 2 3 5 mg l are simulated using eq 11 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 1d as shown the probe based kinetic models reasonably predicted the abatement efficiencies of the four model mps r2 0 90 sy x 8 57 these observations confirm the hypothesis that by measurement of the abatement of several mps to determine the exposures of key reactive species the abatement efficiencies of other mps during the uv chlorine process can be generally predicted with the probe based kinetic model to verify the model applicability for various water matrices mp abatement in a selected groundwater by the uv chlorine process were also evaluated fig 1b and f shows that under the same treatment conditions cl2 0 2 mg l mps were abated at moderately higher kinetics in the selected groundwater than in the surface water in addition the final abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole at the end of the treatment were 10 15 higher for the groundwater than the surface water these observations can be probably attributed to the differing water quality of the two water matrices see table 2 for example compared with the selected surface water the selected groundwater had a lower solution ph and doc concentration but higher concentrations of hco3 and cl which can considerably influence the generation quenching and interconversion of oh and rcs during the uv chlorine process see si fig s4 for more discussion guo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 despite the different water constituents the probe based kinetic model satisfactorily simulated the abatement of diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol in the groundwater water based on the exposures of oh and rcs obtained with ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole being the internal probe compounds fig 1g and h furthermore published data from uv chlorine treatment of phosphate buffered synthetic solutions guo et al 2017 simulated drinking water and wastewater effluent guo et al 2018a were assessed with the probe based kinetic model in these previous studies ibuprofen primidone dimetridazole and other pharmaceuticals were used as model mps during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process based on the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole reported in these studies the oh and rcs exposures during the uv chlorine process were back calculated using eqs 13 16 the abatement efficiencies of other mps were then simulated using the probe based kinetic model as shown in fig 2 the differences between experimentally measured and model predicted abatement efficiencies are generally within 20 r2 0 88 sy x 12 0 for the various mps note that some of the deviations can be possibly attributed to the uncertainties in measuring mp concentrations in the two previous studies the initial concentration of model mps was only 1 μg l and solid phase extraction was employed for mp analysis by lc ms ms guo et al 2017 2018a these factors can induce relatively large experimental errors in measuring the concentrations of the internal probes ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole and target mps thus contributing to the deviations of measured and modelled results given the uncertainties associated with mp analysis and the complexity of aop systems 20 deviations are generally considered acceptable during the modelling of mp abatement by aops in water and wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2014 wünsch et al 2021 this suggests that the probe based kinetic model may provide a feasible way to predict mp abatement with acceptable accuracy during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process besides predicting abatement efficiencies the probe based model is helpful to reveal the pathway of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process based on the measured radical exposures the relative contributions of direct uv photolysis oxidation with chlorine and oxidation with various radicals ri to mp abatement during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water and groundwater are calculated using eqs 17 19 17 f uv k uv h k uv h k chlorine 0 t chlorine dt k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt k

k uv h k chlorine 0 t chlorine dt k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt k clo 0 t clo dt k cl 2 0 t cl 2 dt as shown in fig 3 a the mps were abated through different pathways during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water due to the low chlorine reactivity of the model mps k chlorine 3 89 m 1 s 1 see table 1 the contribution of chlorine oxidation to their abatement is generally negligible during the uv chlorine process see si for more information fig s2 in contrast clo oxidation was found to be the dominate abatement mechanism of most mps with the exception of ibuprofen and dimetridazole which were mainly by oh oxidation and combined oh and clo oxidation respectively meanwhile direct uv photolysis contributed a considerable fraction fuv 20 35 to the abatement of diclofenac and ibuprofen due to their relatively high photoreactivity the different abatement mechanisms of the mps can be mainly explained by their different reactivity with the radicals oh and rcs as reported in table 1 k oh of the selected mps is generally 109 m 1 s 1 because of the non selectivity of oh in comparison cl clo and cl 2 are more selective oxidants and k cl k cl 2 and k clo of the selected mps vary considerably within 109 1010 106 109 and 106 108 m 1 s 1 respectively meanwhile simulation with the probe based kinetic model indicates that clo exposures are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than oh exposures and 4 orders of magnitude higher than cl and cl 2 exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water see fig 1c and table 3 consequently higher k clo 0 t clo dt values are obtained for most mps primidone diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol than their k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt and k cl 2 t 0 cl 2 dt values during the uvcl2 process this is with the exception of ibuprofen and dimetridazole whose k clo 0 t clo dt values are smaller or similar to their k oh 0 t oh dt values due to their significantly smaller k clo than k oh see table 1 therefore the probe based kinetic model indicates that while most mps are mainly abated by clo oxidation fclo 58 6 92 9 for primidone diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol ibuprofen and dimetridazole were mainly abated by oh oxidation f oh 59 1 and combined oh and clo oxidation f oh 46 9 fclo 46 9 during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water fig 3a the abatement of the mps during uv chlorine treatment of the selected groundwater are generally similar to that shown for the surface water with most mps being primarily abated by clo oxidation see fig 3b in addition the simulation suggests that the relative contributions of rcs cl clo and cl 2 to mp abatement increased while the contribution of oh decreased moderately during uv chlorine treatment of the groundwater relative to the surface water these changes can be probably attributed to the higher hco3 and cl concentration in the groundwater than in the surface water table 2 hco3 is a well known oh scavenger whereas cl can promote the formation of rcs through secondary reactions during the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that the contribution of oh to mp abatement will decrease while the contributions of rcs will increase during uv chlorine treatment of water matrices with higher hco3 and cl concentrations which is in agreement with the model simulation notably during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater the exposures of clo i e time integrated concentrations of clo are several orders of magnitude higher than those of oh cl and cl 2 fig 1c and g these observations indicate that clo is the dominant radical during uv chlorine treatment of both water matrices meanwhile it is found that the exposures of cl 2 are lower than that of oh for the surface water but higher for the groundwater this difference suggests that cl 2 are present at lower concentrations than oh during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water but present at higher concentrations than oh during uv chlorine treatment of the groundwater this change can be possibly attributed to the higher cl concentrations in the groundwater table 2 which can promote the formation of cl 2 e g via the reaction of cl with cl eq 16 during the uv chlorine process kishimoto et al 2018 overall the results presented above demonstrate that by combining probe compound based experiments and reaction kinetics theory the probe based kinetic model can provide a feasible way to compare the exposures and concentrations of key radicals during the uv chlorine process which may help to clarify some uncertainties and controversies reported in literature 3 2 simulation of the uv chlorine process with mechanistic kinetic models mp abatement during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water and groundwater was also simulated using a mechanistic kinetic model that has been commonly used to simulate the uv chlorine process in previous studies guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 due to the different model mps used in the present and previous studies the model was slightly modified to replace the previous mps with the present ones in relevant reactions e g reactions of mps with oh and rcs whereas the other reactions such as the formation of various radicals and the reactions of radicals with background water constituents e g nom and carbonate remain the same the model was then implemented using the kintecus software version 6 80 based on rate constants reported in previous studies or experimentally measured in the present study si table s2 as shown in fig 4 the mechanistic kinetic model fails to a large extent in predicting the abatement efficiencies of mps during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water r2 0 64 sy x 31 4 and groundwater r2 1 28 sy x 37 4 for most mps the model predicted abatement efficiencies are considerably lower than the experimentally measured values nevertheless the model predicted the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and dimetridazole with acceptable accuracy deviations generally 15 similar to the probe based kinetic model the mechanistic kinetic model assumes that mps are mainly abated through uv photolysis and reactions with hocl ocl oh cl clo and cl 2 during the uv chlorine process see si table s2 however unlike the probe based model which determines the chlorine and radical exposures based on measurement of chlorine and probe compound depletion during the uv chlorine process the mechanistic kinetic model simulates the concentrations of chlorine and radicals by solving many reactions that are hypothesized to occur and are responsible for the formation and consumption of chlorine and radicals during the uv chlorine process si table s2 this comparison suggests that the different modelling results of the probe based and mechanistic kinetic models are probably mainly caused by the different ways of the two models to determine the chlorine and radical concentrations and exposures to clarify this inference the chlorine and radical exposures obtained with the two models are compared in table 3 and fig 5 see si fig s9 for more information notably the chorine exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater simulated by the mechanistic model are approximately 97 and 48 higher than those determined from the measured chlorine depletion curves see fig 1a and e these deviations can be attributed to the fact that the mechanistic model substantially underestimates the rate of chlorine depletion during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices see fig 5a and d during the uv chlorine process chlorine is mainly consumed by uv photolysis and reaction with nom in the water for the modelling process the rate constant for chlorine photolysis was experimentally measured 2 17 10 3 s 1 si table s2 whereas a rate constant commonly used to simulate the reaction of chlorine with nom in previous studies 1 25 10 4 mg l 1 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 was taken however it seems that this value is not sufficient to describe the fast chlorine depletion in the two water matrices by increasing the rate constant for the reaction of chlorine with nom in the selected surface water and groundwater to 1 0 10 3 and 1 5 10 3 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively chlorine depletion during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices can be well simulated using the mechanistic kinetic model fig 5a and d these results highlight the difficulty in simulating the uv chlorine process by mechanistic models due to the water specific chemistry therefore prior model calibration is usually needed for applying the mechanistic models to a given water matrix bulman et al 2019 elovitz and von gunten 1999 interestingly the oh cl and cl 2 exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater determined by the probe based model and the mechanistic model are not significantly different the values differ within a factor of 1 4 21 see table 3 however the clo exposure simulated by the probe based model are about 300 700 times higher than those simulated by the mechanistic model see table 3 and fig 5b and e these data suggest that the different modelling results of mp abatement of the two models are probably mainly caused by the different clo exposures determined by the two models consistently fig 4a and b shows that the mps whose abatement efficiencies are seriously under predicted by the mechanistic model coincide with those that are suggested to be mainly abated through clo oxidation by the probe based model primidone naproxen atenolol and metoprolol see fig 3 in contrast the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and dimetridazole are more accurately predicted by the mechanistic model fig 4a and b possibly because clo plays a less important role in their abatement than the other model mps see fig 3 overall the results presented above suggest that the mechanistic kinetic model under predicted clo exposures and thus the abatement efficiencies of the mps that are mainly abated through clo oxidation during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater the reason for the underestimation of clo exposures are unclear and can be possibly explained by i some important routes for clo formation during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices are not considered in the model and or ii the quenching of clo by water matrix constituents e g nom is overestimated in the original model by decreasing the rate constant for the reaction of clo with nom in the selected surface water and groundwater to 1 0 101 mg l 1 1 s 1 and 5 0 101 mg l 1 1 s 1 the clo exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices simulated by the mechanistic model can be increased to similar levels as those determined by the probe based kinetic model fig 5b and e and table 3 after these adjustments the mechanistic kinetic model reasonably simulates the abatement efficiencies of the various model mps during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater fig 5c and f these results suggest that the failure of the mechanistic model for predicting mp abatement is mainly caused by the underestimation of clo exposures during the uv chlorine process it should be noted that although the mechanistic model well simulated mp abatement after adjusting rate constants for the reaction of nom with chlorine and clo these adjustments lack convincing kinetic or chemical basis and are water specific the requirement of prior water specific calibration makes it problematic to apply the mechanistic kinetic models for generalized prediction of mp abatement in real water and wastewater treatment elovitz and von gunten 1999 3 3 practical applications the results of this study demonstrate that the probe based kinetic models can well predict the abatement of various mps during the uv chlorine process similar to what have been shown for ozone h2o2 and persulfate based aops gao et al 2022 gerrity et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 wang and yu 2022 compared with mechanistic kinetic models the probe based kinetic models are easier to develop more importantly the probe based kinetic models can be directly applied to predict mp abatement in various water matrices without prior water specific calibration elovitz and von gunten 1999 gao et al 2022 guo et al 2018b 2021 furthermore mps in the water matrix can be used as internal probe compounds to determine the exposures of key reactive species during the treatment process hübner et al 2013 wünsch et al 2021 zucker et al 2016 in this way only the abatement of a few mps needs to be measured during water and wastewater treatment while the abatement efficiencies of other mps can be predicted using the models the probe based models can thus offer a feasible method for generalized prediction of mp abatement during practical applications it should be noted that the probe based kinetic model eq 10 is developed based on an assumption that secondary radicals such as co 3 and br play a negligible role for mp abatement during the uv chlorine process the reasonable modelling results shown in fig 1d h and fig 2 suggest that this assumption is generally acceptable under typical conditions of water and wastewater treatment however in water matrices that have unusually high concentrations of carbonate and bromide significant co 3 and br may be formed from secondary reactions of rcs and oh with carbonate and bromide and thus play a non negligible role for mp abatement pan et al 2020 in that case the developed model may need a modification to include the contribution of co 3 and br to well predict the abatement efficiencies of mps during the uv chlorine process 4 conclusions a probe based kinetic model was developed for the generalized prediction of mp abatement during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process by measurement of the abatement of several probe compounds the exposures of main reactive species e g oh cl and clo during uv chlorine can be simulated using the model with the simulated exposures the abatement efficiencies of various mps during uv chorine treatment of different water matrices e g synthetic solutions surface water groundwater and wastewater can generally be predicted with acceptable accuracy without prior water specific calibration in addition the probe based kinetic model can be used to check the plausibility of experimental results and simulation results of other models as shown herein for the mechanistic model these results suggest that the probe based kinetic model can offer a

14803,micropollutant mp abatement efficiencies are critical information for optimizing water treatment process for cost effective operations nevertheless due to the vast number of mps in real water matrices it is infeasible to measure their abatement efficiencies individually in practical applications in this study a probe compound based kinetic model was developed for generalized prediction of mp abatement in various water matrices by the ultraviolet uv chlorine process the results show that by measuring the depletion of three probe compounds ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole spiked in the water matrix the exposures of main reactive chlorine species rcs including chlorine radicals cl dichloride radicals cl 2 and chlorine oxide radicals clo and hydroxyl radicals oh during the uv chlorine process could be calculated using the model based on the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of various mps in different water matrices e g surface water groundwater and wastewater could generally be predicted with acceptable accuracy by the model without prior water specific calibration in addition the relative contribution of uv photolysis and oxidation with active chlorine rcs and oh to mp abatement could be quantitatively simulated using the model to clarify the abatement mechanism of mps during the uv chlorine process the probe based kinetic model can thus offer a useful tool to guide practical water and wastewater treatment for mp abatement and to explore the mechanism of uv chlorine process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet chlorine micropollutant kinetic model water and wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the wide detection of numerous micropollutants mps e g pharmaceuticals pesticides and personal care products in potable water sources and wastewater has caused considerable concerns michael et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 although most mps are present at ng µg l concentrations in the water matrices they can pose risks to human health and ecological systems due to possible additive or even synergistic toxic effects daughton and ternes 1999 ultraviolet photolysis of chlorine uv chlorine is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop for mp abatement in water and wastewater treatment guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 von gunten 2018 during the uv chlorine process photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl and ensuing reactions eqs 1 9 can generate a variety of reactive radicals including hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as chlorine radicals cl chlorine oxide radicals clo and dichloride radicals cl 2 guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 1 hocl h ν oh cl 2 oc l h ν o cl 3 oh hocl clo h 2 o 4 oh oc l clo o h 5 cl hocl clo h c l 6 cl oc l clo c l 7 cl c l cl 2 8 cl 2 hocl clo 2 c l h 9 cl 2 oc l clo 2 c l these radicals together with hocl ocl can oxidize a broad range of mps with different reactivity in addition direct uv photolysis can degrade photoreactive mps during the uv chlorine process therefore the uv chlorine process can offer a robust way to abate the various mps commonly present in the water matrices e g pharmaceuticals personal care products and pesticides guo et al 2017 miklos et al 2018 yang et al 2021 2016 to optimize the uv chlorine process for cost effective mp abatement e g effective abatement of most mps with minimal chlorine and uv doses it is necessary to know mp abatement efficiencies during water and wastewater treatment however the great number of mps in real water matrices makes it infeasible to experimentally measure their abatement efficiency individually during practical applications therefore some researchers have tried to simulate mp abatement during the uv chlorine process using kinetic models developed based on hypothesized mechanisms guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 szczuka et al 2020 nevertheless due to the complex mechanism of the uv chlorine process the development of mechanistic kinetic models is challenging for instance several tens or even hundreds of equations are usually needed for the models to describe the reactions involved in the uv chlorine process including the formation of various radicals e g eqs 1 9 the reactions of radicals with target mps and the quenching of radicals by background water constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom carbonate and bromide see table s2 in supporting information si more importantly because the rate constants of many reactions are unknown or water specific e g the rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and radicals with dom in the water matrix they have to be experimentally measured or estimated by data fitting for each water matrix the need of prior water specific calibration restricts the application of mechanistic kinetic models in real water and wastewater treatment where the constituents e g dom of source waters changes constantly hence while the mechanistically based kinetic models are very useful in evaluating the mechanism of uv chlorine process they are unlikely to be used for generalized prediction of mp abatement in real water and wastewater treatment to circumvent the difficulty in model development and water specific calibration this study tested combining kinetic modelling with probe compound based experiments to predict micropollutant abatement during the uv chlorine process this approach has been successfully applied to predict mp abatement during water treatment by several aops such as ozonation guo et al 2021 lee et al 2013 2014 catalytic ozonation guo et al 2018b 2019 uv h2o2 gerrity et al 2016 wünsch et al 2021 and the persulfate process gao et al 2022 but has not been well explored for the uv chlorine process yet based on the assumption that pollutants are mainly abated through several parallel pathways during the uv chlorine process including uv photolysis direct oxidation with hocl ocl and oxidation with oh cl clo and cl 2 generated from chlorine photolysis guo et al 2022 remucal and manley 2016 a kinetic model eq 10 is proposed in this study to describe the kinetics of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process 10 d p dt k uv p e p k chlorine p chlorine p k oh p oh p k cl p cl p k clo p clo p k cl 2 p cl 2 p where e is the average uv fluence rate w m 2 k uv is fluence based rate constant for direct photolysis of the mp p m2 j 1 k chlorine p k oh p k cl p k clo p and k cl 2 p are second order rate constants for the reaction of mp with hocl ocl oh cl clo and cl 2 respectively m 1 s 1 note that secondary radicals such as co 3 and br may contribute non negligibly to pollutant abatement during the uv chlorine process when the water matrix contains high concentrations of carbonate and bromide e g 10 mm for carbonate and 20 µm bromide pan et al 2020 however such high carbonate and bromide concentrations are rarely encountered in typical water and wastewater treatment therefore the role of co 3 and br for mp abatement is not considered in the modelling process in this study rearranging and integrating eq 10 yields eq 11 11 ln p 0 p t h k uv p k chlorine p t 0 chlorine dt k oh p t 0 oh dt k cl p t 0 cl dt k clo p t 0 clo dt k cl 2 p t 0 cl 2 dt where h is the average fluence j m 2 p 0 and p t mol l 1 are mp concentrations at treatment time 0

clo and cl 2 over a given reaction period respectively it is hypothesized that by measuring the abatement of several probe compounds spiked or indigenously present in the water matrix the exposures of rcs and oh during the uv chlorine process can be determined using the developed kinetic models with the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of mps during the process can then possibly be predicted using the models if second order rate constants for their reactions with the reactive species are known therefore the aim of this study was to assess the probe based kinetic model for generalized prediction of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process the validity of the model was evaluated with data obtained from own experiments of uv chlorine treatment of surface water and groundwater as well as data reported in literature representing different water matrices synthetic solutions simulated drinking water and wastewater effluent in addition the developed model was compared with a widely used mechanistic kinetic model to get more insight into the mechanism of the uv chlorine process 2 experiments and model simulation 2 1 chemical and reagents ibuprofen primidone naproxen and diclofenac with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa metoprolol dimetridazole and atenolol with purity 98 were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china the second

hypochlorite naocl solution was obtained from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china all other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade stock solutions of mps were prepared with milli

cellulose acetate filters and used within one week for the uv chlorine experiments main parameters of the selected sw and gw are shown in table 2 the background concentrations of the model mps in the surface water and groundwater are generally 1 μg l to facilitate the evaluation of mp abatement kinetics mp stock solutions were spiked in the surface water and groundwater to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l for each model mp 2 3 uv chlorine treatment uv chlorine treatments of the selected sw and gw were conducted in a cylindrical grass reactor see fig s1 in si for the experimental setup for uv irradiation a low pressure uv lamp gph265t5l 4 heraeus 254 nm was installed in the centre of the reactor the average uv fluence rate was 0 87 mw cm2 measured by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry frangos et al 2016 rahn 1997 after the selected sw or gw 700 ml was added in the reactor appropriate volumes of naocl solutions were spiked in the water to initiate the uv chlorine process with varying initial chlorine doses of 1 2 3 and 5 mg l during the treatment the solutions were agitated with magnetic stirring bar all experiments were conducted twice and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 analytical methods free chlorine was measured with a hach chlorine spectrophotometer pocket colorimeter using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method mao et al 2018 for mp analysis water samples were quenched with sodium sulfite then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system using a previously described method zhang et al 2022 2 5 prediction of mp abatement by the probe based kinetic model based on eq 11 the abatement efficiency of a mp during the uv

concentrations over a given treatment time during the uv chlorine process zhang et al 2020 to determine the exposures of oh cl clo and cl 2 the model mps ibuprofen ibu primidone pmd and dimetridazole dmz spiked in the water matrix were selected as the probe compounds because their moderate abatement kinetics during the uv chlorine process allows the oh and rcs exposures to be reliably determined note that the concentrations of other mps were quickly abated to very low concentrations 10 μg l in a few minutes of the uv chlorine process see fig 1 b and f which would increase the uncertainties in back calculating the exposures of oh and rcs reactive species due to experimental errors in measuring such low concentrations guo et al 2019 zucker et al 2016 based on the measured abatement efficiencies of ibu pmd and dmz as well as the equilibrium constant for the reversible reaction between cl and cl 2 eq 7 k 5 9 104 m 1 kishimoto et al 2018 the exposures of oh cl clo and cl 2 during

determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of other mps during water treatment by the uv chlorine process were modelled using eq 11 and compared to the experimentally measured results for model validation 2 6 simulation of mp abatement with mechanistic kinetic model mp abatement during the uv chlorine process was also modelled with a mechanistic kinetic model this model was modified from a kinetic model that has been commonly used to simulate the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 and contains 135 reactions to describe the reactions involved in the process including the formation of various radicals and their reactions with background water constituents e g dom and carbonate and target mps see si table s2 the model was implemented using kintecus software version 6 80 ianni 2020 based on rate constants collected from relevant literature or experimentally measured in this study si table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the uv chlorine process with the probe based kinetic model the applicability of the probe based kinetic model for generalized prediction of mp abatement was firstly evaluated for uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water fig 1a shows that for an initial chlorine dose of 1 5 mg l chlorine was completely depleted within 5 13 min during the uv chlorine process simultaneous with chlorine depletion the spiked mps were abated at different kinetics during the uv chlorine process see fig 1b and si fig s5 for instance with the applied chlorine dose of 2 mg l diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol were quickly eliminated with 5 10 min whereas ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole were only abated by 33 71 when chlorine was completely depleted at 10 min fig 1b with increasing chlorine doses from 1 to 5 mg l mps were more quickly abated during the uv chlorine process and higher abatement efficiencies could be obtained at complete chlorine depletion si fig s4 however the energy consumption of water treatment increased considerably due to the higher chlorine doses and the longer uv irradiation time required to obtain complete chlorine depletion si fig s6 these results indicate that for cost effective water treatment the uv chlorine process needs to be carefully optimized to balance the abatement efficiencies of mps and energy consumption according to the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole observed during the uv chlorine process the evolutions of oh cl clo and cl 2 exposures were calculated using eqs 13 16 see fig 1c for the result with cl2 0 2 mg l and si fig s7 for the results with cl2 0 1 3 and 5 mg l in addition the chlorine exposures were calculated from the area under chlorine depletion curves see fig 1a inset based on the determined exposures the abatement efficiencies of diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol during uv chlorine treatment of the selected sw with varying chlorine doses 1 2 3 5 mg l are simulated using eq 11 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies in fig 1d as shown the probe based kinetic models reasonably predicted the abatement efficiencies of the four model mps r2 0 90 sy x 8 57 these observations confirm the hypothesis that by measurement of the abatement of several mps to determine the exposures of key reactive species the abatement efficiencies of other mps during the uv chlorine process can be generally predicted with the probe based kinetic model to verify the model applicability for various water matrices mp abatement in a selected groundwater by the uv chlorine process were also evaluated fig 1b and f shows that under the same treatment conditions cl2 0 2 mg l mps were abated at moderately higher kinetics in the selected groundwater than in the surface water in addition the final abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole at the end of the treatment were 10 15 higher for the groundwater than the surface water these observations can be probably attributed to the differing water quality of the two water matrices see table 2 for example compared with the selected surface water the selected groundwater had a lower solution ph and doc concentration but higher concentrations of hco3 and cl which can considerably influence the generation quenching and interconversion of oh and rcs during the uv chlorine process see si fig s4 for more discussion guo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 despite the different water constituents the probe based kinetic model satisfactorily simulated the abatement of diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol in the groundwater water based on the exposures of oh and rcs obtained with ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole being the internal probe compounds fig 1g and h furthermore published data from uv chlorine treatment of phosphate buffered synthetic solutions guo et al 2017 simulated drinking water and wastewater effluent guo et al 2018a were assessed with the probe based kinetic model in these previous studies ibuprofen primidone dimetridazole and other pharmaceuticals were used as model mps during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process based on the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole reported in these studies the oh and rcs exposures during the uv chlorine process were back calculated using eqs 13 16 the abatement efficiencies of other mps were then simulated using the probe based kinetic model as shown in fig 2 the differences between experimentally measured and model predicted abatement efficiencies are generally within 20 r2 0 88 sy x 12 0 for the various mps note that some of the deviations can be possibly attributed to the uncertainties in measuring mp concentrations in the two previous studies the initial concentration of model mps was only 1 μg l and solid phase extraction was employed for mp analysis by lc ms ms guo et al 2017 2018a these factors can induce relatively large experimental errors in measuring the concentrations of the internal probes ibuprofen primidone and dimetridazole and target mps thus contributing to the deviations of measured and modelled results given the uncertainties associated with mp analysis and the complexity of aop systems 20 deviations are generally considered acceptable during the modelling of mp abatement by aops in water and wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2014 wünsch et al 2021 this suggests that the probe based kinetic model may provide a feasible way to predict mp abatement with acceptable accuracy during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process besides predicting abatement efficiencies the probe based model is helpful to reveal the pathway of mp abatement during the uv chlorine process based on the measured radical exposures the relative contributions of direct uv photolysis oxidation with chlorine and oxidation with various radicals ri to mp abatement during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water and groundwater are calculated using eqs 17 19 17 f uv k uv h k uv h k chlorine 0 t chlorine dt k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt k

k uv h k chlorine 0 t chlorine dt k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt k clo 0 t clo dt k cl 2 0 t cl 2 dt as shown in fig 3 a the mps were abated through different pathways during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water due to the low chlorine reactivity of the model mps k chlorine 3 89 m 1 s 1 see table 1 the contribution of chlorine oxidation to their abatement is generally negligible during the uv chlorine process see si for more information fig s2 in contrast clo oxidation was found to be the dominate abatement mechanism of most mps with the exception of ibuprofen and dimetridazole which were mainly by oh oxidation and combined oh and clo oxidation respectively meanwhile direct uv photolysis contributed a considerable fraction fuv 20 35 to the abatement of diclofenac and ibuprofen due to their relatively high photoreactivity the different abatement mechanisms of the mps can be mainly explained by their different reactivity with the radicals oh and rcs as reported in table 1 k oh of the selected mps is generally 109 m 1 s 1 because of the non selectivity of oh in comparison cl clo and cl 2 are more selective oxidants and k cl k cl 2 and k clo of the selected mps vary considerably within 109 1010 106 109 and 106 108 m 1 s 1 respectively meanwhile simulation with the probe based kinetic model indicates that clo exposures are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than oh exposures and 4 orders of magnitude higher than cl and cl 2 exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water see fig 1c and table 3 consequently higher k clo 0 t clo dt values are obtained for most mps primidone diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol than their k oh 0 t oh dt k cl 0 t cl dt and k cl 2 t 0 cl 2 dt values during the uvcl2 process this is with the exception of ibuprofen and dimetridazole whose k clo 0 t clo dt values are smaller or similar to their k oh 0 t oh dt values due to their significantly smaller k clo than k oh see table 1 therefore the probe based kinetic model indicates that while most mps are mainly abated by clo oxidation fclo 58 6 92 9 for primidone diclofenac naproxen atenolol and metoprolol ibuprofen and dimetridazole were mainly abated by oh oxidation f oh 59 1 and combined oh and clo oxidation f oh 46 9 fclo 46 9 during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water fig 3a the abatement of the mps during uv chlorine treatment of the selected groundwater are generally similar to that shown for the surface water with most mps being primarily abated by clo oxidation see fig 3b in addition the simulation suggests that the relative contributions of rcs cl clo and cl 2 to mp abatement increased while the contribution of oh decreased moderately during uv chlorine treatment of the groundwater relative to the surface water these changes can be probably attributed to the higher hco3 and cl concentration in the groundwater than in the surface water table 2 hco3 is a well known oh scavenger whereas cl can promote the formation of rcs through secondary reactions during the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that the contribution of oh to mp abatement will decrease while the contributions of rcs will increase during uv chlorine treatment of water matrices with higher hco3 and cl concentrations which is in agreement with the model simulation notably during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater the exposures of clo i e time integrated concentrations of clo are several orders of magnitude higher than those of oh cl and cl 2 fig 1c and g these observations indicate that clo is the dominant radical during uv chlorine treatment of both water matrices meanwhile it is found that the exposures of cl 2 are lower than that of oh for the surface water but higher for the groundwater this difference suggests that cl 2 are present at lower concentrations than oh during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water but present at higher concentrations than oh during uv chlorine treatment of the groundwater this change can be possibly attributed to the higher cl concentrations in the groundwater table 2 which can promote the formation of cl 2 e g via the reaction of cl with cl eq 16 during the uv chlorine process kishimoto et al 2018 overall the results presented above demonstrate that by combining probe compound based experiments and reaction kinetics theory the probe based kinetic model can provide a feasible way to compare the exposures and concentrations of key radicals during the uv chlorine process which may help to clarify some uncertainties and controversies reported in literature 3 2 simulation of the uv chlorine process with mechanistic kinetic models mp abatement during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water and groundwater was also simulated using a mechanistic kinetic model that has been commonly used to simulate the uv chlorine process in previous studies guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 due to the different model mps used in the present and previous studies the model was slightly modified to replace the previous mps with the present ones in relevant reactions e g reactions of mps with oh and rcs whereas the other reactions such as the formation of various radicals and the reactions of radicals with background water constituents e g nom and carbonate remain the same the model was then implemented using the kintecus software version 6 80 based on rate constants reported in previous studies or experimentally measured in the present study si table s2 as shown in fig 4 the mechanistic kinetic model fails to a large extent in predicting the abatement efficiencies of mps during uv chlorine treatment of the selected surface water r2 0 64 sy x 31 4 and groundwater r2 1 28 sy x 37 4 for most mps the model predicted abatement efficiencies are considerably lower than the experimentally measured values nevertheless the model predicted the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and dimetridazole with acceptable accuracy deviations generally 15 similar to the probe based kinetic model the mechanistic kinetic model assumes that mps are mainly abated through uv photolysis and reactions with hocl ocl oh cl clo and cl 2 during the uv chlorine process see si table s2 however unlike the probe based model which determines the chlorine and radical exposures based on measurement of chlorine and probe compound depletion during the uv chlorine process the mechanistic kinetic model simulates the concentrations of chlorine and radicals by solving many reactions that are hypothesized to occur and are responsible for the formation and consumption of chlorine and radicals during the uv chlorine process si table s2 this comparison suggests that the different modelling results of the probe based and mechanistic kinetic models are probably mainly caused by the different ways of the two models to determine the chlorine and radical concentrations and exposures to clarify this inference the chlorine and radical exposures obtained with the two models are compared in table 3 and fig 5 see si fig s9 for more information notably the chorine exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater simulated by the mechanistic model are approximately 97 and 48 higher than those determined from the measured chlorine depletion curves see fig 1a and e these deviations can be attributed to the fact that the mechanistic model substantially underestimates the rate of chlorine depletion during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices see fig 5a and d during the uv chlorine process chlorine is mainly consumed by uv photolysis and reaction with nom in the water for the modelling process the rate constant for chlorine photolysis was experimentally measured 2 17 10 3 s 1 si table s2 whereas a rate constant commonly used to simulate the reaction of chlorine with nom in previous studies 1 25 10 4 mg l 1 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 was taken however it seems that this value is not sufficient to describe the fast chlorine depletion in the two water matrices by increasing the rate constant for the reaction of chlorine with nom in the selected surface water and groundwater to 1 0 10 3 and 1 5 10 3 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively chlorine depletion during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices can be well simulated using the mechanistic kinetic model fig 5a and d these results highlight the difficulty in simulating the uv chlorine process by mechanistic models due to the water specific chemistry therefore prior model calibration is usually needed for applying the mechanistic models to a given water matrix bulman et al 2019 elovitz and von gunten 1999 interestingly the oh cl and cl 2 exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater determined by the probe based model and the mechanistic model are not significantly different the values differ within a factor of 1 4 21 see table 3 however the clo exposure simulated by the probe based model are about 300 700 times higher than those simulated by the mechanistic model see table 3 and fig 5b and e these data suggest that the different modelling results of mp abatement of the two models are probably mainly caused by the different clo exposures determined by the two models consistently fig 4a and b shows that the mps whose abatement efficiencies are seriously under predicted by the mechanistic model coincide with those that are suggested to be mainly abated through clo oxidation by the probe based model primidone naproxen atenolol and metoprolol see fig 3 in contrast the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and dimetridazole are more accurately predicted by the mechanistic model fig 4a and b possibly because clo plays a less important role in their abatement than the other model mps see fig 3 overall the results presented above suggest that the mechanistic kinetic model under predicted clo exposures and thus the abatement efficiencies of the mps that are mainly abated through clo oxidation during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater the reason for the underestimation of clo exposures are unclear and can be possibly explained by i some important routes for clo formation during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices are not considered in the model and or ii the quenching of clo by water matrix constituents e g nom is overestimated in the original model by decreasing the rate constant for the reaction of clo with nom in the selected surface water and groundwater to 1 0 101 mg l 1 1 s 1 and 5 0 101 mg l 1 1 s 1 the clo exposures during uv chlorine treatment of the two water matrices simulated by the mechanistic model can be increased to similar levels as those determined by the probe based kinetic model fig 5b and e and table 3 after these adjustments the mechanistic kinetic model reasonably simulates the abatement efficiencies of the various model mps during uv chlorine treatment of the surface water and groundwater fig 5c and f these results suggest that the failure of the mechanistic model for predicting mp abatement is mainly caused by the underestimation of clo exposures during the uv chlorine process it should be noted that although the mechanistic model well simulated mp abatement after adjusting rate constants for the reaction of nom with chlorine and clo these adjustments lack convincing kinetic or chemical basis and are water specific the requirement of prior water specific calibration makes it problematic to apply the mechanistic kinetic models for generalized prediction of mp abatement in real water and wastewater treatment elovitz and von gunten 1999 3 3 practical applications the results of this study demonstrate that the probe based kinetic models can well predict the abatement of various mps during the uv chlorine process similar to what have been shown for ozone h2o2 and persulfate based aops gao et al 2022 gerrity et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 wang and yu 2022 compared with mechanistic kinetic models the probe based kinetic models are easier to develop more importantly the probe based kinetic models can be directly applied to predict mp abatement in various water matrices without prior water specific calibration elovitz and von gunten 1999 gao et al 2022 guo et al 2018b 2021 furthermore mps in the water matrix can be used as internal probe compounds to determine the exposures of key reactive species during the treatment process hübner et al 2013 wünsch et al 2021 zucker et al 2016 in this way only the abatement of a few mps needs to be measured during water and wastewater treatment while the abatement efficiencies of other mps can be predicted using the models the probe based models can thus offer a feasible method for generalized prediction of mp abatement during practical applications it should be noted that the probe based kinetic model eq 10 is developed based on an assumption that secondary radicals such as co 3 and br play a negligible role for mp abatement during the uv chlorine process the reasonable modelling results shown in fig 1d h and fig 2 suggest that this assumption is generally acceptable under typical conditions of water and wastewater treatment however in water matrices that have unusually high concentrations of carbonate and bromide significant co 3 and br may be formed from secondary reactions of rcs and oh with carbonate and bromide and thus play a non negligible role for mp abatement pan et al 2020 in that case the developed model may need a modification to include the contribution of co 3 and br to well predict the abatement efficiencies of mps during the uv chlorine process 4 conclusions a probe based kinetic model was developed for the generalized prediction of mp abatement during water and wastewater treatment by the uv chlorine process by measurement of the abatement of several probe compounds the exposures of main reactive species e g oh cl and clo during uv chlorine can be simulated using the model with the simulated exposures the abatement efficiencies of various mps during uv chorine treatment of different water matrices e g synthetic solutions surface water groundwater and wastewater can generally be predicted with acceptable accuracy without prior water specific calibration in addition the probe based kinetic model can be used to check the plausibility of experimental results and simulation results of other models as shown herein for the mechanistic model these results suggest that the probe based kinetic model can offer a useful tool to guide practical water and wastewater treatment for mp abatement and to clarify the process mechanism based on widely accepted reaction kinetic theories declaration of competing interest

14804,the conventional oxidation adsorption methods are effective for the removal of roxarsone rox but are limited by complicated operation toxic residual oxidant and leaching of toxic metal ions herein we proposed a new approach to improve rox removal i e using the fes sulfite system experimental results showed that approximately 100 of rox 20 mg l was removed and more than 90 of the released inorganic arsenic as v dominated was adsorbed on fes within 40 min this fes sulfite system was a non homogeneous activation process and so4 oh and 1o2 were identified as reactive oxidizing species with their contributions to rox degradation being 48 36 27 97 and 2 64 respectively based on density functional theory calculations and hplc ms results the degradation of rox was achieved by c as breaking electrophilic addition hydroxylation and denitrification it was also found that the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed through a combination of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation and the generated arsenopyrite feass a precursor to ecologically secure scorodite feaso4 2h2o was served as the foundation for further inorganic arsenic mineralization this is the first attempt to use the fes sulfite system for organic heavy metal removal which proposes a prospective technique for the removal of rox graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fes sulfite roxarsone arsenic reactive oxidizing species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction roxarsone rox one of the principal organic arsenic representations has been widely used as farm feed in the poultry sectors for decades due to its benefits in increasing feed efficiency avoiding dysentery and controlling intestinal parasites the rox dosages in the feeds range from 20 to 100 mg kg 1 liu et al 2014 due to restricted absorption around 90 is eliminated in the feces mangalgiri et al 2015 it is evaluated that the rox concentration of poultry and pig manure reaches 76 and 318 mg kg 1 respectively chen et al 2018 however animal manure is used as an economical and effective fertilizer resulting in rox being transported to aquatic areas and soils nachman et al 2005 undergoing chemical and biological decomposition rox could be turned into the more hazardous and transportable inorganic arsenic as iii and as v bednar et al 2003 garbarino et al 2003 ji et al 2016 stolz et al 2007 long term exposure to inorganic arsenic has been shown to cause several cancers e g lung cancer bladder cancer etc fisher et al 2015 it was reported that the rox content in swine farm effluent was 15 9 95 8 mg l by simulating the average amount of produced manure the rox dosages in the manure and the wastewater production rate chen et al 2018 thus there is considerable anxiety about how to eliminate organic arsenic contamination effectively and rapidly currently many approaches were attempted to enhance the removal of rox to simultaneously treat organic and inorganic arsenic contamination oxidation adsorption is the key direction at present given the benefits of short reaction time and high oxidation capacity peroxodisulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms was commonly used as oxidants to tackle organic arsenic contamination fu et al 2022 some self made metal framework materials with adsorptive properties were used as activators chen et al 2021 huang et al 2021 li et al 2022 for example li et al reported that co3o4 la2o2co3 c composite a kind of mof material had an excellent catalytic capability for ps activation to breakdown rox and as v was also eliminated within 90 min li et al 2022 besides employing metal ions as activators and then generating precipitation to adsorb inorganic arsenic through ph control was also investigated cai et al 2022a xie and cheng 2019 cai et al reported that using uv led assisted fe3 for activating ps pms at ph 3 to decompose organic arsenic and subsequently the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed by adjusting ph to 6 under dark conditions for 60 min cai et al 2022a nevertheless the complex operation residual oxidant toxicity and the risk of leaching toxic metal ions are limitations of these methods thus it is an important environmental and ecological significance to develop simple efficient and economical techniques for rox oxidation and removal recently sulfite s iv advanced oxidation processes being considered as an alternative to conventional advanced oxidation processes based on peroxides zhou et al 2022 yang et al 2023b have received increasingly more attention compared to peroxides s iv as the industrial by product of flue gas desulfurization zhuang et al 2021 with the residual can be converted to nontoxic sulfate by aeration has the benefits of being inexpensive and simple to prepare rao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 thus making it non hazardous to humans and the environment many activation methods transition metal ultrasonic thermal and photo activation etc for sulfites have attracted widespread attention zhou et al 2018 mackinawite fes is a metabolically produced tetragonal crystal of sulfate reducing bacteria commonly existing in anaerobic water environments chen et al 2017 fan et al 2022 2018 rickard 1995 as an electron donor or resource for fe2 fes has been demonstrated to activate ps or pms to generate free radicals in previous studies fan et al 2018 furthermore fes was demonstrated that it had a favorable adsorption property for some heavy metals dzade et al 2017 sun et al 2017 especially for inorganic arsenic as iii as v dzade et al 2017 han et al 2013 2011a 2011b jeong et al 2010 up to now there was a little relevant research conducted on the fes s iv for example chen et al utilized fes s iv to degrade 95 of the β blocker propranolol within 20 min and found that the fe2 released by fes was the primary activator chen et al 2020 cai et al enhanced the oxidation capacity of fes s iv by introducing cu ii and achieved high removal of tetracycline within 30 min cai et al 2022b hence it can be hypothesized that the fes s iv system could remove rox and released inorganic arsenic by oxidation and adsorption simultaneously however the process availability and the involved mechanisms of rox removal have not been elucidated yet therefore it is of great significance to investigate the oxidation capacity and adsorption mechanism of rox removal by fes s iv the objectives of this study are as follows i to evaluate the viability of the fes s iv process towards rox and released inorganic arsenic removal ii to determine the reactive oxidizing species ross leading to rox abatement and calculate their contributions iii to clarify the s iv activation mechanism with fes iv to determine the reaction sites degradation intermediates and degradation pathways for rox elimination using density functional theory dft calculation and hplc ms results v to discuss the destination of inorganic arsenic in the system vi to analyze the effects of various factors and coexisting components on rox abatement 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals roxarsone rox c6h6asno6 98 was purchased from shanghai yi en chemical technology co commercial fes solids 70 purchased from china national pharmaceutical chemical reagent were grinded into powder and passed through a 200 mesh sieve before use other reagents including sodium sulfite methanol ma tert butanol tba l histidine l his sodium hydroxide concentrated sulfuric acid 1 10 o phenanthroline monohydrate sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate sodium nitrate acetic acid sodium acetate trihydrate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were obtained from china national pharmaceutical chemical reagent c methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 and humic acid ha 90 was obtained from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co o all chemicals were of at least analytical grade and the deionized water 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare solutions 2 2 experimental procedures the conical flasks of 250 ml capacity were used for the batch experiments firstly the reactor was initially filled with sodium sulfite and rox at the desired concentration the ph was not adjusted during the reaction without extra notes then a magnetic stirrer was used to mix the solution at 500 rpm until it was homogeneous at room temperature finally the fes was added to initiate the reaction the samples were taken at set intervals of 1 ml instantly terminated with ma 1 ml and subsequently loaded through organic filter membranes 0 22 μm into a small brown vial for subsequent analysis to estimate the reproducibility of fes the remaining granules were filtered out washed more than three times with methanol and then dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c the substance was then employed again after cooling naturally unless otherwise specified average results with standard deviations are presented for all studies that were conducted at least twice 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of rox and the intermediate products were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography fe2 fe3 were measured by a 1 10 phenanthroline method the electron spin resonance esr technique was adopted to record the produced radicals the details were provided in text s1 2 4 characterizations the fes sample morphology was taken by scanning electron microscopy using zeiss sigma 300 sem germany the crystalline phase of the fes was determined by bruker d8 advance powder x ray cu ka radiation diffractometer xrd germany the variations of elemental composition and surface chemical characteristics of the samples were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kratos ultra dld uk fu et al 2022 and fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir iraffinity 1 japan 2 5 calculation the reaction kinetics of rox removal is described by the pseudo first order kinetic model which has been widely used to characterize the removal of organic pollutants the contributions of oh λ oh s o 4 λ s o 4 and 1 o 2 λ 1 o 2 was calculated to investigate the dominant radicals respectively dft calculations were conducted on a gaussian 09 package yang et al 2022 details in text s2 3 results 3 1 feasibility of s iv activation with fes for rox abatement due to the inexpensive and nontoxic properties fes s iv was investigated to degrade some pollutants such as β blocker chen et al 2020 tetracycline cai et al 2022b etc to verify the feasibility of rox removal by fes s iv three batch experiments including fes alone s iv alone and fes s iv system were evaluated for 90 min the removal rate of rox by s iv alone is almost none and fes alone is nearly 65 fig 1 a according to the findings the catalyst had strong adsorption potential and s iv alone was almost not capable of rox oxidation which was parallel to the previous research chen et al 2020 however almost 100 of rox was removed with the treatment of fes and s iv for 60 min and it was shown that the surface was corroded and some materials were adsorbed in the sem test fig 1 b which indicated that the coexistence of fes and s iv could significantly enhance the rox removal without altering the fes adsorption characteristics although the system demonstrated outstanding properties for rox removal the mechanism of oxidation of rox the generation pathway of ross and the destination of inorganic arsenic were still unidentified these confusions would be further explored in the later sections 3 2 mechanism of oxidation 3 2 1 identification of reactive species it has been reported that the ross generated by transition metal activated s iv include s o 3 s o 5 s o 4 oh etc but the redox potentials of s o 3 and s o 5 are low e so3 0 63 v e so5 0 81 v das et al 1999 and both of them are further converted to s o 4 eqs 1 2 thus s o 4 and oh were explored in the experiment according to the available literature it is known that ma can quench s o 4 and oh k ma ho 4 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k ma so4 1 1 2 5 107 m 1s 1 while tba has a much higher reaction rate with oh k tba ho 4 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 to validate the prevailing ross both of them were introduced into system as scavengers respectively undoubtedly the removal of rox was significantly inhibited illustrating that ross played a crucial role in rox removal fig 2 a b at 100 mm of scavengers the rox removal rate with ma added was 66 and the kobs reduced from 0 10674 to 0 02526 min 1 while the kobs was 0 07688 min 1 with tba added fig s1 indicating that the effect of oh was limited using dmpo as a probe esr was used to detect free radicals and the findings indicated that dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were present in the solution fig 2 d e as a result of nucleophilic substitution dmpo so4 is easily converted to dmpo oh which is much more stable leading that the signal of dmpo oh was louder than that of dmpo so4 eqs 3 and 4 xu et al 2016 1 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 2 so 5 hso 3 so 4 2 so 4 h 3 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 4 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h in previous studies only s o 4 with oh were detected in the fes s iv system however in the literature of zhou it was demonstrated that 1o2 one of the main ross was produced by the reaction of so 4 with so3 2 in the fe3 caso3 system eqs 5 7 zhou et al 2022 therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that 1o2 would play a role in the fes s iv system which was confirmed in the esr experiment fig 2 d to investigate the contribution of 1o2 in rox removal l his was added to the system as a quencher k l his 1 o2 3 2 5 0 107 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 the inhibition effect was apparent fig 2 c and the kobs c l his 100 mm was only 0 0224 min 1 figure s1 c it is worth mentioning that in addition to 1o2 l his could react with h o and so 4 k l his ho 5 109 m 1s 1 k l his so4 2 5 109 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 so this phenomenon only indicated the involvement of 1o2 in the degradation the contributions of the three free radicals were calculated eqs s2 s4 and the most prevalent free radical in the degrading process was determined to be so4 λ s o 4 48 36 λ oh 27 97 λ 1 o 2 2 64 in addition fe iv was reported to be detected in fe iii sulfite based systems luo et al 2022 the high valent iron species can oxidize pmso to pmso2 cai et al 2022b however pmso2 was not detected in our experiment indicating fe iv did not exist data not shown 5 2 so 4 2 so 3 1 o 2 6 2 so 4 so 3 2 3 so 3 1 o 2 e 7 4 so 4 2 so 3 2 2 so 4 2 4 so 3 1 o 2 3 2 2 activation of s iv by fes to explore the production mechanism of ross xps was separately carried out on fresh and used fes the results are illustrated in fig 4 and fig 6 a details in table s2 for fresh fes fe ii accounted for 76 43 in fe 2p3 2 and s2 at s 2p with a proportion of 80 65 indicating that fe ii and s2 were the dominant substances before the reaction after the reaction fe ii remained dominant with a slight decrease of 13 81 while correspondingly the proportion of fe iii increased to 37 38 indicating that the reaction occurred on the surface of fes where fe ii was transformed to fe iii which was in accordance with the xrd pattern with a slight change in phase and intensity after the reaction figure s2 this revealed that s iv may was activated on the surface of the substance and not due to the leaching of iron ions as suggested in the literature chen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the conjecture was confirmed by the following outcomes for fe2 and fe3 the maximum leaching concentrations were 1 16 mg l and 0 43 mg l respectively fig 3 a moreover the degradation of rox was unsatisfactory by dosing 1 6 mg l of fe2 fig 3 b it demonstrated that the activation of s iv by fes was not due to the leaching of fe2 but a non homogeneous process eqs 8 12 additionally the variation in the dominance of s species should not be neglected as can be obtained from the s 2p spectrum the proportion of s2 decreased by 36 62 implying that s2 acted as an electron donor providing electrons for the reduction of fe iii leading to a cycle of fe ii fe iii fe ii eqs 12 13 fan et al 2018 which is the reason for the increase in s o ratio from 19 35 to 38 68 as for the generated polysulfide sn 2 it might be an intermediate formed by the oxidation of s2 or associated with the reaction of inorganic arsenic with fes notably the consumption of s2 is irreversible throughout the whole process and the peak of s 2p can also be seen to be significantly weakened fig 6 a which explained why the rox removal rate dropped in the reuse section 8 fe ii hso 3 fehso 3 9 fehso 3 1 4 o 2 feso 3 1 2 h 2 o 10

chemistry technique have been widely used in various fields chemistry materials science etc it can provide more deep information than experiments on the structure properties and degradation pathways of compounds yang et al 2023a in advanced oxidation it has been used to further explore the reaction behavior and intrinsic mechanisms jing et al 2023 for example wang et al identified transformation products and vulnerable positions of bisphenol analogues molecules by dft calculations wang et al 2022 du et al used dft calculations to reveal specific reaction sites on smx and predicted intermediates du et al 2018 in our research the degradation pathway of rox was analyzed by combining the results of lc ms and dft calculations the optimized structure and numbering system of rox were shown in fig 5 as was proven in the previous section the oxidation of rox was connected to the attacks by ross as a consequence the fukui index values of f 0 which indicates that radical attack was chosen to depict the reactive sites of rox and the findings were presented in fig 5 details in fig s3 casid a et al 1998 the rox degradation was initiated by the breakage of the as c bond which was more susceptible to attack by free radicals due to its rich electron density and the higher f 0 values li et al 2022 xie and cheng 2019 rox was converted to o nitrophenol and inorganic as iv which was rapidly converted to as iii and as v by the disproportionation huang et al 2021 and then as iii would be further oxidized to as v with ultimate adsorption by fes on the one hand o nitrophenol p1 was converted to 2 nitrobenzene 1 4 diol p2 by electrophilic addition reaction of free radicals li et al 2022 su et al 2019 and 7 n atom with the higher f 0 values is the strong electron acceptor leading to the conversion of p2 to hydroxyquinoline p4 undetected li et al 2022 su et al 2019 on the other hand due to the homo substitution of oh to the nitro group on the benzene ring during denitrification leading to the shedding of the no2 zhang et al 2007 which reacted with the so4 to generate the nitro radical no2 ji et al 2016 then no2 combined with p1 multiple times and gradually produced 2 4 dinitrophenol p3 and 2 4 6 trinitrophenol p5 similarly p3 could be turned into p4 by denitrification the p4 was further oxidized to form 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone p6 finally as the reaction continuously proceeded p5 and p6 could be further mineralized to no3 co2 and h2o by sufficient free radicals 3 3 destination of inorganic arsenic 3 3 1 transformation of inorganic arsenic as species undergo a marked transformation during degradation fig 6 c finally as v is the major inorganic arsenic in solution as opposed to as iii it was attributed to the fact that the free radicals attacked the as c bond of rox causing breakage and generation of unstable as iv which would rapidly be disproportionate to as v and as iii huang et al 2021 meanwhile the as iii was then swiftly turned to as v by the ross additionally due to the adsorption of fes total arsenic concentrations dropped steadily from 5 74 mg l to 0 4 mg l in about 40 min below the 0 5 mg l combined wastewater discharge limit gb 8978 1996 3 3 2 mechanism of inorganic arsenic adsorption the ftir and core level spectra of as 3d were used to investigate the mechanism of adsorption fig 6 b and d for fresh fes the bands at 3416 and 1630 cm 1 were the results of the stretching of surface adsorbed water molecules and ho h deformation respectively chiriţă et al 2008 furthermore the peaks at 1384 1018 and 704 cm 1 were attributed to the presence of s o due to the oxidation of fes or the production of so4 2 resulting in symmetric and asymmetric stretching chiriţă et al 2008 sun et al 2017 the peak at 618 cm 1 revealed the occurrence of fe s sun et al 2017 attractively there are three new bands in the used fes the peak at 478 cm 1 once again indicated the existence of multiple forms of sulfur eg sn 2 mikhlin et al 2002 and the band at 2914 cm 1 was due to the stretching mode of fe oh 3 s chiriţă et al 2008 the formation of which will be discussed in subsequent sections the most noteworthy peak is at 830 cm 1 it reflected the existence of as o an et al 2017 and also proved the inorganic arsenic was adsorbed additionally both as iii and as v are observed on the surface of the material in fig 6 d with as v o 71 91 being the predominant component followed by as iii o 19 65 and the least being as iii s 8 44 the composition of these peaks indicates that the adsorption of inorganic arsenic by fes is a conjunction of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation farquhar et al 2002 in prior studies effective disposal of adsorbed inorganic arsenic was not discussed in practical applications inorganic arsenic may be susceptible into the environment by physical and chemical changes through arsenic precipitates such arsenic sulfide calcium arsenate iron arsenate and others min et al 2015 in contrast immobilization of arsenic in crystalline scorodite feaso4 2h2o is the preferred route because of its limited solubility and high arsenic concentration gonzález contreras et al 2012 feass a precursor can react with fes to compose scorodite under autoclave conditions wang and ferron 2003 in our research the coexistence of the three as s fe oh 3 and sn 2 provides evidence for the production of feass eqs 14 15 han et al 2013 therefore the phenomenon provides the basis for the subsequent mineralization of inorganic arsenic 14 15 3 4 effect of various parameters on the rox removal 3 4 1 effect of fes s iv and rox dose fig 7 a showed the effect of fes dosage on the rox decrease in the fes s iv system when the fes concentration increased from 1 0 g l to 2 5 g l the removal rate of rox almost tended to 100 which indicated the superiority of the system for the removal of rox to investigate the variation of the reaction the pseudo first order kinetic model was employed figure s4 as the fes dose increased from 0 5 g l to 2 g l the kobs increased from 0 01262 to 0 07981 min 1 however when the concentration of fes further increased to 2 5 g l the corresponding kobs decreased to 0 07547 min 1 fig s4 a because the higher concentration of fes the more activation sites and ross are available liu et al 2017 triggering the quenching reaction eqs 16 18 huang et al 2021 which resulted to an inhibition of the degradation of rox moreover the reaction of the released reducing substances s2 and fe2 with ross is also a cause yu et al 2021 fig 7 b and c displayed the effect of s iv dose and rox concentration on rox abatement the kobs gradually increased from 0 04395 to 0 08385 min 1 as the s iv concentration rose from 0 1 g l to 0 3 g l then the kobs decreased as the s iv dosage increasing fig s4b this phenomenon was likely due to the fact that so 4 e0 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 was transformed to so 3 e0 0 63 v hayon et al 2002 with low redox potential eq 19 chen et al 2012 considering the variation of rox dosage as the rox dosage increases to 50 mg l the kobs decreases from 0 08988 to 0 03489 min 1 fig 7 d and fig s4 c which was to the fact that ross generation rate was inadequate to keep up with the rox removal 16 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 or 2 so 4 2 17 so 4 oh hso 5 18 oh oh h 2 o 2 19 so 4 hso 3 hso 4 so 3 20 hso 5 hso 3 2 so 4 2 h 2 o 3 4 2 effect of initial ph and do as illustrated in fig 7 d the rox elimination in the fes s iv process was affected by the solution ph the rox could be removed in a wide ph 5 0 9 0 and the rox removal rate was as high as 97 during 10 min at the initial ph of 5 with the kobs reaching 0 18422 min 1 fig s4 d the phpzc of fes was about 7 dominic and di toro 1996 when exposed to an acidic environment fes became positively charged which might increase its electrostatic attraction to s iv and rox s iv existed as hso5 rox as rox chen et al 2021 furthermore the fe2 production was triggered by the acidic surroundings which might produce extra ross via homogeneous reactions eqs 21 22 chen et al 2020 fig 8 a showed the effect of dissolved oxygen do on rox removal obviously the elimination of the target contaminant was severely impeded under n2 aeration fig 8 a it is mainly attributed to the fact that do is involved in generating so 4 eqs 8 12 zhou et al 2018 additionally we observed a sharp decline in do within the first 5 min fig 8 b 21 22 f e 2 hso 5 so 4 f e 3 o h 4 environmental influences 4 1 influence of coexisting ions the mechanism of oxidation adsorption has been well established for rox removal by fes s iv due to the existence of various natural organic matter and inorganic anions in the water environment we are inclined to explore the universality of fes s iv the representative inorganic ions no3 hco3 cl and dissolved organic matter ha were introduced as expected different species and concentrations of inorganic ions have different effects on the degradation of rox in deionized water no3 had an absence of effect on the rox removal fig 9 a and figure s5 a hco3 had a significant inhibitory effect on rox removal when the hco3 concentration was increased to 100 mm a reduction in rox removal to 64 was observed fig 9 b and fig s5 b undoubtedly the altered value of ph resulting from an increase in hco3 was one of the causes of inhibition ph c hco3 100 mm 9 furthermore due to the lower reactivity and higher selectivity of c o 3 and hc o 3 hco3 was found to have an inhibitory effect on degradation by o h or s o 4 eqs 23 26 sharma et al 2015 wang and wang 2021 the presence of cl inhibited the reaction at low concentrations while promoting the removal of rox at high concentrations fig 9 c and fig s5 c at low concentrations c cl 1 mm the main form is cl with less reactivity eqs 27 29 huang et al 2021 at high concentrations c cl 100 mm the dominant form is the free chlorine cl2 hclo eqs 30 33 fang et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 having a strong oxidizing capacity to oxidize the target pollutant fig 9 d depicted the effect of ha on rox removal the removal of rox was apparently inhibited by the addition of ha with the kobs from 0 10005 min 1 to 0 02421 min 1 fig s5 d the primary reason is that functional groups carbonyl etc in ha can consume ross zhang et al 2020 moreover extensive ha tends to congregate on the surface of fes inhibiting exposure of fe ii to s iv chi et al 2022 23 oh c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 24 oh hco 3 hc o 3 o h 25 s o 4 c o 3 2 c o 3 s o 4 2 26 s o 4 hco 3 hc o 3 so 4 2 27 28 29 30 oh cl 2 hclo c l 31 hso 5 c l hclo so 4 2 32 c l c l c l 2 33 cl 2 cl 2 c l 2 c l 4 2 reuse of the fes the stability test was performed by using recycled fes the results showed that the removal rate of rox decreased by nearly 50 after three times fig s6 the reasons are as indicated below firstly the sulfur on the fes surface that was continuously consumed in the reaction was not replenished during the recycling secondly the reaction sites may be occupied by adsorption products after reactions thirdly during the recycling process some fes was lost due to operation and other factors fig s7 furthermore the deterioration of fes dispersion in the solution during the recovery process may also be one of the reasons in addition methods to improve the reusability of fes e g addition of tiny reductants synthesis of new fe containing materials using metal organic frameworks will be explored in the future 4 3 environme ntal implication since 1999 and 2013 rox was banned from the eu and us respectively arts et al 2013 su et al 2019 however rox was still extensively used as feed in developing countries including china and india su et al 2019 wang and cheng 2015 it was speculated that rox concentrations in swine farm effluent can reach up to 95 8 mg l chen et al 2018 the rox and its degradation products can seep into groundwater or accumulate in soil and plants causing hazards to humans therefore methods for the removal of rox and released inorganic arsenic were extensively investigated by researchers in the past such as feooh h2o2 zhang et al 2018 α feooh gca uv persulfate su et al 2019 mos2 schwertmannite uv h2o2 wang et al 2021 in this study the fes s iv system was used to remove rox and released inorganic arsenic for the first time it was found that the fes s iv technique could remove 100 rox and 90 inorganic arsenic simultaneously in 40 min the ross generated through a non homogeneous activation played a crucial role in the oxidative degradation of rox at the initial ph three free radicals so4 oh and 1o2 were detected among which so4 played a predominant function the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed by fes in the forms of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation and the generated feass served as a basis for further inorganic arsenic mineralization compared with other methods it took less time to remove pollutants had higher removal efficiency with the same rox concentrations seen in table 1 furthermore the system also has the advantages of rich raw materials environmental friendliness and low cost without the risk of leaching toxic metal ions due to the existence of various natural organic matter and inorganic anions in the nature water environment the universality of fes s iv was also explored the results indicated that the removal of rox was achieved successfully under the interference of various coexisting components which showed that fes s iv process was promising as a simple and effective method for the treatment of rox containing wastewaters this research is of great importance to the comprehensive utilization of fes s iv system which not only advances the understanding of the reaction between fes and s iv but also contributes to the expansion of the practical application of the fes sulfite process 5 conclusion as an efficient and safe water treatment technology the fes s iv system was applied for the first time to the remove rox the results showed that rox could be successfully removed at the initial ph which was attributed to the oxidation of so4 oh and 1o2 from the non homogeneous activation the adsorption of fes was used to immobilize the released inorganic arsenic which kept the arsenic concentration under control based on lc ms and dft calculations a reasonable degradation mechanism and pathway were proposed in conclusion the outcomes of our research provide a promising new approach for controlling the aromatic organic arsenic compounds and the released inorganic arsenic species simultaneously declaration of competing

14804,the conventional oxidation adsorption methods are effective for the removal of roxarsone rox but are limited by complicated operation toxic residual oxidant and leaching of toxic metal ions herein we proposed a new approach to improve rox removal i e using the fes sulfite system experimental results showed that approximately 100 of rox 20 mg l was removed and more than 90 of the released inorganic arsenic as v dominated was adsorbed on fes within 40 min this fes sulfite system was a non homogeneous activation process and so4 oh and 1o2 were identified as reactive oxidizing species with their contributions to rox degradation being 48 36 27 97 and 2 64 respectively based on density functional theory calculations and hplc ms results the degradation of rox was achieved by c as breaking electrophilic addition hydroxylation and denitrification it was also found that the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed through a combination of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation and the generated arsenopyrite feass a precursor to ecologically secure scorodite feaso4 2h2o was served as the foundation for further inorganic arsenic mineralization this is the first attempt to use the fes sulfite system for organic heavy metal removal which proposes a prospective technique for the removal of rox graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fes sulfite roxarsone arsenic reactive oxidizing species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction roxarsone rox one of the principal organic arsenic representations has been widely used as farm feed in the poultry sectors for decades due to its benefits in increasing feed efficiency avoiding dysentery and controlling intestinal parasites the rox dosages in the feeds range from 20 to 100 mg kg 1 liu et al 2014 due to restricted absorption around 90 is eliminated in the feces mangalgiri et al 2015 it is evaluated that the rox concentration of poultry and pig manure reaches 76 and 318 mg kg 1 respectively chen et al 2018 however animal manure is used as an economical and effective fertilizer resulting in rox being transported to aquatic areas and soils nachman et al 2005 undergoing chemical and biological decomposition rox could be turned into the more hazardous and transportable inorganic arsenic as iii and as v bednar et al 2003 garbarino et al 2003 ji et al 2016 stolz et al 2007 long term exposure to inorganic arsenic has been shown to cause several cancers e g lung cancer bladder cancer etc fisher et al 2015 it was reported that the rox content in swine farm effluent was 15 9 95 8 mg l by simulating the average amount of produced manure the rox dosages in the manure and the wastewater production rate chen et al 2018 thus there is considerable anxiety about how to eliminate organic arsenic contamination effectively and rapidly currently many approaches were attempted to enhance the removal of rox to simultaneously treat organic and inorganic arsenic contamination oxidation adsorption is the key direction at present given the benefits of short reaction time and high oxidation capacity peroxodisulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms was commonly used as oxidants to tackle organic arsenic contamination fu et al 2022 some self made metal framework materials with adsorptive properties were used as activators chen et al 2021 huang et al 2021 li et al 2022 for example li et al reported that co3o4 la2o2co3 c composite a kind of mof material had an excellent catalytic capability for ps activation to breakdown rox and as v was also eliminated within 90 min li et al 2022 besides employing metal ions as activators and then generating precipitation to adsorb inorganic arsenic through ph control was also investigated cai et al 2022a xie and cheng 2019 cai et al reported that using uv led assisted fe3 for activating ps pms at ph 3 to decompose organic arsenic and subsequently the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed by adjusting ph to 6 under dark conditions for 60 min cai et al 2022a nevertheless the complex operation residual oxidant toxicity and the risk of leaching toxic metal ions are limitations of these methods thus it is an important environmental and ecological significance to develop simple efficient and economical techniques for rox oxidation and removal recently sulfite s iv advanced oxidation processes being considered as an alternative to conventional advanced oxidation processes based on peroxides zhou et al 2022 yang et al 2023b have received increasingly more attention compared to peroxides s iv as the industrial by product of flue gas desulfurization zhuang et al 2021 with the residual can be converted to nontoxic sulfate by aeration has the benefits of being inexpensive and simple to prepare rao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 thus making it non hazardous to humans and the environment many activation methods transition metal ultrasonic thermal and photo activation etc for sulfites have attracted widespread attention zhou et al 2018 mackinawite fes is a metabolically produced tetragonal crystal of sulfate reducing bacteria commonly existing in anaerobic water environments chen et al 2017 fan et al 2022 2018 rickard 1995 as an electron donor or resource for fe2 fes has been demonstrated to activate ps or pms to generate free radicals in previous studies fan et al 2018 furthermore fes was demonstrated that it had a favorable adsorption property for some heavy metals dzade et al 2017 sun et al 2017 especially for inorganic arsenic as iii as v dzade et al 2017 han et al 2013 2011a 2011b jeong et al 2010 up to now there was a little relevant research conducted on the fes s iv for example chen et al utilized fes s iv to degrade 95 of the β blocker propranolol within 20 min and found that the fe2 released by fes was the primary activator chen et al 2020 cai et al enhanced the oxidation capacity of fes s iv by introducing cu ii and achieved high removal of tetracycline within 30 min cai et al 2022b hence it can be hypothesized that the fes s iv system could remove rox and released inorganic arsenic by oxidation and adsorption simultaneously however the process availability and the involved mechanisms of rox removal have not been elucidated yet therefore it is of great significance to investigate the oxidation capacity and adsorption mechanism of rox removal by fes s iv the objectives of this study are as follows i to evaluate the viability of the fes s iv process towards rox and released inorganic arsenic removal ii to determine the reactive oxidizing species ross leading to rox abatement and calculate their contributions iii to clarify the s iv activation mechanism with fes iv to determine the reaction sites degradation intermediates and degradation pathways for rox elimination using density functional theory dft calculation and hplc ms results v to discuss the destination of inorganic arsenic in the system vi to analyze the effects of various factors and coexisting components on rox abatement 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals roxarsone rox c6h6asno6 98 was purchased from shanghai yi en chemical technology co commercial fes solids 70 purchased from china national pharmaceutical chemical reagent were grinded into powder and passed through a 200 mesh sieve before use other reagents including sodium sulfite methanol ma tert butanol tba l histidine l his sodium hydroxide concentrated sulfuric acid 1 10 o phenanthroline monohydrate sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate sodium nitrate acetic acid sodium acetate trihydrate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were obtained from china national pharmaceutical chemical reagent c methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 and humic acid ha 90 was obtained from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co o all chemicals were of at least analytical grade and the deionized water 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare solutions 2 2 experimental procedures the conical flasks of 250 ml capacity were used for the batch experiments firstly the reactor was initially filled with sodium sulfite and rox at the desired concentration the ph was not adjusted during the reaction without extra notes then a magnetic stirrer was used to mix the solution at 500 rpm until it was homogeneous at room temperature finally the fes was added to initiate the reaction the samples were taken at set intervals of 1 ml instantly terminated with ma 1 ml and subsequently loaded through organic filter membranes 0 22 μm into a small brown vial for subsequent analysis to estimate the reproducibility of fes the remaining granules were filtered out washed more than three times with methanol and then dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c the substance was then employed again after cooling naturally unless otherwise specified average results with standard deviations are presented for all studies that were conducted at least twice 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of rox and the intermediate products were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography fe2 fe3 were measured by a 1 10 phenanthroline method the electron spin resonance esr technique was adopted to record the produced radicals the details were provided in text s1 2 4 characterizations the fes sample morphology was taken by scanning electron microscopy using zeiss sigma 300 sem germany the crystalline phase of the fes was determined by bruker d8 advance powder x ray cu ka radiation diffractometer xrd germany the variations of elemental composition and surface chemical characteristics of the samples were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kratos ultra dld uk fu et al 2022 and fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir iraffinity 1 japan 2 5 calculation the reaction kinetics of rox removal is described by the pseudo first order kinetic model which has been widely used to characterize the removal of organic pollutants the contributions of oh λ oh s o 4 λ s o 4 and 1 o 2 λ 1 o 2 was calculated to investigate the dominant radicals respectively dft calculations were conducted on a gaussian 09 package yang et al 2022 details in text s2 3 results 3 1 feasibility of s iv activation with fes for rox abatement due to the inexpensive and nontoxic properties fes s iv was investigated to degrade some pollutants such as β blocker chen et al 2020 tetracycline cai et al 2022b etc to verify the feasibility of rox removal by fes s iv three batch experiments including fes alone s iv alone and fes s iv system were evaluated for 90 min the removal rate of rox by s iv alone is almost none and fes alone is nearly 65 fig 1 a according to the findings the catalyst had strong adsorption potential and s iv alone was almost not capable of rox oxidation which was parallel to the previous research chen et al 2020 however almost 100 of rox was removed with the treatment of fes and s iv for 60 min and it was shown that the surface was corroded and some materials were adsorbed in the sem test fig 1 b which indicated that the coexistence of fes and s iv could significantly enhance the rox removal without altering the fes adsorption characteristics although the system demonstrated outstanding properties for rox removal the mechanism of oxidation of rox the generation pathway of ross and the destination of inorganic arsenic were still unidentified these confusions would be further explored in the later sections 3 2 mechanism of oxidation 3 2 1 identification of reactive species it has been reported that the ross generated by transition metal activated s iv include s o 3 s o 5 s o 4 oh etc but the redox potentials of s o 3 and s o 5 are low e so3 0 63 v e so5 0 81 v das et al 1999 and both of them are further converted to s o 4 eqs 1 2 thus s o 4 and oh were explored in the experiment according to the available literature it is known that ma can quench s o 4 and oh k ma ho 4 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k ma so4 1 1 2 5 107 m 1s 1 while tba has a much higher reaction rate with oh k tba ho 4 2 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 to validate the prevailing ross both of them were introduced into system as scavengers respectively undoubtedly the removal of rox was significantly inhibited illustrating that ross played a crucial role in rox removal fig 2 a b at 100 mm of scavengers the rox removal rate with ma added was 66 and the kobs reduced from 0 10674 to 0 02526 min 1 while the kobs was 0 07688 min 1 with tba added fig s1 indicating that the effect of oh was limited using dmpo as a probe esr was used to detect free radicals and the findings indicated that dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were present in the solution fig 2 d e as a result of nucleophilic substitution dmpo so4 is easily converted to dmpo oh which is much more stable leading that the signal of dmpo oh was louder than that of dmpo so4 eqs 3 and 4 xu et al 2016 1 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 2 so 5 hso 3 so 4 2 so 4 h 3 so 4 o h oh so 4 2 4 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h in previous studies only s o 4 with oh were detected in the fes s iv system however in the literature of zhou it was demonstrated that 1o2 one of the main ross was produced by the reaction of so 4 with so3 2 in the fe3 caso3 system eqs 5 7 zhou et al 2022 therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that 1o2 would play a role in the fes s iv system which was confirmed in the esr experiment fig 2 d to investigate the contribution of 1o2 in rox removal l his was added to the system as a quencher k l his 1 o2 3 2 5 0 107 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 the inhibition effect was apparent fig 2 c and the kobs c l his 100 mm was only 0 0224 min 1 figure s1 c it is worth mentioning that in addition to 1o2 l his could react with h o and so 4 k l his ho 5 109 m 1s 1 k l his so4 2 5 109 m 1s 1 ren et al 2022 so this phenomenon only indicated the involvement of 1o2 in the degradation the contributions of the three free radicals were calculated eqs s2 s4 and the most prevalent free radical in the degrading process was determined to be so4 λ s o 4 48 36 λ oh 27 97 λ 1 o 2 2 64 in addition fe iv was reported to be detected in fe iii sulfite based systems luo et al 2022 the high valent iron species can oxidize pmso to pmso2 cai et al 2022b however pmso2 was not detected in our experiment indicating fe iv did not exist data not shown 5 2 so 4 2 so 3 1 o 2 6 2 so 4 so 3 2 3 so 3 1 o 2 e 7 4 so 4 2 so 3 2 2 so 4 2 4 so 3 1 o 2 3 2 2 activation of s iv by fes to explore the production mechanism of ross xps was separately carried out on fresh and used fes the results are illustrated in fig 4 and fig 6 a details in table s2 for fresh fes fe ii accounted for 76 43 in fe 2p3 2 and s2 at s 2p with a proportion of 80 65 indicating that fe ii and s2 were the dominant substances before the reaction after the reaction fe ii remained dominant with a slight decrease of 13 81 while correspondingly the proportion of fe iii increased to 37 38 indicating that the reaction occurred on the surface of fes where fe ii was transformed to fe iii which was in accordance with the xrd pattern with a slight change in phase and intensity after the reaction figure s2 this revealed that s iv may was activated on the surface of the substance and not due to the leaching of iron ions as suggested in the literature chen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the conjecture was confirmed by the following outcomes for fe2 and fe3 the maximum leaching concentrations were 1 16 mg l and 0 43 mg l respectively fig 3 a moreover the degradation of rox was unsatisfactory by dosing 1 6 mg l of fe2 fig 3 b it demonstrated that the activation of s iv by fes was not due to the leaching of fe2 but a non homogeneous process eqs 8 12 additionally the variation in the dominance of s species should not be neglected as can be obtained from the s 2p spectrum the proportion of s2 decreased by 36 62 implying that s2 acted as an electron donor providing electrons for the reduction of fe iii leading to a cycle of fe ii fe iii fe ii eqs 12 13 fan et al 2018 which is the reason for the increase in s o ratio from 19 35 to 38 68 as for the generated polysulfide sn 2 it might be an intermediate formed by the oxidation of s2 or associated with the reaction of inorganic arsenic with fes notably the consumption of s2 is irreversible throughout the whole process and the peak of s 2p can also be seen to be significantly weakened fig 6 a which explained why the rox removal rate dropped in the reuse section 8 fe ii hso 3 fehso 3 9 fehso 3 1 4 o 2 feso 3 1 2 h 2 o 10

chemistry technique have been widely used in various fields chemistry materials science etc it can provide more deep information than experiments on the structure properties and degradation pathways of compounds yang et al 2023a in advanced oxidation it has been used to further explore the reaction behavior and intrinsic mechanisms jing et al 2023 for example wang et al identified transformation products and vulnerable positions of bisphenol analogues molecules by dft calculations wang et al 2022 du et al used dft calculations to reveal specific reaction sites on smx and predicted intermediates du et al 2018 in our research the degradation pathway of rox was analyzed by combining the results of lc ms and dft calculations the optimized structure and numbering system of rox were shown in fig 5 as was proven in the previous section the oxidation of rox was connected to the attacks by ross as a consequence the fukui index values of f 0 which indicates that radical attack was chosen to depict the reactive sites of rox and the findings were presented in fig 5 details in fig s3 casid a et al 1998 the rox degradation was initiated by the breakage of the as c bond which was more susceptible to attack by free radicals due to its rich electron density and the higher f 0 values li et al 2022 xie and cheng 2019 rox was converted to o nitrophenol and inorganic as iv which was rapidly converted to as iii and as v by the disproportionation huang et al 2021 and then as iii would be further oxidized to as v with ultimate adsorption by fes on the one hand o nitrophenol p1 was converted to 2 nitrobenzene 1 4 diol p2 by electrophilic addition reaction of free radicals li et al 2022 su et al 2019 and 7 n atom with the higher f 0 values is the strong electron acceptor leading to the conversion of p2 to hydroxyquinoline p4 undetected li et al 2022 su et al 2019 on the other hand due to the homo substitution of oh to the nitro group on the benzene ring during denitrification leading to the shedding of the no2 zhang et al 2007 which reacted with the so4 to generate the nitro radical no2 ji et al 2016 then no2 combined with p1 multiple times and gradually produced 2 4 dinitrophenol p3 and 2 4 6 trinitrophenol p5 similarly p3 could be turned into p4 by denitrification the p4 was further oxidized to form 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone p6 finally as the reaction continuously proceeded p5 and p6 could be further mineralized to no3 co2 and h2o by sufficient free radicals 3 3 destination of inorganic arsenic 3 3 1 transformation of inorganic arsenic as species undergo a marked transformation during degradation fig 6 c finally as v is the major inorganic arsenic in solution as opposed to as iii it was attributed to the fact that the free radicals attacked the as c bond of rox causing breakage and generation of unstable as iv which would rapidly be disproportionate to as v and as iii huang et al 2021 meanwhile the as iii was then swiftly turned to as v by the ross additionally due to the adsorption of fes total arsenic concentrations dropped steadily from 5 74 mg l to 0 4 mg l in about 40 min below the 0 5 mg l combined wastewater discharge limit gb 8978 1996 3 3 2 mechanism of inorganic arsenic adsorption the ftir and core level spectra of as 3d were used to investigate the mechanism of adsorption fig 6 b and d for fresh fes the bands at 3416 and 1630 cm 1 were the results of the stretching of surface adsorbed water molecules and ho h deformation respectively chiriţă et al 2008 furthermore the peaks at 1384 1018 and 704 cm 1 were attributed to the presence of s o due to the oxidation of fes or the production of so4 2 resulting in symmetric and asymmetric stretching chiriţă et al 2008 sun et al 2017 the peak at 618 cm 1 revealed the occurrence of fe s sun et al 2017 attractively there are three new bands in the used fes the peak at 478 cm 1 once again indicated the existence of multiple forms of sulfur eg sn 2 mikhlin et al 2002 and the band at 2914 cm 1 was due to the stretching mode of fe oh 3 s chiriţă et al 2008 the formation of which will be discussed in subsequent sections the most noteworthy peak is at 830 cm 1 it reflected the existence of as o an et al 2017 and also proved the inorganic arsenic was adsorbed additionally both as iii and as v are observed on the surface of the material in fig 6 d with as v o 71 91 being the predominant component followed by as iii o 19 65 and the least being as iii s 8 44 the composition of these peaks indicates that the adsorption of inorganic arsenic by fes is a conjunction of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation farquhar et al 2002 in prior studies effective disposal of adsorbed inorganic arsenic was not discussed in practical applications inorganic arsenic may be susceptible into the environment by physical and chemical changes through arsenic precipitates such arsenic sulfide calcium arsenate iron arsenate and others min et al 2015 in contrast immobilization of arsenic in crystalline scorodite feaso4 2h2o is the preferred route because of its limited solubility and high arsenic concentration gonzález contreras et al 2012 feass a precursor can react with fes to compose scorodite under autoclave conditions wang and ferron 2003 in our research the coexistence of the three as s fe oh 3 and sn 2 provides evidence for the production of feass eqs 14 15 han et al 2013 therefore the phenomenon provides the basis for the subsequent mineralization of inorganic arsenic 14 15 3 4 effect of various parameters on the rox removal 3 4 1 effect of fes s iv and rox dose fig 7 a showed the effect of fes dosage on the rox decrease in the fes s iv system when the fes concentration increased from 1 0 g l to 2 5 g l the removal rate of rox almost tended to 100 which indicated the superiority of the system for the removal of rox to investigate the variation of the reaction the pseudo first order kinetic model was employed figure s4 as the fes dose increased from 0 5 g l to 2 g l the kobs increased from 0 01262 to 0 07981 min 1 however when the concentration of fes further increased to 2 5 g l the corresponding kobs decreased to 0 07547 min 1 fig s4 a because the higher concentration of fes the more activation sites and ross are available liu et al 2017 triggering the quenching reaction eqs 16 18 huang et al 2021 which resulted to an inhibition of the degradation of rox moreover the reaction of the released reducing substances s2 and fe2 with ross is also a cause yu et al 2021 fig 7 b and c displayed the effect of s iv dose and rox concentration on rox abatement the kobs gradually increased from 0 04395 to 0 08385 min 1 as the s iv concentration rose from 0 1 g l to 0 3 g l then the kobs decreased as the s iv dosage increasing fig s4b this phenomenon was likely due to the fact that so 4 e0 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 was transformed to so 3 e0 0 63 v hayon et al 2002 with low redox potential eq 19 chen et al 2012 considering the variation of rox dosage as the rox dosage increases to 50 mg l the kobs decreases from 0 08988 to 0 03489 min 1 fig 7 d and fig s4 c which was to the fact that ross generation rate was inadequate to keep up with the rox removal 16 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 or 2 so 4 2 17 so 4 oh hso 5 18 oh oh h 2 o 2 19 so 4 hso 3 hso 4 so 3 20 hso 5 hso 3 2 so 4 2 h 2 o 3 4 2 effect of initial ph and do as illustrated in fig 7 d the rox elimination in the fes s iv process was affected by the solution ph the rox could be removed in a wide ph 5 0 9 0 and the rox removal rate was as high as 97 during 10 min at the initial ph of 5 with the kobs reaching 0 18422 min 1 fig s4 d the phpzc of fes was about 7 dominic and di toro 1996 when exposed to an acidic environment fes became positively charged which might increase its electrostatic attraction to s iv and rox s iv existed as hso5 rox as rox chen et al 2021 furthermore the fe2 production was triggered by the acidic surroundings which might produce extra ross via homogeneous reactions eqs 21 22 chen et al 2020 fig 8 a showed the effect of dissolved oxygen do on rox removal obviously the elimination of the target contaminant was severely impeded under n2 aeration fig 8 a it is mainly attributed to the fact that do is involved in generating so 4 eqs 8 12 zhou et al 2018 additionally we observed a sharp decline in do within the first 5 min fig 8 b 21 22 f e 2 hso 5 so 4 f e 3 o h 4 environmental influences 4 1 influence of coexisting ions the mechanism of oxidation adsorption has been well established for rox removal by fes s iv due to the existence of various natural organic matter and inorganic anions in the water environment we are inclined to explore the universality of fes s iv the representative inorganic ions no3 hco3 cl and dissolved organic matter ha were introduced as expected different species and concentrations of inorganic ions have different effects on the degradation of rox in deionized water no3 had an absence of effect on the rox removal fig 9 a and figure s5 a hco3 had a significant inhibitory effect on rox removal when the hco3 concentration was increased to 100 mm a reduction in rox removal to 64 was observed fig 9 b and fig s5 b undoubtedly the altered value of ph resulting from an increase in hco3 was one of the causes of inhibition ph c hco3 100 mm 9 furthermore due to the lower reactivity and higher selectivity of c o 3 and hc o 3 hco3 was found to have an inhibitory effect on degradation by o h or s o 4 eqs 23 26 sharma et al 2015 wang and wang 2021 the presence of cl inhibited the reaction at low concentrations while promoting the removal of rox at high concentrations fig 9 c and fig s5 c at low concentrations c cl 1 mm the main form is cl with less reactivity eqs 27 29 huang et al 2021 at high concentrations c cl 100 mm the dominant form is the free chlorine cl2 hclo eqs 30 33 fang et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 having a strong oxidizing capacity to oxidize the target pollutant fig 9 d depicted the effect of ha on rox removal the removal of rox was apparently inhibited by the addition of ha with the kobs from 0 10005 min 1 to 0 02421 min 1 fig s5 d the primary reason is that functional groups carbonyl etc in ha can consume ross zhang et al 2020 moreover extensive ha tends to congregate on the surface of fes inhibiting exposure of fe ii to s iv chi et al 2022 23 oh c o 3 2 c o 3 o h 24 oh hco 3 hc o 3 o h 25 s o 4 c o 3 2 c o 3 s o 4 2 26 s o 4 hco 3 hc o 3 so 4 2 27 28 29 30 oh cl 2 hclo c l 31 hso 5 c l hclo so 4 2 32 c l c l c l 2 33 cl 2 cl 2 c l 2 c l 4 2 reuse of the fes the stability test was performed by using recycled fes the results showed that the removal rate of rox decreased by nearly 50 after three times fig s6 the reasons are as indicated below firstly the sulfur on the fes surface that was continuously consumed in the reaction was not replenished during the recycling secondly the reaction sites may be occupied by adsorption products after reactions thirdly during the recycling process some fes was lost due to operation and other factors fig s7 furthermore the deterioration of fes dispersion in the solution during the recovery process may also be one of the reasons in addition methods to improve the reusability of fes e g addition of tiny reductants synthesis of new fe containing materials using metal organic frameworks will be explored in the future 4 3 environme ntal implication since 1999 and 2013 rox was banned from the eu and us respectively arts et al 2013 su et al 2019 however rox was still extensively used as feed in developing countries including china and india su et al 2019 wang and cheng 2015 it was speculated that rox concentrations in swine farm effluent can reach up to 95 8 mg l chen et al 2018 the rox and its degradation products can seep into groundwater or accumulate in soil and plants causing hazards to humans therefore methods for the removal of rox and released inorganic arsenic were extensively investigated by researchers in the past such as feooh h2o2 zhang et al 2018 α feooh gca uv persulfate su et al 2019 mos2 schwertmannite uv h2o2 wang et al 2021 in this study the fes s iv system was used to remove rox and released inorganic arsenic for the first time it was found that the fes s iv technique could remove 100 rox and 90 inorganic arsenic simultaneously in 40 min the ross generated through a non homogeneous activation played a crucial role in the oxidative degradation of rox at the initial ph three free radicals so4 oh and 1o2 were detected among which so4 played a predominant function the released inorganic arsenic was adsorbed by fes in the forms of outer sphere complexation and surface co precipitation and the generated feass served as a basis for further inorganic arsenic mineralization compared with other methods it took less time to remove pollutants had higher removal efficiency with the same rox concentrations seen in table 1 furthermore the system also has the advantages of rich raw materials environmental friendliness and low cost without the risk of leaching toxic metal ions due to the existence of various natural organic matter and inorganic anions in the nature water environment the universality of fes s iv was also explored the results indicated that the removal of rox was achieved successfully under the interference of various coexisting components which showed that fes s iv process was promising as a simple and effective method for the treatment of rox containing wastewaters this research is of great importance to the comprehensive utilization of fes s iv system which not only advances the understanding of the reaction between fes and s iv but also contributes to the expansion of the practical application of the fes sulfite process 5 conclusion as an efficient and safe water treatment technology the fes s iv system was applied for the first time to the remove rox the results showed that rox could be successfully removed at the initial ph which was attributed to the oxidation of so4 oh and 1o2 from the non homogeneous activation the adsorption of fes was used to immobilize the released inorganic arsenic which kept the arsenic concentration under control based on lc ms and dft calculations a reasonable degradation mechanism and pathway were proposed in conclusion the outcomes of our research provide a promising new approach for controlling the aromatic organic arsenic compounds and the released inorganic arsenic species simultaneously declaration of competing
