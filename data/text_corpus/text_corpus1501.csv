7505,partial expansion was observed in stratified subsidence during foundation pit dewatering however the phenomenon was suspected to be an error because the compression of layers is known to occur when subsidence occurs a slice of the subsidence cone induced by drawdown was selected as the prototype model tests were performed to investigate the phenomenon the underlying confined aquifer was generated as a movable rigid plate with a hinge at one end the overlying layers were simulated with remolded materials collected from a construction site model tests performed under the conceptual model indicated that partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions during foundation pit dewatering rapid drawdown resulted in rapid subsidence in the dewatered confined aquifer the rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top was the bottom deformation boundary of the overlying layers non coordination deformation was observed at the top and bottom of the subsiding overlying layers the subsidence of overlying layers was larger at the bottom than at the top the layers expanded and became thicker the phenomenon was verified using numerical simulation method based on finite difference method compared with numerical simulation results the boundary effect of the physical tests was obvious in the observation point close to the movable endpoint the tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon the partial expansion of overlying soil layers was defined as inversed rebound the inversed rebound was induced by inversed coordination deformation compression was induced by the consolidation in the overlying soil layers because of drainage partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression considering the inversed rebound traditional layer wise summation method for calculating subsidence should be revised and improved keywords foundation pit dewatering partial expansion model test coordinated subsidence consolidation subsidence numerical verification 1 introduction groundwater extraction plays a direct role in land subsidence by causing the compaction of susceptible aquifer systems galloway and burbey 2011 when ground water in underlying confined aquifers endangered excavation the water level was lowered to ensure safety subsidence induced by groundwater withdrawal has been recognized and cumulatively evaluated in a large number of situations modoni et al 2013 land subsidence is a serious environmental geological problem in china ye et al 2016a b various studies have been carried out to predict the subsidence induced by lowering water levels such as statistical method holzer

subsidence due to groundwater pumping together with a corresponding land subsidence prediction method shen et al 2006 and shen and xu 2011 established a numerical model to predict the behavior of land subsidence in shanghai because of groundwater pumping wang et al 2012 suggested three ways to control seepage and discussed the combined effects of pumping curtain and recharging wells yoo et al 2012 presented a case where excessive ground settlement occurred around a conventional tunnel the excessive ground settlement was caused by tunneling induced groundwater drawdown a similar case of land subsidence was monitored and analyzed by lopez fernandez et al 2013 in a tunnel excavation wang et al 2013a b investigated the influences of dewatering on deep excavation and surrounding deformation loaiciga 2013 proposed a new equation to calculate vertical consolidation settlement in aquifers caused by pumping an equation that is viewed as a modification of traditional 1d consolidation theory however the subsidence predicted using consolidation theory was larger than the observed one for the multi aquifer and multi aquitard mama system in china the predicted subsidence has to be revised through an empirical coefficient to match the observation field and laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the deformation law of layers burbey 1999 2001 2003 2006 2008 burbey et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013a b c d li et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 minderhoud et al 2015 however the reason for the inaccurate prediction was not discussed partial expansion phenomenon was observed in a subway foundation pit close to an operating high rise bridge by complicated monitoring measures under the demand of environment protection during foundation pit dewatering wang et al 2009 2013a b c d zhu et al 2015 in shanghai china this phenomenon may be one of the potential reasons for the inaccurate subsidence prediction when the partial expansion phenomenon was first observed it was suspected to be a monitoring error of the observation method using multipoint extensometers in soft soil reproducing the phenomenon in layered soil in the laboratory and observing the deformation was a key step to check its existence model tests were performed in this study to check the existence and understand the mechanism of partial expansion phenomenon in a mama system during foundation pit dewatering numerical methods were introduced to reproduce the partial expansion and correct the results of model tests the existence of partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation condition was confirmed the mechanism of the phenomenon was explained by the model tests and numerical simulations which can be used as references to revise and improve subsidence calculation method for foundation pit dewatering 2 background shanghai is located in front of the yangtze river delta plain besides sporadic residual volcanic rocks exposed in the southwest all the bedrocks are covered with quaternary strata the layers of shanghai are composed of typical mama system according to generation time genetic types and main engineering geological features the quaternary strata in shanghai area were divided into 16 engineering geological strata shanghai geological environmental atlas 2002 seven major engineering geological layers are shown in table 1 the aquifer system underlying shanghai is not a complete independent groundwater system but rather a part of the water systems of the yangtze delta the first sand layer corresponds to the phreatic aquifer in the hydrogeological section of the region and the second to the sixth sand layers correspond to the first to fifth confined aquifers apart from the sixth sandy soil distributed in the northern region the remaining sand layers in the region have relatively stable distribution in some sand layers clay lenses exist semipermeable aquifers composed of clay and silty clay are distributed between the sand layers for normal foundation pit dewatering only micro confined the first confined and second confined aquifers were considered according to engineering geological and hydrogeological conditions as well as the combinations of formation the shanghai area was divided into four landform partitions lake plains coastal plains river sand and tidal flat fig 1 coastal plain partition was selected as the background of the model test most of the confined aquifers of dewatering engineering in shanghai are concentrated in the first confined aquifer the overlying strata include the topsoil first sand first hard soil first soft soil second soft soil and second hard soil layers according to the physical and mechanical properties of the overlying combined strata the overlying strata were summarized into muddy clay sandy silt and silty clay layers the confined aquifer was generalized as silty sand layer physical property indexes of the summarized layers are shown in table 2 the foundation pit of yishan road station subway line 9 is a typical foundation pit in shanghai the geological and hydrological conditions of the pit can represent a type of geological partition and the pits in the city center of shanghai the description of layers is shown in fig 2 b due to the high request of environment protection lots of monitoring and field experiments were performed here obtaining enough monitoring data the pit was selected as the case for investigating the partial expansion phenomenon partial expansion phenomenon in the subsidence was observed in the foundation pit dewatering of the pit wang et al 2009 2013a b c d zhu et al 2015 the subsidence velocity of the bottom was larger than the top in an aquitard there was a different subsidence acceleration for the bottom and top of an aquitard although the bottom and top of the aquitard were all subsided the velocity of bottom was faster than that of top then the thickness of the aquitard was increasing and expansion occurred fig 2 3 material and methods 3 1 conceptual model for a 3d subsidence cone induced by foundation pit dewatering a slice was selected to represent the subsidence in that direction fig 3 during dewatering the effective stress increased and the aquifer was compressed when the water pressure decreased because of the lowering water level when dewatering was stopped the water pressure increased and recovered to the initial level the effective stress decreased and the layer rebounded in foundation pit dewatering the subsidence mechanism of granular material in the confined aquifer was clear and could be predicted accurately therefore the deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer was simulated with a displacement boundary however the deformation course of the aquitard overlying the dewatered confined aquifer was unclear the aquitards adjacent to the dewatered confined aquifer the lowering water level in the confined aquifer resulted in very large hydraulic gradient in the aquitards nearby the boundary to the confined aquifer seepage and weak flow occurred under the large hydraulic gradient consolidation deformation occurred during the course meanwhile the overlying aquitards adjacent to the dewatered confined aquifer deformed with the subsiding roof of the underlying confined aquifer the drawdown in the dewatered confined aquifer developed rapidly the rapidly developing drawdown resulted in rapidly developing subsidence the rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top act as bottom deformation boundary for the overlying layers the adjacent overlying layers deformed to coordinate with the underlying deformation boundary if the displacement of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard were equal the subsidence of ground surface equaled to the deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer and adjacent overlying aquitards if the deformations of the top and bottom of the adjacent overlying layers were different then compression or expansion occurred corresponding to positive and negative differences the conceptual model of subsidence induced by foundation pit dewatering is shown in fig 3 during dewatering at field subsidence does take place due to effective stress and pore pressure changes the subsidence includes two parts one is the subsidence in dewatered confined aquifer the other is the deformation of overlying aquitard the subsidence in aquifer occurs quickly and the one in aquitard occurs slowly it is difficult and complex to consider the two subsidence in a model at the same time for the deformation in sand can be predicted more precisely the deformation is considered as a moveable plate controlled manually with jacks i e a deformation boundary the overlying aquitards were simulated using remold soils the aquitard and its subsidence including movement with underlying boundary and self consolidation are the focus of the current study the above description is also the conceptual model for the test two kinds of layers are used in the experiment the deformation of underlying aquifer forms a subsidence cone corresponding to a drawdown cone one slice of the cone is selected for it belongs to a symmetrical shape the linear boundary between two points is used to simulate the upper deformation in underlying aquifer sand meanwhile the linear boundary provides the deformation boundary for overlying clay for foundation pit dewatering the pumping of confined aquifer can decrease the water level quickly the time reaching stable state is several days although the consolidation in overlying aquitard occurred at this time the minor deformation is neglected in conceptual model so we separate the dewatering and consolidation of the underlying aquifer the movement of the hinged plate from the changing of the water levels on the ends of the sand tank the underlying deformed aquifer is summarized as a moveable boundary fig 3 the underlying confined aquifer was simulated with a deformation boundary the curve of a slice of subsidence cone of dewatered confined aquifer was generated as a line the subsidence cone of the underlying confined aquifer was simulated using the displacement of a rigid steel plate the overlying layers were simulated with similitude material and the bottom boundary of the similitude material was the deformation boundary of the underlying confined aquifer the displacement of the boundary simulated the subsidence of the underlying confined layer induced by dewatering the lowering water pressure simulated the lowering water level seepage boundary of the underlying confined aquifer 3 2 analogous material according to the theory and dimensional analysis requirements can be deduced from force equilibrium equations geometry hooke s law and boundary conditions fumagalli 1973 the process of similarity analysis is shown in appendix 1 to simplify the similitude material and avoid complicated similitude materials remolded soil was adopted to simulate the prototype soil under natural conditions the compressive modulus of the overlying soil depended on stress level the 1 10th scale of compressive modulus was adopted according to the comparison between the compressive modulus of the remolded soil under model test condition and prototype soil in the field under the original stress conditions table 3 the geometric scale was determined according to the size of the prototype and the possible model box the influence of stress on permeability was ignored and the 1 1st scale of hydraulic conductivity was adopted meanwhile the 1 10th scale of time was adopted according to the above principles the geometry scale is c l 40 and the gravity scale is c r 1 table 4 3 3 model tests operation in the model test a displacement boundary was set to simulate the deformation of the underlying confined aquifer dewatered in a short duration at the same time water pressure head was set between the overlying layers and underlying confined aquifer to simulate the seepage deformation of the overlying layers the model box was designed as a long strip shaped box the steel plate rotating around a hinge was used to simulate the roof deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer the movement of the plate simulated the deformation of the roof of the confined aquifer the displacement of the different points of the plate simulated the subsidence cone corresponding to drawdown cone controlling the water level of the water tank on both sides of the model box simulated the seepage of the overlying soil layers one fixed end of the plate was used to simulate the progressive deformation of the confined aquifer the other end controlled by the jack simulated the deformation of the top surface of the confined aquifer with the change of drawdown cone the device used for the physical model tests is shown in fig 4 remolded soil was used to simulate the summarized soil layer in this model test the remolded soil materials were all collected from the construction site then the remolded soil was prepared by drying crushing and reshaping the physical mechanical parameters of the remolded soil are shown in table 5 to minimize side friction the wall of the model was smeared with vaseline the bottom of the soil layers was provided with a sand layer to facilitate drainage the procedures for preparing the soil layer were as follows 1 the movable plate was positioned at the initial position i e horizontal position 2 standard sand was used to construct the bottom sand layer 100 mm in thickness 3 layer 3 200 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded silt clay 4 layer 2 200 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded sandy silt 5 layer 1 500 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded muddy clay 6 topsoil layer 100 mm in thickness was constructed using hard clay all the soil layers were evenly filled and compacted every 50 mm in the model box to measure the stratified subsidence 13 benchmark poles 13 displacement transducers 6 soil pressure cells and 6 pore pressure gauges were installed fig 4 b the displacement transducer wy0 was set at the bottom of the movable endpoint to monitor the subsidence the displacement transducers wy11 wy21 wy31 and wy41 were placed on the top of layer 1 and the distance to the wall of the movable endpoint were 200 800 1400 and 2000 mm respectively in the same way wy12 wy22 wy32 and wy42 were installed on the top of layer 2 and wy13 wy23 wy33 and wy43 were installed on the top of layer 3 to facilitate data analysis the virtual measurement points wy14 wy24 wy34 and wy44 were set and their values were equal to 230 250wy0 170 250wy0 110 250wy0 and 50 250wy0 the soil pressure cells ty11 piezometers ky11 and ty21 ky12 were set at the middle of layer 1 and their distance to the movable endpoint was 500 and 1100 mm in the same way ty12 and ty22 were set at the middle of layer 2 and ty13 ky12 and ty23 ky22 were located on top of layer 3 the detailed test procedures were as follows 1 self weight consolidation and saturation when all the monitoring instruments were installed the water was injected into both sides of the water tank to reach the top of layer 1 for self weight consolidation and hydraulic balance 2 movable plate settlement when all of the monitoring data of soil layers were stable after the water injection about 30 h the jack was controlled to lower the movable bottom plate to simulate the subsidence cone caused by dewatering in the top of the underlying confined aquifer under undrained condition the water level was maintained at the top of layer 1 three working scenarios were performed lower 15 mm in an hour lower 15 mm in half an hour and lower 20 mm instantaneously 3 lowering water level keeping the state of the jack the water level on both sides of the water tank was lowered two times without interval the water level was lowered 500 mm each time in about five minutes to simulate the drawdown under drainage condition 4 movable plate settlement for the second time slowly raised the movable plate to the initial position about one hour and slowly recovered the water level to the initial position when all the monitoring data of the soil layers were stable again after several days the jack was controlled to once again sink the movable bottom plate twice sink 15 mm for 1 5 h and sink 20 mm instantaneously 4 results and discussions the self consolidation and hydraulic balance process lasted 30 h until the subsidence reached stable state fig 5 layer 1 subsided 3 8 4 5 mm layer 2 subsided 0 5 1 0 mm slight expansion occurred in layer 3 after compression because of hydraulic balance and then reached stable state the subsidence of the top of each overlying layer caused by movable plate settlement under different settlement velocities is shown in fig 6 the vertical displacement of the top of layer 3 w13 w23 w33 w43 was larger than that of layer 2 w12 w22 w32 w42 the vertical displacement of the top of layer 2 w13 w23 w33 w43 was larger than that of layer 1 w11 w21 w31 w41 the subsidence of layer 3 was the largest the medium was layer 2 and the least was layer 1 the thickness of layers 1 2 was increasing and expansion occurred fig 6 a the phenomenon was quite similar to the monitoring expansion in field fig 2 the subsidence of the top of each layer generally decreased with the increasing horizontal distance to the movable endpoint fig 7 however the subsidence of the points with a horizontal distance of 200 mm to movable endpoint was less than the points with a horizontal distance of 800 mm which may be influence by the boundary effect of box wall fig 7 the subsidence and subsidence velocity of the monitoring points with a horizontal distance of 800 mm to the movable endpoint was the largest the expansion of the overlying layers occurred because of unloading relaxation combining with the moveable boundary effect the stratified subsidence of different layers is shown in fig 8 the subsidence of the top of each layer increased with increasing depth and settlement velocity the points w11 w14 were the most obvious the subsidence of the top of the overlying layers caused by the movable plate settlement for the second time is shown in fig 9 the partial expansion phenomena were less obvious than the first time the points wy11 wy13 were the most obvious which were the nearest to the movable endpoint the subsidence of the top of each layer increased with increasing depth which was consistent with the first movable plate settlement after the settlement of the moveable plate water level in the bottom boundary of overlying layer was lowered to simulate the drainage corresponding to the dewatering of underlying confined aquifer the subsidence increment of the top of each layer singly caused by the lowering water level is shown in fig 10 the partial expansion phenomenon became complex because of the lowering water level the subsidence of w13 exceeded that of w12 indicating that the subsidence increment induced by the consolidation exceeded the expansion increment induced by non coordination deformation however the subsidence of w12 was still less than that of w11 and that the subsidence increment induced by the consolidation was less than the expansion increment induced by non coordination deformation the expansion of the layer between wy11 and wy12 was continued when the expansion of the layer between w12 and w13 was decreased the whole layers showed expansion because that the compression induced by consolidation was less than the expansion induced by deformation coordination based on the data in fig 6 the change of the thickness of each layer caused by the movable plate settlement in three velocities is shown in fig 11 the subsidence of the bottom was larger than that of the top in the overlying aquitars and the layer was expanding and became thicker all overlying soil layers showed expansion the closer to the movable endpoint the larger of the expansion with the increasing depth the partial expansion became more obvious all soil layers presented a compression phenomenon during the drainage fig 12 the compression of layer 3 which was the nearest to the lowering water level boundary was the most obvious the compression increased with the increasing depth of soil layer the compression decreased with increasing horizontal distance to movable endpoint the weight of the overlying layer was generally exerted on the top of underlying layers and then passed down on the basis of the principle of effective stress pore water pressure in confined aquifer and overlying layers decreased because of dewatering and effective stress increased the compression of layers was caused by consolidation subsidence and compression deformation the consolidation subsidence of the underlying confined aquifer formed a deformation boundary for overlying layers the rapid developing deformation boundary caused downwards rebound in the overlying soil layers the phenomenon was defined as inversed rebound to distinguish it from the normally defined upwards rebound caused by excavation the explanation of the phenomenon is shown in fig 13 the closer to the confined aquifer the more obvious the inversed rebound owing to the consolidation subsidence of the underlying confined aquifer the deformation coordination occurred from the bottom to the top in the overlying layers the overlying layers adjacent to the confined aquifer expanded the course was defined as the inversed deformation coordination the settlement velocity of the movable plate obviously influenced the expansive deformation of the overlying layers in a short term fig 11 the conceptual model of the inverse rebound and inverse deformation coordination is shown in fig 13 the consolidation occurred first in the confined aquifer owing to dewatering under the condition of no external load 1 h 42 h 41 2 h 12 h 22 h 32 h 11 h 21 h 31 where h 11 h 21 h 31 h 41 is the thickness of muddy clay sandy silt silty clay and confined aquifer before dewatering respectively h 12 h 22 h 32 h 42 is the thickness of muddy clay sandy silt silty clay and confined aquifer after dewatering respectively the overlying soil layers gradually expanded because of the inversed rebound and inversed deformation coordination positive or negative expansion may occur in different layers and positions in addition δ4i was the displacement at the top of the muddy clay layer near the subsidence cone center which represented land subsidence δ1i δ2i and δ3i were the respective displacements at the top of the confined aquifer silty clay sandy silt and muddy clay layers it was not consistent with the results calculated by the traditional layer wise summation method for land subsidence in traditional calculation all the displacements were positive and the land subsidence δ4 was calculated by the sum of δ1i δ2i δ3i and δ4i the calculated subsidence was larger than the observation in further research the traditional layer wise summation method should be revised considering the inverse rebound and inverse deformation coordination during foundation pit dewatering the water level in the confined aquifer rapidly recovered when pumping was stopped the top of the confined aquifer almost rebounded to the initial elevation when the water level was lowered again the dewatered confined aquifer subsided again in the course partial expansion phenomenon became less obvious in stratified subsidence fig 9 after the expansion in the first cycle drawdown the subsidence of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard tended to coordinate the partial expansion decreased in the course of subsiding and rebounding the partial expansion phenomenon was believed to be generalized to the mama system of other hydrologic fields and geographical areas such as the deformation caused by groundwater pumping for water supply water inrush during tunnel excavation gas extraction from layers etc although great efforts have been contributed to the model tests the experiments may still be imperfect in box scale analogous materials and some other operation details however it is necessary and significant for understanding the phenomenon observed in site at this stage more efforts and investments should be poured into the study of partial expansion phenomenon the work can be performed in many aspects if possible including in site monitoring large scale laboratory experiments mathematical modeling mechanism analysis theory analysis etc especially in the following aspects 1 more accurate and detailed in site monitoring should be performed in the area with different combination of aquitards and aquifers 2 large scale model tests should be performed to investigate the 3d expansion phenomenon 3 different combination of aquitards and aquifers should be systematically and comprehensively considered in model tests 4 quantitative researches are significant to make more profound recognition in next study 5 subsidence predication methods considering the partial expansion should be developed to improve the predication accuracy of the deformation induced by dewatering the partial expansion phenomenon was observed in a subway foundation pit close to an operating high rise bridge using complicated monitoring measures under the demand of environment protection the phenomenon may have been or be observed by many construction units but was ignored or doubted as a mistake as we do before seldom would like to invest to verify the phenomenon in a project when it was doubted as an error the complicated monitoring measures in fields that adopted in the foundation pit of yishan road station are not necessary monitoring items for lots of normal foundation pit even if the monitoring has been performed it is difficult to collect the monitoring data because the monitoring works were performed by different corporations it is difficult to reproduce the phenomenon in field the contribution of the current study is that the partial expansion phenomenon is reappeared in a physical model and proved that the phenomenon is objective not error or mistake 5 numerical verification and correction 5 1 verification numerical model the results of physical model test reflected the complex coupled hydro mechanical process a coupled hydro mechanical mathematical model was established to verify the model test results the response equation for the pore fluid is 3 q i i q v ζ t 1 m p t n s s t 1 s ζ t α ε t where q i i is the specific discharge vector q v is the volumetric fluid source intensity in 1

ij is the kronecker delta h is the functional form of the constitutive law ξ ij is the strain rate κ is a history parameter the relation between strain rate and velocity gradient is 5 ξ ij 1 2 v i j v j i the model box was simulated using boundary conditions the left and right sides of the layers were fixed only in x directions impermeable in movable plate during settlement stage and then changed as permeable boundary during drainage stage the front and back sides of the soil layers were fixed only in y directions and impermeable in both settlement and drainage stage the upper side was free permeable in both settlement and drainage stage the bottom was the moveable displacement boundary to simulate the settlement in y directions and permeable in both settlement and drainage stage the finite difference formulation was designed to simulate the complex experimental processes according to the model tests the overlying layer of the physical model was divided into five sub layers and all dimensions were in agreement with the physical model the coupled hydro mechanical numerical model is shown in fig 14 the elasto plastic mohr coulomb mc constitutive model was used to model the different soil layers the geotechnical and seepage parameters of different soil layers are summarized in tables 6 and 7 the soil layers were discretized into 11 000 cells 5 2 numerical verification results the simulated subsidence of overlying aquitards caused by bottom settlement with different velocities is shown in fig 15 the simulation results were in good agreement with physical model test fig 6 the partial expansion phenomenon existed without considering boundary effect in all models the final subsidence of different positions with different velocities is shown in fig 16 there were differences in the positions close to the movable endpoint between the simulation and experiments the boundary effect of the model box was obvious close to the movable endpoint although the vaseline was smeared at the sides of the model box which influenced the subsidence during model tests actually the boundary effect did exist between soil layers and diaphragm wall close to foundation pit during dewatering in field whether the boundary effects contribute to the expansion phenomenon should be further discussed with model experiment and numerical simulation in the future the subsidence of soil layers caused by drainage after bottom settlement is shown in fig 17 the subsidence nearest to the movable endpoint has obvious difference between physical test and simulation it shows that compression occurred at all of the soil layers in numerical simulation and agreed with the results of physical test the maximum principal stress of all soil layers under different settlement velocities was tensile fig 18 the tensile stress increased with increasing depth and settlement in addition according to fig 19 which presents the displacement magnitude of soil layers on different settlement velocities under the tensile stress extrusion deformation to the movable endpoint occurred in the upper soil layers the lower layers showed expansion deformation away from the movable endpoint the tensile stress played an important role in the partial expansion of soil layers during dewatering 6 conclusions 1 the partial expansion phenomenon in stratified subsidence during foundation pit dewatering was reproduced using model test the partial expansion occurred in stratified subsidence under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions 2 the subsidence caused by the inversed coordination deformation increased with the increasing depth of soil layers both the subsidence caused by coordination deformation and consolidation decreased with increasing horizontal distance to the subsidence cone center 3 the partial expansion of different layers increased with increasing depth and settlement velocity the second stratified subsidence was less obvious than the first movable plate settlement 4 the expansion phenomenon occurred mainly in coordination deformation and it was more obvious in the location close to the movable plate 5 the partial expansion was verified using fdm numerical simulation method compared with numerical simulation results the boundary effect of the physical tests was still obvious in the observation point close to the box wall and movable endpoint 6 in the numerical simulations the tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon 7 the partial expansion of overlying soil layers was induced by the inversed rebound and inversed coordination deformation the compression of overlying soil layers was induced by the consolidation because of drainage partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression 8 after the expansion in the first cycle drawdown the subsidence of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard tended to coordination the partial expansion decreased in the course of multi subsiding and rebounding courses 9 considering the existence of the partial expansion of the overlying soil layers the traditional layer wise summation method should be revised in the calculation of land subsidence further efforts should be made to improve the computational method for stratified subsidence 10 more in site monitoring data are needed to understand the mechanism of the partial expansion phenomenon the influence of different combination of soil layers the accurate mathematical models the influence of diaphragm wall and pumping wells should be further studied 11 the partial expansion was observed in foundation pit dewatering of soft soil distribution area with interbedded soft soil aquitard and sand aquifer the phenomenon was believed to be generalized to the mama system of other hydrologic fields and geographical areas such as the deformation caused by groundwater pumping for water supply water inrush during tunnel excavation gas extraction from layers etc 12 owing to the limitation of model scale and complexity of soil layers the current research only qualitatively studied the partial expansion phenomenon caused by dewatering in a mama system quantitative researches are significant to make more profound recognition in future study acknowledgments

7505,partial expansion was observed in stratified subsidence during foundation pit dewatering however the phenomenon was suspected to be an error because the compression of layers is known to occur when subsidence occurs a slice of the subsidence cone induced by drawdown was selected as the prototype model tests were performed to investigate the phenomenon the underlying confined aquifer was generated as a movable rigid plate with a hinge at one end the overlying layers were simulated with remolded materials collected from a construction site model tests performed under the conceptual model indicated that partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions during foundation pit dewatering rapid drawdown resulted in rapid subsidence in the dewatered confined aquifer the rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top was the bottom deformation boundary of the overlying layers non coordination deformation was observed at the top and bottom of the subsiding overlying layers the subsidence of overlying layers was larger at the bottom than at the top the layers expanded and became thicker the phenomenon was verified using numerical simulation method based on finite difference method compared with numerical simulation results the boundary effect of the physical tests was obvious in the observation point close to the movable endpoint the tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon the partial expansion of overlying soil layers was defined as inversed rebound the inversed rebound was induced by inversed coordination deformation compression was induced by the consolidation in the overlying soil layers because of drainage partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression considering the inversed rebound traditional layer wise summation method for calculating subsidence should be revised and improved keywords foundation pit dewatering partial expansion model test coordinated subsidence consolidation subsidence numerical verification 1 introduction groundwater extraction plays a direct role in land subsidence by causing the compaction of susceptible aquifer systems galloway and burbey 2011 when ground water in underlying confined aquifers endangered excavation the water level was lowered to ensure safety subsidence induced by groundwater withdrawal has been recognized and cumulatively evaluated in a large number of situations modoni et al 2013 land subsidence is a serious environmental geological problem in china ye et al 2016a b various studies have been carried out to predict the subsidence induced by lowering water levels such as statistical method holzer

subsidence in shanghai because of groundwater pumping wang et al 2012 suggested three ways to control seepage and discussed the combined effects of pumping curtain and recharging wells yoo et al 2012 presented a case where excessive ground settlement occurred around a conventional tunnel the excessive ground settlement was caused by tunneling induced groundwater drawdown a similar case of land subsidence was monitored and analyzed by lopez fernandez et al 2013 in a tunnel excavation wang et al 2013a b investigated the influences of dewatering on deep excavation and surrounding deformation loaiciga 2013 proposed a new equation to calculate vertical consolidation settlement in aquifers caused by pumping an equation that is viewed as a modification of traditional 1d consolidation theory however the subsidence predicted using consolidation theory was larger than the observed one for the multi aquifer and multi aquitard mama system in china the predicted subsidence has to be revised through an empirical coefficient to match the observation field and laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the deformation law of layers burbey 1999 2001 2003 2006 2008 burbey et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013a b c d li et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 minderhoud et al 2015 however the reason for the inaccurate prediction was not discussed partial expansion phenomenon was observed in a subway foundation pit close to an operating high rise bridge by complicated monitoring measures under the demand of environment protection during foundation pit dewatering wang et al 2009 2013a b c d zhu et al 2015 in shanghai china this phenomenon may be one of the potential reasons for the inaccurate subsidence prediction when the partial expansion phenomenon was first observed it was suspected to be a monitoring error of the observation method using multipoint extensometers in soft soil reproducing the phenomenon in layered soil in the laboratory and observing the deformation was a key step to check its existence model tests were performed in this study to check the existence and understand the mechanism of partial expansion phenomenon in a mama system during foundation pit dewatering numerical methods were introduced to reproduce the partial expansion and correct the results of model tests the existence of partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation condition was confirmed the mechanism of the phenomenon was explained by the model tests and numerical simulations which can be used as references to revise and improve subsidence calculation method for foundation pit dewatering 2 background shanghai is located in front of the yangtze river delta plain besides sporadic residual volcanic rocks exposed in the southwest all the bedrocks are covered with quaternary strata the layers of shanghai are composed of typical mama system according to generation time genetic types and main engineering geological features the quaternary strata in shanghai area were divided into 16 engineering geological strata shanghai geological environmental atlas 2002 seven major engineering geological layers are shown in table 1 the aquifer system underlying shanghai is not a complete independent groundwater system but rather a part of the water systems of the yangtze delta the first sand layer corresponds to the phreatic aquifer in the hydrogeological section of the region and the second to the sixth sand layers correspond to the first to fifth confined aquifers apart from the sixth sandy soil distributed in the northern region the remaining sand layers in the region have relatively stable distribution in some sand layers clay lenses exist semipermeable aquifers composed of clay and silty clay are distributed between the sand layers for normal foundation pit dewatering only micro confined the first confined and second confined aquifers were considered according to engineering geological and hydrogeological conditions as well as the combinations of formation the shanghai area was divided into four landform partitions lake plains coastal plains river sand and tidal flat fig 1 coastal plain partition was selected as the background of the model test most of the confined aquifers of dewatering engineering in shanghai are concentrated in the first confined aquifer the overlying strata include the topsoil first sand first hard soil first soft soil second soft soil and second hard soil layers according to the physical and mechanical properties of the overlying combined strata the overlying strata were summarized into muddy clay sandy silt and silty clay layers the confined aquifer was generalized as silty sand layer physical property indexes of the summarized layers are shown in table 2 the foundation pit of yishan road station subway line 9 is a typical foundation pit in shanghai the geological and hydrological conditions of the pit can represent a type of geological partition and the pits in the city center of shanghai the description of layers is shown in fig 2 b due to the high request of environment protection lots of monitoring and field experiments were performed here obtaining enough monitoring data the pit was selected as the case for investigating the partial expansion phenomenon partial expansion phenomenon in the subsidence was observed in the foundation pit dewatering of the pit wang et al 2009 2013a b c d zhu et al 2015 the subsidence velocity of the bottom was larger than the top in an aquitard there was a different subsidence acceleration for the bottom and top of an aquitard although the bottom and top of the aquitard were all subsided the velocity of bottom was faster than that of top then the thickness of the aquitard was increasing and expansion occurred fig 2 3 material and methods 3 1 conceptual model for a 3d subsidence cone induced by foundation pit dewatering a slice was selected to represent the subsidence in that direction fig 3 during dewatering the effective stress increased and the aquifer was compressed when the water pressure decreased because of the lowering water level when dewatering was stopped the water pressure increased and recovered to the initial level the effective stress decreased and the layer rebounded in foundation pit dewatering the subsidence mechanism of granular material in the confined aquifer was clear and could be predicted accurately therefore the deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer was simulated with a displacement boundary however the deformation course of the aquitard overlying the dewatered confined aquifer was unclear the aquitards adjacent to the dewatered confined aquifer the lowering water level in the confined aquifer resulted in very large hydraulic gradient in the aquitards nearby the boundary to the confined aquifer seepage and weak flow occurred under the large hydraulic gradient consolidation deformation occurred during the course meanwhile the overlying aquitards adjacent to the dewatered confined aquifer deformed with the subsiding roof of the underlying confined aquifer the drawdown in the dewatered confined aquifer developed rapidly the rapidly developing drawdown resulted in rapidly developing subsidence the rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top act as bottom deformation boundary for the overlying layers the adjacent overlying layers deformed to coordinate with the underlying deformation boundary if the displacement of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard were equal the subsidence of ground surface equaled to the deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer and adjacent overlying aquitards if the deformations of the top and bottom of the adjacent overlying layers were different then compression or expansion occurred corresponding to positive and negative differences the conceptual model of subsidence induced by foundation pit dewatering is shown in fig 3 during dewatering at field subsidence does take place due to effective stress and pore pressure changes the subsidence includes two parts one is the subsidence in dewatered confined aquifer the other is the deformation of overlying aquitard the subsidence in aquifer occurs quickly and the one in aquitard occurs slowly it is difficult and complex to consider the two subsidence in a model at the same time for the deformation in sand can be predicted more precisely the deformation is considered as a moveable plate controlled manually with jacks i e a deformation boundary the overlying aquitards were simulated using remold soils the aquitard and its subsidence including movement with underlying boundary and self consolidation are the focus of the current study the above description is also the conceptual model for the test two kinds of layers are used in the experiment the deformation of underlying aquifer forms a subsidence cone corresponding to a drawdown cone one slice of the cone is selected for it belongs to a symmetrical shape the linear boundary between two points is used to simulate the upper deformation in underlying aquifer sand meanwhile the linear boundary provides the deformation boundary for overlying clay for foundation pit dewatering the pumping of confined aquifer can decrease the water level quickly the time reaching stable state is several days although the consolidation in overlying aquitard occurred at this time the minor deformation is neglected in conceptual model so we separate the dewatering and consolidation of the underlying aquifer the movement of the hinged plate from the changing of the water levels on the ends of the sand tank the underlying deformed aquifer is summarized as a moveable boundary fig 3 the underlying confined aquifer was simulated with a deformation boundary the curve of a slice of subsidence cone of dewatered confined aquifer was generated as a line the subsidence cone of the underlying confined aquifer was simulated using the displacement of a rigid steel plate the overlying layers were simulated with similitude material and the bottom boundary of the similitude material was the deformation boundary of the underlying confined aquifer the displacement of the boundary simulated the subsidence of the underlying confined layer induced by dewatering the lowering water pressure simulated the lowering water level seepage boundary of the underlying confined aquifer 3 2 analogous material according to the theory and dimensional analysis requirements can be deduced from force equilibrium equations geometry hooke s law and boundary conditions fumagalli 1973 the process of similarity analysis is shown in appendix 1 to simplify the similitude material and avoid complicated similitude materials remolded soil was adopted to simulate the prototype soil under natural conditions the compressive modulus of the overlying soil depended on stress level the 1 10th scale of compressive modulus was adopted according to the comparison between the compressive modulus of the remolded soil under model test condition and prototype soil in the field under the original stress conditions table 3 the geometric scale was determined according to the size of the prototype and the possible model box the influence of stress on permeability was ignored and the 1 1st scale of hydraulic conductivity was adopted meanwhile the 1 10th scale of time was adopted according to the above principles the geometry scale is c l 40 and the gravity scale is c r 1 table 4 3 3 model tests operation in the model test a displacement boundary was set to simulate the deformation of the underlying confined aquifer dewatered in a short duration at the same time water pressure head was set between the overlying layers and underlying confined aquifer to simulate the seepage deformation of the overlying layers the model box was designed as a long strip shaped box the steel plate rotating around a hinge was used to simulate the roof deformation of the underlying dewatered confined aquifer the movement of the plate simulated the deformation of the roof of the confined aquifer the displacement of the different points of the plate simulated the subsidence cone corresponding to drawdown cone controlling the water level of the water tank on both sides of the model box simulated the seepage of the overlying soil layers one fixed end of the plate was used to simulate the progressive deformation of the confined aquifer the other end controlled by the jack simulated the deformation of the top surface of the confined aquifer with the change of drawdown cone the device used for the physical model tests is shown in fig 4 remolded soil was used to simulate the summarized soil layer in this model test the remolded soil materials were all collected from the construction site then the remolded soil was prepared by drying crushing and reshaping the physical mechanical parameters of the remolded soil are shown in table 5 to minimize side friction the wall of the model was smeared with vaseline the bottom of the soil layers was provided with a sand layer to facilitate drainage the procedures for preparing the soil layer were as follows 1 the movable plate was positioned at the initial position i e horizontal position 2 standard sand was used to construct the bottom sand layer 100 mm in thickness 3 layer 3 200 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded silt clay 4 layer 2 200 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded sandy silt 5 layer 1 500 mm in thickness was constructed using the remolded muddy clay 6 topsoil layer 100 mm in thickness was constructed using hard clay all the soil layers were evenly filled and compacted every 50 mm in the model box to measure the stratified subsidence 13 benchmark poles 13 displacement transducers 6 soil pressure cells and 6 pore pressure gauges were installed fig 4 b the displacement transducer wy0 was set at the bottom of the movable endpoint to monitor the subsidence the displacement transducers wy11 wy21 wy31 and wy41 were placed on the top of layer 1 and the distance to the wall of the movable endpoint were 200 800 1400 and 2000 mm respectively in the same way wy12 wy22 wy32 and wy42 were installed on the top of layer 2 and wy13 wy23 wy33 and wy43 were installed on the top of layer 3 to facilitate data analysis the virtual measurement points wy14 wy24 wy34 and wy44 were set and their values were equal to 230 250wy0 170 250wy0 110 250wy0 and 50 250wy0 the soil pressure cells ty11 piezometers ky11 and ty21 ky12 were set at the middle of layer 1 and their distance to the movable endpoint was 500 and 1100 mm in the same way ty12 and ty22 were set at the middle of layer 2 and ty13 ky12 and ty23 ky22 were located on top of layer 3 the detailed test procedures were as follows 1 self weight consolidation and saturation when all the monitoring instruments were installed the water was injected into both sides of the water tank to reach the top of layer 1 for self weight consolidation and hydraulic balance 2 movable plate settlement when all of the monitoring data of soil layers were stable after the water injection about 30 h the jack was controlled to lower the movable bottom plate to simulate the subsidence cone caused by dewatering in the top of the underlying confined aquifer under undrained condition the water level was maintained at the top of layer 1 three working scenarios were performed lower 15 mm in an hour lower 15 mm in half an hour and lower 20 mm instantaneously 3 lowering water level keeping the state of the jack the water level on both sides of the water tank was lowered two times without interval the water level was lowered 500 mm each time in about five minutes to simulate the drawdown under drainage condition 4 movable plate settlement for the second time slowly raised the movable plate to the initial position about one hour and slowly recovered the water level to the initial position when all the monitoring data of the soil layers were stable again after several days the jack was controlled to once again sink the movable bottom plate twice sink 15 mm for 1 5 h and sink 20 mm instantaneously 4 results and discussions the self consolidation and hydraulic balance process lasted 30 h until the subsidence reached stable state fig 5 layer 1 subsided 3 8 4 5 mm layer 2 subsided 0 5 1 0 mm slight expansion occurred in layer 3 after compression because of hydraulic balance and then reached stable state the subsidence of the top of each overlying layer caused by movable plate settlement under different settlement velocities is shown in fig 6 the vertical displacement of the top of layer 3 w13 w23 w33 w43 was larger than that of layer 2 w12 w22 w32 w42 the vertical displacement of the top of layer 2 w13 w23 w33 w43 was larger than that of layer 1 w11 w21 w31 w41 the subsidence of layer 3 was the largest the medium was layer 2 and the least was layer 1 the thickness of layers 1 2 was increasing and expansion occurred fig 6 a the phenomenon was quite similar to the monitoring expansion in field fig 2 the subsidence of the top of each layer generally decreased with the increasing horizontal distance to the movable endpoint fig 7 however the subsidence of the points with a horizontal distance of 200 mm to movable endpoint was less than the points with a horizontal distance of 800 mm which may be influence by the boundary effect of box wall fig 7 the subsidence and subsidence velocity of the monitoring points with a horizontal distance of 800 mm to the movable endpoint was the largest the expansion of the overlying layers occurred because of unloading relaxation combining with the moveable boundary effect the stratified subsidence of different layers is shown in fig 8 the subsidence of the top of each layer increased with increasing depth and settlement velocity the points w11 w14 were the most obvious the subsidence of the top of the overlying layers caused by the movable plate settlement for the second time is shown in fig 9 the partial expansion phenomena were less obvious than the first time the points wy11 wy13 were the most obvious which were the nearest to the movable endpoint the subsidence of the top of each layer increased with increasing depth which was consistent with the first movable plate settlement after the settlement of the moveable plate water level in the bottom boundary of overlying layer was lowered to simulate the drainage corresponding to the dewatering of underlying confined aquifer the subsidence increment of the top of each layer singly caused by the lowering water level is shown in fig 10 the partial expansion phenomenon became complex because of the lowering water level the subsidence of w13 exceeded that of w12 indicating that the subsidence increment induced by the consolidation exceeded the expansion increment induced by non coordination deformation however the subsidence of w12 was still less than that of w11 and that the subsidence increment induced by the consolidation was less than the expansion increment induced by non coordination deformation the expansion of the layer between wy11 and wy12 was continued when the expansion of the layer between w12 and w13 was decreased the whole layers showed expansion because that the compression induced by consolidation was less than the expansion induced by deformation coordination based on the data in fig 6 the change of the thickness of each layer caused by the movable plate settlement in three velocities is shown in fig 11 the subsidence of the bottom was larger than that of the top in the overlying aquitars and the layer was expanding and became thicker all overlying soil layers showed expansion the closer to the movable endpoint the larger of the expansion with the increasing depth the partial expansion became more obvious all soil layers presented a compression phenomenon during the drainage fig 12 the compression of layer 3 which was the nearest to the lowering water level boundary was the most obvious the compression increased with the increasing depth of soil layer the compression decreased with increasing horizontal distance to movable endpoint the weight of the overlying layer was generally exerted on the top of underlying layers and then passed down on the basis of the principle of effective stress pore water pressure in confined aquifer and overlying layers decreased because of dewatering and effective stress increased the compression of layers was caused by consolidation subsidence and compression deformation the consolidation subsidence of the underlying confined aquifer formed a deformation boundary for overlying layers the rapid developing deformation boundary caused downwards rebound in the overlying soil layers the phenomenon was defined as inversed rebound to distinguish it from the normally defined upwards rebound caused by excavation the explanation of the phenomenon is shown in fig 13 the closer to the confined aquifer the more obvious the inversed rebound owing to the consolidation subsidence of the underlying confined aquifer the deformation coordination occurred from the bottom to the top in the overlying layers the overlying layers adjacent to the confined aquifer expanded the course was defined as the inversed deformation coordination the settlement velocity of the movable plate obviously influenced the expansive deformation of the overlying layers in a short term fig 11 the conceptual model of the inverse rebound and inverse deformation coordination is shown in fig 13 the consolidation occurred first in the confined aquifer owing to dewatering under the condition of no external load 1 h 42 h 41 2 h 12 h 22 h 32 h 11 h 21 h 31 where h 11 h 21 h 31 h 41 is the thickness of muddy clay sandy silt silty clay and confined aquifer before dewatering respectively h 12 h 22 h 32 h 42 is the thickness of muddy clay sandy silt silty clay and confined aquifer after dewatering respectively the overlying soil layers gradually expanded because of the inversed rebound and inversed deformation coordination positive or negative expansion may occur in different layers and positions in addition δ4i was the displacement at the top of the muddy clay layer near the subsidence cone center which represented land subsidence δ1i δ2i and δ3i were the respective displacements at the top of the confined aquifer silty clay sandy silt and muddy clay layers it was not consistent with the results calculated by the traditional layer wise summation method for land subsidence in traditional calculation all the displacements were positive and the land subsidence δ4 was calculated by the sum of δ1i δ2i δ3i and δ4i the calculated subsidence was larger than the observation in further research the traditional layer wise summation method should be revised considering the inverse rebound and inverse deformation coordination during foundation pit dewatering the water level in the confined aquifer rapidly recovered when pumping was stopped the top of the confined aquifer almost rebounded to the initial elevation when the water level was lowered again the dewatered confined aquifer subsided again in the course partial expansion phenomenon became less obvious in stratified subsidence fig 9 after the expansion in the first cycle drawdown the subsidence of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard tended to coordinate the partial expansion decreased in the course of subsiding and rebounding the partial expansion phenomenon was believed to be generalized to the mama system of other hydrologic fields and geographical areas such as the deformation caused by groundwater pumping for water supply water inrush during tunnel excavation gas extraction from layers etc although great efforts have been contributed to the model tests the experiments may still be imperfect in box scale analogous materials and some other operation details however it is necessary and significant for understanding the phenomenon observed in site at this stage more efforts and investments should be poured into the study of partial expansion phenomenon the work can be performed in many aspects if possible including in site monitoring large scale laboratory experiments mathematical modeling mechanism analysis theory analysis etc especially in the following aspects 1 more accurate and detailed in site monitoring should be performed in the area with different combination of aquitards and aquifers 2 large scale model tests should be performed to investigate the 3d expansion phenomenon 3 different combination of aquitards and aquifers should be systematically and comprehensively considered in model tests 4 quantitative researches are significant to make more profound recognition in next study 5 subsidence predication methods considering the partial expansion should be developed to improve the predication accuracy of the deformation induced by dewatering the partial expansion phenomenon was observed in a subway foundation pit close to an operating high rise bridge using complicated monitoring measures under the demand of environment protection the phenomenon may have been or be observed by many construction units but was ignored or doubted as a mistake as we do before seldom would like to invest to verify the phenomenon in a project when it was doubted as an error the complicated monitoring measures in fields that adopted in the foundation pit of yishan road station are not necessary monitoring items for lots of normal foundation pit even if the monitoring has been performed it is difficult to collect the monitoring data because the monitoring works were performed by different corporations it is difficult to reproduce the phenomenon in field the contribution of the current study is that the partial expansion phenomenon is reappeared in a physical model and proved that the phenomenon is objective not error or mistake 5 numerical verification and correction 5 1 verification numerical model the results of physical model test reflected the complex coupled hydro mechanical process a coupled hydro mechanical mathematical model was established to verify the model test results the response equation for the pore fluid is 3 q i i q v ζ t 1 m p t n s s t 1 s ζ t α ε t where q i i is the specific discharge vector q v is the volumetric fluid source intensity in 1 sec m is biot modulus n m2 p is the pore pressure n is the porosity s is the saturation ζ is the variation of fluid volume per unit volume of porous material α is biot coefficient ɛ is the mechanical

ij is the kronecker delta h is the functional form of the constitutive law ξ ij is the strain rate κ is a history parameter the relation between strain rate and velocity gradient is 5 ξ ij 1 2 v i j v j i the model box was simulated using boundary conditions the left and right sides of the layers were fixed only in x directions impermeable in movable plate during settlement stage and then changed as permeable boundary during drainage stage the front and back sides of the soil layers were fixed only in y directions and impermeable in both settlement and drainage stage the upper side was free permeable in both settlement and drainage stage the bottom was the moveable displacement boundary to simulate the settlement in y directions and permeable in both settlement and drainage stage the finite difference formulation was designed to simulate the complex experimental processes according to the model tests the overlying layer of the physical model was divided into five sub layers and all dimensions were in agreement with the physical model the coupled hydro mechanical numerical model is shown in fig 14 the elasto plastic mohr coulomb mc constitutive model was used to model the different soil layers the geotechnical and seepage parameters of different soil layers are summarized in tables 6 and 7 the soil layers were discretized into 11 000 cells 5 2 numerical verification results the simulated subsidence of overlying aquitards caused by bottom settlement with different velocities is shown in fig 15 the simulation results were in good agreement with physical model test fig 6 the partial expansion phenomenon existed without considering boundary effect in all models the final subsidence of different positions with different velocities is shown in fig 16 there were differences in the positions close to the movable endpoint between the simulation and experiments the boundary effect of the model box was obvious close to the movable endpoint although the vaseline was smeared at the sides of the model box which influenced the subsidence during model tests actually the boundary effect did exist between soil layers and diaphragm wall close to foundation pit during dewatering in field whether the boundary effects contribute to the expansion phenomenon should be further discussed with model experiment and numerical simulation in the future the subsidence of soil layers caused by drainage after bottom settlement is shown in fig 17 the subsidence nearest to the movable endpoint has obvious difference between physical test and simulation it shows that compression occurred at all of the soil layers in numerical simulation and agreed with the results of physical test the maximum principal stress of all soil layers under different settlement velocities was tensile fig 18 the tensile stress increased with increasing depth and settlement in addition according to fig 19 which presents the displacement magnitude of soil layers on different settlement velocities under the tensile stress extrusion deformation to the movable endpoint occurred in the upper soil layers the lower layers showed expansion deformation away from the movable endpoint the tensile stress played an important role in the partial expansion of soil layers during dewatering 6 conclusions 1 the partial expansion phenomenon in stratified subsidence during foundation pit dewatering was reproduced using model test the partial expansion occurred in stratified subsidence under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions 2 the subsidence caused by the inversed coordination deformation increased with the increasing depth of soil layers both the subsidence caused by coordination deformation and consolidation decreased with increasing horizontal distance to the subsidence cone center 3 the partial expansion of different layers increased with increasing depth and settlement velocity the second stratified subsidence was less obvious than the first movable plate settlement 4 the expansion phenomenon occurred mainly in coordination deformation and it was more obvious in the location close to the movable plate 5 the partial expansion was verified using fdm numerical simulation method compared with numerical simulation results the boundary effect of the physical tests was still obvious in the observation point close to the box wall and movable endpoint 6 in the numerical simulations the tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon 7 the partial expansion of overlying soil layers was induced by the inversed rebound and inversed coordination deformation the compression of overlying soil layers was induced by the consolidation because of drainage partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression 8 after the expansion in the first cycle drawdown the subsidence of the top and bottom of the overlying aquitard tended to coordination the partial expansion decreased in the course of multi subsiding and rebounding courses 9 considering the existence of the partial expansion of the overlying soil layers the traditional layer wise summation method should be revised in the calculation of land subsidence further efforts should be made to improve the computational method for stratified subsidence 10 more in site monitoring data are needed to understand the mechanism of the partial expansion phenomenon the influence of different combination of soil layers the accurate mathematical models the influence of diaphragm wall and pumping wells should be further studied 11 the partial expansion was observed in foundation pit dewatering of soft soil distribution area with interbedded soft soil aquitard and sand aquifer the phenomenon was believed to be generalized to the mama system of other hydrologic fields and geographical areas such as the deformation caused by groundwater pumping for water supply water inrush during tunnel excavation gas extraction from layers etc 12 owing to the limitation of model scale and complexity of soil layers the current research only qualitatively studied the partial expansion phenomenon caused by dewatering in a mama system quantitative researches are significant to make more profound recognition in future study acknowledgments

7506,we develop a new analytical infiltration model to determine water flow dynamics around layer interfaces during infiltration process in layered soils the model mainly involves the analytical solutions to quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the interfaces active water content profile behind the wetting front is developed based on the solution of steady state flow to dynamically update active parameters in sharp wetting front infiltration equations and to predict unsaturated flow in coarse layers before the front reaches an impeding fine layer the effect of water backfill to saturate the coarse layers after the wetting front encounters the impeding fine layer is analytically expressed based on the active water content profiles comparison to the numerical solutions of the richards equation shows that the new model can well capture water dynamics in relation to the arrangement of soil layers the steady state active water content profile can be used to predict the saturation state of all layers when the wetting front first passes through these layers during the unsteady infiltration process water backfill effect may occur when the unsaturated wetting front encounters a fine layer underlying a coarse layer sensitivity analysis shows that saturated hydraulic conductivity is the parameter dictating the occurrence of unsaturated flow and water backfill and can be used to represent the coarseness of soil layers water backfill effect occurs in coarse layers between upper and lower fine layers when the lower layer is not significantly coarser than the upper layer keywords unsaturated flow water backfill layered soils active water content profile infiltration 1 introduction infiltration is an important component of land surface and subsurface hydrological processes infiltration process can be described using the most commonly used richards equation re richards 1931 which may be difficult to solve with highly non linear soil property functions ogden et al 2017 low order finite difference and finite element methods are often employed to solve re a number of studies focused on the development of robust numerical solution of re to improve conservation stability and efficiency celia et al 1990 du et al 2001 miller et al 1998 list and radu 2016 in general numerically solving re is not guaranteed to converge and mass balance errors may occur due to the interaction of diffusion and advection ogden et al 2015 pan and wierenga 1995 analytical solution of re is difficult except under some special forms of soil retention curves boundary and initial conditions and some restrictive assumptions celia et al 1990 de luca and cepeda 2016 hayek 2016 field soil profiles are commonly heterogeneous rather than uniform in vertical direction typically in a layered formation with different hydraulic properties in individual layers due to natural evolutions or anthropogenic activities assouline 2013 wang et al 2014 water movement is strongly affected by the layering in soil profile such as capillary and hydraulic barriers li et al 2014 generally fine layer with smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity is the main layer that controls infiltration process regardless of its position in layered soils philip 1957 kale and sahoo 2011 however it is not easy to quantitatively describe the infiltration process within layered soils for example the thickness of upper soil layer is an important factor in infiltration process leconte and brissette 2001 and contrasting hydraulic properties between layers dominate infiltration yang et al 2006 when the wetting front reaches layer interface for a two layer soil profile with a coarse layer above a fine soil layer a step change of infiltration rate may occur latifi et al 1994 miller and gardner 1962 for a two layer formation with fine soil on top infiltration rate when the front reaches the interface may be reduced due to the smaller sorptivity of lower coarse soil and the coarse layer will not be saturated and remains at a stable moisture content for a long time chu and mariño 2005 latifi et al 1994 takagi 1960 moreover a special case of layered soil is crust soil profile with significant fine soil layer overlying coarse layer in which unsaturated flow was observed in the laboratory experiments by vandervaere et al 1997 1998 yang et al 2004 found that the water pressure head of top finer soil near the interface may not increase with further evolution of infiltration however some research results showed that the wetting front may pause temporarily at the interface to wait for the capillary barrier breakthrough and infiltration rate then reduces to a constant value al maktoumi et al 2015 hillel and baker 1988 wang et al 1999 the air content in the lower coarser layer may increase due to the relatively small amount available water in the interface for the more permeable coarser layer mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 also the wetting front may become unstable and narrow wetting columns i e finger flow may occur carrillo et al 2000 diment and watson 1983 hill and parlange 1972 wang et al 2014 richards equation can be used to numerically solve infiltration problems in layered soils however careful evaluation of hydraulic parameters and proper average method around layer interfaces are required brunone et al 2003 romano et al 1998 several studies have extended green ampt ga model green and ampt 1911 to simulate infiltration into layered soils childs and bybordi 1969 used the ga model to describe the infiltration in layered soils with decreasing hydraulic conductivity from the surface moore 1981 and ahuja 1983 extended the ga model to examine the effects of stable crusted soils on infiltration damodhara rao et al 2006 studied the infiltration in three layer soils with seal tillage subsoil formation based on the ga model chu and mariño 2005 proposed a modified ga model for layered soils gal model that agreed well with the field experimental results for a four layer soil profile under unsteady rainfall the gal model has been employed and extended for studies of infiltration in layered soils cui and zhu 2017 deng and zhu 2016 ma et al 2011 however the gal model did not specifically take into account the complex water flow dynamics around the layer interfaces and was only validated for layered soil formations with decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth most extended ga models to layered soils typically adopted the traditional assumption of fully saturated water content profile behind the wetting front which may not be valid in some cases where fine soil layers overlie coarse layers to the best of our knowledge few studies on infiltration in layered soils focused on the water flow dynamics near the interfaces and the effects of layer formation especially in soil profile containing fine over coarse layers in this study we develop a new analytical infiltration model that specifically takes into account the flow dynamics around the layer interfaces in layered soils the model can be used to simulate evolution of infiltration in layered soils without numerical difficulties involved in numerically solving the non linear richards equation the model only involves the analytical solutions of quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the interfaces and has two new components 1 active water content profile behind the wetting front to predict unsaturated flow before the wetting front encounters a fine layer and 2 water backfill effect to saturate the coarser layer above the fine layer after the unsaturated front encounters the fine layer both components are analytically developed based on flow physics around the layer interfaces in the following sections we first describe the development of the analytical model and compare to the results of numerical solutions of the richards equation we then analyze and discuss the results for two illustrative examples to investigate the influence of layer arrangement on the infiltration dynamics finally we perform sensitivity analysis of hydraulic parameters to examine the important parameters that dictate the evolution of water dynamics in layered soils note that the hysteresis effect in soil water characteristic curve and possible unstable wetting front in the coarse layer under fine layer are not considered to facilitate the analysis of infiltration characteristics in layered soils using the analytical model 2 methods our proposed analytical model contains two core components as shown in fig 1 a steady state active water content profiles behind the wetting front which are used to update active parameters in sharp wetting front infiltration equations and to predict unsaturated flow and water backfill effect and b analytical expressions of water flow dynamics during the water backfill process 2 1 steady state active water content profile fig 2 schematically illustrates the layered soil formation under constant ponding condition in cases where a coarse layer underlies a fine layer the coarse layer may not be saturated and remains at a stable water content as discussed earlier since the top fine layer limits amount of water into the layered profile we propose a new and more accurate approach of active water content profile behind the wetting front the active water content profile behind the wetting front in any soil layers above layer j is solved using the steady state water content profile by imposing free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of layer j the idea is based on the hypothesis that water flow in layered soils approaches steady state profile during infiltration when the front first passes in any layers the steady state flow equations are easy to solve and the solutions provide water content profile and water pressure head profile that are used to update active parameters for the infiltration equations the updated active parameters represent the flow dynamics caused by contrasting hydraulic properties of layered soils the active water content profiles behind wetting front are proposed for the infiltration in layered soils for a layered soil profile with a total of n soil layers there are n active water content profiles which are sequentially determined based on the water content profile in steady state with the imposed free drainage condition at the bottom of layer j 1 j n we introduce layer stage j to represent that the free drainage condition is applied to the bottom of layer j the active water content profile with layer stage j denotes the predicted active water content profile above the bottom of layer j when wetting front first flows in layer j due to the contrasting hydraulic properties of soil layers the active water content profile evolves along with different layer stages based on continuity of the water pressure head at every layer interface above layer j the equations derived from the steady state richard equation with the same flux rate q st j throughout the soil profile above the bottom of layer j are rockhold et al 1997 warrick and jim yeh 1990 for topmost layer 1 1a z 1 z 0 h 0 j h 1 j 1 1

coupling the brent s method brent 1973 and the analytical algorithm for steady water flow in layered soils rockhold et al 1997 the root finding brent s method starts with an initial guess of the pressure head h j j and then adjusts it to make the difference zero between the solved pressure head at the surface h p and the given upper ponding head hp the analytical algorithm of rockhold et al 1997 is to solve water pressure heads at layer interfaces with given steady state flux and pressure head at the bottom of layered soil profile with the given guessed value of h j j the steady state flux q st j is calculated using eq 1c and then h p is solved by the analytical algorithm of rockhold et al 1997 fig 3 the active water content profile i e θ e c j l3l 3 in the layer c integer 1 c j for layer stage j is obtained by converting the h c 1 j l in the upper water pressure head of layer c to the water content using the water retention function θ h of layer c 2 θ e c j θ c h c 1 j for 1 c j the active parameters in the following sharp wetting front infiltration equations i e active hydraulic conductivity water content deficit and suction head of soil layers are calculated using the water content and pressure head values from the solved active water content profiles at different layer stages along with the evolution of active water content profiles at different layer stages the active parameters evolve as the wetting front advances to different layers this dynamic process of active parameters represents the influences of contrasting soil hydraulic properties of the soil layers and the formation of soil profile on the infiltration equations without numerically solving the highly non linear richards equation the active hydraulic conductivity k e c j lt 1 and active

layer n and q st n lt 1 the steady state infiltration rate at layer stage n 2 2 water backfill effect and analytical expression water backfill effect is a phenomenon that occurs in coarse layers in between two fine layers since the upper fine layer limits available water into coarse layers the coarse layers are unsaturated when the wetting front first passes through them after the unsaturated wetting front encounters the lower fine layer the impeding effect by the fine layer leads to water backfill effect that water simultaneously fills the water content deficit in the coarse layers and infiltrates into the lower fine layer suppose that water backfill effect occurs at the interface between layer k and k 1 and water will backfill upper two coarse layers above the interface layers k 1 and k fig 4 this water backfill effect around the interface between layer k and k 1 can be detected and predicted according to the results of steady state active water contents layers k 1 and k are not saturated when the wetting front is in layers k 1 and k i e layer stages k 1 and k in the superscripts in eqs 8a and 8b while the two layers are saturated when the wetting front is in layer k 1 i

bottom layer of entire soil profile the subsequent infiltration process is continually simulated by the proposed infiltration model while we have demonstrated the analytical model with water backfills in two layers the approach can be similarly applied to backfill any number of layers to solve all the above sharp front infiltration equations we use wetting front location as the calculation step since the layer formation is known 2 3 numerical solutions of richards equation and sensitivity analysis one dimensional richards equation is numerically solved by the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2013 the hydrus 1d model simulates infiltration process in layered soils with upper ponding and lower free drainage boundary conditions and given appropriate initial conditions for all layers the soil hydraulic properties are described by the modified van genuchten model with air entry value ha 2 cm van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 however any other hydraulic models can also be easily used results from the hydrus 1d are used to compare to those from the new analytical infiltration model the elementary effects ees method proposed by morris 1991 is used to perform global sensitivity analysis to investigate the most important parameter that dominates the evolution of water flow in layered soils the ees method is also called one at a time oat method which means that each model run varies only one input parameter and keeps all others fixed the elementary effect is an incremental ratio of outputs of interest to input parameter increment from each model run measure μ is the mean of absolute value of elementary effects of input parameters which is used to identify non influential input parameters and to rank them in the order of importance measure σ is the standard deviation of elementary effects which describes interactions with other parameters more details can be found in morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 and wang et al 2016 3 results and discussion while the developed analytical infiltration model is generic for layered soils we design several illustrative examples to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the model to capture unsaturated flow and water backfill during complex infiltration evolution our focus in the illustrative examples is to demonstrate how the unsaturated flow and backfill process are simulated by the analytical model as they are compared with the hydrus 1d results and the effect of layer arrangement 3 1 unsaturated flow and backfill process a four layer case is used to compare the results of the analytical model and the hydrus 1d results soil hydraulic parameters layer arrangement and initial condition are shown in table 1 a in this illustrative example the initial water content for layers are corresponding to the water pressure head of 500 cm the initial water content can be set as measured or estimated data for real world applications infiltration simulation is performed under hp 0 cm soil profile contains soil layers 3 2 1 and 4 from coarsest to finest according to their saturated conductivities the active water content and water pressure head profiles for four layer stages are shown in fig 5 which illustrate that layers 2 and 3 are not saturated when the wetting front first passes through these two layers since the topmost fine layer 1 limits the infiltration however the active water content profile with layer stage j 4 indicates the two layers are saturated when the wetting front is in layer 4 therefore water backfill effect occurs in layers 2 and 3 when the wetting front encounters the finest layer 4 the predicted unsaturated flow and water backfill effect from the analytical model are compared with the results from the hydrus 1d fig 6 during the backfill process infiltrated water partitions into two ways one filling the unsaturated parts of layers 3 and 2 the other flowing into layer 4 this can be seen from the water content profiles at 900 and 1050 min in fig 6a during this filling process infiltration rate is constant which is shown in fig 6c the constant water backfill infiltration rate is due to the fact that water pressure head profiles near the surface remain unchanged profiles at 900 and 1050 min in fig 6b although water pressure head at the backfill interface at 225 cm is continuously building up after the completion of backfilling in the unsaturated layers above the interface the wetting front keeps advancing to the bottom of layer and infiltration eventually achieves steady state i e the tail part of infiltration rate in fig 6c comparison of results from the new analytical infiltration hydrus 1d and gal models in fig 7 shows the gal model results differ significantly from the hydrus 1d results especially after water infiltrates into layer 2 the difference is not surprising because the gal model assumes saturated water content profile behind the wetting front which does not explicitly take into account the water dynamics around the interfaces this assumption leads to unrealistically high infiltration rate in layers 2 and 3 unlike the gal model the results from the new analytical model agree well with those from the hydrus 1d the two drops in infiltration rate when the water backfill ends and steady state flow starts are well predicted by the new analytical model with only slight difference in the timing of drop fig 7 this slight difference is mainly caused by the fact that the sharp front infiltration model predicts an infinite rate when the wetting front zf is zero hsu et al 2017 and the analytical model slightly overestimates the infiltration rate in the top layer 1 the slight overestimation is more noticeable with coarse soils since their hydraulic conductivities are notably larger than fine soils however the overestimation is not from problems related to the active water content profile and backfilling approach proposed in this study comparison of water content profiles in fig 8 shows that although the analytical model assumes a sharp wetting front water content profiles from the analytical model agree well with those from the hydrus 1d the slight discrepancies of the location of upper wetting front in layers 2 and 3 are caused by the slightly overestimated infiltration in layer 1 from the analytical model as discussed above the total time of backfill process from the analytical model is 245 min compared to 243 min from the hydrus 1d overall the new analytical model effectively and accurately describes the dynamic infiltration process in the layered soils 3 2 effect of layer arrangement to illustrate the influence of soil layer arrangement on infiltration we select three types of soils with contrasting hydraulic parameters and six arrangements of three layer formation labeled as cases 1 6 as shown in tables 1b and c results in figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that layer arrangement significantly affects infiltration process case 1 with coarsest soil on the topmost layer and coarse soil overlying fine soil has the shortest time for the wetting front to reach the bottom and the largest cumulative infiltration soils in the layers behind the wetting front are fully saturated in case 1 fig 10 case 1 is the only case with fully saturated water content profile because the upper coarse soil layers always allow enough water to infiltrate into the lower finer soils on the contrary cases 5 and 6 with finest soil on top have significantly longer time and smaller cumulative infiltration when the front reaches the bottom both cases have unsaturated water content in layers 2 and 3 when the wetting front first passes through these layers because the topmost finest soil layer limits the infiltration rate comparison of the six cases shows that unsaturated flow occurs at coarse layer underlying a finer layer water backfill effect exists in layer 2 in case 3 where sandy loam in layer 2 is coarser than loam in layer 1 and silt in layer 3 bottom finest layer further limits water flow into layer 3 thus water backfill effect occurs to saturate layer 2 however if layer 3 is not finer than the topmost layer 1 water backfill would not occur which is similar to case 5 3 3 sensitivity analysis as arrangement of coarse and fine layers significantly affects infiltration process definition of coarser and finer soils is important for the prediction of saturated unsaturated and backfill flow we perform two cases of elementary effects sensitivity analysis to investigate the most important parameter that dominates the evolution of water flow in the first case a two layer soil formation is used to examine the influence of soil hydraulic parameters and length of bottom layer 2 on the occurrence of unsaturated flow in layer 2 details of setup are shown in table 2 and the bounds of van genuchten parameters used in the analysis are determined based on the 12 soil textural groups from carsel and parrish 1988 fig 11 demonstrates the results of elementary effects test the results of μ and σ of elementary effects in fig 11a clearly show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of layer 2 is the only parameter dictating the occurrence of unsaturated flow in layer 2 saturated flow in layer 2 only occurs one time when ks of layer 2 is smaller than that of layer 1 larger ks of layer 2 results in more significant unsaturated flow in layer 2 since layer 1 is finer that limits water flowing into layer 2 in the second case a three layer formation is constructed with the topmost loam layer overlying the second sandy loam layer table 2 which leads to unsaturated flow in layer 2 then we analyze the influences of hydraulic parameters and length of layer 3 on the water backfill effect in layer 2 the results in fig 11b show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of layer 3 is the only influential parameter to the occurrence of backfill in layer 2 when layer 3 ks is below a critical value the backfill effect would occur the results of simulations with varying layer 3 ks values while keeping the other parameters of layer 3 the same as layer 1 show that the critical layer 3 ks is in the narrow range of 0 0177733 to 0 017933 cm min this critical value is slightly larger than the layer 1 ks of 0 01733 cm min which means that water backfill effect only occurs when ks of layer 3 is close to or less than that of layer 1 the sensitivity analysis allows us to predict the water backfill and unsaturated flow based on the saturated hydraulic conductivities of layered soils the above analysis and discussion have demonstrated the phenomena and dynamics of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect during the infiltration in layered soils which can be effectively and accurately captured by the new model the occurrences of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect are controlled by the arrangement and contrasting saturated hydraulic conductivities of soil layers the unsaturated flow occurs in a coarse layer underlying a top fine soil layer due to the fact that the top fine layer limits available water to flow into the coarse layer below the water backfill effect occurs after the unsaturated front in the coarse layer encounters another fine layer below which has a saturated hydraulic conductivity that is close to or less than that of the top fine layer since the relatively smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bottom fine layer limits water to flow out of the coarse layer the water will fill the unsaturated part of the coarse layer which is in between the two fine layers during this water backfill process water simultaneously fills the water content deficit in the coarse layer and infiltrates into the lower fine layer the complex soil water dynamics of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect is caused by the continuity requirement of water pressure head at the layer interfaces and the contrasting hydraulic properties of soil layers this study contributes to a better understanding of infiltration evolution in layered soils by the proposed analytical model the water backfill effect is validated by the solution of richards equation and may be further tested by well designed laboratory experiments due to the water backfill effect in layered soils the saturation in certain layers may change during the infiltration process this not only affects actual infiltration under rainfall or irrigation conditions but also influences the design of irrigation scenarios in addition nutrient or contaminant transport in layered soils is significantly influenced since the water flow in saturated and unsaturated soils differs in magnitude the analytical model developed under saturated condition on the surface in this study can be used to calculate the infiltration rate capacity and cumulative infiltration capacity which is in good agreement with the solution of richards equation for practical purposes the calculated infiltration capacity can then be used to simulate infiltration and runoff under variable intensity rainfall events in combination with other techniques such as the time compression approximation tca or the infiltrability depth approximation ida assouline et al 2007 hogarth et al 2011 smith et al 2002 zhu and cheng 2016 without numerically solving the nonlinear richards equation and associated numerical difficulties for instance the infiltration capacity for layered soils from this analytical model enable us to calculate the ponding time infiltration and runoff under steady and unsteady rainfalls with a simple tca based iterative method e g cheng et al 2017 however to fully explore potential applications under other boundary conditions is beyond the scope of this study and will be the next step 4 conclusions to analytically simulate infiltration process in layered soils we developed a new infiltration model with the assumption of sharp wetting front under constant surface ponding condition the analytical model employs evolving steady state active water content profiles at different layer stages which can simulate the unsaturated flow in coarse layers underlying fine layers the water backfill effect is determined based on the steady state active water contents the model only involves the analytical solutions to quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the backfill interface and to simulate the water backfill process while the sharp wetting front assumption results in slight overestimation of infiltration at early stage it allows the backfill effect to be explicitly implemented using the analytical approach the new model developed under ponding condition can be used in combination with other available analytical methods for other boundary conditions such as flux infiltration main conclusions could be summarized as follows the new sharp front model is able to simulate water flow dynamics in layered soils including unsaturated flow and water backfill without having to numerically solving the non linear richards equation the hypothesis that water flow in layered soils approaches steady state profile during infiltration when the front first passes in any layers is tested and supported based on that the analytically determined steady state active water content profiles can be used to predict the saturation state of all layers when the wetting front first passes through these layers and the occurrence of water backfill effect the updated active hydraulic parameters according to the active water content profiles can be used to simulate the unsaturated flow water backfill effect may occur when the unsaturated wetting front in the coarse encounters a fine layer saturated hydraulic conductivity is the parameter determining the occurrence of unsaturated flow and water backfill this means that saturated hydraulic conductivity can be used to define the coarseness of soil layers and to derive the saturation degree of soil layers and the occurrence of water backfill effect arrangement of contrasting soil layers significantly affects the infiltration process the commonly used assumption of saturated water content profile behind the wetting front is valid only when coarser layers always overlie fine layers acknowledgements this research was supported by the engineering initiative program at the university of wyoming it was also partially

7506,we develop a new analytical infiltration model to determine water flow dynamics around layer interfaces during infiltration process in layered soils the model mainly involves the analytical solutions to quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the interfaces active water content profile behind the wetting front is developed based on the solution of steady state flow to dynamically update active parameters in sharp wetting front infiltration equations and to predict unsaturated flow in coarse layers before the front reaches an impeding fine layer the effect of water backfill to saturate the coarse layers after the wetting front encounters the impeding fine layer is analytically expressed based on the active water content profiles comparison to the numerical solutions of the richards equation shows that the new model can well capture water dynamics in relation to the arrangement of soil layers the steady state active water content profile can be used to predict the saturation state of all layers when the wetting front first passes through these layers during the unsteady infiltration process water backfill effect may occur when the unsaturated wetting front encounters a fine layer underlying a coarse layer sensitivity analysis shows that saturated hydraulic conductivity is the parameter dictating the occurrence of unsaturated flow and water backfill and can be used to represent the coarseness of soil layers water backfill effect occurs in coarse layers between upper and lower fine layers when the lower layer is not significantly coarser than the upper layer keywords unsaturated flow water backfill layered soils active water content profile infiltration 1 introduction infiltration is an important component of land surface and subsurface hydrological processes infiltration process can be described using the most commonly used richards equation re richards 1931 which may be difficult to solve with highly non linear soil property functions ogden et al 2017 low order finite difference and finite element methods are often employed to solve re a number of studies focused on the development of robust numerical solution of re to improve conservation stability and efficiency celia et al 1990 du et al 2001 miller et al 1998 list and radu 2016 in general numerically solving re is not guaranteed to converge and mass balance errors may occur due to the interaction of diffusion and advection ogden et al 2015 pan and wierenga 1995 analytical solution of re is difficult except under some special forms of soil retention curves boundary and initial conditions and some restrictive assumptions celia et al 1990 de luca and cepeda 2016 hayek 2016 field soil profiles are commonly heterogeneous rather than uniform in vertical direction typically in a layered formation with different hydraulic properties in individual layers due to natural evolutions or anthropogenic activities assouline 2013 wang et al 2014 water movement is strongly affected by the layering in soil profile such as capillary and hydraulic barriers li et al 2014 generally fine layer with smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity is the main layer that controls infiltration process regardless of its position in layered soils philip 1957 kale and sahoo 2011 however it is not easy to quantitatively describe the infiltration process within layered soils for example the thickness of upper soil layer is an important factor in infiltration process leconte and brissette 2001 and contrasting hydraulic properties between layers dominate infiltration yang et al 2006 when the wetting front reaches layer interface for a two layer soil profile with a coarse layer above a fine soil layer a step change of infiltration rate may occur latifi et al 1994 miller and gardner 1962 for a two layer formation with fine soil on top infiltration rate when the front reaches the interface may be reduced due to the smaller sorptivity of lower coarse soil and the coarse layer will not be saturated and remains at a stable moisture content for a long time chu and mariño 2005 latifi et al 1994 takagi 1960 moreover a special case of layered soil is crust soil profile with significant fine soil layer overlying coarse layer in which unsaturated flow was observed in the laboratory experiments by vandervaere et al 1997 1998 yang et al 2004 found that the water pressure head of top finer soil near the interface may not increase with further evolution of infiltration however some research results showed that the wetting front may pause temporarily at the interface to wait for the capillary barrier breakthrough and infiltration rate then reduces to a constant value al maktoumi et al 2015 hillel and baker 1988 wang et al 1999 the air content in the lower coarser layer may increase due to the relatively small amount available water in the interface for the more permeable coarser layer mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 also the wetting front may become unstable and narrow wetting columns i e finger flow may occur carrillo et al 2000 diment and watson 1983 hill and parlange 1972 wang et al 2014 richards equation can be used to numerically solve infiltration problems in layered soils however careful evaluation of hydraulic parameters and proper average method around layer interfaces are required brunone et al 2003 romano et al 1998 several studies have extended green ampt ga model green and ampt 1911 to simulate infiltration into layered soils childs and bybordi 1969 used the ga model to describe the infiltration in layered soils with decreasing hydraulic conductivity from the surface moore 1981 and ahuja 1983 extended the ga model to examine the effects of stable crusted soils on infiltration damodhara rao et al 2006 studied the infiltration in three layer soils with seal tillage subsoil formation based on the ga model chu and mariño 2005 proposed a modified ga model for layered soils gal model that agreed well with the field experimental results for a four layer soil profile under unsteady rainfall the gal model has been employed and extended for studies of infiltration in layered soils cui and zhu 2017 deng and zhu 2016 ma et al 2011 however the gal model did not specifically take into account the complex water flow dynamics around the layer interfaces and was only validated for layered soil formations with decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth most extended ga models to layered soils typically adopted the traditional assumption of fully saturated water content profile behind the wetting front which may not be valid in some cases where fine soil layers overlie coarse layers to the best of our knowledge few studies on infiltration in layered soils focused on the water flow dynamics near the interfaces and the effects of layer formation especially in soil profile containing fine over coarse layers in this study we develop a new analytical infiltration model that specifically takes into account the flow dynamics around the layer interfaces in layered soils the model can be used to simulate evolution of infiltration in layered soils without numerical difficulties involved in numerically solving the non linear richards equation the model only involves the analytical solutions of quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the interfaces and has two new components 1 active water content profile behind the wetting front to predict unsaturated flow before the wetting front encounters a fine layer and 2 water backfill effect to saturate the coarser layer above the fine layer after the unsaturated front encounters the fine layer both components are analytically developed based on flow physics around the layer interfaces in the following sections we first describe the development of the analytical model and compare to the results of numerical solutions of the richards equation we then analyze and discuss the results for two illustrative examples to investigate the influence of layer arrangement on the infiltration dynamics finally we perform sensitivity analysis of hydraulic parameters to examine the important parameters that dictate the evolution of water dynamics in layered soils note that the hysteresis effect in soil water characteristic curve and possible unstable wetting front in the coarse layer under fine layer are not considered to facilitate the analysis of infiltration characteristics in layered soils using the analytical model 2 methods our proposed analytical model contains two core components as shown in fig 1 a steady state active water content profiles behind the wetting front which are used to update active parameters in sharp wetting front infiltration equations and to predict unsaturated flow and water backfill effect and b analytical expressions of water flow dynamics during the water backfill process 2 1 steady state active water content profile fig 2 schematically illustrates the layered soil formation under constant ponding condition in cases where a coarse layer underlies a fine layer the coarse layer may not be saturated and remains at a stable water content as discussed earlier since the top fine layer limits amount of water into the layered profile we propose a new and more accurate approach of active water content profile behind the wetting front the active water content profile behind the wetting front in any soil layers above layer j is solved using the steady state water content profile by imposing free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of layer j the idea is based on the hypothesis that water flow in layered soils approaches steady state profile during infiltration when the front first passes in any layers the steady state flow equations are easy to solve and the solutions provide water content profile and water pressure head profile that are used to update active parameters for the infiltration equations the updated active parameters represent the flow dynamics caused by contrasting hydraulic properties of layered soils the active water content profiles behind wetting front are proposed for the infiltration in layered soils for a layered soil profile with a total of n soil layers there are n active water content profiles which are sequentially determined based on the water content profile in steady state with the imposed free drainage condition at the bottom of layer j 1 j n we introduce layer stage j to represent that the free drainage condition is applied to the bottom of layer j the active water content profile with layer stage j denotes the predicted active water content profile above the bottom of layer j when wetting front first flows in layer j due to the contrasting hydraulic properties of soil layers the active water content profile evolves along with different layer stages based on continuity of the water pressure head at every layer interface above layer j the equations derived from the steady state

coupling the brent s method brent 1973 and the analytical algorithm for steady water flow in layered soils rockhold et al 1997 the root finding brent s method starts with an initial guess of the pressure head h j j and then adjusts it to make the difference zero between the solved pressure head at the surface h p and the given upper ponding head hp the analytical algorithm of rockhold et al 1997 is to solve water pressure heads at layer interfaces with given steady state flux and pressure head at the bottom of layered soil profile with the given guessed value of h j j the steady state flux q st j is calculated using eq 1c and then h p is solved by the analytical algorithm of rockhold et al 1997 fig 3 the active water content profile i e θ e c j l3l 3 in the layer c integer 1 c j

between two fine layers since the upper fine layer limits available water into coarse layers the coarse layers are unsaturated when the wetting front first passes through them after the unsaturated wetting front encounters the lower fine layer the impeding effect by the fine layer leads to water backfill effect that water simultaneously fills the water content deficit in the coarse layers and infiltrates into the lower fine layer suppose that water backfill effect occurs at the interface between layer k and k 1 and water will backfill upper two coarse layers above the interface layers k 1 and k fig 4 this water backfill effect around the interface between layer k and k 1 can be detected and predicted according to the results of steady state active water contents layers k 1 and k are not saturated when the wetting front is in layers k 1 and k i e layer stages k 1 and k in the superscripts in eqs 8a and 8b while the two layers are saturated when the wetting front is in layer k 1 i

bottom layer of entire soil profile the subsequent infiltration process is continually simulated by the proposed infiltration model while we have demonstrated the analytical model with water backfills in two layers the approach can be similarly applied to backfill any number of layers to solve all the above sharp front infiltration equations we use wetting front location as the calculation step since the layer formation is known 2 3 numerical solutions of richards equation and sensitivity analysis one dimensional richards equation is numerically solved by the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2013 the hydrus 1d model simulates infiltration process in layered soils with upper ponding and lower free drainage boundary conditions and given appropriate initial conditions for all layers the soil hydraulic properties are described by the modified van genuchten model with air entry value ha 2 cm van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 however any other hydraulic models can also be easily used results from the hydrus 1d are used to compare to those from the new analytical infiltration model the elementary effects ees method proposed by morris 1991 is used to perform global sensitivity analysis to investigate the most important parameter that dominates the evolution of water flow in layered soils the ees method is also called one at a time oat method which means that each model run varies only one input parameter and keeps all others fixed the elementary effect is an incremental ratio of outputs of interest to input parameter increment from each model run measure μ is the mean of absolute value of elementary effects of input parameters which is used to identify non influential input parameters and to rank them in the order of importance measure σ is the standard deviation of elementary effects which describes interactions with other parameters more details can be found in morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 and wang et al 2016 3 results and discussion while the developed analytical infiltration model is generic for layered soils we design several illustrative examples to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the model to capture unsaturated flow and water backfill during complex infiltration evolution our focus in the illustrative examples is to demonstrate how the unsaturated flow and backfill process are simulated by the analytical model as they are compared with the hydrus 1d results and the effect of layer arrangement 3 1 unsaturated flow and backfill process a four layer case is used to compare the results of the analytical model and the hydrus 1d results soil hydraulic parameters layer arrangement and initial condition are shown in table 1 a in this illustrative example the initial water content for layers are corresponding to the water pressure head of 500 cm the initial water content can be set as measured or estimated data for real world applications infiltration simulation is performed under hp 0 cm soil profile contains soil layers 3 2 1 and 4 from coarsest to finest according to their saturated conductivities the active water content and water pressure head profiles for four layer stages are shown in fig 5 which illustrate that layers 2 and 3 are not saturated when the wetting front first passes through these two layers since the topmost fine layer 1 limits the infiltration however the active water content profile with layer stage j 4 indicates the two layers are saturated when the wetting front is in layer 4 therefore water backfill effect occurs in layers 2 and 3 when the wetting front encounters the finest layer 4 the predicted unsaturated flow and water backfill effect from the analytical model are compared with the results from the hydrus 1d fig 6 during the backfill process infiltrated water partitions into two ways one filling the unsaturated parts of layers 3 and 2 the other flowing into layer 4 this can be seen from the water content profiles at 900 and 1050 min in fig 6a during this filling process infiltration rate is constant which is shown in fig 6c the constant water backfill infiltration rate is due to the fact that water pressure head profiles near the surface remain unchanged profiles at 900 and 1050 min in fig 6b although water pressure head at the backfill interface at 225 cm is continuously building up after the completion of backfilling in the unsaturated layers above the interface the wetting front keeps advancing to the bottom of layer and infiltration eventually achieves steady state i e the tail part of infiltration rate in fig 6c comparison of results from the new analytical infiltration hydrus 1d and gal models in fig 7 shows the gal model results differ significantly from the hydrus 1d results especially after water infiltrates into layer 2 the difference is not surprising because the gal model assumes saturated water content profile behind the wetting front which does not explicitly take into account the water dynamics around the interfaces this assumption leads to unrealistically high infiltration rate in layers 2 and 3 unlike the gal model the results from the new analytical model agree well with those from the hydrus 1d the two drops in infiltration rate when the water backfill ends and steady state flow starts are well predicted by the new analytical model with only slight difference in the timing of drop fig 7 this slight difference is mainly caused by the fact that the sharp front infiltration model predicts an infinite rate when the wetting front zf is zero hsu et al 2017 and the analytical model slightly overestimates the infiltration rate in the top layer 1 the slight overestimation is more noticeable with coarse soils since their hydraulic conductivities are notably larger than fine soils however the overestimation is not from problems related to the active water content profile and backfilling approach proposed in this study comparison of water content profiles in fig 8 shows that although the analytical model assumes a sharp wetting front water content profiles from the analytical model agree well with those from the hydrus 1d the slight discrepancies of the location of upper wetting front in layers 2 and 3 are caused by the slightly overestimated infiltration in layer 1 from the analytical model as discussed above the total time of backfill process from the analytical model is 245 min compared to 243 min from the hydrus 1d overall the new analytical model effectively and accurately describes the dynamic infiltration process in the layered soils 3 2 effect of layer arrangement to illustrate the influence of soil layer arrangement on infiltration we select three types of soils with contrasting hydraulic parameters and six arrangements of three layer formation labeled as cases 1 6 as shown in tables 1b and c results in figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that layer arrangement significantly affects infiltration process case 1 with coarsest soil on the topmost layer and coarse soil overlying fine soil has the shortest time for the wetting front to reach the bottom and the largest cumulative infiltration soils in the layers behind the wetting front are fully saturated in case 1 fig 10 case 1 is the only case with fully saturated water content profile because the upper coarse soil layers always allow enough water to infiltrate into the lower finer soils on the contrary cases 5 and 6 with finest soil on top have significantly longer time and smaller cumulative infiltration when the front reaches the bottom both cases have unsaturated water content in layers 2 and 3 when the wetting front first passes through these layers because the topmost finest soil layer limits the infiltration rate comparison of the six cases shows that unsaturated flow occurs at coarse layer underlying a finer layer water backfill effect exists in layer 2 in case 3 where sandy loam in layer 2 is coarser than loam in layer 1 and silt in layer 3 bottom finest layer further limits water flow into layer 3 thus water backfill effect occurs to saturate layer 2 however if layer 3 is not finer than the topmost layer 1 water backfill would not occur which is similar to case 5 3 3 sensitivity analysis as arrangement of coarse and fine layers significantly affects infiltration process definition of coarser and finer soils is important for the prediction of saturated unsaturated and backfill flow we perform two cases of elementary effects sensitivity analysis to investigate the most important parameter that dominates the evolution of water flow in the first case a two layer soil formation is used to examine the influence of soil hydraulic parameters and length of bottom layer 2 on the occurrence of unsaturated flow in layer 2 details of setup are shown in table 2 and the bounds of van genuchten parameters used in the analysis are determined based on the 12 soil textural groups from carsel and parrish 1988 fig 11 demonstrates the results of elementary effects test the results of μ and σ of elementary effects in fig 11a clearly show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of layer 2 is the only parameter dictating the occurrence of unsaturated flow in layer 2 saturated flow in layer 2 only occurs one time when ks of layer 2 is smaller than that of layer 1 larger ks of layer 2 results in more significant unsaturated flow in layer 2 since layer 1 is finer that limits water flowing into layer 2 in the second case a three layer formation is constructed with the topmost loam layer overlying the second sandy loam layer table 2 which leads to unsaturated flow in layer 2 then we analyze the influences of hydraulic parameters and length of layer 3 on the water backfill effect in layer 2 the results in fig 11b show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of layer 3 is the only influential parameter to the occurrence of backfill in layer 2 when layer 3 ks is below a critical value the backfill effect would occur the results of simulations with varying layer 3 ks values while keeping the other parameters of layer 3 the same as layer 1 show that the critical layer 3 ks is in the narrow range of 0 0177733 to 0 017933 cm min this critical value is slightly larger than the layer 1 ks of 0 01733 cm min which means that water backfill effect only occurs when ks of layer 3 is close to or less than that of layer 1 the sensitivity analysis allows us to predict the water backfill and unsaturated flow based on the saturated hydraulic conductivities of layered soils the above analysis and discussion have demonstrated the phenomena and dynamics of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect during the infiltration in layered soils which can be effectively and accurately captured by the new model the occurrences of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect are controlled by the arrangement and contrasting saturated hydraulic conductivities of soil layers the unsaturated flow occurs in a coarse layer underlying a top fine soil layer due to the fact that the top fine layer limits available water to flow into the coarse layer below the water backfill effect occurs after the unsaturated front in the coarse layer encounters another fine layer below which has a saturated hydraulic conductivity that is close to or less than that of the top fine layer since the relatively smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bottom fine layer limits water to flow out of the coarse layer the water will fill the unsaturated part of the coarse layer which is in between the two fine layers during this water backfill process water simultaneously fills the water content deficit in the coarse layer and infiltrates into the lower fine layer the complex soil water dynamics of the unsaturated flow and water backfill effect is caused by the continuity requirement of water pressure head at the layer interfaces and the contrasting hydraulic properties of soil layers this study contributes to a better understanding of infiltration evolution in layered soils by the proposed analytical model the water backfill effect is validated by the solution of richards equation and may be further tested by well designed laboratory experiments due to the water backfill effect in layered soils the saturation in certain layers may change during the infiltration process this not only affects actual infiltration under rainfall or irrigation conditions but also influences the design of irrigation scenarios in addition nutrient or contaminant transport in layered soils is significantly influenced since the water flow in saturated and unsaturated soils differs in magnitude the analytical model developed under saturated condition on the surface in this study can be used to calculate the infiltration rate capacity and cumulative infiltration capacity which is in good agreement with the solution of richards equation for practical purposes the calculated infiltration capacity can then be used to simulate infiltration and runoff under variable intensity rainfall events in combination with other techniques such as the time compression approximation tca or the infiltrability depth approximation ida assouline et al 2007 hogarth et al 2011 smith et al 2002 zhu and cheng 2016 without numerically solving the nonlinear richards equation and associated numerical difficulties for instance the infiltration capacity for layered soils from this analytical model enable us to calculate the ponding time infiltration and runoff under steady and unsteady rainfalls with a simple tca based iterative method e g cheng et al 2017 however to fully explore potential applications under other boundary conditions is beyond the scope of this study and will be the next step 4 conclusions to analytically simulate infiltration process in layered soils we developed a new infiltration model with the assumption of sharp wetting front under constant surface ponding condition the analytical model employs evolving steady state active water content profiles at different layer stages which can simulate the unsaturated flow in coarse layers underlying fine layers the water backfill effect is determined based on the steady state active water contents the model only involves the analytical solutions to quadratic equations to determine the flux rates around the backfill interface and to simulate the water backfill process while the sharp wetting front assumption results in slight overestimation of infiltration at early stage it allows the backfill effect to be explicitly implemented using the analytical approach the new model developed under ponding condition can be used in combination with other available analytical methods for other boundary conditions such as flux infiltration main conclusions could be summarized as follows the new sharp front model is able to simulate water flow dynamics in layered soils including unsaturated flow and water backfill without having to numerically solving the non linear richards equation the hypothesis that water flow in layered soils approaches steady state profile during infiltration when the front first passes in any layers is tested and supported based on that the analytically determined steady state active water content profiles can be used to predict the saturation state of all layers when the wetting front first passes through these layers and the occurrence of water backfill effect the updated active hydraulic parameters according to the active water content profiles can be used to simulate the unsaturated flow water backfill effect may occur when the unsaturated wetting front in the coarse encounters a fine layer saturated hydraulic conductivity is the parameter determining the occurrence of unsaturated flow and water backfill this means that saturated hydraulic conductivity can be used to define the coarseness of soil layers and to derive the saturation degree of soil layers and the occurrence of water backfill effect arrangement of contrasting soil layers significantly affects the infiltration process the commonly used assumption of saturated water content profile behind the wetting front is valid only when coarser layers always overlie fine layers acknowledgements this research was supported by the engineering initiative program at the university of wyoming it was also partially

7507,the in well point velocity probe iwpvp is a novel device designed for obtaining rapid initial measurements of groundwater velocity at the centimeter scale using a standard monitoring well to access the subsurface iwpvp measurements of groundwater speed are quantified on the basis of a mini tracer test that is conducted within the body of the probe information regarding horizontal flow directions is obtained from differential responses at detectors placed in the four quadrants of the probe the viability of the iwpvp design was confirmed by 1 numerical modeling that accounted for laminar flow in the porous medium outside the well and turbulent flow inside the well and probe and 2 a series of laboratory tank experiments in which the probe was calibrated to quantify seepage rates in a medium grain sand laboratory tests were completed in less than 20 min in all cases when seepage velocity was between 50 and 400 cm day the magnitude of the groundwater velocity was determined with a precision of 7 on average and accuracy of 11 for seepage velocities up to 400 cm day the flow direction was determined within 15 the iwpvp appears to be a viable tool for rapid

storage tank hb half bridge 1 introduction groundwater velocity is of primary concern for the movement of solutes in aquifers sudicky 1986 showed that aquifer heterogeneity of significance to transport processes exists even in geologically simple aquifers such as the c f b borden aquifer ontario canada thus small scale variations in groundwater velocity should be expected in all aquifers which may be of importance for fate and transport studies and site characterization for remediation purposes gierzack et al 2006 kempf et al 2013 labaky et al 2007 2009 schillig et al 2011 2016 verreydt et al 2015 traditionally groundwater velocity is estimated by calculating the specific discharge q l t corrected for effective porosity n dimensionless using a one dimensional form of darcy s law and assuming homogeneous conditions 1 v q n k n δ h δ x where v is the average linear groundwater velocity l t k is the hydraulic conductivity l t δh is the change in total hydraulic head l h elevation head pressure head over the distance δx in the direction of flow l units are generalized where l is length and t is time the directional component of the velocity vector is commonly obtained assuming an isotropic aquifer with flow occurring perpendicular to contoured equipotentials of hydraulic head it is well known that the darcy method is associated with potentially large sources of error connected with parameter identification and issues of scale the primary source of parameter error in darcy based calculations usually originates from estimations of k which can vary over 13 orders of magnitude in natural deposits freeze and cherry 1979 two order of magnitude variations in k measured over distances of just a few centimeters were reported in the borden aquifer which has been described as quite homogeneous relative to many aquifers of similar origin mackay et al 1986 p 2019 sudicky 1986 apart from k hydraulic gradient estimations are subject to notable errors post and von asmuth 2013 for example large distances between monitoring wells may be required to obtain a measurable difference in hydraulic heads in highly permeable sediments raising concern over the assumption of continuous hydraulic connections between the wells devlin and mcelwee 2007 thus the scale of a gradient measurement could lead to unrepresentative estimates of localized velocity values similarly hydraulic gradients may be highly uncertain at small sites where wells are closely spaced with these considerations in mind it is clear that darcy based conventional methods of estimating groundwater velocity are not well suited to all cases and hydrologic investigations may benefit from complementary methods for estimating groundwater velocities an alternative to darcy based calculations is the use of a direct velocity measurement technique there is currently no technology available that truly measures water velocity directly nevertheless for convenience and simplicity tracer based methods are hereafter referred to as direct velocity measurements the earliest demonstrations of direct velocity measurement involved inter well tracer tests and later natural gradient tracer tests thiem 1887 slitcher 1905 mackay et al 1986 leblanc et al 1991 post and von asmuth 2013 however these tests tend to be time consuming and labor intensive scaled down single well tracer tests were developed in part to overcome this problem drost et al 1968 yet these methods may require time series chemical sampling or accurate knowledge of porosity to calculate velocity values and many of them provide no information on flow direction kempf et al 2013 more recently other methods of direct groundwater velocity measurement have been developed examples of in well techniques include the point dilution method the colloidal borescope the passive flux meter the heat pulse flowmeter and the acoustic doppler flowmeter drost et al 1968 hatfield et al 2004 kearl 1997 kerfoot 1988 wilson et al 2001 in well techniques can assess spatial variability across a site economically by redeploying probes in multiple wells their disadvantages include the need for empirical calibration lines to account for the effects of wells and filter packs on local flow the representativeness of such calibration lines can be problematic if well screens suffer from partial clogging due to biofilms encrustation or other damage additionally the specific aforementioned devices generally have moderate to high costs of use and commonly require specialized personnel to interpret the test results technologies that support direct measurements of groundwater velocity without wells also exist i e probes are in direct contact with the aquifer material in dedicated boreholes without the presence of a well the point velocity probe pvp is such a technology for use in unconsolidated noncohesive porous media pvps measure groundwater velocity by tracking tracer movement around the perimeter of a cylindrical probe and do not require calibration a pvp can be deployed singly or in multilevel stands and sampled repeatedly over time devlin et al 2009 2011 the probes can be constructed by hand from readily available inexpensive materials or 3d printed devlin et al 2009 walter and devlin 2017 the purpose of this work was to extend the work that developed the pvp by redesigning the probe to function in a standard commercial well the new probe referred to here as the in well pvp or iwpvp was designed with the objectives of being an inexpensive reusable tool for rapid centimeter scale in situ measurements of groundwater velocity in principle the tool is subject to the same operational limitations that apply to other in well technologies in particular those associated with the need for calibration but the iwpvp can be fabricated inexpensively and utilized with the same training and software required for other pvp instruments a further objective of this work was to use the newly designed probe in controlled laboratory tests to assess is viability and demonstrate proof of concept 2 materials and methods 2 1 probe concept it is well known that groundwater monitoring wells cause a perturbation of the local flow system drost 1983 wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 bidaux and tsang 1991 fig 1 a the contrasting permeabilities of the aquifer and the open water i e no porous medium inside the well as well as factors connected to filter packs if present and the well screen are expected to cause water to converge towards the well drost et al 1968 freeze and cherry 1979 beyond the zone of disturbance the average linear velocity of interest v applies within the well an average bulk velocity vw applies it was hypothesized in this work that a suitably designed probe could be deployed in a well and render a measureable velocity value within the probe vp which will be different from vw that could be related to the average linear velocity of groundwater in the aquifer i e vp v to test this hypothesis the iwpvp was designed fig 2 the iwpvp releases a tracer in principle a variety of tracers could be used in this work a solution of nacl is used into the central chamber of the probe and tracks it through detector channels that run from the the probe center to isolated portions of the well volume b fig 1b in the probes tested for this work each detector consisted of two stainless steel wires as described for previous pvp systems devlin et al 2009 changes in electrical conductivity of the passing groundwater were measured as voltage changes across the wires of the detectors the signals yielded breakthrough curves btc from which vp was calculated by the method of moments implemented in the free excel based software velprobepe an example breakthrough curve from an actual test is shown in fig 3 b freyberg 1986 schillig 2012 schillig et al 2016 velprobepe can also estimate vp by fitting the btc to a one dimensional solution of the advection dispersion equation but that option was not used in this work assuming the speed of water passing through the probe is proportional to the ambient groundwater velocity a linear calibration line relates the two quantities calibration lines depend on properties of the aquifer medium and the well construction so site specific calibration lines i e lines generated using site specific media and well designs will likely be required for best results kerfoot 1988 the directional component of the velocity can also be estimated based the speed and tracer distribution in the four detection channels fig 1b limiting the number of channels to four affords the possibility of determining flow direction with good accuracy while limiting the size of the cable running to the surface wires and injection lines so multilevel probe stacks can be deployed in a single borehole 2 2 experimental methods to assess the viability of the iwpvp a prototype probe was fabricated using a 3d printer and subjected to laboratory testing the prototype was designed using trimble sketchup and printed with abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic it was designed with an outside diameter o d of 4 99 cm and a height of 5 0 cm fig 2 making it suitable for use in a commercially obtained 5 15 cm inside diameter i d well screen a probe body cost less than 100 to produce on the printer additional costs were incurred to complete the fabrication including the rods e g 2 54 cm diameter schedule 40 pvc pipe to raise and lower the probe in a well and the wiring to carry detector signals to the surface in general these costs will vary depending on the intended depth to which the probe will be installed once assembled the probe can be reused indefinitely depending on restrictions that may arise due to contaminant levels in wells contributing to its cost effectiveness the detection system was manually assembled using 30 pound test stainless steel fishing lead wire a single detector consisted of a pair of wires inside a channel connected to a campbell scientific cr1000 data logger devlin et al 2009 voltage across the wires was recorded and stored at 1 s intervals the distance between the tracer source assumed the center of the central chamber and the detector wire furthest away from the chamber in the active channel 1 06 cm in each channel was used as the travel distance in the velocity calculations note a signal is only generated when the tracer reaches the more distal wire in a channel closing the circuit between the two wires of a detector all experiments were conducted with a schedule 40 pvc 0 508 mm 0 020 in slot width four slot commercial well screen installed in a sand packed nested storage tank nest aquifer simulator packed with medium grained sand the nest system has been shown to establish a uniform delivery of water through the saturated portion of the sand packed tank bowen et al 2012 the iwpvp was installed inside the well screen and the annular space around each of the channel inlets was isolated with friction fit weather stripping to initiate a test a small volume of saline tracer solution 0 1 ml in these tests was injected into the top of the central chamber because iwpvp measurements are based on the movement of the tracer in open water the system is very sensitive to density gradients and care was taken to ensure that the measured velocities were not due to density driven flow to assist in this regard a passive mixing system was designed to mix the tracer solution with ambient groundwater in the central chamber maximizing the tracer mass carried into the detector channels by flowing groundwater and minimizing tracer loss at the bottom of the probe due to density flow tracer solution that reaches the bottom of the central chamber due to density flow passes out of the probe without contacting the detector wires which are protected by raised shoes at the bases of the channels fig 2 the tracer injections were conducted through a t connector linking a 60 ml reservoir syringe and a 1 ml injection syringe both filled with the saline tracer solution schillig et al 2011 an automated syringe pump was used to deliver the small volumes of tracer 0 1 ml in each experiment manual injections are also possible and may be preferable in many applications due to simplicity however manual injections could contribute an additional source of uncertainty depending on the operator the nest was prepared by placing the well screen in the center of the empty sand tank which was subsequently filled with water and wet packed with homogeneous medium grained sand i e quikrete commercial grade medium sand with a predominant grain size range of 0 8 0 3 mm to a total depth of 25 5 cm the well screen extended the entire vertical extent of the saturated porous medium once the sand was packed around the screen the well was developed by running a surge block up and down the inside of the screen a minimum of 6 times to ensure a good hydraulic connection with the porous medium after screen development the probe was installed and oriented with one of the funneled channels aligned with the expected flow direction the pump was then turned on and flow recirculated from the receiver tank to the source tank fig 3a for a minimum of 2 h before collecting pvp signals to allow flow in the tank to reach steady state the sensitivities of velocity measurements to tracer strength 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l nacl injection volume 0 1 0 5 ml and injection times 5 30 s were evaluated experimentally and found to be low in all cases following this determination the bulk of the tests were performed with tracer injections set to 0 10 ml pulses administered over a period of ten seconds using a 0 25 g l nacl solution in any given experiment the average expected seepage velocity in the nest was determined from pumping rate measurements before and after every iwpvp test using the following equation 2 v q a n where q is the pump discharge cm3 min a is the cross section area of the sand packed storage tank cm2 and n is the effective porosity dimensionless pumping rates were determined by measuring the volume of water pumped over a period of 1 min using a graduated cylinder after each pumping rate measurement was complete a minimum of five minutes was allowed for the flow rate through the sand to re equilibrate before another measurement was initiated to avoid possible interference between tests additionally water collected during pumping rate measurements was held until all tests were completed at that pumping rate once the tests were completed the water was added back to the upstream reservoir tank and the pumping rate was adjusted for the next set of tests this was followed by a period of flow stabilization that lasted at least 45 min four replicate measurements at each tank velocity were made to determine the measurement precision 2 3 numerical simulations a 2 d steady state numerical model of a probe inside an open borehole representing a well emplaced in a porous media was created using the free and porous media flow package in comsol multiphysics which permitted flow in granular porous media in the open water inside the well and inside the probe to be modeled within the same domain fig 4 https www comsol com due to the 2 d nature of the model the simulations represent flow in a single slice through the center of the borehole in the nest therefore the model did not account for flow resistance arising from the slotted nature of the well screen i e alternating open and closed segments the porous medium tank was modeled to match the experimental set up 35 0 cm by 54 cm and with the properties of homogeneous sand comsol input permeability 1e 7 cm2 10 darcy and effective porosity 0 33 the well was represented as a 5 08 cm o d circle containing open water in which the effects of turbulent flow could be simulated within the circle of open water the probe was simulated as symmetrically arranged solid blocks with zero permeability fig 4 the left side of the domain was defined as a constant velocity boundary using values representative of the laboratory experiments the right boundary was defined as a free exit boundary the boundaries running parallel to the flow direction were defined as no flow boundaries 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical modeling several simulations were performed to examine the relationship between seepage velocities in the sand and velocities measured by the probe since the probe operates in open water in the well there was a possibility that non darcian flow in the probe could render the probe s response to variations in seepage velocity nonlinear zeng and grigg 2006 an important finding of these simulations was that linearity was preserved over the range of velocities examined v 48 cm day 400 cm day thus the effects of turbulent flow in the well and probe were predicted to be negligible under these conditions a second notable finding was that the velocities that developed in the probe vp were calculated to be considerably greater than the seepage velocities in the saturated sand v specifically the correlation between these sets of velocities was found to be linear r2 1 00 with a slope of 18 6 fig 5 3 2 measurement of horizontal velocities an experimental evaluation of the iwpvp was undertaken under conditions similar to those represented in the numerical modeling work as described in the preceding section tests were performed with velocities in the sand tank between 48 and 400 cm day the test well was assembled with a commercial well screen that comprised four columns of slots with slot openings of 0 508 mm 20 the precision of the probe measurements was found to average 7 i e one standard deviation based on tests conducted in quadruplicate fig 5 the accuracy of the probe measurements was assessed using the methodology described by devlin 1996 and was found to range from approximately 40 tank velocities 48 cm day to about 10 15 tank velocities 300 cm day at 95 confidence better accuracy at low flow rates may be possible if calibrations are conducted with reliably lower pumping rates the accuracy of the probe was assessed further by comparing experimental calibration lines to the one produced in the modeled simulations fig 5 experimentally the four column screen i e four vertical columns of slots was found to produce a linear calibration line consistent with the simulations in the first of these experiments the calibration line was found to exhibit a slope of 6 2 which was less than the slope predicted by the model 18 this result was anticipated since the numerical simulations did not account for the resistance to flow imposed by the well screen which is composed of open slots separated by solid pvc kerfoot and massard 1985 found that commercial well screens could be quantitatively assigned resistance factors based on well screen design among the screens tested by kerfoot and massard was a 20 four column screen similar to the well screen utilized in the current experiments the resistance factor reported for that well screen was 58 i e the calibration line slope magnification factor mf must be corrected by a factor of 1 0 58 0 42 kerfoot and massard 1985 it should be noted that their resistance factor applies to a well packed with a glass bead porous medium which was required for the operation of their heat pulse flowmeter thus the resistance factor could reflect the effects of the screen the glass beads or both furthermore this factor applies to an ideal screen in a well controlled laboratory experiment and may not be strictly accurate in all field settings however for purposes of comparing the model with our controlled experiments the factor was considered an appropriate initial estimate correcting the flow rates predicted by the model by 42 resulted in a calibration line with a slope of 7 8 which compares quite favorably to the experimental data fig 5 the repeatability of tests and sensitivity of iwpvp velocity measurements to well screen conditions was further investigated by conducting two additional tests in independently packed tanks the same installation methods and velocity ranges were used in all tests however in the third of these experiments the weather stripping packers were replaced with brushes the modification made the probe easier to insert and remove from the well casing the brushes did not form as impermeable a seal against the inside of the screen as the weather stripping but were hypothesized to behave similarly for practical purposes due to the expected high permeability contrast between the brushes and the open channels in the probe altogether 104 tank experiments were completed in the three separately packed tanks over these tests the slopes of the calibration lines were found to vary between about 6 and 9 gray area shown in fig 5 the range was determined by regressing the two extreme calibration lines and calculating the 95 confidence range on the slopes the upper end of the highest slope calibration line packing 3 was 8 6 and the lower end of the lowest slope calibration line packing 1 was 5 6 this degree of variability represents variability in the porous media packing possibly related to variations in effective porosity which was assessed in earlier work by gravimetric analysis to be 0 34 0 2 gibson and devlin 2017 other contributors to the variability could be minor variations in the hydraulic conductivity of the packed sand as well as well screen imperfections the results imply challenges for the application of single calibration lines to multiple field deployments of the probe to deal with this latter challenge and for the purposes of preliminary field measurements a composite calibration line consisting of measurements from several tanks packed with sediments representative of the field site might provide the best overall estimates of groundwater velocity for the site of interest in addition this work has focused on measurements in sandy porous media further work is needed to investigate the effects of a wider range of sediment types on the calibration lines and velocity measurement uncertainties 3 3 measurement of flow direction an evaluation of the iwpvp flow direction measurement capabilities was conducted through a series of tests in which the probe was systematically rotated in the well to establish different incident angles of groundwater flow fig 1c fig 6 these tests were conducted with two seepage velocities in the tank 49 cm day and 156 cm day testing began with the iwpvp oriented with the hb4 and hb2 channels parallel to the flow direction fig 6 the iwpvp was subsequently rotated in clockwise increments of 10 with four replicate velocity measurements made at each probe orientation at some of the probe orientations inflow was intercepted by more than one channel fig 1c similarly outflow occurred from more than one channel ideally in such cases seepage velocities should be possible to calculate by the addition of the observed vp vectors in the probe channels and the appropriate adjustment using the calibration line experimentally it was found that the best results were obtained when the velocities in the channels were also weighted with the mass fraction of tracer passing through them i e at low angles probe to ambient flow most of the tracer passed through the channel that aligned best with the overall flow direction and a very small amount of tracer was detected in a secondary channel however the timing of the tracer appearances in the two channels was very close presumably due to factors related to well screen and probe design that were not represented in the modeling the mass fraction weights wi were calculated from 3 w 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 where ai is the area under the btc from channel i once the weights are calculated the apparent angle of groundwater flow relative to the probe θapp can be estimated by 4 θ app tan 1 v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 where vi is the measured vp in channel i with θapp known the component of flow in the ambient flow direction i e outside the well can be determined for each channel and added together to obtain a total probe measured velocity viwpvp using 5 v iwpvp v 1 sin θ app 2 v 2 cos θ app 2 the probe measured velocity magnitude viwpvp is then converted to the seepage velocity magnitude through the calibration line i e by dividing by the calibration line slope accuracy and precision of the velocity measurements in the 40 rotation tests was assessed by comparing the average of quadruplicate measurements at each angle to the result from 0 rotation it was found that the accuracy of the velocity magnitude was within 6 and the precision was within the 7 previously reported section 3 2 showing similar performance regardless of orientation to the prevailing flow direction see fig 1c the rotation testing also showed that the iwpvp determined the flow angle θapp within 15 on average table 1 these results are considered very encouraging but it must be recalled that they were obtained under highly controlled and favorable conditions further work is needed to assess the iwpvp performance in field applications where well screens may not be ideally connected to the aquifer poorly developed or suffer some form of damage in those cases velocities especially the flow direction determinations are likely to be less certain 4 conclusions in summary the laboratory and numerical testing of the iwpvp show that reasonably accurate measurements of groundwater velocity are possible with this instrument under the conditions of these tests which were limited by the minimum reliable pumping rates the iwpvp returned measurements of groundwater velocity with an accuracy between 40 tank velocities 48 cm day and 10 to 15 at tank velocities 300 cm day with 95 confidence the iwpvp was also able to determine the apparent angle of flow within 15 on average with the orientation of the iwpvp in the well screen showing no effect on the ability to make reliable measurements from the initial benchtop testing the iwpvp appears to be a viable tool for the measurement of local scale groundwater velocity the maximum observed experimental deviations from expected velocity values were within 25 and the majority of that uncertainty resulted from differences in tank packing however to use the iwpvp in the field care must be taken to maximize the development of the well to ensure good connection with the aquifer on the basis of the consistent results from

7507,the in well point velocity probe iwpvp is a novel device designed for obtaining rapid initial measurements of groundwater velocity at the centimeter scale using a standard monitoring well to access the subsurface iwpvp measurements of groundwater speed are quantified on the basis of a mini tracer test that is conducted within the body of the probe information regarding horizontal flow directions is obtained from differential responses at detectors placed in the four quadrants of the probe the viability of the iwpvp design was confirmed by 1 numerical modeling that accounted for laminar flow in the porous medium outside the well and turbulent flow inside the well and probe and 2 a series of laboratory tank experiments in which the probe was calibrated to quantify seepage rates in a medium grain sand laboratory tests were completed in less than 20 min in all cases when seepage velocity was between 50 and 400 cm day the magnitude of the groundwater velocity was determined with a precision of 7 on average and accuracy of 11 for seepage velocities up to 400 cm day the flow direction was determined within 15 the iwpvp appears to be a viable tool for rapid

storage tank hb half bridge 1 introduction groundwater velocity is of primary concern for the movement of solutes in aquifers sudicky 1986 showed that aquifer heterogeneity of significance to transport processes exists even in geologically simple aquifers such as the c f b borden aquifer ontario canada thus small scale variations in groundwater velocity should be expected in all aquifers which may be of importance for fate and transport studies and site characterization for remediation purposes gierzack et al 2006 kempf et al 2013 labaky et al 2007 2009 schillig et al 2011 2016 verreydt et al 2015 traditionally groundwater velocity is estimated by calculating the specific discharge q l t corrected for effective porosity n dimensionless using a one dimensional form of darcy s law and assuming homogeneous conditions 1 v q n k n δ h δ x where v is the average linear groundwater velocity l t k is the hydraulic conductivity l t δh is the change in total hydraulic head l h elevation head pressure head over the distance δx in the direction of flow l units are generalized where l is length and t is time the directional component of the velocity vector is commonly obtained assuming an isotropic aquifer with flow occurring perpendicular to contoured equipotentials of hydraulic head it is well known that the darcy method is associated with potentially large sources of error connected with parameter identification and issues of scale the primary source of parameter error in darcy based calculations usually originates from estimations of k which can vary over 13 orders of magnitude in natural deposits freeze and cherry 1979 two order of magnitude variations in k measured over distances of just a few centimeters were reported in the borden aquifer which has been described as quite homogeneous relative to many aquifers of similar origin mackay et al 1986 p 2019 sudicky 1986 apart from k hydraulic gradient estimations are subject to notable errors post and von asmuth 2013 for example large distances between monitoring wells may be required to obtain a measurable difference in hydraulic heads in highly permeable sediments raising concern over the assumption of continuous hydraulic connections between the wells devlin and mcelwee 2007 thus the scale of a gradient measurement could lead to unrepresentative estimates of localized velocity values similarly hydraulic gradients may be highly uncertain at small sites where wells are closely spaced with these considerations in mind it is clear that darcy based conventional methods of estimating groundwater velocity are not well suited to all cases and hydrologic investigations may benefit from complementary methods for estimating groundwater velocities an alternative to darcy based calculations is the use of a direct velocity measurement technique there is currently no technology available that truly measures water velocity directly nevertheless for convenience and simplicity tracer based methods are hereafter referred to as direct velocity measurements the earliest demonstrations of direct velocity measurement involved inter well tracer tests and later natural gradient tracer tests thiem 1887 slitcher 1905 mackay et al 1986 leblanc et al 1991 post and von asmuth 2013 however these tests tend to be time consuming and labor intensive scaled down single well tracer tests were developed in part to overcome this problem drost et al 1968 yet these methods may require time series chemical sampling or accurate knowledge of porosity to calculate velocity values and many of them provide no information on flow direction kempf et al 2013 more recently other methods of direct groundwater velocity measurement have been developed examples of in well techniques include the point dilution method the colloidal borescope the passive flux meter the heat pulse flowmeter and the acoustic doppler flowmeter drost et al 1968 hatfield et al 2004 kearl 1997 kerfoot 1988 wilson et al 2001 in well techniques can assess spatial variability across a site economically by redeploying probes in multiple wells their disadvantages include the need for empirical calibration lines to account for the effects of wells and filter packs on local flow the representativeness of such calibration lines can be problematic if well screens suffer from partial clogging due to biofilms encrustation or other damage additionally the specific aforementioned devices generally have moderate to high costs of use and commonly require specialized personnel to interpret the test results technologies that support direct measurements of groundwater velocity without wells also exist i e probes are in direct contact with the aquifer material in dedicated boreholes without the presence of a well the point velocity probe pvp is such a technology for use in unconsolidated noncohesive porous media pvps measure groundwater velocity by tracking tracer movement around the perimeter of a cylindrical probe and do not require calibration a pvp can be deployed singly or in multilevel stands and sampled repeatedly over time devlin et al 2009 2011 the probes can be constructed by hand from readily available inexpensive materials or 3d printed devlin et al 2009 walter and devlin 2017 the purpose of this work was to extend the work that developed the pvp by redesigning the probe to function in a standard commercial well the new probe referred to here as the in well pvp or iwpvp was designed with the objectives of being an inexpensive reusable tool for rapid centimeter scale in situ measurements of groundwater velocity in principle the tool is subject to the same operational limitations that apply to other in well technologies in particular those associated with the need for calibration but the iwpvp can be fabricated inexpensively and utilized with the same training and software required for other pvp instruments a further objective of this work was to use the newly designed probe in controlled laboratory tests to assess is viability and demonstrate proof of concept 2 materials and methods 2 1 probe concept it is well known that groundwater monitoring wells cause a perturbation of the local flow system drost 1983 wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 bidaux and tsang 1991 fig 1 a the contrasting permeabilities of the aquifer and the open water i e no porous medium inside the well as well as factors connected to filter packs if present and the well screen are expected to cause water to converge towards the well drost et al 1968 freeze and cherry 1979 beyond the zone of disturbance the average linear velocity of interest v applies within the well an average bulk velocity vw applies it was hypothesized in this work that a suitably designed probe could be deployed in a well and render a measureable velocity value within the probe vp which will be different from vw that could be related to the average linear velocity of groundwater in the aquifer i e vp v to test this hypothesis the iwpvp was designed fig 2 the iwpvp releases a tracer in principle a variety of tracers could be used in this work a solution of nacl is used into the central chamber of the probe and tracks it through detector channels that run from the the probe center to isolated portions of the well volume b fig 1b in the probes tested for this work each detector consisted of two stainless steel wires as described for previous pvp systems devlin et al 2009 changes in electrical conductivity of the passing groundwater were measured as voltage changes across the wires of the detectors the signals yielded breakthrough curves btc from which vp was calculated by the method of moments implemented in the free excel based software velprobepe an example breakthrough curve from an actual test is shown in fig 3 b freyberg 1986 schillig 2012 schillig et al 2016 velprobepe can also estimate vp by fitting the btc to a one dimensional solution of the advection dispersion equation but that option was not used in this work assuming the speed of water passing through the probe is proportional to the ambient groundwater velocity a linear calibration line relates the two quantities calibration lines depend on properties of the aquifer medium and the well construction so site specific calibration lines i e lines generated using site specific media and well designs will likely be required for best results kerfoot 1988 the directional component of the velocity can also be estimated based the speed and tracer distribution in the four detection channels fig 1b limiting the number of channels to four affords the possibility of determining flow direction with good accuracy while limiting the size of the cable running to the surface wires and injection lines so multilevel probe stacks can be deployed in a single borehole 2 2 experimental methods to assess the viability of the iwpvp a prototype probe was fabricated using a 3d printer and subjected to laboratory testing the prototype was designed using trimble sketchup and printed with abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic it was designed with an outside diameter o d of 4 99 cm and a height of 5 0 cm fig 2 making it suitable for use in a commercially obtained 5 15 cm inside diameter i d well screen a probe body cost less than 100 to produce on the printer additional costs were incurred to complete the fabrication including the rods e g 2 54 cm diameter schedule 40 pvc pipe to raise and lower the probe in a well and the wiring to carry detector signals to the surface in general these costs will vary depending on the intended depth to which the probe will be installed once assembled the probe can be reused indefinitely depending on restrictions that may arise due to contaminant levels in wells contributing to its cost effectiveness the detection system was manually assembled using 30 pound test stainless steel fishing lead wire a single detector consisted of a pair of wires inside a channel connected to a campbell scientific cr1000 data logger devlin et al 2009 voltage across the wires was recorded and stored at 1 s intervals the distance between the tracer source assumed the center of the central chamber and the detector wire furthest away from the chamber in the active channel 1 06 cm in each channel was used as the travel distance in the velocity calculations note a signal is only generated when the tracer reaches the more distal wire in a channel closing the circuit between the two wires of a detector all experiments were conducted with a schedule 40 pvc 0 508 mm 0 020 in slot width four slot commercial well screen installed in a sand packed nested storage tank nest aquifer simulator packed with medium grained sand the nest system has been shown to establish a uniform delivery of water through the saturated portion of the sand packed tank bowen et al 2012 the iwpvp was installed inside the well screen and the annular space around each of the channel inlets was isolated with friction fit weather stripping to initiate a test a small volume of saline tracer solution 0 1 ml in these tests was injected into the top of the central chamber because iwpvp measurements are based on the movement of the tracer in open water the system is very sensitive to density gradients and care was taken to ensure that the measured velocities were not due to density driven flow to assist in this regard a passive mixing system was designed to mix the tracer solution with ambient groundwater in the central chamber maximizing the tracer mass carried into the detector channels by flowing groundwater and minimizing tracer loss at the bottom of the probe due to density flow tracer solution that reaches the bottom of the central chamber due to density flow passes out of the probe without contacting the detector wires which are protected by raised shoes at the bases of the channels fig 2 the tracer injections were conducted through a t connector linking a 60 ml reservoir syringe and a 1 ml injection syringe both filled with the saline tracer solution schillig et al 2011 an automated syringe pump was used to deliver the small volumes of tracer 0 1 ml in each experiment manual injections are also possible and may be preferable in many applications due to simplicity however manual injections could contribute an additional source of uncertainty depending on the operator the nest was prepared by placing the well screen in the center of the empty sand tank which was subsequently filled with water and wet packed with homogeneous medium grained sand i e quikrete commercial grade medium sand with a predominant grain size range of 0 8 0 3 mm to a total depth of 25 5 cm the well screen extended the entire vertical extent of the saturated porous medium once the sand was packed around the screen the well was developed by running a surge block up and down the inside of the screen a minimum of 6 times to ensure a good hydraulic connection with the porous medium after screen development the probe was installed and oriented with one of the funneled channels aligned with the expected flow direction the pump was then turned on and flow recirculated from the receiver tank to the source tank fig 3a for a minimum of 2 h before collecting pvp signals to allow flow in the tank to reach steady state the sensitivities of velocity measurements to tracer strength 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l nacl injection volume 0 1 0 5 ml and injection times 5 30 s were evaluated experimentally and found to be low in all cases following this determination the bulk of the tests were performed with tracer injections set to 0 10 ml pulses administered over a period of ten seconds using a 0 25 g l nacl solution in any given experiment the average expected seepage velocity in the nest was determined from pumping rate measurements before and after every iwpvp test using the following equation 2 v q a n where q is the pump discharge cm3 min a is the cross section area of the sand packed storage tank cm2 and n is the effective porosity dimensionless pumping rates were determined by measuring the volume of water pumped over a period of 1 min using a graduated cylinder after each pumping rate measurement was complete a minimum of five minutes was allowed for the flow rate through the sand to re equilibrate before another measurement was initiated to avoid possible interference between tests additionally water collected during pumping rate measurements was held until all tests were completed at that pumping rate once the tests were completed the water was added back to the upstream reservoir tank and the pumping rate was adjusted for the next set of tests this was followed by a period of flow stabilization that lasted at least 45 min four replicate measurements at each tank velocity were made to determine the measurement precision 2 3 numerical simulations a 2 d steady state numerical model of a probe inside an open borehole representing a well emplaced in a porous media was created using the free and porous media flow package in comsol multiphysics which permitted flow in granular porous media in the open water inside the well and inside the probe to be modeled within the same domain fig 4 https www comsol com due to the 2 d nature of the model the simulations represent flow in a single slice through the center of the borehole in the nest therefore the model did not account for flow resistance arising from the slotted nature of the well screen i e alternating open and closed segments the porous medium tank was modeled to match the experimental set up 35 0 cm by 54 cm and with the properties of homogeneous sand comsol input permeability 1e 7 cm2 10 darcy and effective porosity 0 33 the well was represented as a 5 08 cm o d circle containing open water in which the effects of turbulent flow could be simulated within the circle of open water the probe was simulated as symmetrically arranged solid blocks with zero permeability fig 4 the left side of the domain was defined as a constant velocity boundary using values representative of the laboratory experiments the right boundary was defined as a free exit boundary the boundaries running parallel to the flow direction were defined as no flow boundaries 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical modeling several simulations were performed to examine the relationship between seepage velocities in the sand and velocities measured by the probe since the probe operates in open water in the well there was a possibility that non darcian flow in the probe could render the probe s response to variations in seepage velocity nonlinear zeng and grigg 2006 an important finding of these simulations was that linearity was preserved over the range of velocities examined v 48 cm day 400 cm day thus the effects of turbulent flow in the well and probe were predicted to be negligible under these conditions a second notable finding was that the velocities that developed in the probe vp were calculated to be considerably greater than the seepage velocities in the saturated sand v specifically the correlation between these sets of velocities was found to be linear r2 1 00 with a slope of 18 6 fig 5 3 2 measurement of horizontal velocities an experimental evaluation of the iwpvp was undertaken under conditions similar to those represented in the numerical modeling work as described in the preceding section tests were performed with velocities in the sand tank between 48 and 400 cm day the test well was assembled with a commercial well screen that comprised four columns of slots with slot openings of 0 508 mm 20 the precision of the probe measurements was found to average 7 i e one standard deviation based on tests conducted in quadruplicate fig 5 the accuracy of the probe measurements was assessed using the methodology described by devlin 1996 and was found to range from approximately 40 tank velocities 48 cm day to about 10 15 tank velocities 300 cm day at 95 confidence better accuracy at low flow rates may be possible if calibrations are conducted with reliably lower pumping rates the accuracy of the probe was assessed further by comparing experimental calibration lines to the one produced in the modeled simulations fig 5 experimentally the four column screen i e four vertical columns of slots was found to produce a linear calibration line consistent with the simulations in the first of these experiments the calibration line was found to exhibit a slope of 6 2 which was less than the slope

was a 20 four column screen similar to the well screen utilized in the current experiments the resistance factor reported for that well screen was 58 i e the calibration line slope magnification factor mf must be corrected by a factor of 1 0 58 0 42 kerfoot and massard 1985 it should be noted that their resistance factor applies to a well packed with a glass bead porous medium which was required for the operation of their heat pulse flowmeter thus the resistance factor could reflect the effects of the screen the glass beads or both furthermore this factor applies to an ideal screen

an appropriate initial estimate correcting the flow rates predicted by the model by 42 resulted in a calibration line with a slope of 7 8 which compares quite favorably to the experimental data fig 5 the repeatability of tests and sensitivity of iwpvp velocity measurements to well screen conditions was further investigated by conducting two additional tests in independently packed tanks the same installation methods and velocity ranges were used in all tests however in the third of these experiments the weather stripping packers were replaced with brushes the modification made the probe

7508,permeability decline associated with the migration of natural reservoir fines impairs the well index of injection and production wells in aquifers and oilfields in this study we perform laboratory corefloods using aqueous solutions with different salinities in engineered rocks with different kaolinite content yielding fines migration and permeability alteration unusual permeability growth has been observed at high salinities in rocks with low kaolinite concentrations this has been attributed to permeability increase during particle detachment and re attachment of already mobilised fines by electrostatic attraction to the rock in stagnant zones of the porous space we refine the traditional model for fines migration by adding mathematical expressions for the particle re attachment rate particle detachment with delay relative to salinity decrease and the attached concentration dependency of permeability a one dimensional flow problem that accounts for those three

porosity subscripts 0 initial value or condition 1 introduction detachment and straining of suspension colloidal particles during flow in natural reservoirs and engineered porous media occur in numerous natural and technological processes in environmental chemical and petroleum engineering as well as in geology some of the primary applications include drilling fluid invasion into subsurface formations propagation of viruses and bacteria in subterranean waters storage of fresh or hot water in aquifers migration of fines in the vadose zone irrigation of plants industrial filtering waste disposal in aquifers and water waste management water injection into oilfields re injection or disposal of produced water in oilfields and aquifers and size exclusion chromatography civan 2007 kaplan and muñoz carpena 2014 tiab and donaldson 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 detachment and straining of suspension colloidal particles with consequent variation in rock permeability yield significant hydraulic flux changes for the above mentioned processes bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford and torkzaban 2008 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2011 yakirevich et al 2013 yu et al 2012 yuan et al 2016 the most common predictive tool to manage and optimise the above processes is laboratory based mathematical modelling determining the particle exchange rate and formation damage coefficients from laboratory corefloods or column tests upscaling these values and then using them in predictive modelling allows for successful drilling fluid loss control geophysical interpretation of drilling fluid invasion profiles forecasting of aquifer contamination design of water filtration or treatment technologies for environmental protection water resource management injected and disposed water management in oilfields and management of production and injection artesian wells civan 2007 hayek 2014 2015 tiab and donaldson 2015 a schematic of particle arrangement in the pore space including suspended particles in the carrier water and attached strained and re attached fine particles at the liquid matrix interface is shown in fig 1 a here σa and σs are the concentrations of attached and strained particles respectively defined as the number of attached and strained particles per unit of rock volume the concentration c of suspended particles is defined as the number of suspended particles per unit of the pore volume the suspended particles are transported by the carrier fluid with flux u fig 1b shows the forces acting on the attached particles here the drag force fd and lift force fl act to detach the particles whereas the electrostatic force fe acts to maintain the particles to the rock surface the gravitational force fg can be either detaching or attaching depending on the particle position on the grain two scanning electron microscope sem photographs of kaolinite clay fines attached to the grain surface in sandstones are presented in fig 2 fig 2a demonstrates the thin and flat shape of the kaolinite particles as a result of their shape attached kaolinite particles tend to have a small effect on the flow within pores consequently particle detachment is not expected to result in a noticeable rise in permeability on the contrary plugging of a pore with a throat thinner than the leaflet cuts off the flow path diverts the flow into other unplugged pores increases flow tortuosity and thus yields significant permeability reduction fig 2b shows two pore throats plugged by kaolinite fines these effects cause significant reduction of petroleum and artesian well productivity and have been widely presented in the literature khilar and fogler 1998 muecke 1979 moreover fines migration is one of the main causes for formation damage in aquifers and petroleum reservoirs civan 2007 the condition of mechanical equilibrium of a fine particle on the rock surface is an equality of the attaching and detaching torques bergendahl and grasso 2000 bradford et al 2013 1 f d u l d f l u l n f e γ ph f g l n here ld and ln are the tangential and normal lever arms u is the flow velocity and γ is the ionic strength of the injected solute the velocity dependencies of the drag and lift forces and the ph and ionic strength dependency of the electrostatic force for fine particles in sandstones can be deduced from the explicit expressions for these forces bergendahl and grasso 2000 derjaguin and landau 1941 elimelech et al 1995 gregory 1981 takahashi and kovscek 2010 torkzaban et al 2013 it follows that increasing the flow velocity or ph or decreasing the fluid salinity shifts the torque balance equilibrium towards particle detachment the lever arm ln is given by hertz s theory and is a function of the young s moduli and poisson ratios of both the grain and the attached particle bradford et al 2013 the torque balance equation allows determining whether any particle on the grain surface will be mobilised by the flow with velocity u ph and salinity γ this criterion enables the determination of the maximum attached particle concentration for given conditions of ph u and γ the resulting function of attached concentration depends on the flow velocity ph and fluid salinity and is called the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 2 σ a σ cr γ u ph where σcr is the above described maximum retention function for the condition of constant u and ph the maximum retention function is a function of γ only the maximum retention function given by eq 2 is a mathematical model for fines detachment due to an increase in velocity a decrease in salinity and or an increase in ph it is a phenomenological function that depends on the rock and particle geometry and mineralogy this phenomenological function substitutes the kinetics equation for simultaneous particle attachment and detachment in the classical filtration theory khilar and fogler 1998 tufenkji 2007 several limitations arise when calculating the maximum retention function for instance the use of hertz s theory is valid only for smooth surfaces kalantariasl and bedrikovetsky 2013 in addition the pore space geometry will also influence the lever arms in eq 1 accounting for these effects yields more complex formulae for forces and lever arms than those presented by schechter 1992 regardless of the complexity with which the input variables are calculated the torque balance expressed by eq 1 holds for the general case of colloidal flow yielding the phenomenological relationship given by eq 2 the mathematical model for fines mobilisation migration and straining includes a mass balance equation for attached suspended and strained particles a kinetics rate equation for straining and a modified version of darcy s law that accounts for permeability decline due to particle straining bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 tufenkji 2007 3 ϕ c σ s σ a t u s c x 0

significantly lower than the fluid velocity u oliveira et al 2014 eqs 5 6 reflect the idea that the permeability is only altered by particle straining fines attachment occurs where the attaching torque in eq 1 exceeds the detaching torque which corresponds to an attached concentration below the value of the maximum retention function otherwise the attaching torque is lower than the detaching torque and thus particle detachment occurs in this case the attached concentration is equal to the value of the maximum retention function as such particle detachment will occur due to changes in γ u and or ph as per the dependency of the maximum retention function on these variables you et al 2015 the kinetics of particle attachment detachment can then be expressed as 7 σ a t λ cu σ a σ cr γ u ph

γ 1 when decreasing the salinity from γ0 to γ1 the attached concentration decreases by δσcr and the mobilised particles yield an increase in the suspended concentration by δσcr ϕ the maximum retention function is a monotonically increasing function of γ which describes the particle detachment induced by the reduction of the fluid salinity eq 4 demonstrates the monotonic growth of the strained particle concentration during colloidal flows therefore eq 6 exhibits monotonic permeability decline numerous data on the monotonic decline of permeability and well index due to fines migration are available civan 2007 tiab and donaldson 2015 several laboratory and field studies have exhibited permeability increase due to the detachment of small size particles in high permeability sandstones but a mathematical model describing this phenomenon has yet to be developed civan 2007 ju et al 2007 the experimental study performed in the present work reveals non monotonic permeability variation during fines migration an unusual increase in the core permeability during fines migration was observed with high salinity water injections into cores with low kaolinite contents the novelty of this work is the explanation and modelling of the non monotonic permeability variation phenomenon by accounting for the re attachment of mobilised fines in low velocity pore regions and by the attached concentration dependency of permeability in order to capture the permeability growth phenomenon the independent effects of attached and strained concentrations on permeability have been introduced into the traditional mathematical model for suspension colloidal flows in porous media the proposed model was compared with the experimental results to evaluate whether the model reflects the observed phenomenon of non monotonic permeability variation 2 materials and methods this section presents the experimental study of fines migration and permeability variation during the injection of water with piecewise decreasing salinity 2 1 laboratory set up the laboratory set up consists of the reservoir model core holder with the porous specimen injection pump pressure transmitters particle counter and personal computer fig 3 a shows a photograph of the set up with the main components highlighted fig 3b is a detailed schematic of the set up with all components clearly labelled water with fixed γ is injected by the pump into the core with a constant flow rate pressure is monitored continuously by differential pressure transmitters and recorded in the personal computer fluid samples are collected at the core outlet and are analysed using the particle counter to determine the suspended particle concentration 2 2 methodology for the preparation of the artificial cores silica sand sibelco 50 n sibelco australia and kaolinite powder sigma aldrich australia were used the vast majority of kaolinite particles have sizes varying from 0 7 to 11 μm kaolinite was dried at 60 c for 1 h prior to preparation of unconsolidated kaolinite sand mixture to remove excess water before the use of sand in unconsolidated core samples the sand grains were cleaned of organic and inorganic impurities by washing in hexane acetone deionised water 0 5 m mol m 3 10 3 hydrochloric acid and deionised water the sand was then dried for 6 h at 60 c to remove excess water the measured particle size distribution for the processed sand had a minimum and maximum size of 60 3 and 316 μm respectively with a mean size of 134 μm the large disparity between the sand and kaolinite size distributions implies that the sand will comprise the rock matrix while the kaolinite will remain attached to the sand subject to the flow conditions each sand clay mixture was prepared and mixed while dry the kaolinite sand mixture was then wet slightly with a 0 6 m nacl solution to attach the kaolinite particles to the sand grains wet compaction was used to achieve a higher degree of homogeneity with one distributor and end cap loosely fastened to the core holder and viton sleeve the mixture was transferred into the core block with a spatula compression of the core was generated by screwing both end caps to a set position which determines the fixed length of the unconsolidated core five artificial sandstone cores with kaolinite mass fractions 1 3 5 7 and 10 were packed and consolidated the compaction procedure consisted of both axial and radial components to enhance the reproducibility of the flow properties of each core the sequential injections of sodium chloride and water solutions with ionic strength 0 6 m 0 3 m 0 1 m 0 05 m 0 01 m 0 001 m and deionised water were performed for each core the pressure drop across the core and effluent fine concentrations were measured during the experiment injection of each solution in all cores was carried out until stabilisation of the pressure drop across the core was achieved in order to verify that the kaolinite distribution along the core was uniform a separate test on a core with 5 kaolinite was performed the core was injected with a 0 6 m nacl solution until permeability stabilisation was achieved following this the core was cut into five pieces the kaolinite concentration in each piece was measured using ultrasonication and sedimentation to separate the kaolinite and sand the kaolinite concentration in each section varied between 4 86 and 5 16 3 experimental results this section presents the experimental results and considers various physical explanations of the observed results initial stabilisation of core permeability was reached after the injection of 149 pore volumes for the core with 1 kaolinite the number of pore volumes injected pvi will be used further in the text as a dimensionless unit of time the stabilisation times for the 3 5 7 and 10 kaolinite cores were 142 pvi 222 pvi 401 pvi and 498 pvi respectively the collection of kaolinite at the effluent occurred continuously during the stabilisation of permeability during these stabilisation periods the following amounts of kaolinite were recovered from the effluent streams 0 0035 g of kaolinite 0 41 of the total kaolinite in the 1 kaolinite core 0 0094 g of kaolinite 0 37 of the total kaolinite in the 3 kaolinite core 0 0034 g of kaolinite 0 80 of the total kaolinite in the 5 kaolinite core 0 0042 g of kaolinite 0 07 of the total kaolinite in the 7 kaolinite core and 0 0090 g of kaolinite 0 11 of the total kaolinite in the 10 kaolinite core the stabilised initial permeability and corresponding mean pore radii are presented in fig 4 a for each core the mean pore radii have been calculated based on the initial permeability and porosity using the expression r p 5 k ϕ barenblatt et al 1989 fig 4b shows the stabilised permeability values at the end of each injection for the five cores figs 5a 9a present the impedance variation during each injection of constant salinity water and figs 5b 9b show the corresponding accumulated breakthrough concentrations cacc the permeability decreased monotonically during injection of water with piecewise constant decreasing γ for high kaolinite content cores 5 7 and 10 whereas permeability increased in cores with a low concentration of kaolinite 1 and 3 at high salinities usually monotonic permeability decline is observed due to straining of fine particles that are mobilised by low salinity water khilar and fogler 1998 muecke 1979 rosenbrand et al 2014 on the contrary here non monotonic permeability curves were observed fines migration can cause both permeability increase due to particle detachment and permeability decrease due to particle straining the increase in permeability tends to be negligible compared to the permeability decrease and is therefore omitted from models khilar and fogler 1998 mays and hunt 2005 2007 the current study found significant permeability increase fig 4b which indicates that both effects must be accounted for if particle detachment occurred instantaneously upon arrival of low salinity water all observed increases in permeability would occur prior to the low salinity fronts reaching the outlet this would correspond to the injection of one pore volume of fluid however periods of permeability increase sometimes persisted for significantly longer than 1 pvi figs 5a 9a this effect could be attributed to a delay in the particle mobilisation that results from a change in fluid salinity this delay can be explained by nernst plank diffusion which governs the transfer of ions between a bulk solution and the particle rock contact area following the injection of low salinity water the electrostatic force will decrease as ions diffuse out of the particle rock contact area into the bulk solution the electrostatic influence of the grain and particle will significantly slow the rate of ion diffusion hence delaying the change in the electrostatic force this effect could explain the delay in detachment mahani et al 2015a b as part of the holistic approach to modelling fines migration we introduced a secondary particle deposition mechanism particle re attachment to grains by electrostatic attraction this process is likely to occur in regions of the pore space where velocity is low and hence particle transport to these regions will be driven by diffusion the likelihood of particle re attachment is governed primarily by the form of the electrostatic potential energy for the interaction between particle and grain attached particles reside at distances from the grain where the electrostatic potential energy is minimum the transition from favourable to unfavourable conditions for attachment occurs when an energy barrier appears blocking entry into the primary minimum elimelech et al 1995 for the conditions of the current test the energy barrier was predicted to appear between salinities of 0 6 m and 0 1 m this study did not attempt to accurately quantify the likelihood of particle attachment at any salinity as this would require modelling the effects of surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity on electrostatic interactions bradford et al 2013 re attachment is not likely to influence permeability directly but it will remove some particles from the suspended particle population that might otherwise have strained elsewhere the competition of straining and re attachment for suspended particles also explains why permeability increase was observed only in low kaolinite cores as was reasoned earlier the kaolinite particles fill the pore space in between the sand grains therefore the larger the concentration of attached kaolinite the smaller the pore throats which explains why kaolinite content and initial permeability are inversely related fig 4a the abundance of larger pore throats in low kaolinite cores means that the straining probability will be lower and that suspended particles will on average travel further through low kaolinite cores than through high kaolinite cores the further particles travel the more likely that they will encounter pore spaces appropriate for re attachment as such re attachment is most likely for low kaolinite cores at high salinity which is where an increase in permeability was observed during the coreflooding tests this explanation will be supported by the mathematical modelling performed in the next two sections 4 mathematical model in the current section we introduce the modified mathematical model for fines migration in porous media if compared with the conventional model given by eqs 2 6 the proposed model accounts for permeability increase during particle detachment and for mobilised particle re attachment the new model also considers delayed particle detachment the one dimensional 1d problem for injection of particle free water allows for an exact analytical solution 4 1 assumptions of the model following the explanation of non monotonic permeability variation presented in section 3 the term of the re attachment rate is introduced into mass balance equation eq 3 attached concentration dependency is accounted for in equation for permeability damage eq 6 and delay in particle detachment is introduced in the maximum retention function given by eq 2 the modified model accounts for four different populations of particles particles attached to the grain surface particles suspended in the fluid particles strained in thin pore throats and particles re attached to the grain surface in dead end pores or stagnant pore zones figs 1a 2 including two different populations of attached particles reflect the pore scale variance of flow properties within porous media this model assumes only two states for attached particles one where the particles reduce the permeability and can be detached by the drag force and another where particles are irreversibly attached but have no effect on the permeability fig 1a this discrimination is made on the basis that the flow velocity at the site of re attachment is significantly lower than for attached particles a lower u means that re attached particles have a smaller effect on the rock permeability and are less likely to detach a complete model would recognise the full stochastic nature of both fluid velocity and particle size within porous media to summarise initially attached particles can remain attached to the pore surface or detach to become suspended in the carrier fluid suspended particles can either migrate freely through the porous space strain in thin pore throats or re attach to the grain surface strained and re attached particles cannot re enter the suspension flow as such the processes of straining and re attachment are irreversible straining can be reversible if the direction of flow is reversed however this effect is not discussed in this paper for consistency with long stabilisation times it will be assumed that the fluid and particles travel through the pore space at different velocities the rolling and sliding of particles along the grain surfaces are likely to decrease the ratio between particle velocity and fluid velocity and this effect will be incorporated into the model the ratio of particle velocity to fluid velocity is assumed to be constant for all particles during a single injection cycle another key assumption of the model is that the fluid salinity at all points in the core changes instantaneously to the injected salinity at t 0 the consequence of this is that particle detachment begins immediately at all points in the core for fines migration induced by decreasing the injected salinity the detachment of particles should at its earliest begin when the injected fluid front reaches that section of the porous media the assumption of instantaneous salinity change contradicts this notion and thus introduces an error for the region ahead of the injected salinity front which ceases to exist after 1 pvi due to the low particle velocity us u and the timing of each injection cycle in the current tests t 100 pvi the region where an error is induced by this assumption comprises only a small section of the total injection period and so this error is considered acceptable additional assumptions of the model are incompressibility of the carrier fluid and suspended particles additivity of particle and water volumes during mixing capture and re attachment amagat s law the attached concentration approaches the maximum retention value with delay implying that linear kinetics for particle detachment apply and permeability dependence of both attached and strained concentrations the concentrations of strained and re attached particles are assumed to be negligible when compared to the concentration of corresponding vacancies which implies that the filtration and formation damage coefficients for straining and re attachment can be assumed to be constant 4 2 governing equations mass conservation of the four above mentioned types of particles in porous media is defined by the following equation bedrikovetsky 1993 zheng et al 2014 9 ϕ c σ s σ a t u s c x λ cu s where λ is the filtration coefficient for particle re attachment here as in the case of straining given by eq 4 we assume that increasing of either suspension concentration or rate n times increases the supply of suspended particles to vacancies thin pores attachment sites in grain surfaces etc n times so the re attachment rate also increases n times therefore the re attachment rate is given by the classical filtration theory as proportional to the suspended particle flux cu bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 tufenkji 2007 consequently the term on the right hand side of eq 9 corresponds to the particle re attachment rate the particle detachment rate after an instant salinity change from γ0 to γ1 is determined by the delay between the attached particle concentration and the value of the maximum retention concentration bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 10 τ σ a t σ cr γ 1 σ a where τ is the delay time eq 10 tends to the equation for instant detachment eq 2 with the delay time tending to zero the kinetics equation eq 10

separates from the rest of the system and as such eqs 4 9 10 are solved for unknowns c σa σs and p x t is consequently determined from eq 13 4 3 formulation of one dimensional problem let us formulate the 1d problem for injection of particle free water with salinity γ1 into a core saturated with particle free water with salinity γ0 and no strained particles first we introduce the following

eqs 19 20 simulates each stage of the constant salinity injection with decreasing γ figs 5 9 the initial strained concentration at each stage is equal to that accumulated at the end of the previous stage i e ss x t 0 adds from stage to stage it is assumed that the injection time is sufficiently high for the core to be in equilibrium with the injected salinity and for all detached particles to have either been captured or have left the core as such the initial attached concentration in each stage corresponds to the value of the maximum retention function at the injected salinity of the previous stage and the initial suspended concentration is zero 5 analytical model for fines migration with non monotonic permeability variation in the current section the exact solution for the 1d

λ 100 1 m respectively the higher is the re attachment filtration coefficient λ the lower is the breakthrough concentration the suspended concentration is highly sensitive to variation of the re attachment filtration coefficient the pressure drop increases by a convex curve during the decrease of suspended concentration fig 10b the continuous red curve shows the pressure drop across the first core section where the intermediate pressure point is an intermediate port in the core fig 11 presents the concentration profiles for suspended attached and strained particles ahead of the concentration front the mobilisation re attachment and straining rates are independent of x the initial suspended concentration is zero and is thus also uniform therefore the suspended particle concentration along the core ahead of the concentration front is independent of x fig 11a behind the concentration front the suspended concentration increases from zero at the core inlet up to the value at the concentration front the suspended particles ahead of the concentration front are size excluded with the same rate and consequently the strained concentration is also independent of x fig 11b continuous accumulation of strained particles occurs behind the concentration front from the assumption that the salinity changes immediately at all points in the core it follows that the attached concentration is independent of x fig 11c 6 results matching the measured pressure drop and breakthrough concentration curves obtained during injection periods in the tests performed on five cores

two porous media at two injected salinities are presented in table 3 the tuned values of parameters βs δσcr α and λs which are present in the traditional models lie within ranges typically reported in the literature al abduwani et al 2005a b bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 mays and hunt 2005 2007 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 the five presented matched cases all exhibit a high coefficient of determination r2 figs 12 and 13 present four matched impedance curves and the measurement uncertainties the traditional formulation of the dimensionless pressure drop j includes the ratio of injected velocities this ratio is equal to one for these tests due to the constant injection rate nonetheless the generalised form of impedance has been used to calculate uncertainties as a means to account for small variations in injection rate during the tests the details of uncertainty calculations for the coreflooding setup can be found in badalyan et al 2014 and you et al 2014 figs 12 and 13 show that the modelling curves which correspond to the tuned values in table 3 generally lie within the uncertainty bounds 7 discussion modifications to existing models should be limited to those necessary to capture additional physical effects any new model should introduce as few supplementary parameters as possible let us show that the three modifications to the traditional model as presented in section 4 3 comprise a minimum model or rather that the observed physical phenomena could not be modelled with fewer modifications a during the injection of low salinity water the attached concentration decreases and the strained concentration increases therefore the initial permeability growth with further decline is described by the permeability as a function of both attached and strained concentrations b the permeability increase caused by particle detachment naturally corresponds to an increase in the radius of pores within the porous media additionally it has been demonstrated that particle detachment induced by decreasing γ causes particles to detach in order of decreasing size you et al 2015 as such the jamming ratio rs rp will decrease over time which will lead to a decrease in the straining probability or straining filtration coefficient thus when permeability increases as was observed during the initial stages of several tests in this study consideration of only particle sizes would suggest that permeability is only more likely to increase with further decreases to the injected salinity however we found that at lower salinities all five cores experienced a decline in permeability this suggests that an additional salinity dependent particle capture mechanism such as particle re attachment is required c instant particle detachment would imply that the highest permeability during any injection cycle must be observed during the first injected pore volume because increases in permeability would occur only during this time this was not the case in our tests a delay in particle detachment would allow for a permeability maximum to occur at later stages of the injection as was observed introduction of the three new physical effects into the traditional model given by eqs 2 6 results in three new constants βa λ and τ the corresponding dimensionless variables are βa λ and ε the traditional model contains four constants α βs δscr and λs and consequently the modified model contains seven constant empirical parameters introducing additional constants increases the degrees of freedom of the model which can add uncertainty to the fitting process the uncertainty in tuning the model could be decreased by measuring the differential pressure between the core inlet and some intermediate point in addition to the full core measurement this is referred to as the three point pressure method and has been established previously bedrikovetsky et al 2001 vaz et al 2017 the solution of the 1d flow problem presented in table 1 is not self similar and consequently an intermediate differential pressure is not obtainable from the total differential pressure by a length scaling transformation and as such will provide additional degrees of freedom to the data the continuous red curve in fig 10b corresponds to the pressure drop across the first core section versus time as predicted by the analytical model for typical values of the model parameters the dashed red curve presenting the pressure drop across the half core versus 2 t that corresponds to self similarity differs from that for the overall core as such the pressure drop across the first core section presents additional information to the pressure drop across the overall core which can be used for improvement of the tuning of the coefficients by matching the model in addition chemical analysis could be done on the core following the coreflooding to determine the total in situ particle concentration the total retained concentration is 34 σ t x σ s x σ a x σ ra x where σt and σra are the total and re attached concentrations of retained particles respectively the total retained concentration is easily computed using the model and such analysis could provide additional degrees of freedom to the dataset computer tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance are alternative methods to measure this concentration profile their distinct advantage is that they can be run several times during the coreflooding process rather than only once following the coreflooding these methods could provide a significant improvement to the model tuning al abduwani et al 2005a b non monotonic behaviour can be observed not only for stabilised permeability values as in fig 4b but also during a constant salinity injection stage for most of the tests the impedance curves were monotonic during each injection stage the decreasing impedance curves correspond to the dominance of the fines release and re attachment effects over the straining effect the increasing curves correspond to straining dominance however in several cases the impedance curves during constant salinity injections were non monotonic injection of 0 001 m solute and of deionised water in fig 5 and injection of 0 1 m solute in fig 7 we attribute the initial permeability rise to particle detachment and the following permeability decline to particle straining the main result of the work is close agreement between the derived analytical model and the obtained laboratory data which allows concluding that the proposed model captures the experimentally observed phenomena the model coefficients obtained by tuning can be used for laboratory based predictions at the reservoir scale 8 conclusions mathematical modelling of fines migration in porous media with different clay compositions during the injection of fluid with decreasing salinity followed by comparing the model to laboratory results allow drawing the following conclusions 1 in contrast to the traditional permeability decline resulting from a decrease in the injected water salinity some permeability growth can occur at low kaolinite concentrations and high salinities 2 this effect is explained by a the straining filtration coefficient being small at low concentrations of kaolinite so the permeability decrease due to straining is lower than the increase resulting from particle detachment b at high salinities the mobilised fines can be re attached to the rock surface in a stagnant zone where they can be brought by diffusion the re attachment decreases the suspended concentration and consequently decreases the extent of particle straining 3 augmenting the traditional mathematical model by non equilibrium particle release in eq 2 permeability damage by particle attachment in eq 6 and particle re attachment in eq 3 captures the effect of non monotonic permeability variation during fines migration under salinity decrease 4 the one dimensional problem of slow particle migration with delayed particle release after salinity alteration and accounting for re attachment of particles allows for an exact analytical solution 5 the analytical model contains explicit formulae for suspended attached and strained concentrations of particles and for pressure drop history 6 the proposed model predicts non monotonic permeability variation during decreasing salinity injection 7 the model exhibits high agreement with the experimental data

7508,permeability decline associated with the migration of natural reservoir fines impairs the well index of injection and production wells in aquifers and oilfields in this study we perform laboratory corefloods using aqueous solutions with different salinities in engineered rocks with different kaolinite content yielding fines migration and permeability alteration unusual permeability growth has been observed at high salinities in rocks with low kaolinite concentrations this has been attributed to permeability increase during particle detachment and re attachment of already mobilised fines by electrostatic attraction to the rock in stagnant zones of the porous space we refine the traditional model for fines migration by adding mathematical expressions for the particle re attachment rate particle detachment with delay relative to salinity decrease and the attached concentration dependency of permeability a one dimensional flow problem that accounts for those three effects allows for an exact analytical solution the modified model captures the observed effect of permeability increase at high water salinities in rocks with low kaolinite concentrations the

porosity subscripts 0 initial value or condition 1 introduction detachment and straining of suspension colloidal particles during flow in natural reservoirs and engineered porous media occur in numerous natural and technological processes in environmental chemical and petroleum engineering as well as in geology some of the primary applications include drilling fluid invasion into subsurface formations propagation of viruses and bacteria in subterranean waters storage of fresh or hot water in aquifers migration of fines in the vadose zone irrigation of plants industrial filtering waste disposal in aquifers and water waste management water injection into oilfields re injection or disposal of produced water in oilfields and aquifers and size exclusion chromatography civan 2007 kaplan and muñoz carpena 2014 tiab and donaldson 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 detachment and straining of suspension colloidal particles with consequent variation in rock permeability yield significant hydraulic flux changes for the above mentioned processes bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford and torkzaban 2008 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2015 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2011 yakirevich et al 2013 yu et al 2012 yuan et al 2016 the most common predictive tool to manage and optimise the above processes is laboratory based mathematical modelling determining the particle exchange rate and formation damage coefficients from laboratory corefloods or column tests upscaling these values and then using them in predictive modelling allows

environmental protection water resource management injected and disposed water management in oilfields and management of production and injection artesian wells civan 2007 hayek 2014 2015 tiab and donaldson 2015 a schematic of particle arrangement in the pore space including suspended particles in the carrier water and attached strained and re attached fine particles at the liquid matrix interface is shown in fig 1 a here σa and σs are the concentrations of attached and strained particles respectively defined as the number of attached and strained particles per unit of rock volume the concentration c of suspended particles is defined as the number of suspended particles per unit of the pore volume the suspended particles are transported by the carrier fluid with flux u fig 1b shows the forces acting on the attached particles here the drag force fd and lift force fl act to detach the particles whereas the electrostatic force fe acts to maintain the particles to the rock surface the gravitational force fg can be either detaching or attaching depending on the particle position on the grain two scanning electron microscope sem photographs of kaolinite clay fines attached to the grain surface in sandstones are presented in fig 2 fig 2a demonstrates the thin and flat shape of the kaolinite particles as a result of their shape attached kaolinite particles tend to have a small effect on the flow within pores consequently particle detachment is not expected to result in a noticeable rise in permeability on the contrary plugging of a pore with a throat thinner than the leaflet cuts off the flow path diverts the flow into other unplugged pores increases flow tortuosity and thus yields significant permeability reduction fig 2b shows two pore throats plugged by kaolinite fines these effects cause significant reduction of petroleum and artesian well productivity and have been widely presented in the literature khilar and fogler 1998 muecke 1979 moreover fines migration is one of the main causes for formation damage in aquifers and petroleum reservoirs civan 2007 the condition of mechanical equilibrium of a fine particle on the rock surface is an equality of the attaching and detaching torques bergendahl and grasso 2000 bradford et al 2013 1 f d u l d f l u l n f e γ ph f g l n here ld and ln are the tangential and normal lever arms u is the flow velocity and γ is the ionic strength of the injected solute the velocity dependencies of the drag and lift forces and the ph and ionic strength dependency of the electrostatic force for fine particles in sandstones can be deduced from the explicit expressions for these forces bergendahl and grasso 2000 derjaguin and landau 1941 elimelech et al 1995 gregory 1981 takahashi and kovscek 2010 torkzaban et al 2013 it follows that increasing the flow velocity or ph or decreasing the fluid salinity shifts the torque balance equilibrium towards particle detachment the lever arm ln is given by hertz s theory and is a function of the young s moduli and poisson ratios of both the grain and the attached particle bradford et al 2013 the torque balance equation allows determining whether any particle on the grain surface will be mobilised by the flow with velocity u ph and salinity γ this criterion enables the determination of the maximum attached particle concentration for given conditions of ph u and γ the resulting function of attached concentration depends on the flow velocity ph and fluid salinity and is called the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 2 σ a σ cr γ u ph where σcr is the above described maximum retention function for the condition of constant u and ph the maximum retention function is a function of γ only the maximum retention function given by eq 2 is a mathematical model for fines detachment due to an increase in velocity a decrease in salinity and or an increase in ph it is a phenomenological function that depends on the rock and particle geometry and mineralogy this phenomenological function substitutes the kinetics equation for simultaneous particle attachment and detachment in the classical filtration theory khilar and fogler 1998 tufenkji 2007 several limitations arise when calculating the maximum retention function for instance the use of hertz s theory is valid only for smooth surfaces kalantariasl and bedrikovetsky 2013 in addition the pore space geometry will also influence the lever arms in eq 1 accounting for these effects yields more complex formulae for forces and lever arms than those presented by schechter 1992 regardless of the complexity with which the input variables are calculated the torque balance expressed by eq 1 holds for the general case of colloidal flow yielding the phenomenological relationship given by eq 2 the mathematical model for fines mobilisation migration and straining includes a mass balance equation for attached suspended and strained particles a kinetics rate equation for straining and a modified version of darcy s law that accounts for permeability decline due to particle straining bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 tufenkji 2007 3 ϕ c σ s σ a t u s c x 0

significantly lower than the fluid velocity u oliveira et al 2014 eqs 5 6 reflect the idea that the permeability is only altered by particle straining fines attachment occurs where the attaching torque in eq 1 exceeds the detaching torque which corresponds to an attached concentration below the value of the maximum retention function otherwise the attaching torque is lower than the detaching torque and thus particle detachment occurs in this case the attached concentration is equal to the value of the maximum retention function as such particle detachment will occur due to changes in γ u and or ph as per the dependency of the maximum retention function on these variables you et al 2015 the kinetics of particle attachment detachment can then be expressed as 7 σ a t λ cu σ a σ cr γ u ph

2004 bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford and torkzaban 2008 bradford et al 2013 tufenkji 2007 the concentration of released particles after salinity alteration from γ0 to γ1 is 8 δ σ cr σ cr γ 0 σ cr γ 1 when decreasing the salinity from γ0 to γ1 the attached concentration decreases by δσcr and the mobilised particles yield an increase in the suspended concentration by δσcr ϕ the maximum retention function is a monotonically increasing function of γ which describes the particle detachment induced by the reduction of the fluid salinity eq 4 demonstrates the monotonic growth of the strained particle concentration during colloidal flows therefore eq 6 exhibits monotonic permeability decline numerous data on the monotonic decline of permeability and well index due to fines migration are available civan 2007 tiab and donaldson 2015 several laboratory and field studies have exhibited permeability increase due to the detachment of small size particles in high permeability sandstones but a mathematical model describing this phenomenon has yet to be developed civan 2007 ju et al 2007 the experimental study performed in the present work reveals non monotonic permeability variation during fines migration an unusual increase in the core permeability during fines migration was observed with high salinity water injections into cores with low kaolinite contents the novelty of this work is the explanation and modelling of the non monotonic permeability variation phenomenon by accounting for the re attachment of mobilised fines in low velocity pore regions and by the attached concentration dependency of permeability in order to capture the permeability growth phenomenon the independent effects of attached and strained concentrations on permeability have been introduced into the traditional mathematical model for suspension colloidal flows in porous media the proposed model was compared with the experimental results to evaluate whether the model reflects the observed phenomenon of non monotonic permeability variation 2 materials and methods this section presents the experimental study of fines migration and permeability variation during the injection of water with piecewise decreasing salinity 2 1 laboratory set up the laboratory set up consists of the reservoir model core holder with the porous specimen injection pump pressure transmitters particle counter and personal computer fig 3 a shows a photograph of the set up with the main components highlighted fig 3b is a detailed schematic of the set up with all components clearly labelled water with fixed γ is injected by the pump into the core with a constant flow rate pressure is monitored continuously by differential pressure transmitters and recorded in the personal computer fluid samples are collected at the core outlet and are analysed using the particle counter to determine the suspended particle concentration 2 2 methodology for the preparation of the artificial cores silica sand sibelco 50 n sibelco australia and kaolinite powder sigma aldrich australia were used the vast majority of kaolinite particles have sizes varying from 0 7 to 11 μm kaolinite was dried at 60 c for 1 h prior to preparation of unconsolidated kaolinite sand mixture to remove excess water before the use of sand in unconsolidated core samples the sand grains were cleaned of organic and inorganic impurities by washing in hexane acetone deionised water 0 5 m mol m 3 10 3 hydrochloric acid and deionised water the sand was then dried for 6 h at 60 c to remove excess water the measured particle size distribution for the processed sand had a minimum and maximum size of 60 3 and 316 μm respectively with a mean size of 134 μm the large disparity between the sand and kaolinite size distributions implies that the sand will comprise the rock matrix while the kaolinite will remain attached to the sand subject to the flow conditions each sand clay mixture was prepared and mixed while dry the kaolinite sand mixture was then wet slightly with a 0 6 m nacl solution to attach the kaolinite particles to the sand grains wet compaction was used to achieve a higher degree of homogeneity with one distributor and end cap loosely fastened to the core holder and viton sleeve the mixture was transferred into the core block with a spatula compression of the core was generated by screwing both end caps to a set position which determines the fixed length of the unconsolidated core five artificial sandstone cores with kaolinite mass fractions 1 3 5 7 and 10 were packed and consolidated the compaction procedure consisted of both axial and radial components to enhance the reproducibility of the flow properties of each core the sequential injections of sodium chloride and water solutions with ionic strength 0 6 m 0 3 m 0 1 m 0 05 m 0 01 m 0 001 m and deionised water were performed for each core the pressure drop across the core and effluent fine concentrations were measured during the experiment injection of each solution in all cores was carried out until stabilisation of the pressure drop across the core was achieved in order to verify that the kaolinite distribution along the core was uniform a separate test on a core with 5 kaolinite was performed the core was injected with a 0 6 m nacl solution until permeability stabilisation was achieved following this the core was cut into five pieces the kaolinite concentration in each piece was measured using ultrasonication and sedimentation to separate the kaolinite and sand the kaolinite concentration in each section varied between 4 86 and 5 16 3 experimental results this section presents the experimental results and considers various physical explanations of the observed results initial stabilisation of core permeability was reached after the injection of 149 pore volumes for the core with 1 kaolinite the number of pore volumes injected pvi will be used further in the text as a dimensionless unit of time the stabilisation times for the 3 5 7 and 10 kaolinite cores were 142 pvi 222 pvi 401 pvi and 498 pvi respectively the collection of kaolinite at the effluent occurred continuously during the stabilisation of permeability during these stabilisation periods the following amounts of kaolinite were recovered from the effluent streams 0 0035 g of kaolinite 0 41 of the total kaolinite in the 1 kaolinite core 0 0094 g of kaolinite 0 37 of the total kaolinite in the 3 kaolinite core 0 0034 g of kaolinite 0 80 of the total kaolinite in the 5 kaolinite core 0 0042 g of kaolinite 0 07 of the total kaolinite in the 7 kaolinite core and 0 0090 g of kaolinite 0 11 of the total kaolinite in the 10 kaolinite core the stabilised initial permeability and corresponding mean pore radii are presented in fig 4 a for each core the mean pore radii have been calculated based on the initial permeability and porosity using the expression r p 5 k ϕ barenblatt et al 1989 fig 4b shows the stabilised permeability values at the end of each injection for the five cores figs 5a 9a present the impedance variation during each injection of constant salinity water and figs 5b 9b show the corresponding accumulated breakthrough concentrations cacc the permeability decreased monotonically during injection of water with piecewise constant decreasing γ for high kaolinite content cores 5 7 and 10 whereas permeability increased in cores with a low concentration of kaolinite 1 and 3 at high salinities usually monotonic permeability decline is observed due to straining of fine particles that are mobilised by low salinity water khilar and fogler 1998 muecke 1979 rosenbrand et al 2014 on the contrary here non monotonic permeability curves were observed fines migration can cause both permeability increase due to particle detachment and permeability decrease due to particle straining the increase in permeability tends to be negligible compared to the permeability decrease and is therefore omitted from models khilar and fogler 1998 mays and hunt 2005 2007 the current study found significant permeability increase fig 4b which indicates that both effects must be accounted for if particle detachment occurred instantaneously upon arrival of low salinity water all observed increases in permeability would occur prior to the low salinity fronts reaching the outlet this would correspond to the injection of one pore volume of fluid however periods of permeability increase sometimes persisted for significantly longer than 1 pvi figs 5a 9a this effect could be attributed to a delay in the particle mobilisation that results from a change in fluid salinity this delay can be explained by nernst plank diffusion which governs the transfer of ions between a bulk solution and the particle rock contact area following the injection of low salinity water the electrostatic force will decrease as ions diffuse out of the particle rock contact area into the bulk solution the electrostatic influence of the grain and particle will significantly slow the rate of ion diffusion hence delaying the change in the electrostatic force this effect could explain the delay in detachment mahani et al 2015a b as part of the holistic approach to modelling fines migration we introduced a secondary particle deposition mechanism particle re attachment to grains by electrostatic attraction this process is likely to occur in regions of the pore space where velocity is low and hence particle transport to these regions will be driven by diffusion the likelihood of particle re attachment is governed primarily by the form of the electrostatic potential energy for the interaction between particle and grain attached particles reside at distances from the grain where the electrostatic potential energy is minimum the transition from favourable to unfavourable conditions for attachment occurs when an energy barrier appears blocking entry into the primary minimum elimelech et al 1995 for the conditions of the current test the energy barrier was predicted to appear between salinities of 0 6 m and 0 1 m this study did not attempt to accurately quantify the likelihood of particle attachment at any salinity as this would require modelling the effects of surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity on electrostatic interactions bradford et al 2013 re attachment is not likely to influence permeability directly but it will remove some particles from the suspended particle population that might otherwise have strained elsewhere the competition of straining and re attachment for suspended particles also explains why permeability increase was observed only in low kaolinite cores as was reasoned earlier the kaolinite particles fill the pore space in between the sand grains therefore the larger the concentration of attached kaolinite the smaller the pore throats which explains why kaolinite content and initial permeability are inversely related fig 4a the abundance of larger pore throats in low kaolinite cores means that the straining probability will be lower and that suspended particles will on average travel further through low kaolinite cores than through high kaolinite cores the further particles travel the more likely that they will encounter pore spaces appropriate for re attachment as such re attachment is most likely for low kaolinite cores at high salinity which is where an increase in permeability was observed during the coreflooding tests this explanation will be supported by the mathematical modelling performed in the next two sections 4 mathematical model in the current section we introduce the modified mathematical model for fines migration in porous media if compared with the conventional model given by eqs 2 6 the proposed model accounts for permeability increase during particle detachment and for mobilised particle re attachment the new model also considers delayed particle detachment the one dimensional 1d problem for injection of particle free water allows for an exact analytical solution 4 1 assumptions of the model following the explanation of non monotonic permeability variation presented in section 3 the term of the re attachment rate is introduced into mass balance equation eq 3 attached concentration dependency is accounted for in equation for permeability damage eq 6 and delay in particle detachment is introduced in the maximum retention function given by eq 2 the modified model accounts for four different populations of particles particles attached to the grain surface particles suspended in the fluid particles strained in thin pore throats and particles re attached to the grain surface in dead end pores or stagnant pore zones figs 1a 2 including two different populations of attached particles reflect the pore scale variance of flow properties within porous media this model assumes only two states for attached particles one where the particles reduce the permeability and can be detached by the drag force and another where particles are irreversibly attached but have no effect on the permeability fig 1a this discrimination is made on the basis that the flow velocity at the site of re attachment is significantly lower than for attached particles a lower u means that re attached particles have a smaller effect on the rock permeability and are less likely to detach a complete model would recognise the full stochastic nature of both fluid velocity and particle size within porous media to summarise initially attached particles can remain attached to the pore surface or detach to become suspended in the carrier fluid suspended particles can either migrate freely through the porous space strain in thin pore throats or re attach to the grain surface strained and re attached particles cannot re enter the suspension flow as such the processes of straining and re attachment are irreversible straining can be reversible if the direction of flow is reversed however this effect is not discussed in this paper for consistency with long stabilisation times it will be assumed that the fluid and particles travel through the pore space at different velocities the rolling and sliding of particles along the grain surfaces are likely to decrease the ratio between particle velocity and fluid velocity and this effect will be incorporated into the model the ratio of particle velocity to fluid velocity is assumed to be constant for all particles during a single injection cycle another key assumption of the model is that the fluid salinity at all points in the core changes instantaneously to the injected salinity at t 0 the consequence of this is that particle detachment begins immediately at all points in the core for fines migration induced by decreasing the injected salinity the detachment of particles should at its earliest begin when the injected fluid front reaches that section of the porous media the assumption of instantaneous salinity change contradicts this notion and thus introduces an error for the region ahead of the injected salinity front which ceases to exist after 1 pvi due to the low particle velocity us u and the timing of each injection cycle in the current tests t 100 pvi the region where an error is induced by this assumption comprises only a small section of the total injection period and so this error is considered acceptable additional assumptions of the model are incompressibility of the carrier fluid and suspended particles additivity of particle and water volumes during mixing capture and re attachment amagat s law the attached concentration approaches the maximum retention value with delay implying that linear kinetics for particle detachment apply and permeability dependence of both attached and strained concentrations the concentrations of strained and re attached particles are assumed to be negligible when compared to the concentration of corresponding vacancies which implies that the filtration and formation damage coefficients for straining and re attachment can be assumed to be constant 4 2 governing equations mass conservation of the four above mentioned types of particles in porous media is defined by the following equation bedrikovetsky 1993 zheng et al 2014 9 ϕ c σ s σ a t u s c x λ cu s where λ is the filtration coefficient for particle re attachment here as in the case of straining given by eq 4 we assume that increasing of either suspension concentration or rate n times increases the supply of suspended particles to vacancies thin pores attachment sites in grain surfaces etc n times so the re attachment rate also increases n times therefore the re attachment rate is given by the classical filtration theory as proportional to the suspended particle flux cu bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 tufenkji 2007 consequently the term on the right hand side of eq 9 corresponds to the particle re attachment rate the particle detachment rate after an instant salinity change from γ0 to γ1 is determined by the delay between the attached particle concentration and the value of the maximum retention concentration bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 10 τ σ a t σ cr γ 1 σ a where τ is the delay time eq 10 tends to the equation for instant detachment eq 2 with the delay time tending to zero the kinetics equation eq 10

separates from the rest of the system and as such eqs 4 9 10 are solved for unknowns c σa σs and p x t is consequently determined from eq 13 4 3 formulation of one dimensional problem let us formulate the 1d problem for injection of particle free water with salinity γ1 into a core saturated with particle free water with salinity γ0 and no strained particles first we introduce the following

eqs 19 20 simulates each stage of the constant salinity injection with decreasing γ figs 5 9 the initial strained concentration at each stage is equal to that accumulated at the end of the previous stage i e ss x t 0 adds from stage to stage it is assumed that the injection time is sufficiently high for the core to be in equilibrium with the injected salinity and for all detached particles to have either been captured or have left the core as such the initial attached concentration in each stage corresponds to the value of the maximum retention function at the injected salinity of the previous stage and the initial suspended concentration is zero 5 analytical model for fines migration with non monotonic permeability variation in the current section the exact solution for the 1d

λ 100 1 m respectively the higher is the re attachment filtration coefficient λ the lower is the breakthrough concentration the suspended concentration is highly sensitive to variation of the re attachment filtration coefficient the pressure drop increases by a convex curve during the decrease of suspended concentration fig 10b the continuous red curve shows the pressure drop across the first core section where the intermediate pressure point is an intermediate port in the core fig 11 presents the concentration profiles for suspended attached and strained particles ahead of the concentration front the mobilisation re attachment and straining rates are independent of x the initial suspended concentration is zero and is thus also uniform therefore the suspended particle concentration along the core ahead of the concentration front is independent of x fig 11a behind the concentration front the suspended concentration increases from zero at the core inlet up to the value at the concentration front the suspended particles ahead of the concentration front are size excluded with the same rate and consequently the strained concentration is also independent of x fig 11b continuous accumulation of strained particles occurs behind the concentration front from the assumption that the salinity changes immediately at all points in the core it follows that the attached concentration is independent of x fig 11c 6 results matching the measured pressure drop and breakthrough concentration curves obtained during injection periods in the tests performed on five cores

a nonlinear least squares method improved levenberg marquardt procedure was applied coleman and li 1996 more 1977 zhou et al 2017 the implemented algorithm minimised the error between the model and experimental results simultaneously for both the pressure drop and effluent suspended concentration curves the optimization algorithm was implemented in matlab matlab r2016a the mathworks inc natick ma 2016 the matched curves are presented in figs 5 9 even accounting for the scattering of the laboratory data the agreement is high tuned parameters obtained from matching coreflooding results for two porous media at two injected salinities are presented in table 3 the tuned values of parameters βs δσcr α and λs which are present in the traditional models lie within ranges typically reported in the literature al abduwani et al 2005a b bradford and bettahar 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 mays and hunt 2005 2007 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 the five presented matched cases all exhibit a high coefficient of determination r2 figs 12 and 13 present four matched impedance curves and the measurement uncertainties the traditional formulation of the dimensionless pressure drop j includes the ratio of injected velocities this ratio is equal to one for these tests due to the constant injection rate nonetheless the generalised form of impedance has been used to calculate uncertainties as a means to account for small variations in injection rate during the tests the details of uncertainty calculations for the coreflooding setup can be found in badalyan et al 2014 and you et al 2014 figs 12 and 13 show that the modelling curves which correspond to the tuned values in table 3 generally lie within the uncertainty bounds 7 discussion modifications to existing models should be limited to those necessary to capture additional physical effects any new model should introduce as few supplementary parameters as possible let us show that the three modifications to the traditional model as presented in section 4 3 comprise a minimum model or rather that the observed physical phenomena could not be modelled with fewer modifications a during the injection of low salinity water the attached concentration decreases and the strained concentration increases therefore the initial permeability growth with further decline is described by the permeability as a function of both attached and strained concentrations b the permeability increase caused by particle detachment naturally corresponds to an increase in the radius of pores within the porous media additionally it has been demonstrated that particle detachment induced by decreasing γ causes particles to detach in order of decreasing size you et al 2015 as such the jamming ratio rs rp will decrease over time which will lead to a decrease in the straining probability or straining filtration coefficient thus when permeability increases as was observed during the initial stages of several tests in this study consideration of only particle sizes would suggest that permeability is only more likely to increase with further decreases to the injected salinity however we found that at lower salinities all five cores experienced a decline in permeability this suggests that an additional salinity dependent particle capture mechanism such as particle re attachment is required c instant particle detachment would imply that the highest permeability during any injection cycle must be observed during the first injected pore volume because increases in permeability would occur only during this time this was not the case in our tests a delay in particle detachment would allow for a permeability maximum to occur at later stages of the injection as was observed introduction of the three new physical effects into the traditional model given by eqs 2 6 results in three new constants βa λ and τ the corresponding dimensionless variables are βa λ and ε the traditional model contains four constants α βs δscr and λs and consequently the modified model contains seven constant empirical parameters introducing additional constants increases the degrees of freedom of the model which can add uncertainty to the fitting process the uncertainty in tuning the model could be decreased by measuring the differential pressure between the core inlet and some intermediate point in addition to the full core measurement this is referred to as the three point pressure method and has been established previously bedrikovetsky et al 2001 vaz et al 2017 the solution of the 1d flow problem presented in table 1 is not self similar and consequently an intermediate differential pressure is not obtainable from the total differential pressure by a length scaling transformation and as such will provide additional degrees of freedom to the data the continuous red curve in fig 10b corresponds to the pressure drop across the first core section versus time as predicted by the analytical model for typical values of the model parameters the dashed red curve presenting the pressure drop across the half core versus 2 t that corresponds to self similarity differs from that for the overall core as such the pressure drop across the first core section presents additional information to the pressure drop across the overall core which can be used for improvement of the tuning of the coefficients by matching the model in addition chemical analysis could be done on the core following the coreflooding to determine the total in situ particle concentration the total retained concentration is 34 σ t x σ s x σ a x σ ra x where σt and σra are the total and re attached concentrations of retained particles respectively the total retained concentration is easily computed using the model and such analysis could provide additional degrees of freedom to the dataset computer tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance are alternative methods to measure this concentration profile their distinct advantage is that they can be run several times during the coreflooding process rather than only once following the coreflooding these methods could provide a significant improvement to the model tuning al abduwani et al 2005a b non monotonic behaviour can be observed not only for stabilised permeability values as in fig 4b but also during a constant salinity injection stage for most of the tests the impedance curves were monotonic during each injection stage the decreasing impedance curves correspond to the dominance of the fines release and re attachment effects over the straining effect the increasing curves correspond to straining dominance however in several cases the impedance curves during constant salinity injections were non monotonic injection of 0 001 m solute and of deionised water in fig 5 and injection of 0 1 m solute in fig 7 we attribute the initial permeability rise to particle detachment and the following permeability decline to particle straining the main result of the work is close agreement between the derived analytical model and the obtained laboratory data which allows concluding that the proposed model captures the experimentally observed phenomena the model coefficients obtained by tuning can be used for laboratory based predictions at the reservoir scale 8 conclusions mathematical modelling of fines migration in porous media with different clay compositions during the injection of fluid with decreasing salinity followed by comparing the model to laboratory results allow drawing the following conclusions 1 in contrast to the traditional permeability decline resulting from a decrease in the injected water salinity some permeability growth can occur at low kaolinite concentrations and high salinities 2 this effect is explained by a the straining filtration coefficient being small at low concentrations of kaolinite so the permeability decrease due to straining is lower than the increase resulting from particle detachment b at high salinities the mobilised fines can be re attached to the rock surface in a stagnant zone where they can be brought by diffusion the re attachment decreases the suspended concentration and consequently decreases the extent of particle straining 3 augmenting the traditional mathematical model by non equilibrium particle release in eq 2 permeability damage by particle attachment in eq 6 and particle re attachment in eq 3 captures the effect of non monotonic permeability variation during fines migration under salinity decrease 4 the one dimensional problem of slow particle migration with delayed particle release after salinity alteration and accounting for re attachment of particles allows for an exact analytical solution 5 the analytical model contains explicit formulae for suspended attached and strained concentrations of particles and for pressure drop history 6 the proposed model predicts non monotonic permeability variation during decreasing salinity injection 7 the model exhibits high agreement with the experimental data

7509,implementation of dual polarization radar should allow for improvements in quantitative precipitation estimates due to dual polarization capability allowing for the retrieval of the second moment of the gamma drop size distribution knowledge of the shape of the dsd can then be used in combination with mesoscale model data to estimate the motion and evaporation of each size of drop falling from the height at which precipitation is observed by the radar to the surface using data from central missouri at a range between 130 and 140 km from the operational national weather service radar a rain drop tracing scheme was developed to account for the effects of evaporation where individual raindrops hitting the ground were traced to the point in space and time where they interacted with the radar beam the results indicated evaporation played a significant role in radar rainfall estimation in situations where the atmosphere was relatively dry improvements in radar estimated rainfall were also found in these situations by accounting for evaporation the conclusion was made that the effects of raindrop evaporation were significant enough to warrant further research into the inclusion high resolution model data in the radar rainfall estimation process for appropriate locations keywords dual polarization radar rainfall estimation evaporation mesoscale model 1 introduction among the many issues with retrieving rainfall rates from meteorological radar observations one that has received little attention is that of evaporation of falling drops between the level at which they are observed by the radar and the surface villarini and krajewski 2010 kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 this can be a particular problem in areas such as the midwestern us where the majority of annual precipitation comes from convective storms and it is not uncommon for there to be dry atmospheric layers near the surface two sources of rainfall data are generally available rain gauge data and radar estimated rainfall the in situ source rain gauge data is very limited in spatial coverage especially in rural areas where agriculture is important radar estimated rainfall is remote sensing based and attempts to fill in gaps where no rain gauges are present areas surrounding columbia missouri fit this description columbia is located in central missouri an area far from the nearest radar location this introduces problems with radar rainfall estimation associated with the height of the beam above ground level as well as the spatial resolution of the beam what happens to the raindrops as they fall from the altitude at which they are detected by the radar influences surface determination of rainfall amounts the present study examined the effects of evaporation in an effort to improve radar rainfall estimation in this work the drop size distribution dsd is determined using dual polarization radar observations by finding the appropriate form of the gamma distribution that agrees with the radar observations the dsd is then modified by modeling the fall of the different drop sizes to the surface using rapid update cycle rapid refresh ruc rap model humidity fields to estimate evaporation the resulting dsd at the surface is computed and a rainfall rate r calculated in order to evaluate the effects of evaporation knowledge of the dsd of raindrops is required dual polarization radar utilizes horizontally and vertically polarized radiation to obtain information about the hydrometeors within an atmospheric volume that would otherwise be unavailable as the eccentricity of raindrops larger than about 1 mm in diameter increases with size these drops interact differently with the horizontally and vertically polarized radiation this difference in interaction can be used to derive the drop size distribution from combinations of the reflectivity z the differential reflectivity zdr and the specific differential phase kdp these parameters are dependent on the dsd and they have been used in dual polarization radar based quantitative precipitation estimation qpe methods as they contain implicit information about the dsd that better informs the qpe the effectiveness of the polarimetric rainfall algorithms has been evaluated in many studies for example ryzhkov et al 2005 referred to as rgs05 and ryzhkov and zrnić 1996 these formulas have been found to be more effective than the simple r z formulas literature dealing with raindrop evaporation calculations is relatively limited kinzer and gunn 1951 detailed an analytic solution to evaporation for a falling drop the rate of mass change per unit time was given by 1 dm dt 4 π rd v δ ρ v 1 fr s for 1 m is the mass of the raindrop r is the drop radius d v is the diffusivity of water vapor in air δ ρ v is the vapor density difference and 1 fr s is the ventilation coefficient term recent updates to this formula have been made li and srivastava 2001 as discussed in the methodology li and srivastava 2001 established a parameter d that was defined as the diameter of raindrop that would just completely evaporate after traveling through a layer of the atmosphere with specified qualities this parameter essentially corresponded to the drying power of the layer they also detailed the relationship between d and several other parameters including evaporation induced changes in dsds and evaporation related errors in rainfall estimation with r z and r z zdr relations a more focused examination of the effect of evaporation on polarimetric radar parameters was conducted by kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 the theoretical effects of evaporation on z zdr and kdp were addressed evaporation calculations caused substantial alterations in each of the three parameters z and kdp were reduced by evaporation while zdr was increased since conventional formulas for rainfall estimation are directly proportional to powers of z and kdp but inversely proportional to powers of zdr each of these three changes from evaporation was expected to result in rainfall overestimation the study noted that the effects of evaporation were generally reduced as the rainfall rate increased and that kdp was the parameter most affected most recently xie et al 2016 examined the evaporation of rain using a vertically pointing micro rain radar in that work a model of the evaporation process that uses similar equations to those used herein was found to replicate the observed vertical profile of evaporation the objective of this study was to examine the utility of high resolution model data in accounting for the effects of precipitation drift and evaporation on radar rainfall estimation a trace method was developed as a way for high resolution model data to potentially improve radar rainfall estimation this method relied on tracing all raindrops hitting the surface at a point back to the locations in space and time at which the radar interacted with them calculations for both evaporation and horizontal drift were utilized in the tracing process such that the time taken for each drop to reach the surface from the height at which it is observed by the radar is accounted for the tracing process required the use of dual polarization radar data to establish the dsd several variations of the trace technique were tested these variations consisted of different combinations of evaporation and horizontal drift also included was a version where raindrops were assumed to instantaneously reach the ground without change analogous to the assumptions of most r z schemes testing each of these variations allowed isolation of the effects a particular parameter had on the method to the authors knowledge previous estimation of raindrop evaporation in the literature has been performed in the context of theoretical and modeling frameworks rather than being applied to observational data as is done here evaluations of the trace techniques designed for this project provided a physical test of raindrop evaporation theory 2 data traditional techniques for radar rainfall estimation assume the rain drops generating the observed reflectivity hit the ground with no change in the state of the rain between the beam rainfall interaction and the surface as the radar beam rises with height the assumption made in these techniques becomes less sound as the point of interest increases in distance from the radar central missouri is one such location with the nearest radar being klsx located in saint louis several factors such as the vertical wind speed the wind profile and humidity affect where and at what size raindrops hit the surface given the necessary information evaporation can be calculated and high resolution model data can be used to supply this required information the concept of the trace method is that with the right information a rain drop reaching the surface can be traced backwards in space and time to its origin in this case the drop s origin refers to the time and location at which the drop interacted with the radar beam knowledge of atmospheric temperature relative humidity wind speed and wind direction can be used to calculate the drop s origin as well as how much it has evaporated along its trajectory in preliminary testing it was found that inclusion of wind drift made little difference to the overall results for hourly rainfall rates therefore for the trace techniques in this study horizontal movement due to wind was not accounted for radar data were level 2 wsr 88d for klsx downloaded from the national centers for environmental information ncei from these data z and zdr were directly obtained and the data were processed using the warning decision support system integrated information wdss ii lakshmanan et al 2007 the source radar data were converted to a cartesian constant altitude plan position indicator cappi grid using the w2merger process lakshmanan et al 2006 within the wdss ii to produce 1 km 1 km grids at nominal five minute intervals the resolution of the radar at this range is of the order of 2 km and the merging process uses a spherical interpolation technique described in lakshmanan et al 2006 with dual polarized radar the cappi provides information about drop size distribution at a constant height in the atmosphere the cappi height used for this project was 2 km above radar level which accounts for the effects of both earth curvature and beam propagation at the range of central missouri from the st louis radar between 130 km and 140 km the center of the lowest elevation beam is located between 2 3 km and 2 4 km above the radar level as the beamwidth at this range is of the order of 2 4 km the 2 km cappi height is just below the center of the beam while the top of the beam is at a height of about 3 5 km an examination of the temperature profiles for the warm season convective events examined in this work shows that the 0 c isotherm was consistently located above the 700 hpa level 3 1 km as shown in table 1 this implies that melting of ice crystals would certainly be complete by the time hydrometeors reach the center of the beam looking at z zdr comparisons reveals very few outliers indicating that contamination by bright band was minimal for the cases observed the exception to this would be when hail was present but this would not be expected to impact zdr values hail causes many problems when it comes to rainfall estimation using radar a simple hail adjustment algorithm was implemented to reduce the effects of hail on the results similar to that described in fulton et al 1998 whereas in that algorithm reflectivity values were capped at 52 dbz here a fuzzy logic scheme was implemented for reflectivity values between 45 and 52 dbz the fuzzy logic was designed to reduce reflectivity values for points where hail was more likely to be present which in this case corresponded to zdr values below the threshold of 3 db for the trace techniques the minimum value allowed for zdr was 0 5 db this was implemented due to the range of μ values see eqs 4 and 5 below utilized within the program μ was allowed to vary between 5 and 16 resulting in a zdr range of 9 33 db to 0 47 db 13 km resolution model data were obtained at hourly intervals from ncei data for the events preceding may 2012 were from the rapid update cycle ruc numerical weather model which was replaced on 1 may 2012 by the rapid refresh rap both the ruc and the rap issued hourly forecasts for a multitude of parameters across much of north america this study used the initialization data for these models forecast for hour zero height temperature and relative humidity were the necessary fields data were obtained at pressure levels ranging from 1000 hpa to 700 hpa in 25 hpa intervals data for several major rainfall events were available during 2012 and 2013 in central missouri table 1 criteria for selection included availability of radar data and rain gauge data as well as storm type a variety of storm types was necessary to adequately evaluate the estimation methods notably the event that began on 31 august 2012 involved the remnants of hurricane isaac that passed over the area at the end of an exceptionally dry period the events of 7 september 2012 and 17 april 2013 contained some large hail evaluation of the effectiveness of radar related rainfall estimation techniques requires both rain gauge and radar data tipping bucket rain gauge data were obtained from nine locations shown in table 2 around central missouri maintained by the commercial agriculture automated weather station network managed by university of missouri extension and the university of missouri interdisciplinary hydrology laboratory hubbart et al 2010 indicated in the table are the coordinates of these sites as well as their distance from the national weather service radar klsx fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the site locations relative to each other and the radar each of the gauges provided observations at five minute intervals and these were aggregated to hourly totals which were then compared to radar retrievals over the same period 3 methodology 3 1 calculating drop size distribution rain drops reaching the surface range in size from roughly 0 to 6 0 mm in diameter this size is usually given in equivalent spherical drop diameter as the drops themselves become less spherical as they grow larger the ratio of vertical diameter a to horizontal diameter b is called the axis ratio a b the axis ratio shrinks as the equivalent spherical drop diameter increases the axis ratio formula used for this study is derived from beard and chuang 1987 and is shown in 2 2 a b 1 0048 0 00057 d 0 02628 d 2 0 003682 d 3 0 0001677 d 4 in 2 d is the equivalent spherical drop diameter in millimeters differential reflectivity or zdr is a value provided by dual polarized radars the differential reflectivity is defined by 3 z dr 10 log 10 z h z v where zh is the horizontal reflectivity and zv is the vertical reflectivity from 2 a drop size distribution resulting in an equivalent differential reflectivity can be estimated the gamma drop size distribution has been shown to correspond best to real world situations testud et al 2001 this drop size distribution is given by 4 n d n 0 d μ exp λ d where n d is the number of drops of diameter d per meter cubed per drop diameter interval the parameters of the equation are the intercept parameter n0 the shape parameter μ and the median drop size parameter λ to obtain a drop size distribution from just two parameters reflectivity and differential reflectivity a relationship between μ and λ must be assumed brandes et al 2004 found that the relationship shown in 5 provided the best description of this relationship 5 λ 0 0365 μ 2 0 735 μ 1 935 drop concentrations per m3 at discrete 0 01 mm intervals were calculated based on the drop size distribution from 5 assuming an n0 value of 1000 m 3 mm 1 µ from these concentrations predicted z and zdr values were obtained the zdr values were dependent only on μ and in this case unique as a consequence corresponding zdr and μ values were mapped out since adjusting the value of n0 altered the reflectivity without changing the differential reflectivity a value of n0 and μ could be found to match up with every possible z and zdr combination 3 2 drop motion and evaporation at the surface one might expect a certain concentration of drops of a particular size to calculate a rainfall rate a concentration for drops of all sizes is needed the tracing process therefore attempts to trace drops of all sizes to their respective points of origin however these drops will have different sizes at their origins than they will at the surface after they have been affected by evaporation along with evaporation calculating drop terminal velocity is also necessary for tracing drops to their origin for each site each day and each five minute time step 60 representative drop sizes were traced from the gauge site to their origins at radar beam cappi height the tracing was done in one second intervals every second the following parameters were recalculated for each individual drop using ruc model analysis fields interpolated between the available times closest to the radar time latitude longitude height pressure relative humidity temperature terminal velocity virtual temperature the vertical motion vector given to each drop was used to calculate a position one second in the past drop terminal velocity is dependent on a number of factors the most important being drop size and air density the equation used for drop terminal velocity was from van boxel 1998 6 v t ρ b ρ 0 4 9 65 1 exp 0 53 d for eq 6 ρ b is the standard atmospheric air density and ρ is the air density at the point of calculation the evaporation rate was used to calculate a drop size for that position calculation of the evaporation rate required estimation of the wet bulb temperature this was done using an iterative process estimation of the pressure which was needed for air density calculations was done using the hypsometric equation and several assumptions about the temperature lapse rate as described earlier model data was obtained at 25 hpa intervals the average virtual temperature of a layer is necessary to estimate its thickness given the virtual temperature at the top and bottom of the 25 hpa layer an average lapse rate can be calculated however the average virtual temperature given by this average lapse rate may not necessarily correspond to the thickness of the layer given by the model data to maintain the model estimated thickness of the layer as well as the apparent average lapse rate in the model the virtual temperatures at the top and bottom of the layer were adjusted these virtual temperature assumptions the predicted height of the drop and the hypsometric equation were then used to calculate the pressure the equation used to calculate drop evaporation comes from li and srivastava 2001 7 dm dt 4 π rd v f v δ ρ v the ventilation coefficient f v is calculated as 8 f v 0 78 0 308 ν d v 1 3 vd ν 1 2 in these equations m is the mass of the rain drop ν is the kinematic viscosity of air v is the terminal velocity d v is the diffusivity of water vapor in air r is the drop radius d is the drop diameter and δ ρ v is the difference in vapor density between the drop surface and the environment after the change in drop diameter was calculated based on the estimated mass loss a new motion vector and a new evaporation rate were then calculated for the new position these new values were averaged with the original values and used to calculate the drop s official estimated position and mass one second prior to the present this approach mitigated error introduced by the numerical approximation necessary for the tracing calculation for each five minute time step the trace calculations yielded data on the origins of 60 drop sizes ranging from 0 1 mm in diameter to 6 0 mm in diameter at 0 1 mm intervals these drops were sorted by their size at the surface as their size at point of origin varied considerably estimated points of origin were defined by two parameters drop size at point of origin and time for calculation of rainfall rate a higher resolution of drop size was used the drop sizes were further split into 591 categories still ranging from 0 10 mm in diameter to 6 00 mm in diameter but at 0 01 mm intervals the points of origin for the drop sizes at 0 01 mm intervals were found through linear interpolation of the lower resolution points of origin fig 2 illustrates the calculated change in drop diameter during the 2 km descent for various drop sizes the date selected for fig 2 was may 20 2013 while radar data were not obtained for the may 20 event mesoscale model data were acquired and the relevant tracing calculations were performed for this example the tracing process for the data in fig 2 was slightly different from the process used for other parts of this study in that horizontal drop movement due to wind was accounted for this may cause minor effects on total evaporation expected due to slight changes in the environment over the short distances involved once a time size and size interval for a drop reaching the surface were obtained the concentration of drops fitting those parameters was estimated using the drop size distribution derived from the corresponding radar data these concentrations were found at each of the eight surrounding points and interpolated linearly dimensions of latitude longitude and time the concentration of drops for each of the 591 drop sizes was obtained in this fashion and their contribution to the overall rainfall rate was estimated and summed to generate the final rain rate at the time step in question the rainfall rates at the beginning and end of each five minute interval were then averaged to determine the total rainfall during that period possible interactions between drops such as drop merging and splitting were not addressed in this study 3 3 trace method and zdr adjustments two different trace methods were used for this study the first was to simply assume the drops aloft instantly reached the ground with no drift or evaporation the second was calculated under the assumption that the drops took time to reach the ground and were affected by evaporation though not any horizontal drift various adjustments in zdr were also tested the reason for these adjustments was possible bias in zdr values noted by the nws hoban et al 2004 hoban et al 2004 reported on the assessment of zdr bias in nws radars and found biases of more than 0 5 db were not uncommon as the zdr observed for bragg scattering assumed to present a spherical target can be normally distributed around a mean that is offset from 0 db by this bias it is reasonable to test adjustments of 1 db or greater and we choose to include values up to 2 6 db to ensure that such adjustments are seen to be excessive increased zdr values indicate more non spherical hydrometeors suggesting that poorly calibrated zdr values are underestimating the oblateness of raindrops and hence the population of larger drops adjustments in zdr were also tested for the conventional formulas that relied on zdr 3 4 evaluation methods the analyses conducted for this study were based on two different categories of rainfall intensity gauge rainfall totals below 10 mm h 1 were classified as light to moderate intensity rain and gauge totals above 10 mm h 1 were classified as heavy rain it should be noted that this method for categorizing rainfall intensity is not perfect short high intensity events as well as events that are split between different hours may not be filtered out with this method however kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 identified 10 mm h 1 as the intensity above which evaporation becomes less significant in comparison to other dsd modification processes how method performance varied with average atmospheric humidity was a key subject of this study to determine humidity in the atmosphere meteorological variable values for the lowest layers of the atmosphere 800 1000 hpa were again obtained from the ruc and rap models on an hourly basis model values from a location near columbia missouri were used from these values an estimated evaporating power of this layer was obtained this was done by calculating the average rate of evaporation based on temperature terminal velocity and relative humidity for a hypothetical 1 mm diameter raindrop falling through the layer while remaining constant in size this same process was conducted with a series of 1000 standard atmosphere profiles with constant relative humidity values throughout the vertical layer each profile used a different relative humidity value ranging from 0 1 to 100 the evaporating powers of the model obtained layers were then matched with the closest corresponding evaporating power of the standard profiles resulting in a single equivalent relative humidity erh to represent the evaporating power of the modeled layer two methods of radar rainfall estimation technique performance based on erh were conducted the cumulative method and the sliding range method the cumulative method was based on pooling all pairs of radar estimated rainfall and rain gauge totals where the erh for the particular hour falls beneath a threshold as an alternative to the cumulative method for examining the effects of erh on radar estimated rainfall performance a sliding range method was developed to ensure a large enough sample of hourly radar estimated rainfall and rain gauge totals the humidity percentage marker on the x axis of the sliding range figures is indicative of all the relevant pairs where the average relative humidity in the lowest portion of the atmosphere was between plus and minus 15 of the indicated relative humidity percent for example the data point for 55 relative humidity includes all pairs where the relative humidity in the lower atmosphere was between 40 and 70 this sliding range means only the edges of the 55 to 85 range used in the sliding range figures are completely independent unlike for the cumulative method a weighting scheme was created for the sliding range method to mitigate the effects of the skewed observation distribution this ensured that the greater number of observations occurring at the upper end of the 30 sliding range did not have correspondingly greater influence on the results to determine the overall performance of each individual method for rainfall estimation two parameters were calculated the parameters chosen for analysis were fractional bias fb and fractional absolute difference fad 9 fb t r t g t g 10 fad t r t g t g in 9 and 10 t r is the total radar estimated rainfall t g is the total gauge rainfall and the brackets indicate averaging over all values pairs where the rain gauge recorded zero were disqualified for these rain gauges the minimum possible accumulation was 0 01 in or 0 254 mm all radar rainfall estimation techniques considered for evaluation in this study are shown in table 3 these radar rainfall estimation methods consisted of both conventional formulas and the trace techniques described above ten conventional radar rainfall formulas described in rgs05 were initially considered for evaluation five of these formulas were r z formulas and the other five were r z zdr formulas preliminary testing was conducted to eliminate the most poorly performing formulas this was done by calculating mean performance with respect to fad at all sliding range median erhs for both rainfall thresholds of the five r z formulas the z5 formula performed significantly worse than the other four at both thresholds and was not tested further not shown the other five conventional radar rainfall formulas were r z zdr formulas in preliminary testing these formulas were evaluated in a similar way to the r z formulas with the addition of a zdr adjustment parameter figs 3a and 3b shows the results from this testing at the two different rainfall thresholds the zzdr4 and zzdr5 formulas tended to perform worse than the other two methods for both tested thresholds and were not used for further evaluation fad performance with zdr adjustments between 2 0 and 0 6 db was calculated for the r z zdr formulas and a portion of this adjustment range is shown in figs 3a and 3b optimal performance occurred at roughly 0 6 db for the higher threshold and 0 6 db for the lower threshold though the slope suggests minor improvements in performance possible for higher adjustments beyond 0 6 db an adjustment of 0 db was chosen for further evaluation as fad performance at this adjustment was within roughly 1 of the optimal for both thresholds examined an optimal zdr adjustment for the trace techniques was also determined in preliminary testing figs 3a and 3b shows fad performance for the two trace techniques as a function of zdr adjustment the calculations in this figure were done using the same process used for the r z and r z zdr formulas for the evaporation trace technique an adjustment of 1 db was chosen for further analysis as fad values for this adjustment were within 1 of the optimal value for both thresholds optimal zdr adjustment for the no evaporation technique varied from 2 db for the higher threshold to 2 6 db for the lower threshold though the slope suggests possible minor further improvement with increasing db adjustment for the lower threshold a compromise value of 2 4 db was chosen for further analysis in this case the cause of the optimal zdr adjustment for the r z zdr formulas being much lower than for the evaporation trace technique may be related to differing base levels in bias for the two methods the r z zdr formulas showed more negative bias values than most of the standard r z formulas and thus a smaller zdr adjustment upward might be expected to result in improved performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 bias analysis 4 1 1 cumulative bias the observations used to calculate the performance statistics for the cumulative sections are not weighted in any way generally resulting in a greater relative influence for pairs where the erh is closer to the threshold value fig 5a shows the cumulative number of gauge radar observation pairs at each erh 1 increments split into gauge values below and above 10 mm in hourly precipitation fig 5b shows the non cumulative number of gauge radar pairs falling within each erh 1 increments also split into gauge values below and above 10 mm in hourly precipitation it is readily evident from these figures that a far greater number of observations occurred at higher erh values fig 6a shows the cumulative bias for gauge radar pairs where the gauge recorded less than 10 mm of hourly rainfall this is the type of rainfall that would theoretically be most affected by evaporation due to the smaller size of the drops and lower terminal velocity the shape for the e 1 technique is radically different from the no evaporation techniques in particular for all of the ne techniques the bias becomes decreasingly positive as erh increases whereas the e 1 scheme has a small bias at all erh ranges cumulative values at the lower end of equivalent rh scale come with the caveat of lower total number of observations the total number of pairs only approaches 100 at around the 73 erh mark nonetheless it is clear that at low erh the ne methods overestimate rainfall amounts and it is assumed that the overestimation is due to evaporation as the evaporation scheme shows little bias at low humidity fig 6b depicts the cumulative bias for all gauge radar pairs regardless of how much hourly rainfall was recorded by the gauge for this broader range of rainfall rates the e 1 method is seen to have a comparable bias performance to the other methods at lower humidities but appears to overestimate the evaporation resulting in underestimation of rain at the higher erh values its performance is comparable to the better r z algorithms for fig 6b a decreasing trend in bias as erh rises is still present in many of the methods that do not account for evaporation though at a much smaller magnitude possible explanations for this are discussed in the following section 4 1 2 sliding range bias fig 7a illustrates the sliding range method of bias performance evaluation for gauge radar pairs where the gauge total was below 10 mm h 1 a very clear pattern of decreases in bias as erh increases is present in this figure for the no evaporation techniques however the evaporation technique displays low bias across the entire range of erh fig 7b shows the same as 7a but for all gauge radar pairs all of the no evaporation techniques exhibit a reduction in bias from the 55 to 60 median erh range corresponding to all pairs where the erh fell within 40 70 and 45 75 respectively excluding the e 1 technique additional increases in erh only produced clear decreases for the non zdr dependent techniques bias for the e 1 technique generally increased as erh rose such that at higher erh its performance is among the best while at lower erh it appears to assess too much evaporation but still produce fair results when the bias performance of the various rainfall estimation methods for the heavier rain 10 mm hour is isolated it helps explain why the trends in bias as a function of erh are less clear when all the gauge radar pairs are included fig 8a shows the bias values for only the radar gauge pairs where the gauge value exceeded 10 mm while a decreasing trend in bias values as median erh increases is present from the 55 70 range bias values are still negative for heavier rain for all techniques even at very low erh values the negative bias seen with the e 1 method suggests that at low humidities the evaporation may be overestimated this may be a problem with the representation of the model humidity field over the course of the aggregation period of one hour or it is possible that the drop fall speed is underestimated if the fall speed is faster than is being modeled perhaps due to the effect of downdrafts then the drops will have less time than is assumed to undergo evaporation for this figure no weighting was done as the number of gauge radar pairs only ranged from 25 to 59 across the erh spectrum the percentage of all gauge radar pairs where the gauge value exceeded 10 mm is displayed in fig 8b the heavier gauge radar pairs are over represented at the lower end of the erh spectrum flattening the trend in bias when all gauge radar pairs are used it is worth noting that the techniques with the smallest trends in bias for gauge values exceeding 10 mm h 1 also have the least evident trends in bias for all gauge pairs overall from these figures it can be seen that the e 1 techniques has a more stable performance in terms of bias across the range of humidity conditions than is seen by any of the no evaporation techniques however it also appears that the e 1 method overestimates the evaporation of heavy rainfall at lower humidities this could be a result of the method not accounting for rapid moistening of the atmosphere during these events that is not captured by the model data used to characterize the environment 4 2 fad analysis 4 2 1 cumulative fad fig 9a shows the cumulative fad for gauge radar pairs where the gauge recorded less than 10 mm of hourly rainfall the trend is clear in fig 9a with an initial rapid decrease in fad for the no evaporation methods slowing as the erh threshold rises the e 1 technique is the best method by far at the lower erh thresholds in this case though the difference again drops as the erh threshold rises this suggests that the evaporation technique does a good job of assessing the evaporation and that the remaining errors are consistent and related to other sources of error the similarity in fad at high erh suggests that once the humidity is great enough to reduce the evaporation sufficiently then the performance converges this is an indication that the evaporation technique responds to the increased humidity to reduce evaporation in a realistic manner fig 9b is equivalent to 9a but for all gauge radar pairs for the no evaporation techniques a decreasing trend in fad is present as the erh threshold rises these figures show the cumulative performance of the e 1 technique remains superior to that of the no evaporation techniques until the 95 threshold is reached however the magnitude of difference narrows considerably as the erh threshold rises 4 2 2 sliding range fad fig 10a illustrates the sliding range method of fad performance evaluation for gauge radar pairs where the gauge total was below 10 mm h 1 as was the case with the corresponding cumulative graph the e 1 technique performed much better than the no evaporation techniques at the lower end of the erh spectrum this shows that not only does the evaporation scheme reduce bias in low erh conditions but that the absolute errors are also decreased fig 10b is equivalent to 10a but for all gauge radar pairs the e 1 technique largely performed best for median erh values below 75 and tended to perform worse as median erh rose with respect to fad all the conventional formulas exhibited an improvement in performance as median erh rose the trends in fig 10b are less clear than that in 10a indicating that including the heavier gauge totals did not just influence bias but also the other metrics of performance evaluation overall these results suggest that a lack of accounting for evaporation is responsible for a noticeable amount of the error associated with retrievals of rainfall rate from radar observations at ranges where the beam is high enough above the surface that evaporation would be expected to take place between the observation height and the surface 5 conclusions the results presented in the previous section indicate that evaporation plays an important role in radar rainfall estimation under the appropriate conditions both the fad and the bias demonstrate a dependence on the erh radar rainfall estimation techniques that assume a static amount of evaporation or more commonly no evaporation are subject to potentially significant limitations the radar beam increases in height as distance from the radar increases a consequence of this increase in height is that greater potential for evaporation of rain between the height of the beam and the ground exists at locations farther from the radar dynamically adjusting the expected amount of evaporation solely based on range from the radar would address this issue without requiring any inclusion of model data however differing amounts of evaporation based on different atmospheric conditions is a factor that can only be accounted for by inclusion of model data the conditions for which evaporation is most important are when the lower atmosphere is very dry the role of evaporation is particularly enhanced for lighter rainfall as seen in the bias and fad performance metrics from the previous section when all radar gauge pairs were included the difference in performance with respect to the fad metric grew narrower for dryer atmospheric conditions this was true for both the cumulative and sliding range methods of evaluation all tested methods tended to perform better with all radar gauge pairs included this improvement in performance is due to factors associated with heavier rainfall with larger hourly rainfall totals the noise associated with evaluating radar rainfall estimation performance on very short timescales is likely to be mitigated the larger drops seen in heavier rainfall are also less affected by evaporation and horizontal drift as shown in fig 8a for heavier gauge totals all radar rainfall estimation methods tended to underestimate the recorded rainfall influencing the trends in bias seen in figs 6b and 7b this was caused by the unequal distribution of heavier rainfall events across the erh spectrum the fad figures showed that the e 1 technique generally performed worse as erh rose one possible cause for this is a potential reduction in model accuracy for humid atmospheres there is also the issue of model bias and the handling of precipitation within the mesoscale model the scheme developed here is reliant on model humidity fields yet these fields are affected by the presence of the precipitation which will produce a rapid evolution of the humidity field that may not be captured within the model this may also explain how the quality of the results varies as the erh threshold rises use of a finer model temporal resolution 15 min as opposed to 1 h may help mitigate problems associated with model accuracy further improvement may be realized by fine tuning the modeled drop size distribution to better match real world conditions there are a number of additional areas in which we are exploring improvements to this work a better representation of the starting level of the observed drop size distribution would be obtained by using the actual beam height at the range in question while the evaporation process may benefit by consideration of the cloud base height as evaporation should not take place above that level however one would expect that the model fields should identify where the atmosphere is saturated and preclude the scheme from finding drop evaporation while in cloud this leads to a further issue worthy of investigation that of consistency between the evaporation scheme and the model fields in the future we intend to assess whether changes in atmospheric humidity represented within the mesoscale model used are consistent with the evaporation calculated by the trace scheme one method of testing the method further would be to use sites closer to the radar and investigating whether the drop size distribution evolves with height as predicted for example one could replicate the scheme using the reflectivity and zdr from a 2 km cappi and compare z and zdr values computed from the dsd calculated to exist within the evaporation scheme at a height of 1 km alternatively the calculated dsd could be compared to that measured at the surface with a disdrometer acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the

7509,implementation of dual polarization radar should allow for improvements in quantitative precipitation estimates due to dual polarization capability allowing for the retrieval of the second moment of the gamma drop size distribution knowledge of the shape of the dsd can then be used in combination with mesoscale model data to estimate the motion and evaporation of each size of drop falling from the height at which precipitation is observed by the radar to the surface using data from central missouri at a range between 130 and 140 km from the operational national weather service radar a rain drop tracing scheme was developed to account for the effects of evaporation where individual raindrops hitting the ground were traced to the point in space and time where they interacted with the radar beam the results indicated evaporation played a significant role in radar rainfall estimation in situations where the atmosphere was relatively dry improvements in radar estimated rainfall were also found in these situations by accounting for evaporation the conclusion was made that the effects of raindrop evaporation were significant enough to warrant further research into the inclusion high resolution model data in the radar rainfall estimation process for appropriate locations keywords dual polarization radar rainfall estimation evaporation mesoscale model 1 introduction among the many issues with retrieving rainfall rates from meteorological radar observations one that has received little attention is that of evaporation of falling drops between the level at which they are observed by the radar and the surface villarini and krajewski 2010 kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 this can be a particular problem in areas such as the midwestern us where the majority of annual precipitation comes from convective storms and it is not uncommon for there to be dry atmospheric layers near the surface two sources of rainfall data are generally available rain gauge data and radar estimated rainfall the in situ source rain gauge data is very limited in spatial coverage especially in rural areas where agriculture is important radar estimated rainfall is remote sensing based and attempts to fill in gaps where no rain gauges are present areas surrounding columbia missouri fit this description columbia is located in central missouri an area far from the nearest radar location this introduces problems with radar rainfall estimation associated with the height of the beam above ground level as well as the spatial resolution of the beam what happens to the raindrops as they fall from the altitude at which they are detected by the radar influences surface determination of rainfall amounts the present study examined the effects of evaporation in an effort to improve radar rainfall estimation in this work the drop size distribution dsd is determined using dual polarization radar observations by finding the appropriate form of the gamma distribution that agrees with the radar observations the dsd is then modified by modeling the fall of the different drop sizes to the surface using rapid update cycle rapid refresh ruc rap model humidity fields to estimate evaporation the resulting dsd at the surface is computed and a rainfall rate r calculated in order to evaluate the effects of evaporation knowledge of the dsd of raindrops is required dual polarization radar utilizes horizontally and vertically polarized radiation to obtain information about the hydrometeors within an atmospheric volume that would otherwise be unavailable as the eccentricity of raindrops larger than about 1 mm in diameter increases with size these drops interact differently with the horizontally and vertically polarized radiation this difference in interaction can be used to derive the drop size distribution from combinations of the reflectivity z the differential reflectivity zdr and the specific differential phase kdp these parameters are dependent on the dsd and they have been used in dual polarization radar based quantitative precipitation estimation qpe methods as they contain implicit information about the dsd that better informs the qpe the effectiveness of the polarimetric rainfall algorithms has been evaluated in many studies for example ryzhkov et al 2005 referred to as rgs05 and ryzhkov and zrnić 1996 these formulas have been found to be more effective than the simple r z formulas literature dealing with raindrop evaporation calculations is relatively limited kinzer and gunn 1951 detailed an analytic solution to evaporation for a falling drop the rate of mass change per unit time was given by 1 dm dt 4 π rd v δ ρ v 1 fr s for 1 m is the mass of the raindrop r is the drop radius d v is the diffusivity of water vapor in air δ ρ v is the vapor density difference and 1 fr s is the ventilation coefficient term recent updates to this formula have been made li and srivastava 2001 as discussed in the methodology li and srivastava 2001 established a parameter d that was defined as the diameter of raindrop that would just completely evaporate after traveling through a layer of the atmosphere with specified qualities this parameter essentially corresponded to the drying power of the layer they also detailed the relationship between d and several other parameters including evaporation induced changes in dsds and evaporation related errors in rainfall estimation with r z and r z zdr relations a more focused examination of the effect of evaporation on polarimetric radar parameters was conducted by kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 the theoretical effects of evaporation on z zdr and kdp were addressed evaporation calculations caused substantial alterations in each of the three parameters z and kdp were reduced by evaporation while zdr was increased since conventional formulas for rainfall estimation are directly proportional to powers of z and kdp but inversely proportional to powers of zdr each of these three changes from evaporation was expected to result in rainfall overestimation the study noted that the effects of evaporation were generally reduced as the rainfall rate increased and that kdp was the parameter most affected most recently xie et al 2016 examined the evaporation of rain using a vertically pointing micro rain radar in that work a model of the evaporation process that uses similar equations to those used herein was found to replicate the observed vertical profile of evaporation the objective of this study was to examine the utility of high resolution model data in accounting for the effects of precipitation drift and evaporation on radar rainfall estimation a trace method was developed as a way for high resolution model data to potentially improve radar rainfall estimation this method relied on tracing all raindrops hitting the surface at a point back to the locations in space and time at which the radar interacted with them calculations for both evaporation and horizontal drift were utilized in the tracing process such that the time taken for each drop to reach the surface from the height at which it is observed by the radar is accounted for the tracing process required the use of dual polarization radar data to establish the dsd several variations of the trace technique were tested these variations consisted of different combinations of evaporation and horizontal drift also included was a version where raindrops were assumed to instantaneously reach the ground without change analogous to the assumptions of most r z schemes testing each of these variations allowed isolation of the effects a particular parameter had on the method to the authors knowledge previous estimation of raindrop evaporation in the literature has been performed in the context of theoretical and modeling frameworks rather than being applied to observational data as is done here evaluations of the trace techniques designed for this project provided a physical test of raindrop evaporation theory 2 data traditional techniques for radar rainfall estimation assume the rain drops generating the observed reflectivity hit the ground with no change in the state of the rain between the beam rainfall interaction and the surface as the radar beam rises with height the assumption made in these techniques becomes less sound as the point of interest increases in distance from the radar central missouri is one such location with the nearest radar being klsx located in saint louis several factors such as the vertical wind speed the wind profile and humidity affect where and at what size raindrops hit the surface given the necessary information evaporation can be calculated and high resolution model data can be used to supply this required information the concept of the trace method is that with the right information a rain drop reaching the surface can be traced backwards in space and time to its origin in this case the drop s origin refers to the time and location at which the drop interacted with the radar beam knowledge of atmospheric temperature relative humidity wind speed and wind direction can be used to calculate the drop s origin as well as how much it has evaporated along its trajectory in preliminary testing it was found that inclusion of wind drift made little difference to the overall results for hourly rainfall rates therefore for the trace techniques in this study horizontal movement due to wind was not accounted for radar data were level 2 wsr 88d for klsx downloaded from the national centers for environmental information ncei from these data z and zdr were directly obtained and the data were processed using the warning decision support system integrated information wdss ii lakshmanan et al 2007 the source radar data were converted to a cartesian constant altitude plan position indicator cappi grid using the w2merger process lakshmanan et al 2006 within the wdss ii to produce 1 km 1 km grids at nominal five minute intervals the resolution of the radar at this range is of the order of 2 km and the merging process uses a spherical interpolation technique described in lakshmanan et al 2006 with dual polarized radar the cappi provides information about drop size distribution at a constant height in the atmosphere the cappi height used for this project was 2 km above radar level which accounts for the effects of both earth curvature and beam propagation at the range of central missouri from the st louis radar between 130 km and 140 km the center of the lowest elevation beam is located between 2 3 km and 2 4 km above the radar level as the beamwidth at this range is of the order of 2 4 km the 2 km cappi height is just below the center of the beam while the top of the beam is at a height of about 3 5 km an examination of the temperature profiles for the warm season convective events examined in this work shows that the 0 c isotherm was consistently located above the 700 hpa level 3 1 km as shown in table 1 this implies that melting of ice crystals would certainly be complete by the time hydrometeors reach the center of the beam looking at z zdr comparisons reveals very few outliers indicating that contamination by bright band was minimal for the cases observed the exception to this would be when hail was present but this would not be expected to impact zdr values hail causes many problems when it comes to rainfall estimation using radar a simple hail adjustment algorithm was implemented to reduce the effects of hail on the results similar to that described in fulton et al 1998 whereas in that algorithm reflectivity values were capped at 52 dbz here a fuzzy logic scheme was implemented for reflectivity values between 45 and 52 dbz the fuzzy logic was designed to reduce reflectivity values for points where hail was more likely to be present which in this case corresponded to zdr values below the threshold of 3 db for the trace techniques the minimum value allowed for zdr was 0 5 db this was implemented due to the range of μ values see eqs 4 and 5 below utilized within the program μ was allowed to vary between 5 and 16 resulting in a zdr range of 9 33 db to 0 47 db 13 km resolution model data were obtained at hourly intervals from ncei data for the events preceding may 2012 were from the rapid update cycle ruc numerical weather model which was replaced on 1 may 2012 by the rapid refresh rap both the ruc and the rap issued hourly forecasts for a multitude of parameters across much of north america this study used the initialization data for these models forecast for hour zero height temperature and relative humidity were the necessary fields data were obtained at pressure levels ranging from 1000 hpa to 700 hpa in 25 hpa intervals data for several major rainfall events were available during 2012 and 2013 in central missouri table 1 criteria for selection included availability of radar data and rain gauge data as well as storm type a variety of storm types was necessary to adequately evaluate the estimation methods notably the event that began on 31 august 2012 involved the remnants of hurricane isaac that passed over the area at the end of an exceptionally dry period the events of 7 september 2012 and 17 april 2013 contained some large hail evaluation of the effectiveness of radar related rainfall estimation techniques requires both rain gauge and radar data tipping bucket rain gauge data were obtained from nine locations shown in table 2 around central missouri maintained by the commercial agriculture automated weather station network managed by university of missouri extension and the university of missouri interdisciplinary hydrology laboratory hubbart et al 2010 indicated in the table are the coordinates of these sites as well as their distance from the national weather service radar klsx fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the site locations relative to each other and the radar each of the gauges provided observations at five minute intervals and these were aggregated to hourly totals which were then compared to radar retrievals over the same period 3 methodology 3 1 calculating drop size distribution rain drops reaching the surface range in size from roughly 0 to 6 0 mm in diameter this size is usually given in equivalent spherical drop diameter as the drops themselves become less spherical as they grow larger the ratio of vertical diameter a to horizontal diameter b is called the axis ratio a b the axis ratio shrinks as the equivalent spherical drop diameter increases the axis ratio formula used for this study is derived from beard and chuang 1987 and is shown in 2 2 a b 1 0048 0 00057 d 0 02628 d 2 0 003682 d 3 0 0001677 d 4 in 2 d is the equivalent spherical drop diameter in millimeters differential reflectivity or zdr is a value provided by dual polarized radars the differential reflectivity is defined by 3 z dr 10 log 10 z h z v where zh is the horizontal reflectivity and zv is the vertical reflectivity from 2 a drop size distribution resulting in an equivalent differential reflectivity can be estimated the gamma drop size distribution has been shown to correspond best to real world situations testud et al 2001 this drop size distribution is given by 4 n d n 0 d μ exp λ d where n d is the number of drops of diameter d per meter cubed per drop diameter interval the parameters of the equation are the intercept parameter n0 the shape parameter μ and the median drop size parameter λ to obtain a drop size distribution from just two parameters reflectivity and differential reflectivity a relationship between μ and λ must be assumed brandes et al 2004 found that the relationship shown in 5 provided the best description of this relationship 5 λ 0 0365 μ 2 0 735 μ 1 935 drop concentrations per m3 at discrete 0 01 mm intervals were calculated based on the drop size distribution from 5 assuming an n0 value of 1000 m 3 mm 1 µ from these concentrations predicted z and zdr values were obtained the zdr values were dependent only on μ and in this case unique as a consequence corresponding zdr and μ values were mapped out since adjusting the value of n0 altered the reflectivity without changing the differential reflectivity a value of n0 and μ could be found to match up with every possible z and zdr combination 3 2 drop motion and evaporation at the surface one might expect a certain concentration of drops of a particular size to calculate a rainfall rate a concentration for drops of all sizes is needed the tracing process therefore attempts to trace drops of all sizes to their respective points of origin however these drops will have different sizes at their origins than they will at the surface after they have been affected by evaporation along with evaporation calculating drop terminal velocity is also necessary for tracing drops to their origin for each site each day and each five minute time step 60 representative drop sizes were traced from the gauge site to their origins at radar beam cappi height the tracing was done in one second intervals every second the following parameters were recalculated for each individual drop using ruc model analysis fields interpolated between the available times closest to the radar time latitude longitude height pressure relative humidity temperature terminal velocity virtual temperature the vertical motion vector given to each drop was used to calculate a position one second in the past drop terminal velocity is dependent on a number of factors the most important being drop size and air density the equation used for drop terminal velocity was from van boxel 1998 6 v t ρ b ρ 0 4 9 65 1 exp 0 53 d for eq 6 ρ b is the standard atmospheric air density and ρ is the air density at the point of calculation the evaporation rate was used to calculate a drop size for that position calculation of the evaporation rate required estimation of the wet bulb temperature this was done using an iterative process estimation of the pressure which was needed for air density calculations was done using the hypsometric equation and several assumptions about the temperature lapse rate as described earlier model data was obtained at 25 hpa intervals the average virtual temperature of a layer is necessary to estimate its thickness given the virtual temperature at the top and bottom of the 25 hpa layer an average lapse rate can be calculated however the average virtual temperature given by this average lapse rate may not necessarily correspond to the thickness of the layer given by the model data to maintain the model estimated thickness of the layer as well as the apparent average lapse rate in the model the virtual temperatures at the top and bottom of the layer were adjusted these virtual temperature assumptions the predicted height of the drop and the hypsometric equation were then used to calculate the pressure the equation used to calculate drop evaporation comes from li and srivastava 2001 7 dm dt 4 π rd v f v δ ρ v the ventilation coefficient f v is calculated as 8 f v 0 78 0 308 ν d v 1 3 vd ν 1 2 in these equations m is the mass of the rain drop ν is the kinematic viscosity of air v is the terminal velocity d v is the diffusivity of water vapor in air r is the drop radius d is the drop diameter and δ ρ v is the difference in vapor density between the drop surface and the environment after the change in drop diameter was calculated based on the estimated mass loss a new motion vector and a new evaporation rate were then calculated for the new position these new values were averaged with the original values and used to calculate the drop s official estimated position and mass one second prior to the present this approach mitigated error introduced by the numerical approximation necessary for the tracing calculation for each five minute time step the trace calculations yielded data on the origins of 60 drop sizes ranging from 0 1 mm in diameter to 6 0 mm in diameter at 0 1 mm intervals these drops were sorted by their size at the surface as their size at point of origin varied considerably estimated points of origin were defined by two parameters drop size at point of origin and time for calculation of rainfall rate a higher resolution of drop size was used the drop sizes were further split into 591 categories still ranging from 0 10 mm in diameter to 6 00 mm in diameter but at 0 01 mm intervals the points of origin for the drop sizes at 0 01 mm intervals were found through linear interpolation of the lower resolution points of origin fig 2 illustrates the calculated change in drop diameter during the 2 km descent for various drop sizes the date selected for fig 2 was may 20 2013 while radar data were not obtained for the may 20 event mesoscale model data were acquired and the relevant tracing calculations were performed for this example the tracing process for the data in fig 2 was slightly different from the process used for other parts of this study in that horizontal drop movement due to wind was accounted for this may cause minor effects on total evaporation expected due to slight changes in the environment over the short distances involved once a time size and size interval for a drop reaching the surface were obtained the concentration of drops fitting those parameters was estimated using the drop size distribution derived from the corresponding radar data these concentrations were found at each of the eight surrounding points and interpolated linearly dimensions of latitude longitude and time the concentration of drops for each of the 591 drop sizes was obtained in this fashion and their contribution to the overall rainfall rate was estimated and summed to generate the final rain rate at the time step in question the rainfall rates at the beginning and end of each five minute interval were then averaged to determine the total rainfall during that period possible interactions between drops such as drop merging and splitting were not addressed in this study 3 3 trace method and zdr adjustments two different trace methods were used for this study the first was to simply assume the drops aloft instantly reached the ground with no drift or evaporation the second was calculated under the assumption that the drops took time to reach the ground and were affected by evaporation though not any horizontal drift various adjustments in zdr were also tested the reason for these adjustments was possible bias in zdr values noted by the nws hoban et al 2004 hoban et al 2004 reported on the assessment of zdr bias in nws radars and found biases of more than 0 5 db were not uncommon as the zdr observed for bragg scattering assumed to present a spherical target can be normally distributed around a mean that is offset from 0 db by this bias it is reasonable to test adjustments of 1 db or greater and we choose to include values up to 2 6 db to ensure that such adjustments are seen to be excessive increased zdr values indicate more non spherical hydrometeors suggesting that poorly calibrated zdr values are underestimating the oblateness of raindrops and hence the population of larger drops adjustments in zdr were also tested for the conventional formulas that relied on zdr 3 4 evaluation methods the analyses conducted for this study were based on two different categories of rainfall intensity gauge rainfall totals below 10 mm h 1 were classified as light to moderate intensity rain and gauge totals above 10 mm h 1 were classified as heavy rain it should be noted that this method for categorizing rainfall intensity is not perfect short high intensity events as well as events that are split between different hours may not be filtered out with this method however kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 identified 10 mm h 1 as the intensity above which evaporation becomes less significant in comparison to other dsd modification processes how method performance varied with average atmospheric humidity was a key subject of this study to determine humidity in the atmosphere meteorological variable values for the lowest layers of the atmosphere 800 1000 hpa were again obtained from the ruc and rap models on an hourly basis model values from a location near columbia missouri were used from these values an estimated evaporating power of this layer was obtained this was done by calculating the average rate of evaporation based on temperature terminal velocity and relative humidity for a hypothetical 1 mm diameter raindrop falling through the layer while remaining constant in size this same process was conducted with a series of 1000 standard atmosphere profiles with constant relative humidity values throughout the vertical layer each profile used a different relative humidity value ranging from 0 1 to 100 the evaporating powers of the model obtained layers were then matched with the closest corresponding evaporating power of the standard profiles resulting in a single equivalent relative humidity erh to represent the evaporating power of the modeled layer two methods of radar rainfall estimation technique performance based on erh were conducted the cumulative method and the sliding range method the cumulative method was based on pooling all pairs of radar estimated rainfall and rain gauge totals where the erh for the particular hour falls beneath a threshold as an alternative to the cumulative method for examining the effects of erh on radar estimated rainfall performance a sliding range method was developed to ensure a large enough sample of hourly radar estimated rainfall and rain gauge totals the humidity percentage marker on the x axis of the sliding range figures is indicative of all the relevant pairs where the average relative humidity in the lowest portion of the atmosphere was between plus and minus 15 of the indicated relative humidity percent for example the data point for 55 relative humidity includes all pairs where the relative humidity in the lower atmosphere was between 40 and 70 this sliding range means only the edges of the 55 to 85 range used in the sliding range figures are completely independent unlike for the cumulative method a weighting scheme was created for the sliding range method to mitigate the effects of the skewed observation distribution this ensured that the greater number of observations occurring at the upper end of the 30 sliding range did not have correspondingly greater influence on the results to determine the overall performance of each individual method for rainfall estimation two parameters were calculated the parameters chosen for analysis were fractional bias fb and fractional absolute difference fad 9 fb t r t g t g 10 fad t r t g t g in 9 and 10 t r is the total radar estimated rainfall t g is the total gauge rainfall and the brackets indicate averaging over all values pairs where the rain gauge recorded zero were disqualified for these rain gauges the minimum possible accumulation was 0 01 in or 0 254 mm all radar rainfall estimation techniques considered for evaluation in this study are shown in table 3 these radar rainfall estimation methods consisted of both conventional formulas and the trace techniques described above ten conventional radar rainfall formulas described in rgs05 were initially considered for evaluation five of these formulas were r z formulas and the other five were r z zdr formulas preliminary testing was conducted to eliminate the most poorly performing formulas this was done by calculating mean performance with respect to fad at all sliding range median erhs for both rainfall thresholds of the five r z formulas the z5 formula performed significantly worse than the other four at both thresholds and was not tested further not shown the other five conventional radar rainfall formulas were r z zdr formulas in preliminary testing these formulas were evaluated in a similar way to the r z formulas with the addition of a zdr adjustment parameter figs 3a and 3b shows the results from this testing at the two different rainfall thresholds the zzdr4 and zzdr5 formulas tended to perform worse than the other two methods for both tested thresholds and were not used for further evaluation fad performance with zdr adjustments between 2 0 and 0 6 db was calculated for the r z zdr formulas and a portion of this adjustment range is shown in figs 3a and 3b optimal performance occurred at roughly 0 6 db for the higher threshold and 0 6 db for the lower threshold though the slope suggests minor improvements in performance possible for higher adjustments beyond 0 6 db an adjustment of 0 db was chosen for further evaluation as fad performance at this adjustment was within roughly 1 of the optimal for both thresholds examined an optimal zdr adjustment for the trace techniques was also determined in preliminary testing figs 3a and 3b shows fad performance for the two trace techniques as a function of zdr adjustment the calculations in this figure were done using the same process used for the r z and r z zdr formulas for the evaporation trace technique an adjustment of 1 db was chosen for further analysis as fad values for this adjustment were within 1 of the optimal value for both thresholds optimal zdr adjustment for the no evaporation technique varied from 2 db for the higher threshold to 2 6 db for the lower threshold though the slope suggests possible minor further improvement with increasing db adjustment for the lower threshold a compromise value of 2 4 db was chosen for further analysis in this case the cause of the optimal zdr adjustment for the r z zdr formulas being much lower than for the evaporation trace technique may be related to differing base levels in bias for the two methods the r z zdr formulas showed more negative bias values than most of the standard r z formulas and thus a smaller zdr adjustment upward might be expected to result in improved performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 bias analysis 4 1 1 cumulative bias the observations used to calculate the performance statistics for the cumulative sections are not weighted in any way generally resulting in a greater relative influence for pairs where the erh is closer to the threshold value fig 5a shows the cumulative number of gauge radar observation pairs at each erh 1 increments split into gauge values below and above 10 mm in hourly precipitation fig 5b shows the non cumulative number of gauge radar pairs falling within each erh 1 increments also split into gauge values below and above 10 mm in hourly precipitation it is readily evident from these figures that a far greater number of observations occurred at higher erh values fig 6a shows the cumulative bias for gauge radar pairs where the gauge recorded less than 10 mm of hourly rainfall this is the type of rainfall that would theoretically be most affected by evaporation due to the smaller size of the drops and lower terminal velocity the shape for the e 1 technique is radically different from the no evaporation techniques in particular for all of the ne techniques the bias becomes decreasingly positive as erh increases whereas the e 1 scheme has a small bias at all erh ranges cumulative values at the lower end of equivalent rh scale come with the caveat of lower total number of observations the total number of pairs only approaches 100 at around the 73 erh mark nonetheless it is clear that at low erh the ne methods overestimate rainfall amounts and it is assumed that the overestimation is due to evaporation as the evaporation scheme shows little bias at low humidity fig 6b depicts the cumulative bias for all gauge radar pairs regardless of how much hourly rainfall was recorded by the gauge for this broader range of rainfall rates the e 1 method is seen to have a comparable bias performance to the other methods at lower humidities but appears to overestimate the evaporation resulting in underestimation of rain at the higher erh values its performance is comparable to the better r z algorithms for fig 6b a decreasing trend in bias as erh rises is still present in many of the methods that do not account for evaporation though at a much smaller magnitude possible explanations for this are discussed in the following section 4 1 2 sliding range bias fig 7a illustrates the sliding range method of bias performance evaluation for gauge radar pairs where the gauge total was below 10 mm h 1 a very clear pattern of decreases in bias as erh increases is present in this figure for the no evaporation techniques however the evaporation technique displays low bias across the entire range of erh fig 7b shows the same as 7a but for all gauge radar pairs all of the no evaporation techniques exhibit a reduction in bias from the 55 to 60 median erh range corresponding to all pairs where the erh fell within 40 70 and 45 75 respectively excluding the e 1 technique additional increases in erh only produced clear decreases for the non zdr dependent techniques bias for the e 1 technique generally increased as erh rose such that at higher erh its performance is among the best while at lower erh it appears to assess too much evaporation but still produce fair results when the bias performance of the various rainfall estimation methods for the heavier rain 10 mm hour is isolated it helps explain why the trends in bias as a function of erh are less clear when all the gauge radar pairs are included fig 8a shows the bias values for only the radar gauge pairs where the gauge value exceeded 10 mm while a decreasing trend in bias values as median erh increases is present from the 55 70 range bias values are still negative for heavier rain for all techniques even at very low erh values the negative bias seen with the e 1 method suggests that at low humidities the evaporation may be overestimated this may be a problem with the representation of the model humidity field over the course of the aggregation period of one hour or it is possible that the drop fall speed is underestimated if the fall speed is faster than is being modeled perhaps due to the effect of downdrafts then the drops will have less time than is assumed to undergo evaporation for this figure no weighting was done as the number of gauge radar pairs only ranged from 25 to 59 across the erh spectrum the percentage of all gauge radar pairs where the gauge value exceeded 10 mm is displayed in fig 8b the heavier gauge radar pairs are over represented at the lower end of the erh spectrum flattening the trend in bias when all gauge radar pairs are used it is worth noting that the techniques with the smallest trends in bias for gauge values exceeding 10 mm h 1 also have the least evident trends in bias for all gauge pairs overall from these figures it can be seen that the e 1 techniques has a more stable performance in terms of bias across the range of humidity conditions than is seen by any of the no evaporation techniques however it also appears that the e 1 method overestimates the evaporation of heavy rainfall at lower humidities this could be a result of the method not accounting for rapid moistening of the atmosphere during these events that is not captured by the model data used to characterize the environment 4 2 fad analysis 4 2 1 cumulative fad fig 9a shows the cumulative fad for gauge radar pairs where the gauge recorded less than 10 mm of hourly rainfall the trend is clear in fig 9a with an initial rapid decrease in fad for the no evaporation methods slowing as the erh threshold rises the e 1 technique is the best method by far at the lower erh thresholds in this case though the difference again drops as the erh threshold rises this suggests that the evaporation technique does a good job of assessing the evaporation and that the remaining errors are consistent and related to other sources of error the similarity in fad at high erh suggests that once the humidity is great enough to reduce the evaporation sufficiently then the performance converges this is an indication that the evaporation technique responds to the increased humidity to reduce evaporation in a realistic manner fig 9b is equivalent to 9a but for all gauge radar pairs for the no evaporation techniques a decreasing trend in fad is present as the erh threshold rises these figures show the cumulative performance of the e 1 technique remains superior to that of the no evaporation techniques until the 95 threshold is reached however the magnitude of difference narrows considerably as the erh threshold rises 4 2 2 sliding range fad fig 10a illustrates the sliding range method of fad performance evaluation for gauge radar pairs where the gauge total was below 10 mm h 1 as was the case with the corresponding cumulative graph the e 1 technique performed much better than the no evaporation techniques at the lower end of the erh spectrum this shows that not only does the evaporation scheme reduce bias in low erh conditions but that the absolute errors are also decreased fig 10b is equivalent to 10a but for all gauge radar pairs the e 1 technique largely performed best for median erh values below 75 and tended to perform worse as median erh rose with respect to fad all the conventional formulas exhibited an improvement in performance as median erh rose the trends in fig 10b are less clear than that in 10a indicating that including the heavier gauge totals did not just influence bias but also the other metrics of performance evaluation overall these results suggest that a lack of accounting for evaporation is responsible for a noticeable amount of the error associated with retrievals of rainfall rate from radar observations at ranges where the beam is high enough above the surface that evaporation would be expected to take place between the observation height and the surface 5 conclusions the results presented in the previous section indicate that evaporation plays an important role in radar rainfall estimation under the appropriate conditions both the fad and the bias demonstrate a dependence on the erh radar rainfall estimation techniques that assume a static amount of evaporation or more commonly no evaporation are subject to potentially significant limitations the radar beam increases in height as distance from the radar increases a consequence of this increase in height is that greater potential for evaporation of rain between the height of the beam and the ground exists at locations farther from the radar dynamically adjusting the expected amount of evaporation solely based on range from the radar would address this issue without requiring any inclusion of model data however differing amounts of evaporation based on different atmospheric conditions is a factor that can only be accounted for by inclusion of model data the conditions for which evaporation is most important are when the lower atmosphere is very dry the role of evaporation is particularly enhanced for lighter rainfall as seen in the bias and fad performance metrics from the previous section when all radar gauge pairs were included the difference in performance with respect to the fad metric grew narrower for dryer atmospheric conditions this was true for both the cumulative and sliding range methods of evaluation all tested methods tended to perform better with all radar gauge pairs included this improvement in performance is due to factors associated with heavier rainfall with larger hourly rainfall totals the noise associated with evaluating radar rainfall estimation performance on very short timescales is likely to be mitigated the larger drops seen in heavier rainfall are also less affected by evaporation and horizontal drift as shown in fig 8a for heavier gauge totals all radar rainfall estimation methods tended to underestimate the recorded rainfall influencing the trends in bias seen in figs 6b and 7b this was caused by the unequal distribution of heavier rainfall events across the erh spectrum the fad figures showed that the e 1 technique generally performed worse as erh rose one possible cause for this is a potential reduction in model accuracy for humid atmospheres there is also the issue of model bias and the handling of precipitation within the mesoscale model the scheme developed here is reliant on model humidity fields yet these fields are affected by the presence of the precipitation which will produce a rapid evolution of the humidity field that may not be captured within the model this may also explain how the quality of the results varies as the erh threshold rises use of a finer model temporal resolution 15 min as opposed to 1 h may help mitigate problems associated with model accuracy further improvement may be realized by fine tuning the modeled drop size distribution to better match real world conditions there are a number of additional areas in which we are exploring improvements to this work a better representation of the starting level of the observed drop size distribution would be obtained by using the actual beam height at the range in question while the evaporation process may benefit by consideration of the cloud base height as evaporation should not take place above that level however one would expect that the model fields should identify where the atmosphere is saturated and preclude the scheme from finding drop evaporation while in cloud this leads to a further issue worthy of investigation that of consistency between the evaporation scheme and the model fields in the future we intend to assess whether changes in atmospheric humidity represented within the mesoscale model used are consistent with the evaporation calculated by the trace scheme one method of testing the method further would be to use sites closer to the radar and investigating whether the drop size distribution evolves with height as predicted for example one could replicate the scheme using the reflectivity and zdr from a 2 km cappi and compare z and zdr values computed from the dsd calculated to exist within the evaporation scheme at a height of 1 km alternatively the calculated dsd could be compared to that measured at the surface with a disdrometer acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the
