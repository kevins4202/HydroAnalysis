22035,local discontinuities and stress concentrations from pitting corrosion on a component can significantly affect the mechanical properties and failure mode of a structure even though the total mass loss from pitting is not prominent to analyse these problems experimental specimens are created from high strength steel dh36 tests are performed to analyse the compressive behaviour of plate specimens with different dimensions and pitting crater parameters and the influence of the above parameters on the uniaxial compressive mechanical properties and failure mode of the test specimens are investigated furthermore the volume loss rate is found to be the most suitable damage indicator for describing the degradation in mechanical properties of specimens with pitting based on the test results and classical constitutive model a linear exponential model for strength failure specimens and a bilinear model for buckling failure specimens are created using the volume loss rate as a variable the compressive mechanical properties of plate specimens with different degrees of pitting damage can be predicted with these models the results show that under compression the specimen with pitting damage is more likely to exhibit buckling failure than the undamaged specimen especially when the undamaged specimen is in or close to the critical buckling state keywords pitting damage uniaxial compressive behaviour mechanically induced pits failure mode generalized constitutive model 1 introduction due to long term exposure to harsh marine environments ships and ocean engineering structures will inevitably corrode corrosion is one of the main causes of structural failure in old marine structures wang 2008 in addition to cross sectional area loss in the structure corrosion can also lead to a change in its mechanical properties and ultimately a decrease in its strength capacity sultana et al 2015 compared with general corrosion pitting corrosion is distributed more non uniformly and sparsely in appearance however because of local stress concentrations and local discontinuities the pitting corrosion will causes a significant strength reduction and variation and even changes structural failure mode wang y et al 2014 wang r et al 2018 the shape diameter depth and distribution pattern are the basic parameters of corrosion pitting although corrosion pitting has various shapes and are often simulated as cylinders spherical crowns cones and so on wang y et al 2014 studies have found that pitting shape has little effect on the mechanical behaviour of a plate paik et al 2003a wang 2008 according to the long term measurement results of ships and platforms the maximum diameter of a pitting crater is approximately 80 mm and the maximum pitting depth is approximately 20 mm daidola et al 1997 the distribution of pitting has a certain influence on the mechanical properties of components and structures generally a uniform distribution or random distribution function is used to simulate an approximate pitting distribution zhang y et al 2017 wang r et al 2018 to characterize the initial damage caused by pitting corrosion in an efficient way wang y et al 2014 some indicators defined based on the geometrical configuration of pits were proposed e g corrosion volume loss rate degree of pit corrosion dop intensity section area loss rate and thickness loss although pitting corrosion typically has a localized development pattern its influence on damage development sometimes is global and even more significant than general corrosion pitting corrosion will generate not only a decrease in strength and bearing capacity of steel but also a significant decline in material ductility caused by local damage and stress concentrations nakai et al 2004 for specimens subjected to compressive loads pitting damage may influence the failure mode thus it is necessary to set up a constitutive model of pitted steel under compressive loads there are many studies regarding constitutive models of steel the modified power law model kato 1990 can simulate the stress strain relationship of a material with a yield platform however this model was defined by eight parameters which makes the model too complicated based on test data a three stage model for simulating low carbon steel with a yield platform was proposed esmaeily and xiao 2005 because of the obvious distinction in the mechanical model of pitted steel from the general steel constitutive model it is necessary to revise the classical theoretical model according to the degree of pitting corrosion yao et al 2018 the r o model ramberg and osgood 1943 and the various improved versions of the model are widely used to appropriately describe the constitutive relation of elastoplastic materials ma et al 2018b due to the local characteristics and the complexity of parameters of pitting corrosion the study of the constitutive model of pitted steel especially pitted steel subjected to compressive loading is still insufficient pitting craters are often generated by marine immersion direct mechanical drilling or electrochemical corrosion processes in the laboratory yao et al 2018 the marine immersion method melchers 2004 is close to the state of nature but the preparation requires a long time in particular because of the randomness of natural corrosion when the influence of parameters of pitting craters is studied it is difficult to obtain the desired pitting dimensions although electrochemical corrosion a commonly used method ma et al 2018a can be quickly realized in the laboratory this method has the problem as the marine immersion method the pitting dimensions are not controlled the mechanical drilling approach is another approximate simulation method for pitting creation although some differences are observed in the configuration of the pitting craters generated from electrochemical corrosion and mechanical drilling the stress vs strain curves from the two tested specimens by yao et al 2018 agree well with each other even with the same dops up to 58 3 if the influence of configuration of corrosion pits on the mechanical behaviour is insignificant the mechanical drilling could be a preferable for the generation of pitting corrosion due to its desirable controllability in the corrosion related parameters otherwise the electrochemical corrosion method should be employed instead based on the above analysis the high strength steel abs dh36 commonly used in offshore platforms is selected to design test specimens with and without mechanically induced pitting to illustrate the change in the compressive mechanical properties of a pitted component as clearly as possible the pitting corrosion of the specimen is set to single pitting and the effects of the pitting distribution and interaction are not considered in addition different specimen dimensions and pitting craters are designed to research the corresponding uniaxial compressive mechanical properties and failure modes four typical corrosion damage indicators are used to estimate the general trend of property parameters in terms of pitting damage and then the most suitable indicator is selected to describe the degradation in mechanical properties of the pitted specimens eventually based on the test results and a classical constitutive model a generalized constitutive model of a pitted specimen under compressive loading is created from this model the compressive mechanical properties of plate specimens with different degrees of pitting damage could be predicted 2 experimental arrangements 2 1 material and specimen parameters all the tested specimens were machined from high strength steel dh36 which has been widely used in chinese offshore platforms according to the quality certificate provided by the steel manufacturer wuyang iron and steel co ltd 2014 the dh36 steel was certificated by the abs classification the chemical composition and claimed tensile properties of the dh36 steel provided by the manufacture are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively it is noteworthy that as discussed later the yield strength ultimate strength and elongation of the dh36 steel plate tested in the experiment exhibit a significant deviation from the claimed ones it might be caused by the flame cutting and nearly five year exposure to the aggressive environmental conditions before the experiment in view of the significant deviation the measured mechanical properties are used herein as a result of the difference in test conditions between the laboratory and the steel mill the mechanical properties provided by the steel mill are used only for reference according to the astm test standard astm e9 09 2009 the specimen was designed as a plate to consider the effects of different parameters of pitting and the condition of the compression testing machine the size of the specimen was slightly changed from the recommended size in the astm test standard the specimen consists of a clamping section a curved transition section and a parallel test section details of the shape and dimensions of the specimen are shown in fig 1 to illustrate the change in mechanical properties of the components as clearly as possible the effects of pitting distribution and pitting interaction were neglected therefore pitting damage was set to single pitting and each pitting characteristic parameter was selected based on measured statistical data paik et al 2004 because the mechanical properties are less influenced by pitting shape paik et al 2003a a conical pitting crater is selected to simulate the corrosion pitting the specimen and pitting parameters length a width b thickness t and pitting diameter d and pitting depth h in table 3 are the nominal values dop v loss v 0 and a a 0 are calculated by the nominal values of related parameters as the measured values of a b t d and h using a vernier caliper are observed to deviate only within 0 02 mm thus the nominal values of a b t d h and resulting dop v loss v 0 and a a 0 were used herein 2 2 test setup the mechanical drilling method is used to create the pitting damage in the test although some deviations in the configuration of pitting craters are observed in corrosion pitting and mechanically induced pitting the stress strain relations are highly similar yao et al 2018 indicating the efficiency of this practical mechanical treatment a uniaxial compression test was carried out with an sds 100 electro hydraulic servo static and dynamic tester with a load capacity of 100 kn as shown in fig 2 the input and output data of compressive loads displacements and strains were collected in real time by a static strain test system with a data acquisition frequency of 10 hz to avoid damage to the test machine from the specimen buckling under a large compressive load 0 2 is set as the upper bound of the strain the test is loaded in displacement control mode at room temperature and the loading rate is 0 127 mm min the test process is conducted in accordance with the astm standard for compression testing astm e9 09 2009 3 analysis of test results 3 1 test results for the undamaged specimens undamaged specimens without pitting were subjected to uniaxial tensile and compressive loading and then the stress strain curves were obtained as shown in fig 3 table 4 provides details of the test results the yield strength σ y and ultimate strength σ u of undamaged specimen t5 are 383 71 mpa and 533 67 mpa respectively slightly different from the claimed values by the steel manufacturer see table 2 due to the flame cutting for the small pieces used in the experiment and over five year environmental exposure after production compared with the tension specimen the compression specimen exhibited a more complicated and various failure modes as the thickness of a specimen decreases the failure mode of a specimen tends to change from strength failure to buckling failure the stress strain curve of a strength failure has an obvious yielding plateau and strain hardening segment the buckling specimen will reach the ultimate strength at or far below the yield point and then the stress strain curve of this specimen descends rapidly in addition as corrosion develops the strain length l d that is defined as the interval between the yield strain ε y the lower yield point strain and the ultimate strength strain ε u i e l d ε u ε y tends to decrease gradually and becomes invisible when buckling occurs the strain length in the strain hardening segment in the buckling failure specimen is approximately 26 of that in the strength failure specimen the ultimate strength of the bucking failure specimen is approximately 76 of that in the tension specimens the stress and strain marked in the figure were nominal stress σ n and nominal strain ε n as calculated by eq 1 1 σ n p a 0 ε n δ l l 0 where σ n and ε n are the stress and strain of the steel respectively p is the tensile or compressive load a 0 is the initial cross sectional area of the parallel test section of the specimen l 0 is the initial length of the parallel test section of the specimen and δl is the displacement of the parallel test section of the specimen which is equal to the length of the tested section of a loaded specimen l minus l 0 in contrast to the nominal stress σ n the true stress σ t is equal to the compressive force p divided by the corresponding transient cross sectional area of a loaded specimen a usually a is larger than a 0 therefore σ n is smaller than σ t the nominal strain should also be replaced by the true strain ε t which is determined by an integration of the transient compressive length over the entire loading process thus it is more accurate to analyse the compressive properties of the tested specimens by using the true stress strain σ t ε t relation as used herein yao et al 2018 2 σ t p a p a 0 1 ε n 3 ε t l 0 l 1 x d x ln l l 0 ln 1 ε n 3 2 effect of length thickness ratio a t on compressive mechanical properties 1 effect of thickness on compressive mechanical properties the stress strain curves of the specimens are illustrated in fig 4 in 8 groups of different thicknesses the thickness of the test section varies from 3 mm to 9 mm and the length and width were kept unchanged in the test i e the length thickness ratio a t varied from 1 5 to 5 the yield plateau gradually shortened and disappeared with decreasing thickness fig 4 the changes in the compressive mechanical properties i e elastic modulus e yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and strain length in the strain hardening segment l d of the specimens with increasing t are illustrated in fig 5 to clarify the relativity of the parameters with increasing t the data are normalized with respect to their initial values correspondingly fig 5 shows that the ultimate strength and the strain length in the strain hardening segment exhibit a distinct dependency on t whereas the dependency of the elastic modulus and the yield strength on t is negligible when t reaches 3 mm a decrease of over 80 is observed for the strain length in the strain hardening segment thus it can be concluded that the ultimate strength and ductility margin of steel are more sensitive to specimen thickness fig 4 illustrates that the reduction in the thickness of a specimen may change the specimen failure mode in the test most specimens exhibit strength failure when a t is less than 5 and buckling failure when a t is greater than 5 obviously a t may be one of the factors governing the compressive failure mode a comparison of the compression process of the specimens with two different failure modes figs 6 7 shows that their appearances are very similar and difficult to distinguish during the test in the elastic segment the appearance of the specimen changed slightly with increasing load as shown in fig 6 b when the stress of the two specimens is close to the buckling stress or yield stress the edge of the pitting diameter is wrinkled in the horizontal direction when the stress levels of the two specimens t3 and t8 are approaching the buckling or yielding strength the horizontal edge along the diameter of the pitting starts to wrinkle and tend to concave around the pitting see figs 6 d and 7 d the difference between the two specimens can be seen from the corresponding stress strain curve the maximum stress in a buckling failure specimen reaches its yield stress rapidly 400 mpa 60 s the strain hardening segment is very short and soon the stress reaches the ultimate strength of 424 67 mpa 164 s which is far below the yield strength of dh36 steel fig 6 e later the stress drops dramatically to a quarter of the yield strength in contrast a strength failure specimen exhibits a significant strain hardening segment after reaching the yield strength the ultimate strength of 616 74 mpa will be reached after a long time 462 s thereafter the strength failure specimen maintains a high level of stress for a long time until destroyed fig 7 d the strain segment relative to the strain hardening segment of a strength failure specimen is approximately 6 9 times that of a buckling failure specimen 2 supplementary test of the effect of a t on the failure mode in addition to further demonstrate the influence of a t on the compressive failure mode specimens with a t of 3 5 are tested by changing the length of the test section of the specimen the stress strain curves are shown in fig 8 the failure mode of a25b25t5 a t is 5 and the thickness is 5 mm is strength failure thus the failure mode is not directly caused by a t and the compressive failure mode is more related to thickness in addition the yield strength elastic modulus ultimate strength and ductility of the strain hardening segment are not sensitive to the length of the test section 3 3 effect of pitting characteristic parameters on compressive mechanical properties although the cross sectional area of a specimen cannot be greatly reduced by pitting the local properties and stress concentrations of pitting will affect the mechanical performance of a specimen to quantitatively study the influence of pitting diameter and depth a mechanical drilling method is used to generate a single pitting crater at the midpoint of the test section 1 effect of pitting depth and diameter on compressive mechanical properties an image of tested specimens with different mechanically induced pits is shown in fig 9 figs 10 11 show that the mechanical behaviours of steel deteriorate to varying degrees as the pitting damage increased the treatment can clearly determine the influence of pitting damage on the mechanical properties of steel figs 10 and 11 present the stress strain curves of specimens with pitting craters of different depths and diameters in which all of the specimens exhibit strength failures the stress and strain of the pitted specimen are calculated from the original cross sectional area and the original length of the test section respectively thus it is reasonable to call generalized stress and generalized strain the compressive mechanical properties elastic modulus yield strength ultimate strength and strain length in the strain hardening segment of the specimens degrade slightly with increasing pitting degree figs 12 and 13 to clarify the degradation degree of the parameters with increasing pitting degree values are normalized with respect to their initial values without pitting correspondingly i e the maximum value of each parameter as shown in figs 12 and 13 among all the parameters the strain length in the strain hardening segment exhibits the lowest degradation with increasing d or h the decreasing rates of the other properties are much higher but there are not distinct differences between the other properties 2 influence of pitting damage on the compressive failure mode the test results above show that although the mechanical properties of a specimen can be affected by pitting damage the failure mode is not changed while the specimen is obviously strength failure even if the dop reaches 68 4 and the pitting depth reaches penetration the failure mode of a specimen is still strength damage the blue curve in fig 10 to study the influence of pitting damage on the compressive failure mode the specimens close to buckling failure are tested the specimen with a 3 2 mm thickness exhibits strength failure whereas the specimen with a 3 mm thickness exhibits buckling failure after trial and error however the stress strain curve of the 3 2 mm specimen shows that this sample is on the verge of exhibiting buckling failure as shown in fig 14 a pitting crater of 14 mm diameter and 3 2 mm depth is generated on the 3 2 mm specimen via the mechanical drilling approach and then the specimen exhibits buckling under compressive loading the red curve in fig 14 a comparison of the curves in fig 14 shows that although the failure modes of t3 2 and t3 are obviously different which are both undamaged specimens the curves and mechanical properties elastic modulus yield strength and ultimate strength of these specimens are highly similar the pitting on specimen t3 2 changes its failure mode and mechanical properties the ultimate strength is reduced by 32 and the strain length in the strain hardening segment nearly disappears apparently the specimen with pitting craters is easier to fail in buckling due to the influence of eccentricity however the failure mode is more sensitive to specimen thickness than the pitting crater parameters the variation in the failure mode of the compression specimen is not suddenly but gradual with the variation in damage 4 selection of comprehensive corrosion damage indicators the maximum depth of pitting corrosion h max iacs 2006 cross section area loss rate a a 0 paik et al 2003b dop zhang j et al 2017 and volume loss rate v loss v 0 zhang y et al 2017 are usually applied to evaluate the degree of corrosion induced damage the expressions of the four indicators and their related parameters are listed in table 5 note that h max is only capable of describing corrosion pitting depth and irrespective of other pitting parameters and specimen dimensions since dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 are all dimensionless h max is divided by t to obtain h t the thickness loss rate of pitting damage so as to compare with the other indicators obviously dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 contain more parameters with respect to pitting and specimen dimensions they can provide more comprehensive evaluations about the degree of corrosion induced damage fig 15 shows that to determine an indicator i e dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 and h t which is feasible for evaluating the degree of corrosion induced damage the relativity of the mechanical parameters and four indicators are investigated for that purpose an additional twelve sets of specimens were tested which comprised specimens with an 8 mm thickness and different pitting diameters and depths and specimens with a 3 2 mm thickness and different pitting diameters and depths the detailed parameters of the specimens are shown in table 6 the efficiencies of the four indicators are compared in terms of damage characterization to clarify the degradation degree of the parameters with increasing pitting degree the values are normalized with respect to their initial values as shown in fig 15 the goodness of fit of all the four indicators is not desirable for the case of the elastic modulus and strain length in the strain hardening segment although v loss v 0 and a a 0 is comparatively acceptable as for the case of the yield strength and ultimate strength which are more seriously concerned among the mechanical properties v loss v 0 and a a 0 are superior to the other two indicators especially v loss v 0 thus v loss v 0 is selected as the indicator for estimate corrosion damage degree in the follow up study in addition based on the test results the influence parameters on failure mode of a compression specimen are not only the dimension of pitting but also the dimension of specimen according to the parameters analysis of the four indicators shown in table 5 v loss v 0 includes more parameters and is more comprehensive than the others dop includes the diameter of pits the length and width of specimen test section but not includes the thickness of test section and the depth of pits which are significant for failure mode fig 15 shows that the regression relations for all concerned properties with the four indicators and among the four indicators v loss v 0 is most suitable for describing the changes in the compression mechanical properties with increasing pitting damage degree fig 15 also shows that the test data are more sensitive to v loss v 0 especially the yield strength and the ultimate strength indicating a desirable correlation between the test data and the regression results for any case the observations from the experiment consist with those in other similar studies wang 2008 jiang and soares 2012 zhang y et al 2017 among the four corrosion damage indicators i e dop a a 0 v loss v 0 and h t the mechanical properties of the tested specimens have exhibited higher sensitivity to v loss v 0 than others it is because that the indicator of v loss v 0 not only reflects the dual influence of pitting diameter and depth but also reflects the influence of the geometrical parameters of the tested specimens thus the indicator of v loss v 0 can simultaneously account for the reduction in cross section and the localized stress field around the pitting corrosion along the compression direction comparatively dop is applicable for the case where corrosion pits are uniformly distributed over the surface of a steel component e g steel plate saad eldeen and soares 2009 jiang and soares 2013 it cannot address the influence of uneven depths among corrosion pits the indicator of a a 0 is more suitable for the specimens subjected to tension nakai et al 2006 ahmmad and sumi 2010 in this case it can well account for the stress concentration around a corrosion pit the simplest indicator i e h t can be applied only in the case where the depth of a steel component is uniformly corroded 5 generalized constitutive model of dh36 steel with pitting under compressive loading according to the analysis presented above v loss v 0 is selected as the variable of the generalized constitutive model of a pitted specimen under compressive loading 5 1 bilinear constitutive model of buckling failure the bilinear generalized constitutive model corresponding to buckling failure is developed as a function of v loss v 0 fig 16 in fig 16 ε 1 and σ 1 are the initial strain and stress of steel i e ε 1 σ 1 0 e 0 σ 0 l d0 and v 0 are the elastic modulus yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and test section volume of the undamaged specimen respectively k 1 is the elastic modulus of the pitting specimen which can be determined by variable v loss v 0 and e 0 ε y σ y l d and v loss are the yield strain yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and volume loss of the pitting specimen respectively which can all be determined by the variable v loss v 0 of a pitting specimen respectively ε u σ u and k 2 which can be obtained from the formula in fig 16 are the ultimate strain ultimate strength and slope of the strain hardening segment of a pitting specimen the elastic segment of the curves can be well simulated by hooke s law i e σ eε due to the short length of the inelastic segment of a buckling failure curve the strain hardening stage is likely to be described with a linear relationship the replacement of the nonlinear strain hardening segments of the specimens with numerically efficient linear segments can result in a reasonable safety margin fig 17 the linear segments are mathematically expressed as σ σ y k 2 ε ε y where k 2 and ε y are the strain hardening stiffness and yield strain respectively the generalized stress strain curves of the abs dh36 specimens with different v loss v 0 values are presented in fig 18 which are obtained from the constitutive model 5 2 linear exponential constitutive model of compressive strength failure the bilinear generalized stress strain curve proposed above is numerically efficient and specialized for buckling failure however for strength failure the nonlinear strain hardening segment must be simulated more accurately this section presents some procedures to determine the stress strain relations of the nonlinear strain hardening segment through the combination of a theoretical expression form with a parametric determination process from the test data the improved ramberg osgood ramberg and osgood 1943 model yao et al 2018 is selected here to describe the stress strain curve of strength failure specimens before the curve reaches the ultimate strength the linear segments are described by hooke s law 4 σ e ε the nonlinear strain hardening segments are described by the following expression 5 σ k ε n where ε is strain σ is stress e is the elastic modulus k is the strength related coefficient and n is an exponent accounting for the strain hardening effect both k and n depend on material properties k e k 1 n and n 1 n the coefficients k and n are determined by the following parametric regression analysis based on the test data fig 19 regression analyses are carried out to determine the coefficients n and k based on the test data fig 19 shows that the coefficients k and n exhibit distinct dependency on v loss v 0 as one of the strain hardening parameters the coefficient n is also an effective measure of necking resistance a desirable agreement with the test data can be achieved by the proposed generalized stress strain curves especially for those expressed in the linear exponential form shown in fig 20 to obtain the constitutive model the initial point the yield point and ultimate strength point in test data have to be determined firstly when the generalized constitutive model is developed the initial point and the ultimate strength point are easily captured as shown in fig 21 the accurate yield point can be determined by the extension line of elastic segment and yield segment in addition to the proposed expressions for the coefficients k and n figs 19 fig 20 gives the suggested relations between v loss v 0 and the elastic modulus e strain hardening stiffness k 2 yield strength σ y yield strain ε y ultimate strength σ u and peak strain ε u the curves are described by the expressions of σ eε and σ k ε n for the elastic segment and nonlinear strain hardening segments respectively in fig 20 ε 1 and σ 1 are the initial strain and stress of steel i e ε 1 σ 1 0 e 0 σ 0 l d0 and v 0 are the elastic modulus yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and test section volume of the undamaged specimen respectively k 1 is the elastic modulus of the pitting specimen which can be determined by variable v loss v 0 and e 0 in similar yield strength yield strain ultimate strength and ultimate strain can all be determined by the variable v loss v 0 of a pitting specimen fig 22 illustrates the linear exponential generalized stress strain curves of the abs dh36 pitted specimens with different v loss v 0 using the regression coefficients n and k compared with the test results the linear exponential model is satisfactory for simulating the strain hardening stage completely fig 22 fig 23 illustrated the comparison of generalized constitutive model of buckling and strength failure specimen with the same corrosion damage degree the yield strength of the buckling specimen is far below that of the strength failure specimen the strain length in the strain hardening segment of a buckling specimen is approximate sixth to tenth of a strength failure specimen since the strain length of a buckling specimen is so short the slope of the strain hardening segment of it is bigger than a strength failure specimen 6 conclusions a compression test of dh36 specimens is carried out to study the influence of specimen dimensions and pitting crater parameters on the resultant mechanical properties and failure modes bilinear and linear exponential generalized stress strain curves for specimens with mechanically induced pitting damage that exhibit two different failure modes are proposed based on the test results the main conclusions are as follows 1 by changing the thickness and width of the specimen without pitting the compressive failure mode is most affected by the absolute thickness of the specimen mechanically induced pits have little effect on the compressive failure mode pitting will facilitate specimen failure in buckling when the specimen is in or close to the critical buckling state therefore the compressive failure mode of a specimen is mainly determined by the specimen dimensions 2 considering the diameter and depth of pitting craters the relationships between the damage indicators of corrosion degree and the compressive mechanical properties of dh36 specimens are obtained all the mechanical properties of dh36 specimens have different degrees of damage degradation as pitting damage increases in comparison to the small effect of mechanically induced pits on the generalized elastic modulus of steel pitting has a substantial influence on the generalized yield strength and ultimate strength based on the regression results the mechanical properties have a higher sensitivity to v loss v 0 among the four typical corrosion damage indicators 3 based on the test results a bilinear generalized constitutive model for buckling failure specimens is proposed for the design purpose because the stress strain curves of a buckling failure specimen have a very short ductile length the nonlinear strain hardening segment is replaced by a linear segment which is computationally efficient and is also shown to be acceptable for reserving a reasonable degree of safety margin a linear exponential generalized constitutive model for strength failure specimens is proposed the ramberg osgood expression was used to characterize the nonlinear strain hardening segment of the stress strain curves of the abs dh36 specimen with different v loss v 0 values due to the limitation in the size of the test specimens the conclusions are more accurate in predicting the mechanical properties for specimens with similar lengths and widths credit

22035,local discontinuities and stress concentrations from pitting corrosion on a component can significantly affect the mechanical properties and failure mode of a structure even though the total mass loss from pitting is not prominent to analyse these problems experimental specimens are created from high strength steel dh36 tests are performed to analyse the compressive behaviour of plate specimens with different dimensions and pitting crater parameters and the influence of the above parameters on the uniaxial compressive mechanical properties and failure mode of the test specimens are investigated furthermore the volume loss rate is found to be the most suitable damage indicator for describing the degradation in mechanical properties of specimens with pitting based on the test results and classical constitutive model a linear exponential model for strength failure specimens and a bilinear model for buckling failure specimens are created using the volume loss rate as a variable the compressive mechanical properties of plate specimens with different degrees of pitting damage can be predicted with these models the results show that under compression the specimen with pitting damage is more likely to exhibit buckling failure than the undamaged specimen especially when the undamaged specimen is in or close to the critical buckling state keywords pitting damage uniaxial compressive behaviour mechanically induced pits failure mode generalized constitutive model 1 introduction due to long term exposure to harsh marine environments ships and ocean engineering structures will inevitably corrode corrosion is one of the main causes of structural failure in old marine structures wang 2008 in addition to cross sectional area loss in the structure corrosion can also lead to a change in its mechanical properties and ultimately a decrease in its strength capacity sultana et al 2015 compared with general corrosion pitting corrosion is distributed more non uniformly and sparsely in appearance however because of local stress concentrations and local discontinuities the pitting corrosion will causes a significant strength reduction and variation and even changes structural failure mode wang y et al 2014 wang r et al 2018 the shape diameter depth and distribution pattern are the basic parameters of corrosion pitting although corrosion pitting has various shapes and are often simulated as cylinders spherical crowns cones and so on wang y et al 2014 studies have found that pitting shape has little effect on the mechanical behaviour of a plate paik et al 2003a wang 2008 according to the long term measurement results of ships and platforms the maximum diameter of a pitting crater is approximately 80 mm and the maximum pitting depth is approximately 20 mm daidola et al 1997 the distribution of pitting has a certain influence on the mechanical properties of components and structures generally a uniform distribution or random distribution function is used to simulate an approximate pitting distribution zhang y et al 2017 wang r et al 2018 to characterize the initial damage caused by pitting corrosion in an efficient way wang y et al 2014 some indicators defined based on the geometrical configuration of pits were proposed e g corrosion volume loss rate degree of pit corrosion dop intensity section area loss rate and thickness loss although pitting corrosion typically has a localized development pattern its influence on damage development sometimes is global and even more significant than general corrosion pitting corrosion will generate not only a decrease in strength and bearing capacity of steel but also a significant decline in material ductility caused by local damage and stress concentrations nakai et al 2004 for specimens subjected to compressive loads pitting damage may influence the failure mode thus it is necessary to set up a constitutive model of pitted steel under compressive loads there are many studies regarding constitutive models of steel the modified power law model kato 1990 can simulate the stress strain relationship of a material with a yield platform however this model was defined by eight parameters which makes the model too complicated based on test data a three stage model for simulating low carbon steel with a yield platform was proposed esmaeily and xiao 2005 because of the obvious distinction in the mechanical model of pitted steel from the general steel constitutive model it is necessary to revise the classical theoretical model according to the degree of pitting corrosion yao et al 2018 the r o model ramberg and osgood 1943 and the various improved versions of the model are widely used to appropriately describe the constitutive relation of elastoplastic materials ma et al 2018b due to the local characteristics and the complexity of parameters of pitting corrosion the study of the constitutive model of pitted steel especially pitted steel subjected to compressive loading is still insufficient pitting craters are often generated by marine immersion direct mechanical drilling or electrochemical corrosion processes in the laboratory yao et al 2018 the marine immersion method melchers 2004 is close to the state of nature but the preparation requires a long time in particular because of the randomness of natural corrosion when the influence of parameters of pitting craters is studied it is difficult to obtain the desired pitting dimensions although electrochemical corrosion a commonly used method ma et al 2018a can be quickly realized in the laboratory this method has the problem as the marine immersion method the pitting dimensions are not controlled the mechanical drilling approach is another approximate simulation method for pitting creation although some differences are observed in the configuration of the pitting craters generated from electrochemical corrosion and mechanical drilling the stress vs strain curves from the two tested specimens by yao et al 2018 agree well with each other even with the same dops up to 58 3 if the influence of configuration of corrosion pits on the mechanical behaviour is insignificant the mechanical drilling could be a preferable for the generation of pitting corrosion due to its desirable controllability in the corrosion related parameters otherwise the electrochemical corrosion method should be employed instead based on the above analysis the high strength steel abs dh36 commonly used in offshore platforms is selected to design test specimens with and without mechanically induced pitting to illustrate the change in the compressive mechanical properties of a pitted component as clearly as possible the pitting corrosion of the specimen is set to single pitting and the effects of the pitting distribution and interaction are not considered in addition different specimen dimensions and pitting craters are designed to research the corresponding uniaxial compressive mechanical properties and failure modes four typical corrosion damage indicators are used to estimate the general trend of property parameters in terms of pitting damage and then the most suitable indicator is selected to describe the degradation in mechanical properties of the pitted specimens eventually based on the test results and a classical constitutive model a generalized constitutive model of a pitted specimen under compressive loading is created from this model the compressive mechanical properties of plate specimens with different degrees of pitting damage could be predicted 2 experimental arrangements 2 1 material and specimen parameters all the tested specimens were machined from high strength steel dh36 which has been widely used in chinese offshore platforms according to the quality certificate provided by the steel manufacturer wuyang iron and steel co ltd 2014 the dh36 steel was certificated by the abs classification the chemical composition and claimed tensile properties of the dh36 steel provided by the manufacture are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively it is noteworthy that as discussed later the yield strength ultimate strength and elongation of the dh36 steel plate tested in the experiment exhibit a significant deviation from the claimed ones it might be caused by the flame cutting and nearly five year exposure to the aggressive environmental conditions before the experiment in view of the significant deviation the measured mechanical properties are used herein as a result of the difference in test conditions between the laboratory and the steel mill the mechanical properties provided by the steel mill are used only for reference according to the astm test standard astm e9 09 2009 the specimen was designed as a plate to consider the effects of different parameters of pitting and the condition of the compression testing machine the size of the specimen was slightly changed from the recommended size in the astm test standard the specimen consists of a clamping section a curved transition section and a parallel test section details of the shape and dimensions of the specimen are shown in fig 1 to illustrate the change in mechanical properties of the components as clearly as possible the effects of pitting distribution and pitting interaction were neglected therefore pitting damage was set to single pitting and each pitting characteristic parameter was selected based on measured statistical data paik et al 2004 because the mechanical properties are less influenced by pitting shape paik et al 2003a a conical pitting crater is selected to simulate the corrosion pitting the specimen and pitting parameters length a width b thickness t and pitting diameter d and pitting depth h in table 3 are the nominal values dop v loss v 0 and a a 0 are calculated by the nominal values of related parameters as the measured values of a b t d and h using a vernier caliper are observed to deviate only within 0 02 mm thus the nominal values of a b t d h and resulting dop v loss v 0 and a a 0 were used herein 2 2 test setup the mechanical drilling method is used to create the pitting damage in the test although some deviations in the configuration of pitting craters are observed in corrosion pitting and mechanically induced pitting the stress strain relations are highly similar yao et al 2018 indicating the efficiency of this practical mechanical treatment a uniaxial compression test was carried out with an sds 100 electro hydraulic servo static and dynamic tester with a load capacity of 100 kn as shown in fig 2 the input and output data of compressive loads displacements and strains were collected in real time by a static strain test system with a data acquisition frequency of 10 hz to avoid damage to the test machine from the specimen buckling under a large compressive load 0 2 is set as the upper bound of the strain the test is loaded in displacement control mode at room temperature and the loading rate is 0 127 mm min the test process is conducted in accordance with the astm standard for compression testing astm e9 09 2009 3 analysis of test results 3 1 test results for the undamaged specimens undamaged specimens without pitting were subjected to uniaxial tensile and compressive loading and then the stress strain curves were obtained as shown in fig 3 table 4 provides details of the test results the yield strength σ y and ultimate strength σ u of undamaged specimen t5 are 383 71 mpa and 533 67 mpa respectively slightly different from the claimed values by the steel manufacturer see table 2 due to the flame cutting for the small pieces used in the experiment and over five year environmental exposure after production compared with the tension specimen the compression specimen exhibited a more complicated and various failure modes as the thickness of a specimen decreases the failure mode of a specimen tends to change from strength failure to buckling failure the stress strain curve of a strength failure has an obvious yielding plateau and strain hardening segment the buckling specimen will reach the ultimate strength at or far below the yield point and then the stress strain curve of this specimen descends rapidly in addition as corrosion develops the strain length l d that is defined as the interval between the yield strain ε y the lower yield point strain and the ultimate strength strain ε u i e l d ε u ε y tends to decrease gradually and becomes invisible when buckling occurs the strain length in the strain hardening segment in the buckling failure specimen is approximately 26 of that in the strength failure specimen the ultimate strength of the bucking failure specimen is approximately 76 of that in the tension specimens the stress and strain marked in the figure were nominal stress σ n and nominal strain ε n as calculated by eq 1 1 σ n p a 0 ε n δ l l 0 where σ n and ε n are the stress and strain of the steel respectively p is the tensile or compressive load a 0 is the initial cross sectional area of the parallel test section of the specimen l 0 is the initial length of the parallel test section of the specimen and δl is the displacement of the parallel test section of the specimen which is equal to the length of the tested section of a loaded specimen l minus l 0 in contrast to the nominal stress σ n the true stress σ t is equal to the compressive force p divided by the corresponding transient cross sectional area of a loaded specimen a usually a is larger than a 0 therefore σ n is smaller than σ t the nominal strain should also be replaced by the true strain ε t which is determined by an integration of the transient compressive length over the entire loading process thus it is more accurate to analyse the compressive properties of the tested specimens by using the true stress strain σ t ε t relation as used herein yao et al 2018 2 σ t p a p a 0 1 ε n 3 ε t l 0 l 1 x d x ln l l 0 ln 1 ε n 3 2 effect of length thickness ratio a t on compressive mechanical properties 1 effect of thickness on compressive mechanical properties the stress strain curves of the specimens are illustrated in fig 4 in 8 groups of different thicknesses the thickness of the test section varies from 3 mm to 9 mm and the length and width were kept unchanged in the test i e the length thickness ratio a t varied from 1 5 to 5 the yield plateau gradually shortened and disappeared with decreasing thickness fig 4 the changes in the compressive mechanical properties i e elastic modulus e yield strength σ y ultimate strength σ u and strain length in the strain hardening segment l d of the specimens with increasing t are illustrated in fig 5 to clarify the relativity of the parameters with increasing t the data are normalized with respect to their initial values correspondingly fig 5 shows that the ultimate strength and the strain length in the strain hardening segment exhibit a distinct dependency on t whereas the dependency of the elastic modulus and the yield strength on t is negligible when t reaches 3 mm a decrease of over 80 is observed for the strain length in the strain hardening segment thus it can be concluded that the ultimate strength and ductility margin of steel are more sensitive to specimen thickness fig 4 illustrates that the reduction in the thickness of a specimen may change the specimen failure mode in the test most specimens exhibit strength failure when a t is less than 5 and buckling failure when a t is greater than 5 obviously a t may be one of the factors governing the compressive failure mode a comparison of the compression process of the specimens with two different failure modes figs 6 7 shows that their appearances are very similar and difficult to distinguish during the test in the elastic segment the appearance of the specimen changed slightly with increasing load as shown in fig 6 b when the stress of the two specimens is close to the buckling stress or yield stress the edge of the pitting diameter is wrinkled in the horizontal direction when the stress levels of the two specimens t3 and t8 are approaching the buckling or yielding strength the horizontal edge along the diameter of the pitting starts to wrinkle and tend to concave around the pitting see figs 6 d and 7 d the difference between the two specimens can be seen from the corresponding stress strain curve the maximum stress in a buckling failure specimen reaches its yield stress rapidly 400 mpa 60 s the strain hardening segment is very short and soon the stress reaches the ultimate strength of 424 67 mpa 164 s which is far below the yield strength of dh36 steel fig 6 e later the stress drops dramatically to a quarter of the yield strength in contrast a strength failure specimen exhibits a significant strain hardening segment after reaching the yield strength the ultimate strength of 616 74 mpa will be reached after a long time 462 s thereafter the strength failure specimen maintains a high level of stress for a long time until destroyed fig 7 d the strain segment relative to the strain hardening segment of a strength failure specimen is approximately 6 9 times that of a buckling failure specimen 2 supplementary test of the effect of a t on the failure mode in addition to further demonstrate the influence of a t on the compressive failure mode specimens with a t of 3 5 are tested by changing the length of the test section of the specimen the stress strain curves are shown in fig 8 the failure mode of a25b25t5 a t is 5 and the thickness is 5 mm is strength failure thus the failure mode is not directly caused by a t and the compressive failure mode is more related to thickness in addition the yield strength elastic modulus ultimate strength and ductility of the strain hardening segment are not sensitive to the length of the test section 3 3 effect of pitting characteristic parameters on compressive mechanical properties although the cross sectional area of a specimen cannot be greatly reduced by pitting the local properties and stress concentrations of pitting will affect the mechanical performance of a specimen to quantitatively study the influence of pitting diameter and depth a mechanical drilling method is used to generate a single pitting crater at the midpoint of the test section 1 effect of pitting depth and diameter on compressive mechanical properties an image of tested specimens with different mechanically induced pits is shown in fig 9 figs 10 11 show that the mechanical behaviours of steel deteriorate to varying degrees as the pitting damage increased the treatment can clearly determine the influence of pitting damage on the mechanical properties of steel figs 10 and 11 present the stress strain curves of specimens with pitting craters of different depths and diameters in which all of the specimens exhibit strength failures the stress and strain of the pitted specimen are calculated from the original cross sectional area and the original length of the test section respectively thus it is reasonable to call generalized stress and generalized strain the compressive mechanical properties elastic modulus yield strength ultimate strength and strain length in the strain hardening segment of the specimens degrade slightly with increasing pitting degree figs 12 and 13 to clarify the degradation degree of the parameters with increasing pitting degree values are normalized with respect to their initial values without pitting correspondingly i e the maximum value of each parameter as shown in figs 12 and 13 among all the parameters the strain length in the strain hardening segment exhibits the lowest degradation with increasing d or h the decreasing rates of the other properties are much higher but there are not distinct differences between the other properties 2 influence of pitting damage on the compressive failure mode the test results above show that although the mechanical properties of a specimen can be affected by pitting damage the failure mode is not changed while the specimen is obviously strength failure even if the dop reaches 68 4 and the pitting depth reaches penetration the failure mode of a specimen is still strength damage the blue curve in fig 10 to study the influence of pitting damage on the compressive failure mode the specimens close to buckling failure are tested the specimen with a 3 2 mm thickness exhibits strength failure whereas the specimen with a 3 mm thickness exhibits buckling failure after trial and error however the stress strain curve of the 3 2 mm specimen shows that this sample is on the verge of exhibiting buckling failure as shown in fig 14 a pitting crater of 14 mm diameter and 3 2 mm depth is generated on the 3 2 mm specimen via the mechanical drilling approach and then the specimen exhibits buckling under compressive loading the red curve in fig 14 a comparison of the curves in fig 14 shows that although the failure modes of t3 2 and t3 are obviously different which are both undamaged specimens the curves and mechanical properties elastic modulus yield strength and ultimate strength of these specimens are highly similar the pitting on specimen t3 2 changes its failure mode and mechanical properties the ultimate strength is reduced by 32 and the strain length in the strain hardening segment nearly disappears apparently the specimen with pitting craters is easier to fail in buckling due to the influence of eccentricity however the failure mode is more sensitive to specimen thickness than the pitting crater parameters the variation in the failure mode of the compression specimen is not suddenly but gradual with the variation in damage 4 selection of comprehensive corrosion damage indicators the maximum depth of pitting corrosion h max iacs 2006 cross section area loss rate a a 0 paik et al 2003b dop zhang j et al 2017 and volume loss rate v loss v 0 zhang y et al 2017 are usually applied to evaluate the degree of corrosion induced damage the expressions of the four indicators and their related parameters are listed in table 5 note that h max is only capable of describing corrosion pitting depth and irrespective of other pitting parameters and specimen dimensions since dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 are all dimensionless h max is divided by t to obtain h t the thickness loss rate of pitting damage so as to compare with the other indicators obviously dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 contain more parameters with respect to pitting and specimen dimensions they can provide more comprehensive evaluations about the degree of corrosion induced damage fig 15 shows that to determine an indicator i e dop a a 0 and v loss v 0 and h t which is feasible for evaluating the degree of corrosion induced damage the relativity of the mechanical parameters and four indicators are investigated for that purpose an additional twelve sets of specimens were tested which comprised specimens with an 8 mm thickness and different pitting diameters and depths and specimens with a 3 2 mm thickness and different pitting diameters and depths the detailed parameters of the specimens are shown in table 6 the efficiencies of the four indicators are compared in terms of damage characterization to clarify the degradation degree of the parameters with increasing pitting degree the values are normalized with respect to their initial values as shown in fig 15 the goodness of fit of all the four indicators is not desirable for the case of the elastic modulus and strain length in the strain hardening segment although v loss v 0 and a a 0 is comparatively acceptable as for the case of the yield strength and ultimate strength which are more seriously concerned among the mechanical properties v loss v 0 and a a 0 are superior to the other two indicators especially v loss v 0 thus v loss v 0 is selected as the indicator for estimate corrosion damage degree in the follow up study in addition based on the test results the influence parameters on failure mode of a compression specimen are not only the dimension of pitting but also the dimension of specimen according to the parameters analysis of the four indicators shown in table 5 v loss v 0 includes more parameters and is more comprehensive than the others dop includes the diameter of pits the length and width of specimen test section but not includes the thickness of test section and the depth of pits which are significant for failure mode fig 15 shows that the regression relations for all concerned properties with the four indicators and among the four indicators v loss v 0 is most suitable for describing the changes in the compression mechanical properties with increasing pitting damage degree fig 15 also shows that the test data are more sensitive to v loss v 0 especially the yield strength and the ultimate strength indicating a desirable correlation between the test data and the regression results for any case the observations from the experiment consist with those in other similar studies wang 2008 jiang and soares 2012 zhang y et al 2017 among the four corrosion damage indicators i e dop a a 0 v loss v 0 and h t the mechanical properties of the tested specimens have exhibited higher sensitivity to v loss v 0 than others it is because that the indicator of v loss v 0 not only reflects the dual influence of pitting diameter and depth but also reflects the influence of the geometrical parameters of the tested specimens thus the indicator of v loss v 0 can simultaneously account for the reduction in cross section and the localized stress field around the pitting corrosion along the compression direction comparatively dop is applicable for the case where corrosion pits are uniformly distributed over the surface of a steel component e g steel plate saad eldeen and soares 2009 jiang and soares 2013 it cannot address the influence of uneven depths among corrosion pits the indicator of a a 0 is more suitable for the specimens subjected to tension nakai et al 2006 ahmmad and sumi 2010 in this case it can well account for the stress concentration around a corrosion pit the simplest indicator i e h t can be applied only in the case where the depth of a steel component is uniformly corroded 5 generalized constitutive model of dh36 steel with pitting under compressive loading according to the analysis presented above v loss v 0 is selected as the variable of the generalized constitutive model of a pitted specimen under compressive loading 5 1 bilinear constitutive model of buckling failure the bilinear generalized constitutive model corresponding to buckling failure is developed as a function of v loss v 0 fig 16 in fig 16 ε 1 and σ 1 are the initial strain and stress of steel i e ε 1 σ 1 0 e 0 σ 0 l d0 and v 0 are the elastic modulus yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and test section volume of the undamaged specimen respectively k 1 is the elastic modulus of the pitting specimen which can be determined by variable v loss v 0 and e 0 ε y σ y l d and v loss are the yield strain yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and volume loss of the pitting specimen respectively which can all be determined by the variable v loss v 0 of a pitting specimen respectively ε u σ u and k 2 which can be obtained from the formula in fig 16 are the ultimate strain ultimate strength and slope of the strain hardening segment of a pitting specimen the elastic segment of the curves can be well simulated by hooke s law i e σ eε due to the short length of the inelastic segment of a buckling failure curve the strain hardening stage is likely to be described with a linear relationship the replacement of the nonlinear strain hardening segments of the specimens with numerically efficient linear segments can result in a reasonable safety margin fig 17 the linear segments are mathematically expressed as σ σ y k 2 ε ε y where k 2 and ε y are the strain hardening stiffness and yield strain respectively the generalized stress strain curves of the abs dh36 specimens with different v loss v 0 values are presented in fig 18 which are obtained from the constitutive model 5 2 linear exponential constitutive model of compressive strength failure the bilinear generalized stress strain curve proposed above is numerically efficient and specialized for buckling failure however for strength failure the nonlinear strain hardening segment must be simulated more accurately this section presents some procedures to determine the stress strain relations of the nonlinear strain hardening segment through the combination of a theoretical expression form with a parametric determination process from the test data the improved ramberg osgood ramberg and osgood 1943 model yao et al 2018 is selected here to describe the stress strain curve of strength failure specimens before the curve reaches the ultimate strength the linear segments are described by hooke s law 4 σ e ε the nonlinear strain hardening segments are described by the following expression 5 σ k ε n where ε is strain σ is stress e is the elastic modulus k is the strength related coefficient and n is an exponent accounting for the strain hardening effect both k and n depend on material properties k e k 1 n and n 1 n the coefficients k and n are determined by the following parametric regression analysis based on the test data fig 19 regression analyses are carried out to determine the coefficients n and k based on the test data fig 19 shows that the coefficients k and n exhibit distinct dependency on v loss v 0 as one of the strain hardening parameters the coefficient n is also an effective measure of necking resistance a desirable agreement with the test data can be achieved by the proposed generalized stress strain curves especially for those expressed in the linear exponential form shown in fig 20 to obtain the constitutive model the initial point the yield point and ultimate strength point in test data have to be determined firstly when the generalized constitutive model is developed the initial point and the ultimate strength point are easily captured as shown in fig 21 the accurate yield point can be determined by the extension line of elastic segment and yield segment in addition to the proposed expressions for the coefficients k and n figs 19 fig 20 gives the suggested relations between v loss v 0 and the elastic modulus e strain hardening stiffness k 2 yield strength σ y yield strain ε y ultimate strength σ u and peak strain ε u the curves are described by the expressions of σ eε and σ k ε n for the elastic segment and nonlinear strain hardening segments respectively in fig 20 ε 1 and σ 1 are the initial strain and stress of steel i e ε 1 σ 1 0 e 0 σ 0 l d0 and v 0 are the elastic modulus yield strength strain length in the strain hardening segment and test section volume of the undamaged specimen respectively k 1 is the elastic modulus of the pitting specimen which can be determined by variable v loss v 0 and e 0 in similar yield strength yield strain ultimate strength and ultimate strain can all be determined by the variable v loss v 0 of a pitting specimen fig 22 illustrates the linear exponential generalized stress strain curves of the abs dh36 pitted specimens with different v loss v 0 using the regression coefficients n and k compared with the test results the linear exponential model is satisfactory for simulating the strain hardening stage completely fig 22 fig 23 illustrated the comparison of generalized constitutive model of buckling and strength failure specimen with the same corrosion damage degree the yield strength of the buckling specimen is far below that of the strength failure specimen the strain length in the strain hardening segment of a buckling specimen is approximate sixth to tenth of a strength failure specimen since the strain length of a buckling specimen is so short the slope of the strain hardening segment of it is bigger than a strength failure specimen 6 conclusions a compression test of dh36 specimens is carried out to study the influence of specimen dimensions and pitting crater parameters on the resultant mechanical properties and failure modes bilinear and linear exponential generalized stress strain curves for specimens with mechanically induced pitting damage that exhibit two different failure modes are proposed based on the test results the main conclusions are as follows 1 by changing the thickness and width of the specimen without pitting the compressive failure mode is most affected by the absolute thickness of the specimen mechanically induced pits have little effect on the compressive failure mode pitting will facilitate specimen failure in buckling when the specimen is in or close to the critical buckling state therefore the compressive failure mode of a specimen is mainly determined by the specimen dimensions 2 considering the diameter and depth of pitting craters the relationships between the damage indicators of corrosion degree and the compressive mechanical properties of dh36 specimens are obtained all the mechanical properties of dh36 specimens have different degrees of damage degradation as pitting damage increases in comparison to the small effect of mechanically induced pits on the generalized elastic modulus of steel pitting has a substantial influence on the generalized yield strength and ultimate strength based on the regression results the mechanical properties have a higher sensitivity to v loss v 0 among the four typical corrosion damage indicators 3 based on the test results a bilinear generalized constitutive model for buckling failure specimens is proposed for the design purpose because the stress strain curves of a buckling failure specimen have a very short ductile length the nonlinear strain hardening segment is replaced by a linear segment which is computationally efficient and is also shown to be acceptable for reserving a reasonable degree of safety margin a linear exponential generalized constitutive model for strength failure specimens is proposed the ramberg osgood expression was used to characterize the nonlinear strain hardening segment of the stress strain curves of the abs dh36 specimen with different v loss v 0 values due to the limitation in the size of the test specimens the conclusions are more accurate in predicting the mechanical properties for specimens with similar lengths and widths credit

demonstrate the influence of upstream hull on the inflow to propeller under the maneuvering conditions the details of the velocity field around the stern provide a deeper insight into the hydrodynamic mechanism of ship wake affecting the propeller performance it is shown that the propeller behavior is highly related to the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages which would change remarkably with the propeller position windward and leeward and the maneuvering motion drift and turning finally a regression analysis is performed with the proposed propeller models and a reasonable composite model describing the asymmetric propeller behavior of a twin screw ship during maneuvers is obtained keywords ship maneuvering twin screw ship propeller performance rans simulation 1 introduction complying with the demand in tonnage and speed of modern ships the twin propeller twin rudder configuration which can meet the requirements of different sailing condition is adopted for the design schemes of modern ships however the investigations on the steering and propulsive performance of twin screw ships are relatively limited recently some emerging problems of twin screw ships during sailing arouse the attention of ship designers a twin screw ship would exhibit unusual propulsion characteristics during maneuvers and the propulsion plants would experience large power fluctuations and asymmetric propeller behavior these phenomena would affect the operation of the propulsion system significantly especially for the ships with complex configuration of main engine hence accurate estimation of the propeller characteristics during ship maneuvers is of paramount importance to improve the design criteria of the propulsion and steering systems for a twin screw ship relevant experimental studies were carried out to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operation during ship maneuvers kuiper et al 2002 measured the inflow impinging on the propeller for a triple screw frigate during tight maneuvers by using laser doppler velocimetry ldv technology to identify the factors generating the power absorption ortolani et al 2015a 2015b measured the radial bearing force acting on the propeller of a twin screw ship during actual maneuvers and discussed the hydrodynamic mechanism of generating load and the transient effects on the propeller system viviani et al 2007 dubbioso et al 2011 mauro et al 2012 coraddu et al 2013 provided a more authentic representation of the propeller loads during turning circle and zigzag maneuvers and investigated the variation of propulsive loads during free maneuvers and the effect on ship maneuverability however the relating investigations are less systematic for the high expense and complex facility of experimental technology recently computational fluid dynamics cfd method has been widely applied to the investigation of ship maneuvers and the propeller operation under maneuvering conditions is also paid much attention dubbioso et al 2013a 2013b 2014 di mascio et al 2014 yao 2015 chen et al 2016 shamsi and ghassemi 2017 wang et al 2017 and guilmineau et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of an isolated propeller operating in oblique inflow providing more information on the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller working in lateral inflow further badoe et al 2015 abbas and kornev 2016 dubbioso et al 2017 and sun et al 2018 investigated the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull propeller and rudder under the drift and yaw conditions through the numerical simulation of captive model tests moreover mauro et al 2012 broglia et al 2013 and muscari et al 2017a 2017b focused on the numerical estimation of hydrodynamic forces acting on the propeller during free maneuvers and conducted a promising investigation on the asymmetric propulsive loads for a twin screw ship on the whole the reported researches based on the experimental approach and cfd technology have provided valuable information of the propeller operation under ship maneuvering conditions the present work aims to provide a deeper insight into the asymmetric propeller behavior of a twin screw ship under maneuvering conditions the relation between the propeller performance and ship motions are explored based on analysis of the ship wake under different maneuvering conditions the proposed models that describe the propeller performance during ship maneuvers are summarized a typical twin screw ship model dtmb 5415m is selected as the study object a series of static drift tests and rotating arm tests are simulated by using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the computed propulsive loads acting on the propellers are compared with the available experimental data to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method further the details of flow field around the hull and the stern are presented to exhibit the mechanism of asymmetric propulsive loads for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in addition the feasibility of the existing propeller models is analyzed through the data regression of the computed effective wake fraction this procedure would be valuable to establish a reasonable mathematical model so as to better estimate the propeller performance for a twin screw ship during maneuvers 2 mathematical model in the field of ship maneuverability mmg maneuvering modeling group model is widely used for the description of ship maneuvering motion using a non inertial ship fixed frame with the origin located at the center of gravity a general form of 3 dof degree of freedom mmg model is given as 1 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r 2 m m y v m m x u r y h y r 3 i z j z r n h n r where m and i z are the ship s mass and moment of inertia about z axis m x m y and j z

hull x p denotes the force acting on the propeller x r y r and n r denote the forces and moment acting on the rudder abundant research efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and rudder and reliable mathematical modules are developed to describe their characteristics during maneuvers however due to the less remarkable effect of the propulsive loads on ship maneuvers dubbioso et al 2011 the study on the propeller performance during maneuvers is relatively insufficient in mmg model the propeller thrust is usually represented with the open water characteristics and the propulsive coefficients of wake fraction and thrust deduction fraction obtained from the self propulsion test given as follows 4 x p 1 t p ρ n 2 d p 4 k t j 5 k

obtained from the data fitting of the open water characteristics w p is the effective wake fraction actually there are a comparable lateral inflow and generated vortices impinging on the propeller disk during ship maneuvers which would have an apparent impact on the propeller performance several researches focused on describing the propeller characteristics with a modified effective wake fraction providing a simple and efficient alternative for modeling the propeller performance during ship maneuvers based on the regression analysis of global loads from the experimental data some

y p is the dimensionless lateral position of propeller shaft 3 numerical method the rans solver in star ccm is employed in the simulation of flow field and the rans equations are closed by the isotropic blended sst k ω turbulence model the all y treatment is adopted for the solution of near wall flow it is a hybrid treatment imposing wall function for coarse meshes with high y while resolving the viscous sub layer for the fine meshes with low y directly the solver is based on a cell centered finite volume method fvm the convective term and the diffusive term are discretized by using the second order upwind scheme and the second order central difference scheme respectively the temporal term is discretized by a first order backward euler scheme besides the pressure velocity coupling is achieved by simple method dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module is applied to realize the simulation of ship motions with the definition of earth fixed and ship fixed coordinate systems the desired ship motions are achieved by moving the whole computational domain two numerical schemes of moving reference frame mrf and sliding mesh sm are used to represent the rotation of propeller the former is performed to obtain an approximated flow field and then the latter is continued to simulate the unsteady flow field around the rotating propeller taking the configuration of stern into account the effect of free surface elevation on propeller operation is neglected the double body model is adopted for the simplified solution of free surface to improve the computational efficiency 3 1 study object and condition the ship model of dtmb 5415m a kind of typical twin screw ship is selected as the study object as shown in fig 1 the hull geometry is characterized by a sonar dome and a transom stern and it is appended with a series of appendages including skeg bilge keels shafts and brackets the principal particulars of dtmb 5415m ship are listed in table 1 the scale ratio of the model is 35 48 1 for this ship model a large amount of results of captive model tests and free running model tests were published by simman 2014 simman 2014 the abundant experimental data can be used to validate the numerical study in this study the numerical simulations of captive model tests are performed with the partly appended ship model without rotating propeller and fully appended ship model respectively all simulations are carried out at f r 0 248 and the rest details of the working condition are summarized in table 2 for the sake of analysis the computed propulsive loads are presented with the dimensionless forms of the thrust t and torque q of propeller defined as k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 and k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 3 2 computation details in the cfd computation the origin of the ship fixed coordinate system is located at the center of the ship model with the x axis pointing towards stern the y axis to starboard and the z axis upward as shown in fig 2 a cuboid computational domain is selected with the dimension ranging 2 5l pp x 4 5l pp 2 5l pp y 2 5l pp and 1 0l pp z 0 0l pp the boundary condition of velocity inlet with zero pressure gradient is used for the inlet left right and bottom sides the boundary condition of pressure outlet is adopted for the outlet side particularly the boundary condition of symmetry plane is imposed on the top side of the domain according to the double body model for the captive model tests with the fully appended ship model a smaller cylindrical computational domain is adopted to contain the rotating propeller and the interface boundary condition is imposed on the contact surface between the rotating cylindrical domain and the external domain besides the no slip wall boundary condition is applied on the whole solid surface of the hull and appendages the computational domains are discretized with unstructured hexahedral grid the grid refinement is set for the hull and appendages to ensure sufficient resolution of the flow field around the ship model a refinement block is laid under the stern vault to capture the complicated flow around the propeller for the propellers surface a smaller grid spacing is applied to the blade edges while a larger grid spacing is adopted for the mid part on the surface of hull and appendages prismatic cells are adopted to achieve a better resolution of the near wall flow four layer prismatic cells are aligned on the surface of hull and rudder with the averaged targeted non dimensional distance from the wall y approaching to 30 the propeller is with a complex geometry represented by a very small thickness of the blade tip in order to ensure the quality of the generated grid only two prism layers are adopted on the surface of propeller and the averaged y on the propeller surface approximates to 75 the total number of the grids is about 2 50 106 for the simulations with partly appended ship model and 3 65 106 for the simulations with fully appended ship model besides the time step is selected as the interval corresponding to a propeller rotation of 6 and the unsteady computation is performed for 50 revolutions of propeller rotation 4 convergence study the convergence study is performed with the methodology proposed by stern et al 1999 xing and stern 2010 to clarify the impact of grid spacing and time step on the numerical results the static drift test with β 10 n 649 86rpm at f r 0 248 is selected as the study case three sets of grids with number of 8 18 106 s g 1 3 65 106 s g 2 and 1 76 106 s g 3 are generated with the refinement ratio of 2 the grid generation on the propeller blade and hub are shown in fig 3 besides three time steps of 7 69 10 4s s t 1 1 54 10 3s s t 2 and 3 08 10 3s s t 3 are selected with the refinement ratio of 2 corresponding to a propeller rotation of 3 6 and 12 per time step the time step of s t 2 is adopted in the grid convergence study while the grid set of s g 2 is adopted in the time step convergence study a detailed grid distribution and the computational time in the convergence study are given in table 3 the computational time is based on a parallel run of 32 processors run on 16 core nodes for 50 propeller revolutions the time histories of the propeller thrust and torque in the grid convergence study are plotted in figs 4 and 5 where a zoom view of the tendency in one revolution of propeller rotation is also presented an initial numerical simulation is carried out with mrf scheme for 20s and then the unsteady simulation with sm scheme is performed for about 4 5s it is shown that the thrust and torque present a tendency of periodic oscillation and the oscillation amplitude is more remarkable for the portside propeller meanwhile different tendency is observed for the two propellers with the refinement of grid the grid convergence study is performed based on the mean value of the time histories as summarized in table 4 the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t 2 is adopted according to the spatial discretization scheme mon and osc denote monotonic convergence and oscillatory convergence respectively it is shown that the grid convergence can be achieved for all quantities with r g 1 only the thrust and torque of the portside propeller show monotonic convergence the estimated order of accuracy p g is far away from the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t suggesting that the solution is relatively far from the asymptotic range nevertheless all quantities present reasonably small grid uncertainty u g s g 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 4 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with the fine grid s g 1 the iterative uncertainty u i s g 1 is with small magnitude for all quantities demonstrating the convergence of iterative computation the time histories of the propeller thrust and torque in the time step convergence study are presented in figs 6 and 7 the refinement of time step has a more remarkable effect on the thrust and torque of the starboard propeller than on those of the portside propeller the time step convergence study is performed based on the time histories and the results are presented in table 5 the theoretical order of accuracy p t e s t 1 is adopted according to the temporal discretization scheme all quantities achieve the time step convergence with r t 1 and all of them show monotonic convergence the estimated order of accuracy p t presents a dispersed distribution only the solutions for k t s and k q s approach to the asymptotic range overall all quantities present reasonably small time step uncertainty u t s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 5 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with the fine time step all quantities show small iterative uncertainty u i s t 1 demonstrating the convergence of iterative computation through the grid and time step convergence study for the selected case it is shown that the numerical result is less affected by grid spacing and time step in the present simulation however the solution is hard to approach the asymptotic range which may result from the complicated characteristics of the hull propeller rudder interaction considering the small magnitude of ε 21 s g 1 and ε 21 s t 1 the computation with grid spacing and time step of medium level is very close to those with grid spacing and time step of fine level however remarkably enlarged computational expense is needed for the computation with the fine grid and time step as given in table 3 hence weighing the accuracy and efficiency of computation it is reasonable to adopt the grid spacing and time step of medium level to perform the numerical simulation in this study 5 numerical results 5 1 global loads on the propellers the computed hydrodynamic forces on the propellers in the static drift tests and rotating arm tests are compared with the available experimental data hallmann and toxopeus 2007 to validate the effectiveness of the present cfd computation it is worth noting that the experimental data were derived from the model tests performed in different model basins the static drift tests were performed in the deep water basin dt while the rotating arm tests were performed in the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb under the present simulation condition the portside propeller ps is located on the windward side while the starboard propeller sb is located on the leeward side the thrust and torque under the static drift condition are depicted in fig 8 the experimental data are matched well by the numerical result in tendency for k t however apparent deviation is observed between the experimental data and the numerical result under the larger drift angle condition as for k q a similar tendency of the experimental data and the numerical result is shown for the windward and leeward propellers while remarkable overestimation is observed in the present numerical results as a whole in terms of the remarkable discrepancy in the estimation of k t and k q the experimental uncertainty may be an important factor there is a remarkable difference in k t and k q of the portside and starboard propellers under the straight ahead condition β 0 however only limited information was published on the experiments moreover the flow separation would occur during the ship motion of larger amplitude which cannot be resolved fully by using the adopted numerical method this could be another factor resulting in the discrepancy between the experimental data and the numerical results from the numerical results it can be seen that k t and k q present a consistent trend with the increase of drift angle the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers are negligible under the small drift angle β 6 and there is a non monotonic tendency for the variation of k t and k q as the drift angle continues to increase the difference between the windward and leeward propellers is enlarged on the whole the propulsive loads of the windward propeller increase remarkably while those of the leeward propeller are with a decreasing tendency consequently for the static drift tests with the larger drift angle β 10 the windward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than those of the leeward propeller the thrust and torque under the steady turning condition are presented in fig 9 it is shown that k t and k q of the starboard propeller present abnormal values at r 0 straight ahead condition which are remarkably smaller than those of the portside propeller as well as the experimental data from dt it may be also induced by the experimental uncertainty besides an obvious deviation between the experimental data and numerical results is observed for the case with the large yaw rate of r 0 45 meanwhile k q is overestimated by the numerical simulation on the whole from the numerical results it can be seen that k t and k q show consistent trend with the increase of yaw rate the propulsive loads present apparent asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers under the steady turning condition with the increase of yaw rate the propulsive load of the leeward propeller increases remarkably while that of the windward propeller changes slightly in contrast to the static drift condition the leeward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than those of the windward propeller under the steady turning condition overall the numerical results show satisfactory consistency with the available experimental data in view of the complicated characteristics of the hull propeller rudder interaction the propulsive loads present remarkable asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers under the maneuvering condition meanwhile the asymmetry is closely related to the ship motion of drift and yaw in order to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of the asymmetric propulsive loads during ship maneuvers further investigation should be conducted on the basis of the wake field around the hull and propellers under the given maneuvering condition 5 2 features of flow field around the hull the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propellers are highly affected by the ship wake in order to provide a sufficient understanding about the inflow impinging on the propeller disk during ship maneuvers the flow field around the hull under the given ship motions is analyzed qualitatively for the ship not appended with the rotating propellers the static drift test with β 10 and rotating arm test with r 0 3 are simulated based on the ship fixed coordinate system adopted in the cfd computation the contours of longitudinal velocity u and axial vortex ω x are plotted on eight uniformly spaced cross sections extending from x 1 5 m to 1 75 m the variation of the flow field along the longitudinal direction of the ship model is visualized with the contours on these sections the flow fields around the hull at drift angle β 10 are plotted in fig 10 a series of strong vortices detached from the sonar dome bilge keels stabilizing fins and skeg are clearly identified with the contours of u and ω x the sonar dome vortex moves towards the leeward side moving far away from the aft body of the ship model the vortices shedding from the bilge keel and the stabilizing fin of windward side are more apparent than those of the leeward side and they are interacted with the vortex shedding from the skeg near the stern from the contour of u it can be seen that the boundary layer gets thicker along the longitudinal direction showing an asymmetrical distribution with respect to the windward and leeward sides of hull the boundary layer on the leeward side is thicker than that on the windward side exhibiting a stronger interaction with the vortices shedding from the sonar dome and the bilge keels the flow fields around the hull under the steady turning condition of r 0 3 are plotted in fig 11 the major vortices are distorted remarkably due to the different local incidence angles along the longitudinal direction the vortex shedding from the sonar dome presents a clear curved path cross the ship keel impinging on the leeward propeller disk which is with an opposite rotational direction to that of the static drift case the vortices shedding from the bilge keels show opposite rotational direction for the fore body and aft body and are relatively weak due to the small local incidence angle besides a remarkable vortex shedding from the skeg arises at the stern the boundary layer is deformed under the effect of the vortices presenting a different development for the fore body and aft body of the ship model although the experimental data of the local flow field details are not available the obtained vortex distribution and the development of boundary layer are in accordance with those of sakamoto et al 2012 demonstrating the reliability of the present cfd computation from the flow field around the hull it can be seen that the inflow impinging on the propeller disk is highly affected by the developing boundary layer and shedding vortices meanwhile the impact is different for the windward and leeward sides the inflow to the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake to the contrary the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller disk is rather complicated which is highly affected by the shedding vortices relating to the ship motion 5 3 local flow field around the stern in order to further explore the effect of ship motion on the propeller performance the local flow field around the stern is analyzed the nominal wake at the propeller disk section s2 in fig 12 under different conditions are plotted to reflect the overall impact of ship motion on the inflow impinging on the propeller disk and the nominal wake at 0 7r radial position of the propeller disk is presented to illustrate the variation tendency with the drift angle and yaw rate further the propeller behavior is explored based on the flow field around the rotating propellers including the vortex structures generated by the fully appended ship model and the axial inflow distribution ahead and behind the propeller disk section s1 and s3 in fig 12 for the sake of analysis in subsequence a local coordinate system of propeller is adopted in accordance with its rotational direction viewed from the stern as shown in fig 13 5 3 1 nominal wake at the propeller disk the nominal wake under the straight ahead condition is presented in fig 14 the axial component of inflow is disturbed at the upper part of the propeller disk by the vortices detached from the shaft brackets and the developing boundary layer these factors result in a remarkable low velocity region at the 1st quadrant of portside and starboard propeller disks from the distribution of in plane component it can be seen that the incoming flow is slightly deflected inward and upward as a consequence of the pronounced diminution of hull geometry along the longitudinal direction the nominal wake under the static drift condition of β 10 is presented in fig 15 for the windward propeller disk the reduction of axial component at the 1st quadrant is less remarkable due to the thinner boundary layer and the deflection of vortices detached from the shaft brackets the direction of the in plane component presents a consistent trend with the lateral inflow induced by the drift angle except for that in the 1st quadrant of the propeller disk the inflow impinging on the windward propeller disk presents a relatively uniform distribution over the vast majority of the propeller disk while the inflow to the leeward propeller disk is more complicated due to the strong effect of the vortices detached from the sonar dome and the skeg hence it presents a rather non uniform distribution for the axial and in plane components the axial component is reduced apparently at the 1st and 4th quadrants of the propeller disk meanwhile the in plane component presents remarkable reduction and deflection at the most regions of the propeller disk the nominal wake under the steady turning condition of r 0 3 is presented in fig 16 similar to the static drift condition the nominal wake also presents a remarkable asymmetry for the windward and leeward propeller disks and it is less disturbed by the ship wake at the windward propeller disk for the steady turning condition the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller disk presents a different distribution from that under the static drift condition the nominal wake at the leeward propeller disk is highly affected by the vortex detached from the sonar dome which results in an apparent reduction of the axial component at the vast majority of the propeller disk moreover the in plane component is also deflected by the detached vortices a slight deflection is observed at the 1st quadrant of the propeller disk because the skeg vortex is relatively weak under the considered steady turning condition besides at the most region of the leeward propeller disk the flow is affected by the vortex shedding from the sonar dome however the vortex is with a rotational direction opposite to that in the static drift case resulting in a different distribution of the in plane component at the leeward propeller disk the nominal wake at the radial position of 0 7r under the static drift condition is plotted in fig 17 synthesizing the work principle of propeller blade the nominal wake is represented with the axial and tangential components separately denoted as u a and u t a remarkable asymmetry can be observed for the axial and tangential components and it is intensified with the increase of drift angle with the disturbance of shaft bracket the axial component is reduced at the 1st quadrant of the windward and leeward propeller disks the axial component at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the windward propeller disk decreases gradually with the increase of drift angle while it changes remarkably at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the leeward propeller disk presenting a significant reduction at larger drift angle meanwhile the tangential component at the windward propeller disk depends on the lateral inflow induced by drift angle it is less affected by the ship wake and changes with the increase of drift angle gradually differently with the increase of drift angle the tangential component is remarkably enlarged at the leeward propeller disk it would reduce the attack angle of propeller blade profile and result in the decrease of propeller loads further the nominal wake at the radial position of 0 7r under the steady turning condition is plotted in fig 18 the asymmetry of the nominal wake at the windward and leeward propeller disks is also intensified with the increase of yaw rate apart from the disturbance at the 1st quadrant the axial component presents a slight increase at the windward propeller disk with the increase of yaw rate while it decreases remarkably at the leeward propeller disk as a whole moreover the tangential component at the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake and it is shown that the generated vortices have a relatively weak impact on the tangential component at the leeward propeller disk which presents a similar distribution with that at the windward propeller disk apart from the phase difference 5 3 2 flow around the rotating propellers the vortex structures generated by the fully appended ship model under the two maneuvering conditions are shown in figs 19 and 20 they are visualized with the isosurface of the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor q which is colored by the non dimensional axial velocity there is an apparent interaction between the ship wake and the rotating propeller and the propeller slipstream is characterized by the distinct vortices shedding from blade tip and hub due to the effects of lateral inflow and ship wake these vortices are deflected towards the leeward side and the structure of the tip vortex presents an asymmetric distribution with respect to the shaft axis for the different maneuvering conditions the windward propeller is less affected by the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages being dominated by the lateral inflow induced by the maneuvering motion the tip vortex is enhanced at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the disk differently the leeward propeller is more disturbed by the generated vortex e g the skeg vortex which would change with the maneuvering motion it is shown that the tip vortex is enhanced at the 1st quadrant of the leeward propeller disk under the two maneuvering conditions besides compared with the windward propeller the tip vortex shedding from the leeward propeller is diffused apparently under the static drift condition while it is enhanced under the steady turning condition this difference is in accordance with the computed global loads on the propellers the axial flow ahead and behind the rotating propellers under the straight ahead condition is depicted in fig 21 compared with the nominal wake the axial flow at section s1 is accelerated remarkably due to the suction effect of the rotating propellers under the shadow effect of the shaft brackets a low velocity region appears at the 1st quadrant of the sections ahead of the propeller disks from the flow at section s3 it can be seen that the axial flow is accelerated apparently by the propeller slipstream a high velocity region appears at the 1st and 2nd quadrants of the selected sections demonstrating that the propeller blades experience a higher load at those positions it is in accordance with the negative high velocity region shown in fig 17 c and d suggesting that the tangential component induced by the ship hull would have an apparent effect on the propeller performance the axial flow ahead and behind the rotating propellers under the static drift condition of β 10 and the steady turning condition of r 0 3 are plotted in figs 22 and 23 respectively it is shown that the vortices detached from the hull and appendages are less affected by the rotating propellers hence a distribution of the axial inflow similar to that of nominal wake is observed at section s1 as for the axial flow at section s3 a remarkable high velocity region arises at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants behind the windward propeller and at the 1st quadrant behind the leeward propeller which is observed both under the static drift condition and steady turning condition the distribution of high velocity region is in accordance with the negative high velocity region of tangential component of nominal wake at 0 7r radial position as shown in figs 17 and 18 in combination with the analysis of the local flow and propulsive loads obtained in the numerical simulation it is shown that the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers under maneuvering conditions is highly related to the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages the hydrodynamic characteristics of the windward propeller is less affected by the ship wake under different maneuvering conditions depending on the lateral inflow induced by the drift and yaw motions for another the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller is highly influenced by the vortices detached from the hull and appendages and the vortex distribution is rather different under drift and yaw conditions under the static drift condition the generated skeg vortex leads to the reduction of the axial component and the increase of the tangential component compared with the reduction of the axial component the remarkably enlarged tangential component plays a primary role in the behavior of the leeward propeller resulting in lower propeller loads than those of the windward propeller under the steady turning condition apart from the effect of the skeg vortex similar to that under the static drift condition the leeward propeller is also affected by the sonar dome vortex with an opposite rotational direction under the combined effect of the vortices detached from the skeg and the sonar dome the axial component of nominal wake is remarkably reduced while the tangential component is less affected due to the dominant impact of the reduced axial component the leeward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than the windward propeller under the steady turning condition therefore the assessment of propeller loads obtained by considering only the axial inflow would be misleading the crucial contribution of the axial and tangential components induced by the shedding vortices to the propeller behavior should be underlined in addition the variation of the propeller performance is complicated during ship maneuvering which is usually affected by a combination effect of drift and yaw motions 5 4 effective wake fraction considering the complicated flow field around the stern of twin screw ships during maneuvers it is rather challenging to model the propulsive loads theoretically here the propeller performance under ship maneuvering condition is described with the effective wake fraction and the relation between the effective wake fraction and ship motion is explored the effective wake fraction is computed by using the thrust identity method where the thrust is obtained from the numerical results while the open water characteristics are obtained from the available experimental data simman 2014 the computed effective wake fraction expressed as 1 w p is given as a function of the dimensionless geometrical lateral inflow to the propeller v p in fig 24 1 w p derived from the simulation of static drift test is denoted as sdt data and that from the simulation of rotating arm test is denoted as rat data it is shown that 1 w p presents an apparent asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers overall for the windward propeller 1 w p presents a relatively mild changing tendency with the increase of v p a similar tendency is observed for the effective wake fraction obtained from the simulation of static drift test and rotating arm test which is in accordance with the analysis of the nominal wake for the leeward propeller 1 w p changes remarkably and distinctly different changing trend with v p is observed in the static drift and steady turning cases under the static drift condition 1 w p changes slightly with v p of small magnitude about drift angle of 6 and it is enlarged significantly as v p continues to increase on the contrary 1 w p decreases monotonously with the increase of v p under the steady turning condition in view of the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction the existing propeller models are insufficient to describe the propeller performance under maneuvering conditions in those models the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers is underestimated besides for the majority of the models the difference of the effective wake fraction under the drift and yaw conditions is not taken into account in order to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior during maneuvers reasonably the proposed propeller models should be modified by taking the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction into account in this study the propeller models are reconstructed for the windward and leeward propellers respectively meanwhile considering the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction for the leeward propeller part of the propeller models are refined for drift and yaw motions separately the data regression for the computed effective wake fraction of the windward propeller is presented in fig 25 meanwhile the statistical parameters of residual sum of squares rss and pearson correlation coefficient r2 are also presented to qualify the accuracy of data fitting it is shown that 1 w p presents relatively scattered distribution with the ship motions of drift and yaw hence relatively poor fitting accuracy is obtained for the refined propeller models overall obviously the models of hirano kim and yasukawa fail to represent the variation of the effective wake fraction kose s model is feasible for several segments of the data points with a reasonable value of rss while the overall tendency is poorly represented by the model according to the lower value of r2 in contrast the models of kang and lee present satisfactory capability of describing the effective wake fraction for the windward propeller the data regressions for the computed effective wake fraction of the leeward propeller are presented in figs 26 and 27 here the models of hirano kose kang yasukawa and lee are adopted for the data fitting of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions separately apart from hirano s model most of the models are with good capability of describing the changing tendency of the effective wake fraction for the leeward propeller presenting satisfactory values of rss and r2 however establishing the model of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions separately would increase the amount of fitting parameters significantly and the complicated structure would also reduce the applicability of the models particularly the model proposed by matsumoto is adopted for the data fitting of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions jointly with the parameters of c p v and c p r introduced to take the difference between the drift and yaw motions into account the regression with the model presents a reasonable value of rss and r2 demonstrating a good fitting accuracy for the leeward propeller under the maneuvering condition based on the regression analysis for the effective wake fraction under the maneuvering condition a composite model of the effective wake fraction would be feasible to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior during maneuvers for the twin screw ship where matsumoto s model is adopted for the leeward propeller and the model of kang or lee is adopted for the windward propeller particularly it is worth noting that the models of kang and lee can be regarded as a simplified form of matsumoto s model when neglecting the difference between the drift and yaw conditions 6 conclusion in this study the propulsive loads of a twin screw ship during maneuvers are investigated by using cfd method the proposed modules of propellers in the mathematical model of ship maneuvering motion are summarized to analyze the modeling method of the propeller performance under maneuvering condition taking the twin screw ship model dtmb 5415m as the study object a series of static drift tests and rotating arm tests are simulated by using rans method the computed thrust and torque show reasonable agreement with the available experimental data demonstrating the reliability of cfd method in modeling of the hull propeller rudder interaction under maneuvering condition the wake fields around the hull and stern are analyzed to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operating under maneuvering condition for the twin screw ship the contours of axial velocity and vortex around the hull help to gain a deeper insight into the effect of ship motion on the inflow impinging on the propeller disks the local flow around the stern provides more details on the flow around the propeller disks showing an apparent difference between the nominal wake of the windward and leeward propellers under maneuvering condition the nominal wake at the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake while that at the leeward propeller disk is highly affected by the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages the vortices have different impact on the axial and tangential components of nominal wake during various ship maneuvering motions in combination with the global loads and flow field around the rotating propellers the shedding vortices have a remarkable effect on the propulsive loads of the leeward propeller which might be the main factor resulting in the asymmetric propeller behavior for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in addition the relation between the propeller performance and the ship maneuvering motion are explored based on the computed effective wake fraction it is shown that the effective wake fraction presents a significant asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers especially the changing tendencies under the drift and yaw conditions are rather different for the leeward propeller hence the summarized propeller models are refined by piecewise fitting to consider the asymmetry of the windward and leeward sides and the different changing tendencies relating to the ship motion from the data fitting it can be seen that a composite model of the effective wake fraction would be feasible to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior for the twin screw ship during maneuvers it should be pointed out that this study focuses on the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operating under the given maneuvering condition as well as the feasibility of the existing propeller models adopted in mmg model however the effects of the coupled drift yaw motion and the rudder deflection on the propulsive loads have not yet been taken into account these effects would arise in the practical ship maneuvers and should be taken into account for a more accurate prediction of ship maneuverability therefore further systematic numerical and experimental investigations are needed to better understand and generalize the asymmetric propeller behavior

22036,aiming to improve the safety of ship navigation and main engine operation the propulsive loads are investigated for a twin screw ship under the maneuvering condition by using cfd method the proposed models that describe the propeller performance during ship maneuvers are summarized taking the twin screw ship model dtmb 5415m as the study object rans simulation is performed for a series of static drift tests and rotating arm tests the computed propulsive loads are validated by the available experimental data the contours of axial velocity and vortex around the hull are presented to demonstrate the influence of upstream hull on the inflow to propeller under the maneuvering conditions the details of the velocity field around the stern provide a deeper insight into the hydrodynamic mechanism of ship wake affecting the propeller performance it is shown that the propeller behavior is highly related to the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages which would change remarkably with the propeller position windward and leeward and the maneuvering motion drift and turning finally a regression analysis is performed with the proposed propeller models and a reasonable composite model describing the asymmetric propeller behavior of a twin screw ship during maneuvers is obtained keywords ship maneuvering twin screw ship propeller performance rans simulation 1 introduction complying with the demand in tonnage and speed of modern ships the twin propeller twin rudder configuration which can meet the requirements of different sailing condition is adopted for the design schemes of modern ships however the investigations on the steering and propulsive performance of twin screw ships are relatively limited recently some emerging problems of twin screw ships during sailing arouse the attention of ship designers a twin screw ship would exhibit unusual propulsion characteristics during maneuvers and the propulsion plants would experience large power fluctuations and asymmetric propeller behavior these phenomena would affect the operation of the propulsion system significantly especially for the ships with complex configuration of main engine hence accurate estimation of the propeller characteristics during ship maneuvers is of paramount importance to improve the design criteria of the propulsion and steering systems for a twin screw ship relevant experimental studies were carried out to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operation during ship maneuvers kuiper et al 2002 measured the inflow impinging on the propeller for a triple screw frigate during tight maneuvers by using laser doppler velocimetry ldv technology to identify the factors generating the power absorption ortolani et al 2015a 2015b measured the radial bearing force acting on the propeller of a twin screw ship during actual maneuvers and discussed the hydrodynamic mechanism of generating load and the transient effects on the propeller system viviani et al 2007 dubbioso et al 2011 mauro et al 2012 coraddu et al 2013 provided a more authentic representation of the propeller loads during turning circle and zigzag maneuvers and investigated the variation of propulsive loads during free maneuvers and the effect on ship maneuverability however the relating investigations are less systematic for the high expense and complex facility of experimental technology recently computational fluid dynamics cfd method has been widely applied to the investigation of ship maneuvers and the propeller operation under maneuvering conditions is also paid much attention dubbioso et al 2013a 2013b 2014 di mascio et al 2014 yao 2015 chen et al 2016 shamsi and ghassemi 2017 wang et al 2017 and guilmineau et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of an isolated propeller operating in oblique inflow providing more information on the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller working in lateral inflow further badoe et al 2015 abbas and kornev 2016 dubbioso et al 2017 and sun et al 2018 investigated the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull propeller and rudder under the drift and yaw conditions through the numerical simulation of captive model tests moreover mauro et al 2012 broglia et al 2013 and muscari et al 2017a 2017b focused on the numerical estimation of hydrodynamic forces acting on the propeller during free maneuvers and conducted a promising investigation on the asymmetric propulsive loads for a twin screw ship on the whole the reported researches based on the experimental approach and cfd technology have provided valuable information of the propeller operation under ship maneuvering conditions the present work aims to provide a deeper insight into the asymmetric propeller behavior of a twin screw ship under maneuvering conditions the relation between the propeller performance and ship motions are explored based on analysis of the ship wake under different maneuvering conditions the proposed models that describe the propeller performance during ship maneuvers are summarized a typical twin screw ship model dtmb 5415m is selected as the study object a series of static drift tests and rotating arm tests are simulated by using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the computed propulsive loads acting on the propellers are compared with the available experimental data to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method further the details of flow field around the hull and the stern are presented to exhibit the mechanism of asymmetric propulsive loads for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in addition the feasibility of the existing propeller models is analyzed through the data regression of the computed effective wake fraction this procedure would be valuable to establish a reasonable mathematical model so as to better estimate the propeller performance for a twin screw ship during maneuvers 2 mathematical model in the field of ship maneuverability mmg maneuvering modeling group model is widely used for the description of ship maneuvering motion using a non inertial ship fixed frame with the origin located at the center of gravity a general form of 3 dof degree of freedom mmg model is given as 1 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r 2 m m y v m m x u r y h y r 3 i z j z r n h n r where m and i z are the ship s mass and moment of inertia about z axis m x m y and j z are the added masses and added moment of inertia u and v are the longitudinal and lateral components of ship velocity while r is the yaw rate x h y h and n h denote the forces and moment acting on the hull x p denotes the force acting on the propeller x r y r and n r denote the forces and moment acting on the rudder abundant research efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and rudder and reliable mathematical modules are developed to describe their characteristics during maneuvers however due to the less remarkable effect of the propulsive loads on ship maneuvers dubbioso et al 2011 the study on the propeller performance during maneuvers is relatively insufficient in mmg model the propeller thrust is usually represented with the open water characteristics and the propulsive coefficients of wake fraction and thrust deduction fraction obtained from the self propulsion test given as follows 4 x p 1 t p ρ n 2 d p 4 k t j 5 k t j k 2 j 2 k 1 j k 0 6 j 1 w p u n d p where t p is the thrust deduction fraction ρ is the water density n is the propeller revolutions d p is the propeller diameter k 0 k 1 and k 2 are the constants obtained from the data fitting of the open water characteristics w p is the effective wake fraction actually there are a comparable lateral inflow and generated vortices impinging on the propeller disk during ship maneuvers which would have an apparent impact on the propeller performance several researches focused on describing the propeller characteristics with a modified effective wake fraction providing a simple and efficient alternative for modeling the propeller performance during ship maneuvers based on the regression analysis of global loads from the experimental data some empirical formulas were proposed for typical single screw ships given as follows hirano 1980 7 w p w p 0 exp c 1 v p 2 kose 1982 8 1 w p 1 w p 0 1 c 1 v p c 2 v p v p 2 kang et al 2008 9 1 w p 1 w p 0

asymmetric propulsive loads could be modelled by the unbalanced effective wake fractions some models were proposed for twin screw ships as given in eqs 11 14 where the subscripts p and s in

isotropic blended sst k ω turbulence model the all y treatment is adopted for the solution of near wall flow it is a hybrid treatment imposing wall function for coarse meshes with high y while resolving the viscous sub layer for the fine meshes with low y directly the solver is based on a cell centered finite volume method fvm the convective term and the diffusive term are discretized by using the second order upwind scheme and the second order central difference scheme respectively the temporal term is discretized by a first order backward euler scheme besides the pressure velocity coupling is achieved by simple method dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module is applied to realize the simulation of ship motions with the definition of earth fixed and ship fixed coordinate systems the desired ship motions are achieved by moving the whole computational domain two numerical schemes of moving reference frame mrf and sliding mesh sm are used to represent the rotation of propeller the former is performed to obtain an approximated flow field and then the latter is continued to simulate the unsteady flow field around the rotating propeller taking the configuration of stern into account the effect of free surface elevation on propeller operation is neglected the double body model is adopted for the simplified solution of free surface to improve the computational efficiency 3 1 study object and condition the ship model of dtmb 5415m a kind of typical twin screw ship is selected as the study object as shown in fig 1 the hull geometry is characterized by a sonar dome and a transom stern and it is appended with a series of appendages including skeg bilge keels shafts and brackets the principal particulars of dtmb 5415m ship are listed in table 1 the scale ratio of the model is 35 48 1 for this ship model a large amount of results of captive model tests and free running model tests were published by simman 2014 simman 2014 the abundant experimental data can be used to validate the numerical study in this study the numerical simulations of captive model tests are performed with the partly appended ship model without rotating propeller and fully appended ship model respectively all simulations are carried out at f r 0 248 and the rest details of the working condition are summarized in table 2 for the sake of analysis the computed propulsive loads are presented with the dimensionless forms of the thrust t and torque q of propeller defined as k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 and k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 3 2 computation details in the cfd computation the origin of the ship fixed coordinate system is located at the center of the ship model with the x axis pointing towards stern the y axis to starboard and the z axis upward as shown in fig 2 a cuboid computational domain is selected with the dimension ranging 2 5l pp x 4 5l pp 2 5l pp y 2 5l pp and 1 0l pp z 0 0l pp the boundary condition of velocity inlet with zero pressure gradient is used for the inlet left right and bottom sides the boundary condition of pressure outlet is adopted for the outlet side particularly the boundary condition of symmetry plane is imposed on the top side of the domain according to the double body model for the captive model tests with the fully appended ship model a smaller cylindrical computational domain is adopted to contain the rotating propeller and the interface boundary condition is imposed on the contact surface between the rotating cylindrical domain and the external domain besides the no slip wall boundary condition is applied on the whole solid surface of the hull and appendages the computational domains are discretized with unstructured hexahedral grid the grid refinement is set for the hull and appendages to ensure sufficient resolution of the flow field around the ship model a refinement block is laid under the stern vault to capture the complicated flow around the propeller for the propellers surface a smaller grid spacing is applied to the blade edges while a larger grid spacing is adopted for the mid part on the surface of hull and appendages prismatic cells are adopted to achieve a better resolution of the near wall flow four layer prismatic cells are aligned on the surface of hull and rudder with the averaged targeted non dimensional distance from the wall y approaching to 30 the propeller is with a complex geometry represented by a very small thickness of the blade tip in order to ensure the quality of the generated grid only two prism layers are adopted on the surface of propeller and the averaged y on the propeller surface approximates to 75 the total number of the grids is about 2 50 106 for the simulations with partly appended ship model and 3 65 106 for the simulations with fully appended ship model besides the time step is selected as the interval corresponding to a propeller rotation of 6 and the unsteady computation is performed for 50 revolutions of propeller rotation 4 convergence study the convergence study is performed with the methodology proposed by stern et al 1999 xing and stern 2010 to clarify the impact of grid spacing and time step on the numerical results the static drift test with β 10 n 649 86rpm at f r 0 248 is selected as the study case three sets of grids with number of 8 18 106 s g 1 3 65 106 s g 2 and 1 76 106 s g 3 are generated with the refinement ratio of 2 the grid generation on the propeller blade and hub are shown in fig 3 besides three time steps of 7 69 10 4s s t 1 1 54 10 3s s t 2 and 3 08 10 3s s t 3 are selected with the refinement ratio of 2 corresponding to a propeller rotation of 3 6 and 12 per time step the time step of s t 2 is adopted in the grid convergence study while the grid set of s g 2 is adopted in the time step convergence study a detailed grid distribution and the computational time in the convergence study are given in table 3 the computational time is based on a parallel run of 32 processors run on 16 core nodes for 50 propeller revolutions the time histories of the propeller thrust and torque in the grid convergence study are plotted in figs 4 and 5 where a zoom view of the tendency in one revolution of propeller rotation is also presented an initial numerical simulation is carried out with mrf scheme for 20s and then the unsteady simulation with sm scheme is performed for about 4 5s it is shown that the thrust and torque present a tendency of periodic oscillation and the oscillation amplitude is more remarkable for the portside propeller meanwhile different tendency is observed for the two propellers with the refinement of grid the grid convergence study is performed based on the mean value of the time histories as summarized in table 4 the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t 2 is adopted according to the spatial discretization scheme mon and osc denote monotonic convergence and oscillatory convergence respectively it is shown that the grid convergence can be achieved for all quantities with r g 1 only the thrust and torque of the portside propeller show monotonic convergence the estimated order of accuracy p g is far away from the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t suggesting that the solution is relatively far from the asymptotic range nevertheless all quantities present reasonably small grid uncertainty u g s g 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 4 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with the fine grid s g 1 the iterative uncertainty u i s g 1 is with small magnitude for all quantities demonstrating the convergence of iterative computation the time histories of the propeller thrust and torque in the time step convergence study are presented in figs 6 and 7 the refinement of time step has a more remarkable effect on the thrust and torque of the starboard propeller than on those of the portside propeller the time step convergence study is performed based on the time histories and the results are presented in table 5 the theoretical order of accuracy p t e s t 1 is adopted according to the temporal discretization scheme all quantities achieve the time step convergence with r t 1 and all of them show monotonic convergence the estimated order of accuracy p t presents a dispersed distribution only the solutions for k t s and k q s approach to the asymptotic range overall all quantities present reasonably small time step uncertainty u t s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 5 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with the fine time step all quantities show small iterative uncertainty u i s t 1 demonstrating the convergence of iterative computation through the grid and time step convergence study for the selected case it is shown that the numerical result is less affected by grid spacing and time step in the present simulation however the solution is hard to approach the asymptotic range which may result from the complicated characteristics of the hull propeller rudder interaction considering the small magnitude of ε 21 s g 1 and ε 21 s t 1 the computation with grid spacing and time step of medium level is very close to those with grid spacing and time step of fine level however remarkably enlarged computational expense is needed for the computation with the fine grid and time step as given in table 3 hence weighing the accuracy and efficiency of computation it is reasonable to adopt the grid spacing and time step of medium level to perform the numerical simulation in this study 5 numerical results 5 1 global loads on the propellers the computed hydrodynamic forces on the propellers in the static drift tests and rotating arm tests are compared with the available experimental data hallmann and toxopeus 2007 to validate the effectiveness of the present cfd computation it is worth noting that the experimental data were derived from the model tests performed in different model basins the static drift tests were performed in the deep water basin dt while the rotating arm tests were performed in the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb under the present simulation condition the portside propeller ps is located on the windward side while the starboard propeller sb is located on the leeward side the thrust and torque under the static drift condition are depicted in fig 8 the experimental data are matched well by the numerical result in tendency for k t however apparent deviation is observed between the experimental data and the numerical result under the larger drift angle condition as for k q a similar tendency of the experimental data and the numerical result is shown for the windward and leeward propellers while remarkable overestimation is observed in the present numerical results as a whole in terms of the remarkable discrepancy in the estimation of k t and k q the experimental uncertainty may be an important factor there is a remarkable difference in k t and k q of the portside and starboard propellers under the straight ahead condition β 0 however only limited information was published on the experiments moreover the flow separation would occur during the ship motion of larger amplitude which cannot be resolved fully by using the adopted numerical method this could be another factor resulting in the discrepancy between the experimental data and the numerical results from the numerical results it can be seen that k t and k q present a consistent trend with the increase of drift angle the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers are negligible under the small drift angle β 6 and there is a non monotonic tendency for the variation of k t and k q as the drift angle continues to increase the difference between the windward and leeward propellers is enlarged on the whole the propulsive loads of the windward propeller increase remarkably while those of the leeward propeller are with a decreasing tendency consequently for the static drift tests with the larger drift angle β 10 the windward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than those of the leeward propeller the thrust and torque under the steady turning condition are presented in fig 9 it is shown that k t and k q of the starboard propeller present abnormal values at r 0 straight ahead condition which are remarkably smaller than those of the portside propeller as well as the experimental data from dt it may be also induced by the experimental uncertainty besides an obvious deviation between the experimental data and numerical results is observed for the case with the large yaw rate of r 0 45 meanwhile k q is overestimated by the numerical simulation on the whole from the numerical results it can be seen that k t and k q show consistent trend with the increase of yaw rate the propulsive loads present apparent asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers under the steady turning condition with the increase of yaw rate the propulsive load of the leeward propeller increases remarkably while that of the windward propeller changes slightly in contrast to the static drift condition the leeward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than those of the windward propeller under the steady turning condition overall the numerical results show satisfactory consistency with the available experimental data in view of the complicated characteristics of the hull propeller rudder interaction the propulsive loads present remarkable asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers under the maneuvering condition meanwhile the asymmetry is closely related to the ship motion of drift and yaw in order to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of the asymmetric propulsive loads during ship maneuvers further investigation should be conducted on the basis of the wake field around the hull and propellers under the given maneuvering condition 5 2 features of flow field around the hull the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propellers are highly affected by the ship wake in order to provide a sufficient understanding about the inflow impinging on the propeller disk during ship maneuvers the flow field around the hull under the given ship motions is analyzed qualitatively for the ship not appended with the rotating propellers the static drift test with β 10 and rotating arm test with r 0 3 are simulated based on the ship fixed coordinate system adopted in the cfd computation the contours of longitudinal velocity u and axial vortex ω x are plotted on eight uniformly spaced cross sections extending from x 1 5 m to 1 75 m the variation of the flow field along the longitudinal direction of the ship model is visualized with the contours on these sections the flow fields around the hull at drift angle β 10 are plotted in fig 10 a series of strong vortices detached from the sonar dome bilge keels stabilizing fins and skeg are clearly identified with the contours of u and ω x the sonar dome vortex moves towards the leeward side moving far away from the aft body of the ship model the vortices shedding from the bilge keel and the stabilizing fin of windward side are more apparent than those of the leeward side and they are interacted with the vortex shedding from the skeg near the stern from the contour of u it can be seen that the boundary layer gets thicker along the longitudinal direction showing an asymmetrical distribution with respect to the windward and leeward sides of hull the boundary layer on the leeward side is thicker than that on the windward side exhibiting a stronger interaction with the vortices shedding from the sonar dome and the bilge keels the flow fields around the hull under the steady turning condition of r 0 3 are plotted in fig 11 the major vortices are distorted remarkably due to the different local incidence angles along the longitudinal direction the vortex shedding from the sonar dome presents a clear curved path cross the ship keel impinging on the leeward propeller disk which is with an opposite rotational direction to that of the static drift case the vortices shedding from the bilge keels show opposite rotational direction for the fore body and aft body and are relatively weak due to the small local incidence angle besides a remarkable vortex shedding from the skeg arises at the stern the boundary layer is deformed under the effect of the vortices presenting a different development for the fore body and aft body of the ship model although the experimental data of the local flow field details are not available the obtained vortex distribution and the development of boundary layer are in accordance with those of sakamoto et al 2012 demonstrating the reliability of the present cfd computation from the flow field around the hull it can be seen that the inflow impinging on the propeller disk is highly affected by the developing boundary layer and shedding vortices meanwhile the impact is different for the windward and leeward sides the inflow to the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake to the contrary the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller disk is rather complicated which is highly affected by the shedding vortices relating to the ship motion 5 3 local flow field around the stern in order to further explore the effect of ship motion on the propeller performance the local flow field around the stern is analyzed the nominal wake at the propeller disk section s2 in fig 12 under different conditions are plotted to reflect the overall impact of ship motion on the inflow impinging on the propeller disk and the nominal wake at 0 7r radial position of the propeller disk is presented to illustrate the variation tendency with the drift angle and yaw rate further the propeller behavior is explored based on the flow field around the rotating propellers including the vortex structures generated by the fully appended ship model and the axial inflow distribution ahead and behind the propeller disk section s1 and s3 in fig 12 for the sake of analysis in subsequence a local coordinate system of propeller is adopted in accordance with its rotational direction viewed from the stern as shown in fig 13 5 3 1 nominal wake at the propeller disk the nominal wake under the straight ahead condition is presented in fig 14 the axial component of inflow is disturbed at the upper part of the propeller disk by the vortices detached from the shaft brackets and the developing boundary layer these factors result in a remarkable low velocity region at the 1st quadrant of portside and starboard propeller disks from the distribution of in plane component it can be seen that the incoming flow is slightly deflected inward and upward as a consequence of the pronounced diminution of hull geometry along the longitudinal direction the nominal wake under the static drift condition of β 10 is presented in fig 15 for the windward propeller disk the reduction of axial component at the 1st quadrant is less remarkable due to the thinner boundary layer and the deflection of vortices detached from the shaft brackets the direction of the in plane component presents a consistent trend with the lateral inflow induced by the drift angle except for that in the 1st quadrant of the propeller disk the inflow impinging on the windward propeller disk presents a relatively uniform distribution over the vast majority of the propeller disk while the inflow to the leeward propeller disk is more complicated due to the strong effect of the vortices detached from the sonar dome and the skeg hence it presents a rather non uniform distribution for the axial and in plane components the axial component is reduced apparently at the 1st and 4th quadrants of the propeller disk meanwhile the in plane component presents remarkable reduction and deflection at the most regions of the propeller disk the nominal wake under the steady turning condition of r 0 3 is presented in fig 16 similar to the static drift condition the nominal wake also presents a remarkable asymmetry for the windward and leeward propeller disks and it is less disturbed by the ship wake at the windward propeller disk for the steady turning condition the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller disk presents a different distribution from that under the static drift condition the nominal wake at the leeward propeller disk is highly affected by the vortex detached from the sonar dome which results in an apparent reduction of the axial component at the vast majority of the propeller disk moreover the in plane component is also deflected by the detached vortices a slight deflection is observed at the 1st quadrant of the propeller disk because the skeg vortex is relatively weak under the considered steady turning condition besides at the most region of the leeward propeller disk the flow is affected by the vortex shedding from the sonar dome however the vortex is with a rotational direction opposite to that in the static drift case resulting in a different distribution of the in plane component at the leeward propeller disk the nominal wake at the radial position of 0 7r under the static drift condition is plotted in fig 17 synthesizing the work principle of propeller blade the nominal wake is represented with the axial and tangential components separately denoted as u a and u t a remarkable asymmetry can be observed for the axial and tangential components and it is intensified with the increase of drift angle with the disturbance of shaft bracket the axial component is reduced at the 1st quadrant of the windward and leeward propeller disks the axial component at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the windward propeller disk decreases gradually with the increase of drift angle while it changes remarkably at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the leeward propeller disk presenting a significant reduction at larger drift angle meanwhile the tangential component at the windward propeller disk depends on the lateral inflow induced by drift angle it is less affected by the ship wake and changes with the increase of drift angle gradually differently with the increase of drift angle the tangential component is remarkably enlarged at the leeward propeller disk it would reduce the attack angle of propeller blade profile and result in the decrease of propeller loads further the nominal wake at the radial position of 0 7r under the steady turning condition is plotted in fig 18 the asymmetry of the nominal wake at the windward and leeward propeller disks is also intensified with the increase of yaw rate apart from the disturbance at the 1st quadrant the axial component presents a slight increase at the windward propeller disk with the increase of yaw rate while it decreases remarkably at the leeward propeller disk as a whole moreover the tangential component at the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake and it is shown that the generated vortices have a relatively weak impact on the tangential component at the leeward propeller disk which presents a similar distribution with that at the windward propeller disk apart from the phase difference 5 3 2 flow around the rotating propellers the vortex structures generated by the fully appended ship model under the two maneuvering conditions are shown in figs 19 and 20 they are visualized with the isosurface of the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor q which is colored by the non dimensional axial velocity there is an apparent interaction between the ship wake and the rotating propeller and the propeller slipstream is characterized by the distinct vortices shedding from blade tip and hub due to the effects of lateral inflow and ship wake these vortices are deflected towards the leeward side and the structure of the tip vortex presents an asymmetric distribution with respect to the shaft axis for the different maneuvering conditions the windward propeller is less affected by the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages being dominated by the lateral inflow induced by the maneuvering motion the tip vortex is enhanced at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants of the disk differently the leeward propeller is more disturbed by the generated vortex e g the skeg vortex which would change with the maneuvering motion it is shown that the tip vortex is enhanced at the 1st quadrant of the leeward propeller disk under the two maneuvering conditions besides compared with the windward propeller the tip vortex shedding from the leeward propeller is diffused apparently under the static drift condition while it is enhanced under the steady turning condition this difference is in accordance with the computed global loads on the propellers the axial flow ahead and behind the rotating propellers under the straight ahead condition is depicted in fig 21 compared with the nominal wake the axial flow at section s1 is accelerated remarkably due to the suction effect of the rotating propellers under the shadow effect of the shaft brackets a low velocity region appears at the 1st quadrant of the sections ahead of the propeller disks from the flow at section s3 it can be seen that the axial flow is accelerated apparently by the propeller slipstream a high velocity region appears at the 1st and 2nd quadrants of the selected sections demonstrating that the propeller blades experience a higher load at those positions it is in accordance with the negative high velocity region shown in fig 17 c and d suggesting that the tangential component induced by the ship hull would have an apparent effect on the propeller performance the axial flow ahead and behind the rotating propellers under the static drift condition of β 10 and the steady turning condition of r 0 3 are plotted in figs 22 and 23 respectively it is shown that the vortices detached from the hull and appendages are less affected by the rotating propellers hence a distribution of the axial inflow similar to that of nominal wake is observed at section s1 as for the axial flow at section s3 a remarkable high velocity region arises at the 2nd and 3rd quadrants behind the windward propeller and at the 1st quadrant behind the leeward propeller which is observed both under the static drift condition and steady turning condition the distribution of high velocity region is in accordance with the negative high velocity region of tangential component of nominal wake at 0 7r radial position as shown in figs 17 and 18 in combination with the analysis of the local flow and propulsive loads obtained in the numerical simulation it is shown that the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers under maneuvering conditions is highly related to the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages the hydrodynamic characteristics of the windward propeller is less affected by the ship wake under different maneuvering conditions depending on the lateral inflow induced by the drift and yaw motions for another the inflow impinging on the leeward propeller is highly influenced by the vortices detached from the hull and appendages and the vortex distribution is rather different under drift and yaw conditions under the static drift condition the generated skeg vortex leads to the reduction of the axial component and the increase of the tangential component compared with the reduction of the axial component the remarkably enlarged tangential component plays a primary role in the behavior of the leeward propeller resulting in lower propeller loads than those of the windward propeller under the steady turning condition apart from the effect of the skeg vortex similar to that under the static drift condition the leeward propeller is also affected by the sonar dome vortex with an opposite rotational direction under the combined effect of the vortices detached from the skeg and the sonar dome the axial component of nominal wake is remarkably reduced while the tangential component is less affected due to the dominant impact of the reduced axial component the leeward propeller presents higher propulsive loads than the windward propeller under the steady turning condition therefore the assessment of propeller loads obtained by considering only the axial inflow would be misleading the crucial contribution of the axial and tangential components induced by the shedding vortices to the propeller behavior should be underlined in addition the variation of the propeller performance is complicated during ship maneuvering which is usually affected by a combination effect of drift and yaw motions 5 4 effective wake fraction considering the complicated flow field around the stern of twin screw ships during maneuvers it is rather challenging to model the propulsive loads theoretically here the propeller performance under ship maneuvering condition is described with the effective wake fraction and the relation between the effective wake fraction and ship motion is explored the effective wake fraction is computed by using the thrust identity method where the thrust is obtained from the numerical results while the open water characteristics are obtained from the available experimental data simman 2014 the computed effective wake fraction expressed as 1 w p is given as a function of the dimensionless geometrical lateral inflow to the propeller v p in fig 24 1 w p derived from the simulation of static drift test is denoted as sdt data and that from the simulation of rotating arm test is denoted as rat data it is shown that 1 w p presents an apparent asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers overall for the windward propeller 1 w p presents a relatively mild changing tendency with the increase of v p a similar tendency is observed for the effective wake fraction obtained from the simulation of static drift test and rotating arm test which is in accordance with the analysis of the nominal wake for the leeward propeller 1 w p changes remarkably and distinctly different changing trend with v p is observed in the static drift and steady turning cases under the static drift condition 1 w p changes slightly with v p of small magnitude about drift angle of 6 and it is enlarged significantly as v p continues to increase on the contrary 1 w p decreases monotonously with the increase of v p under the steady turning condition in view of the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction the existing propeller models are insufficient to describe the propeller performance under maneuvering conditions in those models the asymmetric behavior of the windward and leeward propellers is underestimated besides for the majority of the models the difference of the effective wake fraction under the drift and yaw conditions is not taken into account in order to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior during maneuvers reasonably the proposed propeller models should be modified by taking the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction into account in this study the propeller models are reconstructed for the windward and leeward propellers respectively meanwhile considering the complicated characteristics of the effective wake fraction for the leeward propeller part of the propeller models are refined for drift and yaw motions separately the data regression for the computed effective wake fraction of the windward propeller is presented in fig 25 meanwhile the statistical parameters of residual sum of squares rss and pearson correlation coefficient r2 are also presented to qualify the accuracy of data fitting it is shown that 1 w p presents relatively scattered distribution with the ship motions of drift and yaw hence relatively poor fitting accuracy is obtained for the refined propeller models overall obviously the models of hirano kim and yasukawa fail to represent the variation of the effective wake fraction kose s model is feasible for several segments of the data points with a reasonable value of rss while the overall tendency is poorly represented by the model according to the lower value of r2 in contrast the models of kang and lee present satisfactory capability of describing the effective wake fraction for the windward propeller the data regressions for the computed effective wake fraction of the leeward propeller are presented in figs 26 and 27 here the models of hirano kose kang yasukawa and lee are adopted for the data fitting of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions separately apart from hirano s model most of the models are with good capability of describing the changing tendency of the effective wake fraction for the leeward propeller presenting satisfactory values of rss and r2 however establishing the model of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions separately would increase the amount of fitting parameters significantly and the complicated structure would also reduce the applicability of the models particularly the model proposed by matsumoto is adopted for the data fitting of the effective wake fraction under drift and yaw conditions jointly with the parameters of c p v and c p r introduced to take the difference between the drift and yaw motions into account the regression with the model presents a reasonable value of rss and r2 demonstrating a good fitting accuracy for the leeward propeller under the maneuvering condition based on the regression analysis for the effective wake fraction under the maneuvering condition a composite model of the effective wake fraction would be feasible to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior during maneuvers for the twin screw ship where matsumoto s model is adopted for the leeward propeller and the model of kang or lee is adopted for the windward propeller particularly it is worth noting that the models of kang and lee can be regarded as a simplified form of matsumoto s model when neglecting the difference between the drift and yaw conditions 6 conclusion in this study the propulsive loads of a twin screw ship during maneuvers are investigated by using cfd method the proposed modules of propellers in the mathematical model of ship maneuvering motion are summarized to analyze the modeling method of the propeller performance under maneuvering condition taking the twin screw ship model dtmb 5415m as the study object a series of static drift tests and rotating arm tests are simulated by using rans method the computed thrust and torque show reasonable agreement with the available experimental data demonstrating the reliability of cfd method in modeling of the hull propeller rudder interaction under maneuvering condition the wake fields around the hull and stern are analyzed to clarify the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operating under maneuvering condition for the twin screw ship the contours of axial velocity and vortex around the hull help to gain a deeper insight into the effect of ship motion on the inflow impinging on the propeller disks the local flow around the stern provides more details on the flow around the propeller disks showing an apparent difference between the nominal wake of the windward and leeward propellers under maneuvering condition the nominal wake at the windward propeller disk is less affected by the ship wake while that at the leeward propeller disk is highly affected by the vortices shedding from the hull and appendages the vortices have different impact on the axial and tangential components of nominal wake during various ship maneuvering motions in combination with the global loads and flow field around the rotating propellers the shedding vortices have a remarkable effect on the propulsive loads of the leeward propeller which might be the main factor resulting in the asymmetric propeller behavior for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in addition the relation between the propeller performance and the ship maneuvering motion are explored based on the computed effective wake fraction it is shown that the effective wake fraction presents a significant asymmetry for the windward and leeward propellers especially the changing tendencies under the drift and yaw conditions are rather different for the leeward propeller hence the summarized propeller models are refined by piecewise fitting to consider the asymmetry of the windward and leeward sides and the different changing tendencies relating to the ship motion from the data fitting it can be seen that a composite model of the effective wake fraction would be feasible to describe the asymmetric propeller behavior for the twin screw ship during maneuvers it should be pointed out that this study focuses on the hydrodynamic mechanism of propeller operating under the given maneuvering condition as well as the feasibility of the existing propeller models adopted in mmg model however the effects of the coupled drift yaw motion and the rudder deflection on the propulsive loads have not yet been taken into account these effects would arise in the practical ship maneuvers and should be taken into account for a more accurate prediction of ship maneuverability therefore further systematic numerical and experimental investigations are needed to better understand and generalize the asymmetric propeller behavior

22037,a coupled dynamics model of multi component mooring line is proposed to analyze the motion of a floating offshore structure the model is developed by extending three dimensional lumped mass method allowing the motion of segment connection points and including an anchor and clump weights it offers analysis on simultaneous interlocking segment line motions to solve three dimensional dynamic responses of a multi component mooring line the model integrates hydrodynamic loads line seabed interaction elasticity current effect and dragging anchor motions it is then coupled with a ship type floating offshore structure and validated by comparing with equivalent model based on a conventional numerical method comparison against two dimensional model is also established finally coupled motion analysis of the floating structure moored by multi leg with multi component mooring lines in realistic operations are conducted by considering actual environmental loads the impact of the presented dynamics model on the evaluation of the response of the floating structure and mooring line tension are investigated the results conclude that the model can successfully provide the realistic prediction of the motion of the floating structure farther this paper found out that three dimensional mooring line treatment needs to be considered since lateral mooring line motion has considerable impact on mooring line tension keywords multi component mooring line mooring line dynamics coupled analysis three dimensional dynamics model 1 introduction in recent decades deep water and severe sea conditions are substantial issue for oil and gas exploitation activities it is challenging to operate a floating offshore structure under complex environmental loads arisen in deep water and severe sea conditions the operations need to be paid attention conscientiously especially focusing on mooring because an adequate mooring line system is necessary to keep the floating structure surviving under the complex environmental conditions the mooring line system is becoming more intricate and needs to be designed in a complex manner ansari 1999 multi component mooring line system consisting of various segment lines clump weights and buoy is considered as the most apropos mooring line system applied for the deep water and severe sea conditions it has superiority comparing with single component mooring line system childers 1974 mooring line tension and the length of catenary line can be reduced by varying the composition of mooring line segments as well as attaching clump weights buoys the cost of a mooring line can also be decreased through the appropriate arrangement of the line segments recently multi component mooring line is widely used for deep water offshore structure ba 2011 vazquez hernandez et al 2011 qiao et al 2013 and xie et al 2015 and it is proven that the mooring line system can withstand external forces under severe sea conditions ha 2011 multi component mooring line is also used and expanded into a new mooring system which is called hybrid mooring line system ji et al 2011 yuan and incecik 2014 and xu et al 2018 to reduce vertical anchoring force in taut mooring the yaw motions of a ship type floating offshore structure with the mooring line system in deep water sanchez mondragon et al 2018 and the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform with the mooring line system ghafari and dardel 2018 were evaluated experimental works related to the mooring line system can be found in zhao et al 2013 lopez et al 2017 the applications of multi component mooring line for deep water conditions are expected to be escalated owing to the increase of operations in deep water conditions the inclusion of the dynamic effects of a mooring line into motion analysis is strongly essential for deep water mooring because these effects become significantly concomitant with the increase of water depth it must be considered in the prediction of mooring performance when investigating the responses of a floating offshore structure ansari 1991 the modeling of the dynamic behavior of a mooring line is challenging task for multi component mooring line it needs laborious efforts since the analysis of mooring line dynamics is literally arduous due to the nonlinearities of a mooring line motions lo 1982 plenty of dynamics models have been arisen for investigating mooring line dynamics these models can be categorized into a finite difference model huang 1994 a finite element fe model roussel 1976 a lumped mass model walton and polachek 1960 a nonlinear boundary value problem method chiou 1990 and a multi body dynamics model kreuzer and wilke 2003 finite difference fe and lumped mass models are popularly used to address the problems of mooring line dynamics the finite difference model based on lagrangian formulation for cable dynamics was presented by tjavaras 1996 it was applied for modeling the dynamics of risers katifeoglou and chatjigeorgiou 2012 and considering the presence of current chen et al 2018 moreover the fe model has been presented by garret 1982 and exerted with without taking bending and torsional stiffnesses into account bucham et al 2004 aamo and fossen 2000 the model was extended by various manners i e mixed fe model montano et al 2007 high order fe model escalante et al 2011 and discontinuous galerkin method palm et al 2013 it was also applied for multi component mooring line to investigate the feasibility of polyester mooring line tahar and kim 2008 however both models were commonly developed based on slender rod model it has versatility and can tackle various boundary conditions in discretization of a mooring line xiong 2016 but more complex mathematical model is required when considering mooring line chai and varyani 2006 on the other hand the fe model has pertinence feature in predicting mooring line dynamics however the computations become slower time consuming and costly hall and goupee 2015 comparing with the above models the lumped mass model is assessed as more efficient for calculating mooring line dynamics with good accuracy the discretization in the lumped mass model makes the model to resemble the fe model azcona et al 2017 and exhibits features which are identical to a straight line element fe model lee and tu 2018 lumped mass model can characterize the necessary features of mooring line dynamics and evade unnecessary features in the fe model which may increase computation time hall and goupee 2015 the discretization has intelligible simplicity and obvious physical meaning for every part of mathematical formulations providing the efficiency in numerical calculations xiong et al 2016 however the application of the lumped mass model for multi component mooring line is limited studies using the lumped mass model were firstly started by walton and polachek 1960 the study introduced the lumped mass model for a single component mooring line through two dimensional discretization the model was further extended by nakajima et al 1982 taking the elasticity of a mooring line into account nakajima et al 1983 expanded the model to three dimensional model and verified with experimental results the results were good though the model was only applied for a single component line the other studies related the lumped mass model can be observed in chai et al 2002b low and langley 2006 and xiong et al 2016 moreover the validations of the lumped mass model were carried out through model test data hall and goupee 2015 and fe based dynamic code azcona et al 2017 both validations indicate the satisfaction of the model in the prediction of dynamic mooring line in fact many studies concerning to dynamic mooring line models have been published however the studies focused on the modeling of dynamics of a multi component mooring line were merely few a model of a multi component mooring line was solely presented in static manner ansari 1980 while the inclusion of dynamic effect was firstly proposed in nakajima et al 1982 by two dimensional lumped mass model the dynamic manners of a multi component mooring line could be expressed well in both studies but calculated results were only provided for identical segment lines moreover an extended model presented in van den boom 1985 chai et al 2002b could figure the dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line with various segment types however the portion of a multi component line in the proposed algorithm was not explained clearly furthermore khan and ansari 1986 provided formulae and succeeded to demonstrate the dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line combining with the motion of a moored offshore vessel ansari 1991 unfortunately it was restricted for inextensible mooring line since the influence of line elasticity was not performed in addition to predict the performance of a mooring line incorporating with the motion of a floating offshore structure a quasi static masciola et al 2013 chai et al 2002a figueirodo and brojo 2017 and quasi dynamic bureau veritas 1998 2004 approaches are frequently used both approaches were developed based on the catenary solutions bauduin and naciri 2000 and thereby the dynamic effects of a mooring line are literally excluded johanning et al 2005 2007 and ha 2011 accordingly the quasi static approach is considered to be inadequate method to apply for deep water conditions mavrakros et al 1996 meanwhile the mooring line tension and the motion of a floating structure are calculated separately in the quasi dynamic approach for the sake of computation time and simplification of complex interaction between them this may lead to the depreciation of calculation accuracy coupled dynamics approach is assessed to be the most rigorous method to carry out the dynamic analysis of the motion of a floating offshore structure both dynamic effects of a mooring line and a floating structure are simultaneously obtained by using the approach the basic theoretical study of the approach was presented by ornberg et al 1998 while its application discussing mooring line dynamics can be found in heurtier et al 2001 garret 2005 low and langley 2006 2008 recently this approach was often used to address the hydrodynamic problems in offshore fields ji et al 2016 jacob et al 2012a 2012b zhao et al 2018 on the other hand there are numerous commercial software packages which provide the coupled dynamics model of mooring line including multi component mooring line problem as instance commercial software orcaflex orcina 2009 used lumped mass method to analyze mooring line system in the software multi component mooring line consisting of several segment lines is treated as a single non homogenous mooring line due to the various properties of the segment lines whilst in this paper the multi component mooring line is treated as segment line by segment line individually as the inherent part of the mooring line in this consideration the dynamic motions of the mooring line are generated by the dynamic motions of the segment lines moreover in this paper the connection point between the segment line is regarded as a massless node to be replaced by the properties of attached component anchor sinker buoy or clump weight while it is considered as a mass node generated from the half element of two connected segment lines which may have different properties more further the overview of various software packages is reviewed in detail by davidson and ringwood 2017 the type of mathematical model used in the software and the features of the software including publications are summarized rhinefrank et al 2010 recorded that the software packages often need to be improved with own numerical code the replenishment of own numerical code into the software is not easy to be conducted thereby the numerical model of coupled dynamics model of multi component mooring line is needed to be developed to accommodate the various specific nature of the coupling dynamic mooring line problems based on the aforementioned premises this study intends to develop a dynamics model of a three dimensional multi component mooring line coupled with the motion of a floating offshore structure the dynamics model is further used to study the necessities of three dimensional manner in calculating the motions of a mooring line the calculated results are compared with results based on two dimensional model to investigate the effect of three dimensional motions furthermore to ensure the ability of the developed model for realistic operation the coupled motions analysis of a ship type floating offshore structure under realistic environmental conditions is conducted the motions of the floating structure and the tension of its mooring line are investigated this study lays on several sections section 2 describes the developed dynamics model of a three dimensional multi component mooring line while the coupling of this model to a ship type floating offshore structure is explained in section 3 a combination of mathematical maneoeuvring model based on the manoeuvring modeling group mmg and conventional floating body motion equations is used to perform the simultaneous analysis of coupled motions between the structure and mooring lines the verification of the developed model is presented in section 4 by comparing with model results calculated by using published method the discussion of the three dimensional effect in calculating dynamics mooring line is presented in section 5 furthermore numerical simulations considering the developed model associated with realistic environmental loads are discussed in section 6 finally the study is summarized into the concluding remarks described in section 7 2 three dimensional multi component mooring line model 2 1 problem description of multi component mooring line a typical multi component mooring line is shown in fig 1 the multi component mooring line is composed of various mooring line components consisting of several identically variously segment lines clump weight and or buoy the clump weights and or buoys are occasionally attached at the connection point between the segments these components are used to increase anchor holding capacity and to decrease mooring line tension respectively the multi component mooring line is subjected to the current force which directly acts on the mooring line depending on its vertical position wave wind and other external forces are enforced as the coupled forces acting on the top point of the mooring line meanwhile bending and torsional stiffnesses of mooring line are neglected since both stiffnesses do not influence mooring line tension too much as reported by hall et al 2014 the dynamic behavior of each segment of a multi component mooring line generally depends on its properties water depth current force anchor holding power and external forces acting on the top point of the mooring line however since the segment lines are connected each other their dynamic behavior are also affected by the weight and tension of other components connected to the segment similarly the properties of an anchor a clump weight and a buoy which may be attached at the end of the segment also give significant effect to the segment line motions consequently these items affect the dynamic behavior of entire multi component mooring line moreover the diverse environmental loads which come from various directions drive the dynamic motions of a floating offshore structure to the six degree of freedom 6 dof these motions encourage the three dimensional motion of the top point of the mooring line and hence these induce the three dimensional dynamic motions of the mooring line the diverse environmental loads acting directly on the mooring line also encourage the mooring line to move three dimensionally therefore a dynamics model for a multi component mooring line must be constructed in three dimensional manners in addition the features of an anchor must be expressed well including its motions and holding forces to satisfy the possibility of semi taut mooring line conditions 2 2 technical groundwork of three dimensional multi component mooring line lumped mass model a dynamics model for a multi component mooring line is constructed by applying a single component mooring line dynamics model nakajima et al 1983 to each segment line of a multi component mooring line this single component mooring line model discretizes a mooring line equally dividing it into several massless spring elements based on three dimensional lumped mass model the elements are linked by a mass point which is regarded as a node it is assumed that the weight of each element and external forces acting on each element are lumped to the node meanwhile the motions of uppermost and lowermost nodes are assumed to be given by arbitrary prescribed motion and to stay at a fixed point as a fixed anchor on the sea bed respectively this three dimensional lumped mass model for a single component mooring line is illustrated in fig 2 the three dimensional lumped mass model presented for a single component mooring line is further adopted and modified to model a multi component mooring line every segment of a multi component mooring line is considered as a single component line based on nakajima s lumped mass model and then interconnected each other to build a lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line each segment line is divided into n elements which means the segment consists of n 1 nodes while the external forces acting on the elements are congregated at these nodes on the other hand both ends of the segment line need to be regarded as meaningless nodes which provide vacant nodes for attaching to an anchor a sinker or a buoy the treatment of both ends of a segment line in this approach is slightly different from common lumped mass method such as a lumped mass method adopted in commercial software orcaflex in the lumped mass method the both end nodes of a segment line are considered to have mass which is equal to the total masses of both half elements existing at the either side of the node orcina 2009 whereas those nodes are massless in this method the mass of the both end elements for each segment line is distributed to node which is most adjacent to the end nodes node j i j n to compensate the presence of attached component at the end nodes this massless node will be replaced by mass node depending on the condition of the connection point associated with the massless node meanwhile in the common lumped mass method the node is generated from two different segment lines generally speaking in the common lumped mass method this node represents two different segment lines which may have different properties on the other hand in the orcaflex time domain motion of the mooring line is calculated directly for entire mooring line while it is calculated through segment line by segment line in this proposed lumped mass method since the nodes for both ends of the segment are vacant thereby the number of non vacant nodes which is equal to n 1 is less than the number of element n a boundary condition for the ends of the segment is necessary to accommodate the redundant element thus the mass of the element and inherent forces acting on the redundant element are equally distributed to the both adjacent nodes hence the mass of the first lifted node and the previous node of top node denoted with δ i and δ n respectively are 1 5 times greater than other nodes whilst the nodes of both ends segments j i 1 j n 1 are considered as massless nodes δ j 0 furthermore connection points joints between adjacent segments are generated by bonding the top node of lower side segment with the bottom node of upper side segment it means that the top node j n 1 of i th segment j i n 1 coincides to the bottom node j 1 of i 1 th segment j i 1 1 in other words both nodes can be regarded as identical node which can be merged into a joint node j i n 1 j i 1 1 since the joint node is generated by bonding two massless nodes it also becomes a massless node accordingly some additional constraints and improvements are established especially for the joint node for replacing the massless node to comply with the conditions for the exact geometry and inherent features of a multi component mooring line in static condition the features of the joint node are modified to meet the basic physical meaning of a multi component mooring line geometry as reported in ansari 1980 it will be discussed later the lumped mass algorithms pertaining to the joint node are also improved when performing the dynamic motion analysis of a mooring line the joint node must move freely and it can t be assumed as the prescribed motion or to stay at a fixed point likely in the single component mooring line model in other words it can be said that the motion of the joint node is similar with the motion of common lumped mass nodes in order to express the dynamic motions of the joint node the lumped mass algorithms used in common nodes are adopted and applied to the joint node however since the lumped mass algorithm in nakajima s single component line model excludes the dynamic motions of both end nodes some modifications are established considering the dynamic effects from adjacent segment moreover an appropriate anchor formulations are adopted to express the motion of bottom end node of a mooring line anchor point whilst the motion of the top point of a mooring line is generated by 6 dof motions of floating offshore structure the dynamic lumped mass model for a three dimensional multi component mooring line can be constructed through these considerations 2 3 local coordinate systems of mooring line as illustrated in fig 3 a multi component mooring line can be expressed by the three dimensional lumped mass model a x y z is a line coordinate system with the origin of z axis on the seabed the schematic diagram of the three dimensional lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line including their features is specifically displayed in the figure as shown in the figure a multi component mooring line lumped mass model is considered as a continuum of several three dimensional lumped mass models for segment lines interconnecting each other and incorporated with an anchor and clump weight buoy in the model the top point of a uppermost segment line which means the top point of a mooring line denoted by p is the attached point of the mooring line on a floating offshore structure bellmouth node a is the bottom end of a lowermost segment regarded as an anchor point joints between the segments can be considered as joints with without clump weight buoy the three dimensional lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line is referred to the line coordinate system a x y z the entire nodes can freely move in three dimensional directions and they provide three dimensional mooring line motions whilst the rotational motions of a line are disregarded since the effects of these motions on the dynamic behavior of a mooring line are not so considerable 2 4 multi component mooring line features the geometry of a multi component mooring line model is detailed in fig 4 here a multi component mooring line is composed by m segments and i th segment is discretized into n i elements while the mass of the segment is spread out into n i 1 nodes an anchor point a touchdown point and the first lifted node are expressed by a i 1 and i respectively j i and p denote i th joint node and the top point of the mooring line in additions w i j is the weight of j th node in i th segment whilst segment length is denoted as l i by adopting the fundamental of nakajima s lumped mass model and integrating anchor feature at the anchor point node node weights for a multi component mooring line model can be described as follows 1 w a w 11 w a w i w r i 1 5 w l r w n i w i n 1 5 w l i i r w r j 1 0 w l r i j n w r j 0 0 j i w i j 1 0 w l i 1 j n i r w i j 0 0 i r where r indicates the first lifted segment line number in the meantime the weight of the joint between segments is defined by characterizing the features of the multi component line according to the basic insight of multi component catenary method reported by ansari 1980 since this weight is pondered as the total weight of suspended part beneath the joint including lifted clump weight buoy the weight of the joint can be written as 2 w j i k 1 i w s k k 2 i w c k w a k 1 i w s k k 2 i w c k k 1 i w s k w a a c t a n d w a 0 w a i n a c t w a i n a c t w c i n a c t o r w c 0 in which the component weights of the joint weights are given by 3 w s k i 1 k j 2 n w i j w c k w c i w c k 0 w c a c t w c i n a c t in eq 2 and eq 3 subscripts a c t and i n a c t represent the lifting condition active or inactive of joint node and anchor the joint node is active when it is upraised from the seabed and vice versa active anchor occurs when there are no nodes lying on the seabed and hence the tension line pulls the anchor meanwhile the weights of mooring line components are given as follows 4 w a w c a w l i w c l i l i w c w c c i where w c a w c l i and w c c i are the weight of an anchor the weight of line segment per unit length and the weight of clump weight buoy in water respectively while l i indicates element length of the segment l i n i according to eq 4 it can be said that the mass of the joint node which attaches to clump weight buoy can be expressed by the mass of clump weight buoy while the mass of anchor point is represented by the mass of anchor furthermore due to the considerations used to express the conditions of a joint node as aforedescribed the joint node will become massless and weightless when the joint node is inactive called as inactive empty joint node j i e accordingly an adjustment for the nodes close to the joint must be carried out because the massless weightless condition of joint node makes lumped mass solutions cannot to be solved the adjustment is carried out by distributing the mass of nodes which are adjacent to the inactive empty joint node j i e into the mass of inactive empty joint node δ j i e the mass of the nodes around the inactive empty joint node further become 5 δ j i e δ i e 1 n 1 δ i e 1 n δ i e 1 δ i e 2 1 0 m l i e 1 0 5 m l i e 1 m l i e 1 0 m l i e where i e represents the number of inactive empty joint node by this manner the adequate solutions for lumped mass matrix algorithm for a multi component mooring line can be attained 2 5 static analysis of multi component mooring line 2 5 1 determining initial line configuration the initial configuration of a mooring line is necessary to define the circumstance of each segment line at the initial condition it encompasses the initial horizontal and vertical projected lengths as well as suspended length for each segment line the initial circumstance of a segment line is required to define the initial state of the segment fully laying on seabed partially suspended or fully suspended segment this initial state of a segment line is then used to introduce the initial status of a joint node active inactive and thereby describes a constraint condition applied for the ends of the segment this constraint is required when calculating the initial shape of a multi component mooring line by the present lumped mass model the weight mass of a joint node generated by its lower suspended segment must be known to obtain the initial shape of an upper segment since the physical understanding of static condition for a multi component mooring line in lumped mass model is identical with the catenary method static multi component catenary line equations are used to express the initial line configuration the typical types of line configurations and their equations proposed by ansari 1980 which was resumed by ba 2011 are used as follows 6 x i a i sinh 1 s i a i tan θ i sinh 1 tan θ i h i a i cosh x i a i sinh 1 tan θ i cosh sinh 1 tan θ i s i a i sinh x i a i sinh 1 tan θ i tan θ i here x i and h i are the projected length of the i th segment in horizontal and vertical directions respectively and s i is the suspended length of the i th segment a i is equal to t h 0 w c l i θ i is an angle formed by horizontal plane and the line segment at i th joint node while t h 0 indicates the initial tension of the mooring line through the iteration process following the procedure in catenary method the preliminary initial line configuration can be obtained and then used as the reference for static multi component lumped mass calculation 2 5 2 initial shape of multi component mooring line the initial condition of a multi component mooring line is obtained through the static analysis of each segment the method proposed by nakajima 1983 is adopted to introduce the initial condition of each segment since the method is literally described for a single component line type it is applied to each segment considering multifarious treatments depending on the initial states of the segment these multifarious treatments exist due to the various constraints coming from the various initial states of the segment to overcome those various constraints the initial states of segment are classified into three types i e fully laying on the seabed partially suspended and fully suspended the initial shape of each segment for lumped mass model is then obtained by regarding the initial state of the segment as one of these three types and calculating the initial shape by using the constraint of the regarded type further the calculation summary for each type of initial shape can be described as follows the calculation of initial shape for a segment which is fully laying on the seabed or partially suspended is started by determining a touchdown point node j i 1 since the touchdown point node may exist in these two types the touchdown point node can be determined by iterating calculation using the following formula 7 w i 1 z p i l i j 1 n i t i j 1 a i e i 1 k 2 j w i k j 1 n i t i j 1 n i a i e i where z p i l i a i and e i are the vertical position of a top segment measured form its bottom end original length sectional area and young s modulus of the i th segment respectively t i j is calculated as follows 8 t i j t i 1 2 w i 1 2 k 1 j w i k 2 the iterative calculation is repeated until the weight of the touchdown point node w i i 1 i 2 becomes greater than 0 in the iteration w i 1 is treated as 0 if the calculated value of w i 1 is less than 0 furthermore the initial segment shape can be calculated by the following equations 9 x i j 1 i 1 k l i k cos γ i k cos χ i y i j 1 i 1 k l i k cos γ i k sin χ i z i j 1 i 1 k l i k sin γ i k where x i j y i j z i j γ i k and χ i can be observed in fig 3 meanwhile due to the absence of a node attached on the seabed a fully suspended segment is introduced by calculating the initial shape of a segment based on eq 9 and omitting the calculation for the touchdown point node in addition weight correction for nodes close to the seabed given by nakajima et al 1983 is also applied 2 6 segment line consideration for dynamic motions of multi component mooring line a lumped mass node matrix is adopted to introduce the flexibilities of both end nodes of a segment line the flexibilities are aroused by extending the treatment of a segment to satisfy proper boundary condition at the nodes thus additional nodes taken from upper or lower segment is appended to the considered segment to reproduce free motions of the end nodes in this improvement each segment is classified into three conditions as shown in fig 5 in this figure a segment is regarded as the lowest segment i 1 middle segment 1 i m or the top segment i m of a mooring line due to this improvement the nodes which are regarded as the flexible node in lumped mass method are modified according to the types of segment i e j 2 n for i 1 j 1 n 1 for 1 i m and j 1 n for i m moreover the coordinate system of mass point used for the equation of mooring line motion is depicted in fig 6 2 7 forces acting on the mooring line 2 7 1 hydrodynamic forces hydrodynamic forces acting on the node are expressed by the following equations 10 f d x i j sin β i j cos θ i j cos i j sin θ i j sin i j f d n i j cos β i j cos θ i j f d t i j f d y i j cos β i j cos i j f d n i j sin β i j f d t i j f d z i j sin β i j cos θ i j cos i j cos θ i j sin i j f d n i j cos β i j cos θ i j f d t i j while hydrodynamic drag forces in normal and tangential directions are calculated by 11 f d n i j 1 2 ρ c d n d c l u n i j u n i j f d t i j 1 2 ρ c d t d c l u t i j u t i j where 12 u t i j u ξ i j u n i j u v i j 2 u η i j 2 i j tan 1 u η i j u v i j in which u ξ i j u v i j and u η i j are obtained by the following matrix 13 u ξ i j u v i j u η i j cos β i j cos θ i j sin β i j cos θ i j sin θ i j sin β i j cos β i j 0 sin θ i j cos β i j sin β i j sin θ i j cos θ i j x i j v x i j y i j v y i j z i j v z i j here x i j y i j z i j and v x i j v y i j v z i j are the velocities of node and current respectively while α i j β i j θ i j are the average angle of three dimensional node shown in fig 6 which are generated by node j and j 1 2 7 2 current velocities current velocities at a mooring line node referred to the local mooring line coordinate system as shown in fig 3 are denoted as v x i j v y i j and v z i j if the current direction referred to the x axis of local mooring line coordinate system is denoted as α c l surface current velocity is v c and the current velocity acting on the node is v c i j the current velocity in local mooring line coordinate system can be easily written as 14 v x i j v c i j cos α c l v y i j v c i j sin α c l v z

introduced it is defined through considering incident wave in term of its direction and amplitude when the direction of the incident wave relative to the floating structure is denoted as μ i e following sea is represented as μ 0 as shown in fig 7 and the amplitude of the wave is assumed as ζ a velocity potential φ 0 representing incident wave in infinite water depth can be expressed by the following equation 27 φ 0 r e g ζ a i ω 0 φ 0 x e i ω 0 t where 28 φ 0 x e k 0 z i k 0 x cos μ y sin μ here g ω 0 and k 0 represent the gravitational acceleration circular frequency of the incident wave and wave number of the incident wave respectively the relationship among g ω 0 and k 0 can be expressed as k 0 ω 0 2 g the disturbance velocity potential φ x can be obtained by adding velocity potential for the incident wave φ 0 radiation potential φ j j 1 6 and diffraction potential φ d as follows 29 φ x g ζ a i ω e φ 0 x φ d x j 2 6 i ω e x j φ j x since normal vector in j 1 direction is

equation using φ 3 and φ 2 satisfying eq 32 since x u i ω e is constant in y and z directions 34 ϕ 5 x u i ω e ϕ 3 ϕ 6 x u i ω e ϕ 2 moreover the diffraction potential φ d can be written in the following formula 35 φ d k 0 e k 0 z i k 0 x cos μ i φ 2 sin μ φ 3 the detail of these relations among velocity potential can be seen in kashiwagi and iwashita 2012 3 2 2 solution of boundary element

3 2 π φ 0 p m j d where d m n and s m n are matrix coefficients for each segment over the body obtained by analytical integration over the segment the numerical solution described above has accommodated an approach for eliminating irregular frequencies that often appear in calculating the velocity potential by using boundary integral equation modified haraguchi ohmatsu s method is used to get rid of those irregular frequencies haraguchi and ohmatsu 1983 3 2 3 wave radiation forces the radiation force acting on the floating body can be obtained by integrating hydrodynamic pressure p r around ship hull the pressure is calculated by using radiation potential given in eq 32 and eq 34 the radiation force in the i direction can be obtained as follows 40 f i l d x s h p r n i d s ρ i ω e 2 j 2 4 x j l d x s h φ j n i d s j 2 4 f i j in which ρ is water density s h and l represent the shape of a hull section and ship length respectively since an imaginary part exists in the green function related to progressive wave on the water surface the radiation potential φ j is typically given as a complex number thus assuming that φ j φ j s i φ j c the radiation force f i j that works in the i direction due to the j mode oscillation is derived 41 f i j i ω e 2 x j ρ l d x s h φ j s n i d s i ω e x j ρ l d x s h φ j c n i d s according to eq 41 it can be noted that i ω 2 x j and i ω

the force component f i j can be written as the transfer function t i j respected to the motion x j f i j t i j x j by substituting eq 41 to eq 40 the following equations are established 43 f i j j 1

r r y β β r β y β r r r β r n h n β β n r r n β β β β n r r r r n β β r β n β r r r β r in eq 52 r r l u indicates non dimensional yaw rate β is relative drift angle due to the presence of current velocity while x u u and x β r represent non dimensional resistance in forward motion and the variation of longitudinal force due to drift and yaw motions here y β y r and so on are hydrodynamic derivatives denoted as y β y h β y r y h r and so on these hydrodynamic derivatives were obtained by captive model tests furthermore since the lateral motion of the floating structure in low speed motion becomes relatively larger comparing with running ship a mathematical model presented by muto et al 2010 to consider the effect of large drift angle are adopted to calculate y h and n h for large drift angle β 30 53 y h r α a y α r 2 b y α r c y α n h r α a n α r 2 b n α r c n α meanwhile when current velocity is taken into account the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by considering the relative speed of the floating structure due to the presence of the current the effect of current velocity is included and calculated directly on the coupled motion equation which is described in further 3 5 wind forces in the present study approximate formulae for wind forces proposed by fujiwara et al 1998 are used 54 x w 1 2 ρ a a t u w 2 c x ν y w 1 2 ρ a a l u w 2 c y ν n w 1 2 ρ a a l l o a u w 2 c n ν here ρ a is air density a t and a l are projected area in transverse and lateral views while l o a is the length over all of a ship type floating offshore structure u w indicates relative wind speed and c x ν c y ν and c n ν are coefficients of wind forces and moment which are the function of relative wind direction ν 3 6 tension forces tension forces acting on a ship type

given by the combinations of equations for manoeuvring motions in horizontal plane and equations for the vertical motions of a floating body since the coupled motion model can be assumed to be applicable for large ship shaped floating offshore structure fpso vlcc etc wave force on the upper end of the mooring lines can be neglected accordingly only horizontal component of the tension of the mooring line is taken into account in the floating structure motion equations furthermore by substituting all the loads described in this section for those in the coupled motions equations the following equations are established 56 m m x u m m y v r m x m y v c r sin ψ α x h x w x t m m y v m m x u r m y m x v c r cos ψ α y h y w y t y d i z z i z z r n h n w n t n d 57 m a 33 g z t b 33 g

here m m x and m y are vessel mass and its added mass component in x and y directions while i x x i y y and i z z are moments of inertia and i z z is added moment of inertia refer to z axis the speed of the floating structure in x and y directions are denoted as u and v whilst r is yaw rate c is the restoring force coefficient of the floating structure while superscript g indicates that the component forces act on the center of gravity g furthermore by solving these equations simultaneously in time domain as well as calculating dynamic mooring line motions the dynamic motions of the ship type offshore platform and multi component mooring line motions can be reproduced in this paper time domain calculation is solved by using runge kutta gill method with constant time step an appropriate time step is selected to get proper convergence results with an efficient time step for both coupled model and dynamic mooring line model 4 verification of three dimensional multi component mooring line dynamics model 4 1 conditions of verifications because the research conducting three dimensional manner of a multi component mooring line is limited the proposed multi component mooring line model is verified against to three dimensional single component mooring line model which has been validated by experiments nakajima et al 1983 in order to represent identical single component mooring line models in both models a multi component mooring line composed of three segments having identical properties is used in the developed model the properties and main particulars of mooring lines used in both models are completely same the properties of anchor related to both mooring lines are also equal the properties of both mooring lines are given in table 1 the sensitivity analysis of the number of mooring line nodes is conducted previously to get precise results both single and multi component mooring lines are then coupled with a ship type floating structure subjected to wave wind and current loads to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi component mooring line model in this coupled model the floating structure is considered to be moored by single point mooring line system at the sea having 500 m depth a mooring line is connected to the vessel at bow and deployed toward the bow direction the mooring line angle ξ 1 is 0 while an anchor is attached on the bottom end of the mooring line furthermore in order to consider the effect of the directions of external disturbances two cases are investigated in this verifications works in the first case noted as case a all external disturbances come from the same directions on the other hand the direction of wind is different from those of wave and current in the second case case b wave height wind speed and current velocity are assumed to be 2 m 10 m s and 1 knot respectively both cases are calculated under regular wave condition during about 15800 s with time step 0 01 s 4 2 verification in coupling with a vessel a ship type floating offshore structure which has principal dimensions shown in table 2 is used to be coupled with a single and multi component mooring lines described above both coupled models are then examined and compared each other in terms of mooring line tension the motions and the trajectory of the floating structure for the two environmental loads cases in the case a wave wind and current come from the same direction which is in 30 relative to the bow while the directions of wave wind and current in the case b are assumed to be 30 0 and 30 respectively the trajectories of the floating structure with single or multi component mooring line for both cases are depicted in fig 8 according to the figure since all external disturbances dominantly come from 30 for the case a the heading angle of the ship type floating offshore structure changes toward the direction of the disturbances on the other hand the ship type floating offshore structure moves farther away in lateral direction comparing with the case a due to the increase of lateral force and yawing moment by the external disturbances the figure also shows that the trajectories and mooring line motions for single and multi component mooring lines are quite similar this similarity is portrayed in detail in fig 9 showing the three dimensional motions of the mooring lines it is observed that the proposed multi component mooring line model can reproduce the motion of single component mooring line calculated by using the three dimensional single component mooring line model proposed by nakajima et al 1983 mooring line tension and 6 dof vessel motions with single or multi component mooring line in the two cases are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 according to these figures line tension and vessel motions for both mooring line models indicate good agreement though there is slight discrepancy at the beginning of the simulation it is considered that the discrepancy caused by the transient environmental loads acting on the floating structure which cause instability in the calculation of transient tension at the beginning of the simulation then this discrepancy can be neglected even further this discrepancy does not affect too much to the trajectories and the motions of the vessel as shown in fig 11 in the figure although the motions are not exactly same the tendency and magnitude of the motions calculated by the two mooring line models have good congruence this congruence is even denoted for all motion modes in the both cases accordingly the developed multi component mooring line dynamics model can be considered as the adequate model to investigate the influence of multi component mooring line on coupling motion of a floating offshore structure 5 comparison against two dimensional model 5 1 conditions of the comparison to investigate the effect of three dimensional manner of a mooring line in the analysis of mooring line dynamics the developed three dimensional dynamics model is compared with two dimensional mooring line model both two and three dimensional models are implemented to simulate the motion of a mooring line with a ship type floating structure used in section 4 the mooring line is regarded as a multi component mooring line consisting of various segment line properties while the mooring line configuration and water depth are same with those used in section 4 the properties of each line segment are presented in table 2 in addition the sensitivity analysis of the number of element of mooring line is carried out in advance to achieve the better accuracy of mooring line motion two dimensional dynamics model used for the comparison is literally similar with the developed three dimensional model however the lateral motion of a mooring line y axis direction is neglected it means that all force components coming from the lateral direction of the mooring line and their effects are omitted to only reflect the two dimensional manner of a mooring line generally speaking only longitudinal and vertical forces are affected to the mooring line tension in this comparison work three different cases are investigated to observe the effect of three dimensional manner under the various directions of the environmental loads the first case denoted as case i is conducted with 5 of wave wind and current directions to represent the environmental loads coming from the direction close to the longitudinal direction of the mooring line as well as the heading of the floating structure 30 of all external disturbances is applied for considering the effect of lateral environmental loads and it is presented in case i i finally the directions of wave wind and current are assumed as 0 15 and 30 respectively for case i i i to verify the effect of three dimensional model under the various combinations of the external loads wave height wind speed and current velocity are assumed to be 4 m 20 m s and 2 knot respectively this comparison is performed by considering regular wave condition with simulation time duration and time step which are same with those used in section 4 5 2 comparison results the comparison results of two and three dimensional models are presented in fig 12 to fig 14 the results of mooring line tension for both models can be observed in fig 12 according to the figure the tension of both models for case i is not too much different forces acting on the three dimensional mooring line model are dominantly generated by longitudinal forces since all external forces come from the longitudinal direction of the mooring line consequently forces coming from the lateral direction of mooring line are measly and not affected to the tension of the three dimensional mooring line model significantly this condition is alike with the condition of two dimensional calculation which does not take the lateral force into account therefore the trajectory of the floating structure and the mooring line motions for case i shown in fig 13 and fig 14 are almost similar however as the increasing of the lateral forces acting on the mooring line the mooring line tension increases as depicted in fig 12 for case i i the lateral forces enlarge the dynamic motions of the mooring line and hence these forces induce the mooring line tension both horizontal and vertical components of tension are also different between the two models since the mooring line motion is different as noted in fig 12 case i i the trajectories of the floating structure for both models which can be discerned in fig 13 case i i are slightly different due to the difference of the mooring line tension based on the figure the floating structure with the three dimensional lumped mass model is a little bit more pulled by the mooring line since the mooring line tension of the three dimensional model is greater than that with the two dimensional model it can be confirmed by the trajectory of a bellmouth position with the three dimensional model which is somewhat close to the anchor position comparing with that with the two dimensional model more detail the three dimensional motion of the floating structure and the mooring line are portrayed in fig 14 case i i meanwhile a tendency similar to the results for case i i appears for case i i i in which the various directions of the environmental loads are considered they are presented in figs 12 and 13 for case i i i and can be verified in detail in fig 14 case i i i according to the figures the floating structure with the three dimensional model in this case is also slightly more pulled by the mooring line than that with two dimensional model the mooring line tension generated by three dimensional model is greater than that for two dimensional model the mooring line tension increases due to the effect of lateral force components induced by the environmental loads coming from various directions based on these three comparison results even the trajectory of the floating structure with two and three dimensional models are similar some peculiarities occur in the implementation of a two dimensional model especially for the mooring line tension these peculiarities increase when considering the complicated directions of environmental loads this situation can affect the accuracy of the prediction of structural reliability for the mooring line and hence the safety of the floating structure therefore the results of dynamic performance of a mooring line based on a two dimensional model may inflict the lack of calculation accuracy and thereby the three dimensional treatment of mooring line is necessary 6 numerical simulation of coupled dynamic model of three dimensional lumped mass to ship type floating offshore structure 6 1 simulation conditions in order to verify the capability of the proposed three dimensional dynamics model of a multi component mooring line analyses of coupled motions of multi component mooring lines and a ship type floating offshore structure are conducted in these analyses the floating structure is moored by single point multi leg mooring system whereby the mooring lines are collected to three groups each group contains three multi component mooring lines and they are deployed by 10 each other meanwhile the groups of the mooring lines are spread off by 120 the schematic view of the multi component mooring lines coupled to the ship type floating offshore structure is shown in fig 15 moreover similar with two previous calculations the sensitivity analysis of the number of mooring line nodes is also conducted at first to ensure the accuracy the moored floating structure is assumed to be subjected to realistic environmental loads representing operations at sea then the newest gas field discovered in indonesia known as masela field is adopted as an operation field used in the analyses the principle dimensions of the ship type floating offshore structure are assumed referring those of a vlcc esso osaka which has equivalent capacity complying with the required dimensions at the offshore field the locations of the masela field and the principle dimensions of the floating structure is presented in fig 16 and table 2 additionally the properties of a multi component mooring line are defined based on conventional mooring line properties used in indonesian sea the combination of r3 studless chains having different material properties and length are used in order to attain the sufficient tension and cost efficiency of the mooring line in the combination the strongest segment with enough length is placed at the bottom of the mooring line to increase holding power the middle segment has the weakest properties but is the longest segment to accommodate the flexible motions of the mooring line the uppermost segment is composed by material having sufficient properties and enough length to restrain tension acting on the connection point of the floating structure without giving excessive weight the properties of these segments are presented in table 3 a set of metocean data at the masela field is applied to calculate environmental loads acting on the ship type floating offshore structure and its mooring lines the metocean data including wave height wind speed and their directions are taken from the global database presented in the ftp site of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa water depth is taken from noaa national center for environmental information while current velocity is defined from dnv os e301 rules det norske veritas 2013 due to the limitation of available data these metocean data are further processed to provide long term environmental data required by the rules regulations in this study dnv os e301 rule is adopted and wave and wind data for100 years return period and current data for 10 years return period are generated according to the rule as presented in table 4 moreover appropriate simulation cases must be considered to verify the proposed mooring line model in present analyses simulation cases for collinear wave wind and current come from same direction and non collinear wave wind and current come from different directions conditions given by the dnv os e301 rule are applied the collinear condition is considered as case 1 while the non collinear condition is case 2 the entire variation of cases applied in the analyses are presented in table 5 the entire numerical simulations are conducted for regular wave condition while the duration of simulation and time increment are same with the two previous simulations 6 2 simulation results in this simulation case variations for collinear case 1 and non collinear case 2 conditions are taken according to dnv os e301 rule all external disturbances for the collinear condition come from 15 relative to the bow while wave wind and current come from 0 30 and 45 respectively for the non collinear condition the trajectory of the ship type floating offshore structure and horizontal forces acting on the floating structure both in the collinear and non collinear conditions are presented in fig 17 according to the figure it can be found that the mooring lines can move simultaneously interrelating each other following the external disturbances the final heading of the floating structure in both collinear and non collinear conditions correspond to the directions of the external disturbances moreover it can be understood from vessel shapes drawn every 500 s on the trajectories that the vessel experiences larger lateral motion in the non collinear condition comparing with the collinear condition the lateral motion is caused by the increase of lateral force and yawing moment due to the spread of the directions of external disturbances the 6 dof motions of the ship type floating offshore structure are presented in fig 18 based on the figure motion in x 0 direction in the collinear condition is slightly greater than that in the non collinear condition while motion in y 0 direction and yaw motion in the non collinear condition are much greater than those in the collinear condition external disturbances applied for the collinear condition have the same direction which is close to the heading of the floating structure they tend to force the floating structure to move toward longitudinal direction then motion in x 0 direction is relatively greater than the rest of motions in horizontal plane on the other hand greater lateral motions motion in y 0 direction and yaw can be observed in the non collinear condition and heave motion is slightly greater than that in the collinear condition it means that the effect of the environmental loads in lateral direction increases the heave motions in additions while pitch motion for both conditions show the identical results the roll motion for the non collinear condition is considerably greater than that for the collinear condition due to the increase of lateral force it also enlarges the roll motion for the non collinear condition whilst longitudinal force which is dominant in the collinear condition leads minuscule roll motion furthermore dynamic coupling between mooring line tension and the motion of the floating structure can be observed in fig 19 the tendency of the tension of each mooring line for both collinear and non collinear conditions is completely different it strongly relates to the motions of the floating structure and the position of a bellmouth on the vessel during the simulation according to the figure the following description may be able to figure the relations between the motions of the floating structure and the tension of its mooring line since the floating structure moves away from the anchor point of the line 3 in both collinear and non collinear conditions the maximum tension occur in the line 3 even so the floating structure moves backward which is almost negative direction of the x 0 axis in the collinear condition this movement is almost vertical to line group gl ii and hence the mean tension of lines in gl ii line 4 6 is almost constant on the other hand in the non collinear condition the floating structure tends to move away from gl ii thus the tension of mooring lines 4 6 increases these conditions can be also confirmed by the tension of the line 1 which is greater than that for the non collinear condition in addition as the result that the floating structure moves toward the gl iii for both collinear and non collinear conditions three lines associated with gl iii lines 7 9 experience slack condition it means that the tension of these three mooring lines decrease during the simulation as pictured in fig 19 finally it can be said that the proposed dynamics model for a multi component mooring line can simulate mooring line tension well in coupling with the motion of a ship type floating offshore structure under the rule requirement conditions the detail of the motion of the mooring line and floating structure in three dimensional view are presented in fig 20 7 concluding remarks three dimensional multi component mooring line dynamics model has been developed in present study based on three dimensional lumped mass method the model takes the complexity which may inherent to a multi component mooring line including segments having different properties sea bottom interaction elasticity and anchoring problem into consideration the model is then coupled with a ship type floating offshore structure and firstly verified against the motion of a single component mooring line simulated by validated numerical method the verification is carried out by comparing the simulated motion of a multi component mooring line consists of identical segment with the motion of an equivalent single component mooring line good agreements are gained between the results of both mooring lines in the coupled analysis under wave wind and current the developed model is then compared with two dimensional dynamics model to investigate the effect of three dimensional motions in calculating mooring line dynamics the comparison results note that the similar results are gained when the external disturbances dominantly come from the longitudinal direction of the mooring line however the mooring line tension significantly increases when the external forces coming from the lateral direction of mooring line increase moreover the comparison results also conclude that the dynamic performance of mooring line need to be conducted in three dimensional manner since the implementation of two dimensional model may give the deficiency of pertinence especially in complicated external loads condition at the end of the works the proposed model is applied for the analysis of a moored ship type floating offshore structure subjected to actual environmental conditions representing realistic operations the analyses are conducted based on a rule under collinear and non collinear of external disturbances according to the analyses external disturbances in the collinear condition force the floating structure to move in longitudinal direction rather than lateral direction whilst those in the non collinear conditions increase lateral force and yawing moment as well as associated motions due to the various directions of external disturbances in the non collinear condition motion in y 0 direction roll heave and yaw motions are relatively greater than those in the collinear condition while a slight diversity is observed on motion in x 0 direction and pitch motion moreover the results generally show that the proposed dynamics model is considered to be an adequate model for representing dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line since the coupling of the model with the floating structure provides appropriate relations between them as well as against the environmental conditions therefore confirming the results the proposed coupled dynamics model of a multi component mooring line is capable to be applied for the analyses of the motion of a floating structure to investigate the coupled dynamic motions and mooring line tension even for dealing with realistic environmental conditions it also can provide the motion of a multi component mooring line in three dimensional manner comparing with the method used in the existing commercial software two main enhancements were made in this proposed coupled model i e the method for calculating three dimensional dynamic motions of multi component mooring lines and the coupled motion equations for reproducing the motions of a floating structure for multi component mooring line calculation method the treatment of the joint node between two different segment lines was improved focusing on the presence of attached component this manner is proven for handling the cluster mass effects due to the presence of attached component at the joint which may affect to the dynamic behavior of the entire mooring line the calculation procedure to generate mooring lines motions is also improved from the direct calculation of entire mooring line adopted in the commercial software to the individual calculation of segment line by segment line in this proposed method whilst the manoeuvring equations are used to improve the coupled motion equations of a floating structure by coupling the motion equations of the floating structure generated from the combination of manoeuvring and vertical motions of the floating body with the proposed mooring line dynamics model coupled motions between the floating structure and its multi component mooring lines can be reproduced properly more further since only regular waves are taken into account in this paper the consideration of irregular waves should be involved in the future study on the other hand because a number of commercial software models have included the advanced features of the mooring line model such as non zero bending and torsional stiffness the effect of wave forces on the mooring line and the effect of vertical component of mooring line tension in the coupled motion equations consideration of those features is necessary in the future improvement of the proposed coupled model for the sake of the achievement of more accurate results moreover in order to examine the proposed mooring line model comparing with that used in the existing commercial software in detail the investigation of the differences between the two line models and the comparison of calculation results between both methods are needed to be conducted in near future furthermore further study is expected to be performed to validate the present model using commercial software for mooring line analysis or experimental work in the coupled motion analysis the model will also be applied for solving other problems related to mooring line to study the ability of the model against the existing mooring line problems more detailed consideration will be included to improve the accuracy of the model author contribution statement yuda apri hermawan conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation

22037,a coupled dynamics model of multi component mooring line is proposed to analyze the motion of a floating offshore structure the model is developed by extending three dimensional lumped mass method allowing the motion of segment connection points and including an anchor and clump weights it offers analysis on simultaneous interlocking segment line motions to solve three dimensional dynamic responses of a multi component mooring line the model integrates hydrodynamic loads line seabed interaction elasticity current effect and dragging anchor motions it is then coupled with a ship type floating offshore structure and validated by comparing with equivalent model based on a conventional numerical method comparison against two dimensional model is also established finally coupled motion analysis of the floating structure moored by multi leg with multi component mooring lines in realistic operations are conducted by considering actual environmental loads the impact of the presented dynamics model on the evaluation of the response of the floating structure and mooring line tension are investigated the results conclude that the model can successfully provide the realistic prediction of the motion of the floating structure farther this paper found out that three dimensional mooring line treatment needs to be considered since lateral mooring line motion has considerable impact on mooring line tension keywords multi component mooring line mooring line dynamics coupled analysis three dimensional dynamics model 1 introduction in recent decades deep water and severe sea conditions are substantial issue for oil and gas exploitation activities it is challenging to operate a floating offshore structure under complex environmental loads arisen in deep water and severe sea conditions the operations need to be paid attention conscientiously especially focusing on mooring because an adequate mooring line system is necessary to keep the floating structure surviving under the complex environmental conditions the mooring line system is becoming more intricate and needs to be designed in a complex manner ansari 1999 multi component mooring line system consisting of various segment lines clump weights and buoy is considered as the most apropos mooring line system applied for the deep water and severe sea conditions it has superiority comparing with single component mooring line system childers 1974 mooring line tension and the length of catenary line can be reduced by varying the composition of mooring line segments as well as attaching clump weights buoys the cost of a mooring line can also be decreased through the appropriate arrangement of the line segments recently multi component mooring line is widely used for deep water offshore structure ba 2011 vazquez hernandez et al 2011 qiao et al 2013 and xie et al 2015 and it is proven that the mooring line system can withstand external forces under severe sea conditions ha 2011 multi component mooring line is also used and expanded into a new mooring system which is called hybrid mooring line system ji et al 2011 yuan and incecik 2014 and xu et al 2018 to reduce vertical anchoring force in taut mooring the yaw motions of a ship type floating offshore structure with the mooring line system in deep water sanchez mondragon et al 2018 and the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform with the mooring line system ghafari and dardel 2018 were evaluated experimental works related to the mooring line system can be found in zhao et al 2013 lopez et al 2017 the applications of multi component mooring line for deep water conditions are expected to be escalated owing to the increase of operations in deep water conditions the inclusion of the dynamic effects of a mooring line into motion analysis is strongly essential for deep water mooring because these effects become significantly concomitant with the increase of water depth it must be considered in the prediction of mooring performance when investigating the responses of a floating offshore structure ansari 1991 the modeling of the dynamic behavior of a mooring line is challenging task for multi component mooring line it needs laborious efforts since the analysis of mooring line dynamics is literally arduous due to the nonlinearities of a mooring line motions lo 1982 plenty of dynamics models have been arisen for investigating mooring line dynamics these models can be categorized into a finite difference model huang 1994 a finite element fe model roussel 1976 a lumped mass model walton and polachek 1960 a nonlinear boundary value problem method chiou 1990 and a multi body dynamics model kreuzer and wilke 2003 finite difference fe and lumped mass models are popularly used to address the problems of mooring line dynamics the finite difference model based on lagrangian formulation for cable dynamics was presented by tjavaras 1996 it was applied for modeling the dynamics of risers katifeoglou and chatjigeorgiou 2012 and considering the presence of current chen et al 2018 moreover the fe model has been presented by garret 1982 and exerted with without taking bending and torsional stiffnesses into account bucham et al 2004 aamo and fossen 2000 the model was extended by various manners i e mixed fe model montano et al 2007 high order fe model escalante et al 2011 and discontinuous galerkin method palm et al 2013 it was also applied for multi component mooring line to investigate the feasibility of polyester mooring line tahar and kim 2008 however both models were commonly developed based on slender rod model it has versatility and can tackle various boundary conditions in discretization of a mooring line xiong 2016 but more complex mathematical model is required when considering mooring line chai and varyani 2006 on the other hand the fe model has pertinence feature in predicting mooring line dynamics however the computations become slower time consuming and costly hall and goupee 2015 comparing with the above models the lumped mass model is assessed as more efficient for calculating mooring line dynamics with good accuracy the discretization in the lumped mass model makes the model to resemble the fe model azcona et al 2017 and exhibits features which are identical to a straight line element fe model lee and tu 2018 lumped mass model can characterize the necessary features of mooring line dynamics and evade unnecessary features in the fe model which may increase computation time hall and goupee 2015 the discretization has intelligible simplicity and obvious physical meaning for every part of mathematical formulations providing the efficiency in numerical calculations xiong et al 2016 however the application of the lumped mass model for multi component mooring line is limited studies using the lumped mass model were firstly started by walton and polachek 1960 the study introduced the lumped mass model for a single component mooring line through two dimensional discretization the model was further extended by nakajima et al 1982 taking the elasticity of a mooring line into account nakajima et al 1983 expanded the model to three dimensional model and verified with experimental results the results were good though the model was only applied for a single component line the other studies related the lumped mass model can be observed in chai et al 2002b low and langley 2006 and xiong et al 2016 moreover the validations of the lumped mass model were carried out through model test data hall and goupee 2015 and fe based dynamic code azcona et al 2017 both validations indicate the satisfaction of the model in the prediction of dynamic mooring line in fact many studies concerning to dynamic mooring line models have been published however the studies focused on the modeling of dynamics of a multi component mooring line were merely few a model of a multi component mooring line was solely presented in static manner ansari 1980 while the inclusion of dynamic effect was firstly proposed in nakajima et al 1982 by two dimensional lumped mass model the dynamic manners of a multi component mooring line could be expressed well in both studies but calculated results were only provided for identical segment lines moreover an extended model presented in van den boom 1985 chai et al 2002b could figure the dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line with various segment types however the portion of a multi component line in the proposed algorithm was not explained clearly furthermore khan and ansari 1986 provided formulae and succeeded to demonstrate the dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line combining with the motion of a moored offshore vessel ansari 1991 unfortunately it was restricted for inextensible mooring line since the influence of line elasticity was not performed in addition to predict the performance of a mooring line incorporating with the motion of a floating offshore structure a quasi static masciola et al 2013 chai et al 2002a figueirodo and brojo 2017 and quasi dynamic bureau veritas 1998 2004 approaches are frequently used both approaches were developed based on the catenary solutions bauduin and naciri 2000 and thereby the dynamic effects of a mooring line are literally excluded johanning et al 2005 2007 and ha 2011 accordingly the quasi static approach is considered to be inadequate method to apply for deep water conditions mavrakros et al 1996 meanwhile the mooring line tension and the motion of a floating structure are calculated separately in the quasi dynamic approach for the sake of computation time and simplification of complex interaction between them this may lead to the depreciation of calculation accuracy coupled dynamics approach is assessed to be the most rigorous method to carry out the dynamic analysis of the motion of a floating offshore structure both dynamic effects of a mooring line and a floating structure are simultaneously obtained by using the approach the basic theoretical study of the approach was presented by ornberg et al 1998 while its application discussing mooring line dynamics can be found in heurtier et al 2001 garret 2005 low and langley 2006 2008 recently this approach was often used to address the hydrodynamic problems in offshore fields ji et al 2016 jacob et al 2012a 2012b zhao et al 2018 on the other hand there are numerous commercial software packages which provide the coupled dynamics model of mooring line including multi component mooring line problem as instance commercial software orcaflex orcina 2009 used lumped mass method to analyze mooring line system in the software multi component mooring line consisting of several segment lines is treated as a single non homogenous mooring line due to the various properties of the segment lines whilst in this paper the multi component mooring line is treated as segment line by segment line individually as the inherent part of the mooring line in this consideration the dynamic motions of the mooring line are generated by the dynamic motions of the segment lines moreover in this paper the connection point between the segment line is regarded as a massless node to be replaced by the properties of attached component anchor sinker buoy or clump weight while it is considered as a mass node generated from the half element of two connected segment lines which may have different properties more further the overview of various software packages is reviewed in detail by davidson and ringwood 2017 the type of mathematical model used in the software and the features of the software including publications are summarized rhinefrank et al 2010 recorded that the software packages often need to be improved with own numerical code the replenishment of own numerical code into the software is not easy to be conducted thereby the numerical model of coupled dynamics model of multi component mooring line is needed to be developed to accommodate the various specific nature of the coupling dynamic mooring line problems based on the aforementioned premises this study intends to develop a dynamics model of a three dimensional multi component mooring line coupled with the motion of a floating offshore structure the dynamics model is further used to study the necessities of three dimensional manner in calculating the motions of a mooring line the calculated results are compared with results based on two dimensional model to investigate the effect of three dimensional motions furthermore to ensure the ability of the developed model for realistic operation the coupled motions analysis of a ship type floating offshore structure under realistic environmental conditions is conducted the motions of the floating structure and the tension of its mooring line are investigated this study lays on several sections section 2 describes the developed dynamics model of a three dimensional multi component mooring line while the coupling of this model to a ship type floating offshore structure is explained in section 3 a combination of mathematical maneoeuvring model based on the manoeuvring modeling group mmg and conventional floating body motion equations is used to perform the simultaneous analysis of coupled motions between the structure and mooring lines the verification of the developed model is presented in section 4 by comparing with model results calculated by using published method the discussion of the three dimensional effect in calculating dynamics mooring line is presented in section 5 furthermore numerical simulations considering the developed model associated with realistic environmental loads are discussed in section 6 finally the study is summarized into the concluding remarks described in section 7 2 three dimensional multi component mooring line model 2 1 problem description of multi component mooring line a typical multi component mooring line is shown in fig 1 the multi component mooring line is composed of various mooring line components consisting of several identically variously segment lines clump weight and or buoy the clump weights and or buoys are occasionally attached at the connection point between the segments these components are used to increase anchor holding capacity and to decrease mooring line tension respectively the multi component mooring line is subjected to the current force which directly acts on the mooring line depending on its vertical position wave wind and other external forces are enforced as the coupled forces acting on the top point of the mooring line meanwhile bending and torsional stiffnesses of mooring line are neglected since both stiffnesses do not influence mooring line tension too much as reported by hall et al 2014 the dynamic behavior of each segment of a multi component mooring line generally depends on its properties water depth current force anchor holding power and external forces acting on the top point of the mooring line however since the segment lines are connected each other their dynamic behavior are also affected by the weight and tension of other components connected to the segment similarly the properties of an anchor a clump weight and a buoy which may be attached at the end of the segment also give significant effect to the segment line motions consequently these items affect the dynamic behavior of entire multi component mooring line moreover the diverse environmental loads which come from various directions drive the dynamic motions of a floating offshore structure to the six degree of freedom 6 dof these motions encourage the three dimensional motion of the top point of the mooring line and hence these induce the three dimensional dynamic motions of the mooring line the diverse environmental loads acting directly on the mooring line also encourage the mooring line to move three dimensionally therefore a dynamics model for a multi component mooring line must be constructed in three dimensional manners in addition the features of an anchor must be expressed well including its motions and holding forces to satisfy the possibility of semi taut mooring line conditions 2 2 technical groundwork of three dimensional multi component mooring line lumped mass model a dynamics model for a multi component mooring line is constructed by applying a single component mooring line dynamics model nakajima et al 1983 to each segment line of a multi component mooring line this single component mooring line model discretizes a mooring line equally dividing it into several massless spring elements based on three dimensional lumped mass model the elements are linked by a mass point which is regarded as a node it is assumed that the weight of each element and external forces acting on each element are lumped to the node meanwhile the motions of uppermost and lowermost nodes are assumed to be given by arbitrary prescribed motion and to stay at a fixed point as a fixed anchor on the sea bed respectively this three dimensional lumped mass model for a single component mooring line is illustrated in fig 2 the three dimensional lumped mass model presented for a single component mooring line is further adopted and modified to model a multi component mooring line every segment of a multi component mooring line is considered as a single component line based on nakajima s lumped mass model and then interconnected each other to build a lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line each segment line is divided into n elements which means the segment consists of n 1 nodes while the external forces acting on the elements are congregated at these nodes on the other hand both ends of the segment line need to be regarded as meaningless nodes which provide vacant nodes for attaching to an anchor a sinker or a buoy the treatment of both ends of a segment line in this approach is slightly different from common lumped mass method such as a lumped mass method adopted in commercial software orcaflex in the lumped mass method the both end nodes of a segment line are considered to have mass which is equal to the total masses of both half elements existing at the either side of the node orcina 2009 whereas those nodes are massless in this method the mass of the both end elements for each segment line is distributed to node which is most adjacent to the end nodes node j i j n to compensate the presence of attached component at the end nodes this massless node will be replaced by mass node depending on the condition of the connection point associated with the massless node meanwhile in the common lumped mass method the node is generated from two different segment lines generally speaking in the common lumped mass method this node represents two different segment lines which may have different properties on the other hand in the orcaflex time domain motion of the mooring line is calculated directly for entire mooring line while it is calculated through segment line by segment line in this proposed lumped mass method since the nodes for both ends of the segment are vacant thereby the number of non vacant nodes which is equal to n 1 is less than the number of element n a boundary condition for the ends of the segment is necessary to accommodate the redundant element thus the mass of the element and inherent forces acting on the redundant element are equally distributed to the both adjacent nodes hence the mass of the first lifted node and the previous node of top node denoted with δ i and δ n respectively are 1 5 times greater than other nodes whilst the nodes of both ends segments j i 1 j n 1 are considered as massless nodes δ j 0 furthermore connection points joints between adjacent segments are generated by bonding the top node of lower side segment with the bottom node of upper side segment it means that the top node j n 1 of i th segment j i n 1 coincides to the bottom node j 1 of i 1 th segment j i 1 1 in other words both nodes can be regarded as identical node which can be merged into a joint node j i n 1 j i 1 1 since the joint node is generated by bonding two massless nodes it also becomes a massless node accordingly some additional constraints and improvements are established especially for the joint node for replacing the massless node to comply with the conditions for the exact geometry and inherent features of a multi component mooring line in static condition the features of the joint node are modified to meet the basic physical meaning of a multi component mooring line geometry as reported in ansari 1980 it will be discussed later the lumped mass algorithms pertaining to the joint node are also improved when performing the dynamic motion analysis of a mooring line the joint node must move freely and it can t be assumed as the prescribed motion or to stay at a fixed point likely in the single component mooring line model in other words it can be said that the motion of the joint node is similar with the motion of common lumped mass nodes in order to express the dynamic motions of the joint node the lumped mass algorithms used in common nodes are adopted and applied to the joint node however since the lumped mass algorithm in nakajima s single component line model excludes the dynamic motions of both end nodes some modifications are established considering the dynamic effects from adjacent segment moreover an appropriate anchor formulations are adopted to express the motion of bottom end node of a mooring line anchor point whilst the motion of the top point of a mooring line is generated by 6 dof motions of floating offshore structure the dynamic lumped mass model for a three dimensional multi component mooring line can be constructed through these considerations 2 3 local coordinate systems of mooring line as illustrated in fig 3 a multi component mooring line can be expressed by the three dimensional lumped mass model a x y z is a line coordinate system with the origin of z axis on the seabed the schematic diagram of the three dimensional lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line including their features is specifically displayed in the figure as shown in the figure a multi component mooring line lumped mass model is considered as a continuum of several three dimensional lumped mass models for segment lines interconnecting each other and incorporated with an anchor and clump weight buoy in the model the top point of a uppermost segment line which means the top point of a mooring line denoted by p is the attached point of the mooring line on a floating offshore structure bellmouth node a is the bottom end of a lowermost segment regarded as an anchor point joints between the segments can be considered as joints with without clump weight buoy the three dimensional lumped mass model for a multi component mooring line is referred to the line coordinate system a x y z the entire nodes can freely move in three dimensional directions and they provide three dimensional mooring line motions whilst the rotational motions of a line are disregarded since the effects of these motions on the dynamic behavior of a mooring line are not so considerable 2 4 multi component mooring line features the geometry of a multi component mooring line model is detailed in fig 4 here a multi component mooring line is composed by m segments and i th segment is discretized into n i elements while the mass of the segment is spread out into n i 1 nodes an anchor point a touchdown point and the first lifted node are expressed by a i 1 and i respectively j i and p denote i th joint node and the top point of the mooring line in additions w i j is the weight of j th node in i th segment whilst segment length is denoted as l i by adopting the fundamental of nakajima s lumped mass model and integrating anchor feature at the anchor point node node weights for a multi component mooring line model can be described as follows 1 w a w 11 w a w i w r i 1 5 w l r w n i w i n 1 5 w l i i r w r j 1 0 w l r i j n w r j 0 0 j i w i j 1 0 w l i 1 j n i r w i j 0 0 i r where r indicates the first lifted segment line number in the meantime the weight of the joint between segments is defined by characterizing the features of the multi component line according to the basic insight of multi component catenary method reported by ansari 1980 since this weight is pondered as the total weight of suspended part beneath the joint including lifted clump weight buoy the weight of the joint can be written as 2 w j i k 1 i w s k k 2 i w c k w a k 1 i w s k k 2 i w c k k 1 i w s k w a a c t a n d w a 0 w a i n a c t w a i n a c t w c i n a c t o r w c 0 in which the component weights of the joint weights are given by 3 w s k i 1 k j 2 n w i j w c k w c i w c k 0 w c a c t w c i n a c t in eq 2 and eq 3 subscripts a c t and i n a c t represent the lifting condition active or inactive of joint node and anchor the joint node is active when it is upraised from the seabed and vice versa active anchor occurs when there are no nodes lying on the seabed and hence the tension line pulls the anchor meanwhile the weights of mooring line components are given as follows 4 w a w c a w l i w c l i l i w c w c c i where w c a w c l i and w c c i are the weight of an anchor the weight of line segment per unit length and the weight of clump weight buoy in water respectively while l i indicates element length of the segment l i n i according to eq 4 it can be said that the mass of the joint node which attaches to clump weight buoy can be expressed by the mass of clump weight buoy while the mass of anchor point is represented by the mass of anchor furthermore due to the considerations used to express the conditions of a joint node as aforedescribed the joint node will become massless and weightless when the joint node is inactive called as inactive empty joint node j i e accordingly an adjustment for the nodes close to the joint must be carried out because the massless weightless condition of joint node makes lumped mass solutions cannot to be solved the adjustment is carried out by distributing the mass of nodes which are adjacent to the inactive empty joint node j i e into the mass of inactive empty joint node δ j i e the mass of the nodes around the inactive empty joint node further become 5 δ j i e δ i e 1 n 1 δ i e 1 n δ i e 1 δ i e 2 1 0 m l i e 1 0 5 m l i e 1 m l i e 1 0 m l i e where i e represents the number of inactive empty joint node by this manner the adequate solutions for lumped mass matrix algorithm for a multi component mooring line can be attained 2 5 static analysis of multi component mooring line 2 5 1 determining initial line configuration the initial configuration of a mooring line is necessary to define the circumstance of each segment line at the initial condition it encompasses the initial horizontal and vertical projected lengths as well as suspended length for each segment line the initial circumstance of a segment line is required to define the initial state of the segment fully laying on seabed partially suspended or fully suspended segment this initial state of a segment line is then used to introduce the initial status of a joint node active inactive and thereby describes a constraint condition applied for the ends of the segment this constraint is required when calculating the initial shape of a multi component mooring line by the present lumped mass model the weight mass of a joint node generated by its lower suspended segment must be known to obtain the initial shape of an upper segment since the physical understanding of static condition for a multi component mooring line in lumped mass model is identical with the catenary method static multi component catenary line equations are used to express the initial line configuration the typical types of line configurations and their equations proposed by ansari 1980 which was resumed by ba 2011 are used as follows 6 x i a i sinh 1 s i a i tan θ i sinh 1 tan θ i h i a i cosh x i a i sinh 1 tan θ i cosh sinh 1 tan θ i s i a i sinh x i a i sinh 1 tan θ i tan θ i here x i and h i are the projected length of the i th segment in horizontal and vertical directions respectively and s i is the suspended length of the i th segment a i is equal to t h 0 w c l i θ i is an angle formed by horizontal plane and the line segment at i th joint node while t h 0 indicates the initial tension of the mooring line through the iteration process following the procedure in catenary method the preliminary initial line configuration can be obtained and then used as the reference for static multi component lumped mass calculation 2 5 2 initial shape of multi component mooring line the initial condition of a multi component mooring line is obtained through the static analysis of each segment the method proposed by nakajima 1983 is adopted to introduce the initial condition of each segment since the method is literally described for a single component line type it is applied to each segment considering multifarious treatments depending on the initial states of the segment these multifarious treatments exist due to the various constraints coming from the various initial states of the segment to overcome those various constraints the initial states of segment are classified into three types i e fully laying on the seabed partially suspended and fully suspended the initial shape of each segment for lumped mass model is then obtained by regarding the initial state of the segment as one of these three types and calculating the initial shape by using the constraint of the regarded type further the calculation summary for each type of initial shape can be described as follows the calculation of initial shape for a segment which is fully laying on the seabed or partially suspended is started by determining a touchdown point node j i 1 since the touchdown point node may exist in these two types the touchdown point node can be determined by iterating calculation using the following formula 7 w i 1 z p i l i j 1 n i t i j 1 a i e i 1 k 2 j w i k j 1 n i t i j 1 n i a i e i where z p i l i a i and e i are the vertical position of a top segment measured form its bottom end original length sectional area and young s modulus of the i th segment respectively t i j is calculated as follows 8 t i j t i 1 2 w i 1 2 k 1 j w i k 2 the iterative calculation is repeated until the weight of the touchdown point node w i i 1 i 2 becomes greater than 0 in the iteration w i 1 is treated as 0 if the calculated value of w i 1 is less than 0 furthermore the initial segment shape can be calculated by the following equations 9 x i j 1 i 1 k l i k cos γ i k cos χ i y i j 1 i 1 k l i k cos γ i k sin χ i z i j 1 i 1 k l i k sin γ i k where x i j y i j z i j γ i k and χ i can be observed in fig 3 meanwhile due to the absence of a node attached on the seabed a fully suspended segment is introduced by calculating the initial shape of a segment based on eq 9 and omitting the calculation for the touchdown point node in addition weight correction for nodes close to the seabed given by nakajima et al 1983 is also applied 2 6 segment line consideration for dynamic motions of multi component mooring line a lumped mass node matrix is adopted to introduce the flexibilities of both end nodes of a segment line the flexibilities are aroused by extending the treatment of a segment to satisfy proper boundary condition at the nodes thus additional nodes taken from upper or lower segment is appended to the considered segment to reproduce free motions of the end nodes in this improvement each segment is classified into three conditions as shown in fig 5 in this figure a segment is regarded as the lowest segment i 1 middle segment 1 i m or the top segment i m of a mooring line due to this improvement the nodes which are regarded as the flexible node in lumped mass method are modified according to the types of segment i e j 2 n for i 1 j 1 n 1 for 1 i m and j 1 n for i m moreover the coordinate system of mass point used for the equation of mooring line motion is depicted in fig 6 2 7 forces acting on the mooring line 2 7 1 hydrodynamic forces

as shown in fig 3 are denoted as v x i j v y i j and v z i j if the current direction referred to the x axis of local mooring line coordinate system is denoted as α c l surface current velocity is v c and the current velocity acting on the node is v c i j the current velocity in local mooring line coordinate system can be easily written as 14 v x i j v c i j cos α c l v y i j v c i j sin α c l v z i j 0 in which the magnification of v c i j can be defined through the following formulation depending on the ratio of the vertical position of a node from the water surface against water depth d w 15

introduced it is defined through considering incident wave in term of its direction and amplitude when the direction of the incident wave relative to the floating structure is denoted as μ i e following sea is represented as μ 0 as shown in fig 7 and the amplitude of the wave is assumed as ζ a velocity potential φ 0 representing incident wave in infinite water depth can be expressed by the following equation 27 φ 0 r e g ζ a i ω 0 φ 0 x e i ω 0 t where 28 φ 0 x e k 0 z i k 0 x cos μ y sin μ here g ω 0 and k 0 represent the gravitational acceleration circular frequency of the incident

3 2 π φ 0 p m j d where d m n and s m n are matrix coefficients for each segment over the body obtained by analytical integration over the segment the numerical solution described above has accommodated an approach for eliminating irregular frequencies that often appear in calculating the velocity potential by using boundary integral equation modified haraguchi ohmatsu s method is used to get rid of those irregular frequencies haraguchi and ohmatsu 1983 3 2 3 wave radiation forces the radiation force acting on the floating body can be obtained by integrating hydrodynamic pressure p

e 2 j 2 4 x j l d x s h φ j n i d s j 2 4 f i j in which ρ is water density s h and l represent the shape of a hull section and ship length respectively since an imaginary part exists in the green function related to progressive wave on the water surface the radiation potential φ j is typically given as a complex number thus assuming that φ j φ j s i φ j c the radiation force f i j that works in the i direction due to the j mode oscillation is derived 41 f i j i ω e 2 x j ρ l d x s h φ j s n i d s i ω e x j ρ l d x s h φ j c n i d s according to eq 41 it can be noted that i ω 2 x j and i ω

the force component f i j can be written as the transfer function t i j respected to the motion x j f i j t i j x j by substituting eq 41 to eq 40 the following equations are established 43 f i j j 1

derivatives denoted as y β y h β y r y h r and so on these hydrodynamic derivatives were obtained by captive model tests furthermore since the lateral motion of the floating structure in low speed motion becomes relatively larger comparing with running ship a mathematical model presented by muto et al 2010 to consider the effect of large drift angle are adopted to calculate y h and n h for large drift angle β 30 53 y h r α a y α r 2 b y α r c y α n h r α a n α r 2 b n α r c n α meanwhile when current velocity is taken into account the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by considering the relative speed of the floating structure due to the presence of the current the effect of current velocity is included and calculated directly on the coupled motion equation which is described in further 3 5 wind forces in the present study approximate formulae for wind forces proposed by fujiwara et al 1998 are used 54 x w 1 2 ρ a a t u w 2 c x ν y w 1 2 ρ a a l u w 2 c y ν n w 1 2 ρ a a l l

given by the combinations of equations for manoeuvring motions in horizontal plane and equations for the vertical motions of a floating body since the coupled motion model can be assumed to be applicable for large ship shaped floating offshore structure fpso vlcc etc wave force on the upper end of the mooring lines can be neglected accordingly only horizontal component of the tension of the mooring line is taken into account in the floating structure motion equations furthermore by substituting all the loads described in this section for those in the coupled motions equations the following equations are established 56 m m x u m m y v r m x m y v c r sin ψ α x h x w x t m m y v m m x u r m y m x v c r cos ψ α y h y w y t y d i z z i z z r n h n w n t n d 57 m a 33 g z t b 33 g

here m m x and m y are vessel mass and its added mass component in x and y directions while i x x i y y and i z z are moments of inertia and i z z is added moment of inertia refer to z axis the speed of the floating structure in x and y directions are denoted as u and v whilst r is yaw rate c is the restoring force coefficient of the floating structure while superscript g indicates that the component forces act on the center of gravity g furthermore by solving these equations simultaneously in time domain as well as calculating dynamic mooring line motions the dynamic motions of the ship type offshore platform and multi component mooring line motions can be reproduced in this paper time domain calculation is solved by using runge kutta gill method with constant time step an appropriate time step is selected to get proper convergence results with an efficient time step for both coupled model and dynamic mooring line model 4 verification of three dimensional multi component mooring line dynamics model 4 1 conditions of verifications because the research conducting three dimensional manner of a multi component mooring line is limited the proposed multi component mooring line model is verified against to three dimensional single component mooring line model which has been validated by experiments nakajima et al 1983 in order to represent identical single component mooring line models in both models a multi component mooring line composed of three segments having identical properties is used in the developed model the properties and main particulars of mooring lines used in both models are completely same the properties of anchor related to both mooring lines are also equal the properties of both mooring lines are given in table 1 the sensitivity analysis of the number of mooring line nodes is conducted previously to get precise results both single and multi component mooring lines are then coupled with a ship type floating structure subjected to wave wind and current loads to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi component mooring line model in this coupled model the floating structure is considered to be moored by single point mooring line system at the sea having 500 m depth a mooring line is connected to the vessel at bow and deployed toward the bow direction the mooring line angle ξ 1 is 0 while an anchor is attached on the bottom end of the mooring line furthermore in order to consider the effect of the directions of external disturbances two cases are investigated in this verifications works in the first case noted as case a all external disturbances come from the same directions on the other hand the direction of wind is different from those of wave and current in the second case case b wave height wind speed and current velocity are assumed to be 2 m 10 m s and 1 knot respectively both cases are calculated under regular wave condition during about 15800 s with time step 0 01 s 4 2 verification in coupling with a vessel a ship type floating offshore structure which has principal dimensions shown in table 2 is used to be coupled with a single and multi component mooring lines described above both coupled models are then examined and compared each other in terms of mooring line tension the motions and the trajectory of the floating structure for the two environmental loads cases in the case a wave wind and current come from the same direction which is in 30 relative to the bow while the directions of wave wind and current in the case b are assumed to be 30 0 and 30 respectively the trajectories of the floating structure with single or multi component mooring line for both cases are depicted in fig 8 according to the figure since all external disturbances dominantly come from 30 for the case a the heading angle of the ship type floating offshore structure changes toward the direction of the disturbances on the other hand the ship type floating offshore structure moves farther away in lateral direction comparing with the case a due to the increase of lateral force and yawing moment by the external disturbances the figure also shows that the trajectories and mooring line motions for single and multi component mooring lines are quite similar this similarity is portrayed in detail in fig 9 showing the three dimensional motions of the mooring lines it is observed that the proposed multi component mooring line model can reproduce the motion of single component mooring line calculated by using the three dimensional single component mooring line model proposed by nakajima et al 1983 mooring line tension and 6 dof vessel motions with single or multi component mooring line in the two cases are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 according to these figures line tension and vessel motions for both mooring line models indicate good agreement though there is slight discrepancy at the beginning of the simulation it is considered that the discrepancy caused by the transient environmental loads acting on the floating structure which cause instability in the calculation of transient tension at the beginning of the simulation then this discrepancy can be neglected even further this discrepancy does not affect too much to the trajectories and the motions of the vessel as shown in fig 11 in the figure although the motions are not exactly same the tendency and magnitude of the motions calculated by the two mooring line models have good congruence this congruence is even denoted for all motion modes in the both cases accordingly the developed multi component mooring line dynamics model can be considered as the adequate model to investigate the influence of multi component mooring line on coupling motion of a floating offshore structure 5 comparison against two dimensional model 5 1 conditions of the comparison to investigate the effect of three dimensional manner of a mooring line in the analysis of mooring line dynamics the developed three dimensional dynamics model is compared with two dimensional mooring line model both two and three dimensional models are implemented to simulate the motion of a mooring line with a ship type floating structure used in section 4 the mooring line is regarded as a multi component mooring line consisting of various segment line properties while the mooring line configuration and water depth are same with those used in section 4 the properties of each line segment are presented in table 2 in addition the sensitivity analysis of the number of element of mooring line is carried out in advance to achieve the better accuracy of mooring line motion two dimensional dynamics model used for the comparison is literally similar with the developed three dimensional model however the lateral motion of a mooring line y axis direction is neglected it means that all force components coming from the lateral direction of the mooring line and their effects are omitted to only reflect the two dimensional manner of a mooring line generally speaking only longitudinal and vertical forces are affected to the mooring line tension in this comparison work three different cases are investigated to observe the effect of three dimensional manner under the various directions of the environmental loads the first case denoted as case i is conducted with 5 of wave wind and current directions to represent the environmental loads coming from the direction close to the longitudinal direction of the mooring line as well as the heading of the floating structure 30 of all external disturbances is applied for considering the effect of lateral environmental loads and it is presented in case i i finally the directions of wave wind and current are assumed as 0 15 and 30 respectively for case i i i to verify the effect of three dimensional model under the various combinations of the external loads wave height wind speed and current velocity are assumed to be 4 m 20 m s and 2 knot respectively this comparison is performed by considering regular wave condition with simulation time duration and time step which are same with those used in section 4 5 2 comparison results the comparison results of two and three dimensional models are presented in fig 12 to fig 14 the results of mooring line tension for both models can be observed in fig 12 according to the figure the tension of both models for case i is not too much different forces acting on the three dimensional mooring line model are dominantly generated by longitudinal forces since all external forces come from the longitudinal direction of the mooring line consequently forces coming from the lateral direction of mooring line are measly and not affected to the tension of the three dimensional mooring line model significantly this condition is alike with the condition of two dimensional calculation which does not take the lateral force into account therefore the trajectory of the floating structure and the mooring line motions for case i shown in fig 13 and fig 14 are almost similar however as the increasing of the lateral forces acting on the mooring line the mooring line tension increases as depicted in fig 12 for case i i the lateral forces enlarge the dynamic motions of the mooring line and hence these forces induce the mooring line tension both horizontal and vertical components of tension are also different between the two models since the mooring line motion is different as noted in fig 12 case i i the trajectories of the floating structure for both models which can be discerned in fig 13 case i i are slightly different due to the difference of the mooring line tension based on the figure the floating structure with the three dimensional lumped mass model is a little bit more pulled by the mooring line since the mooring line tension of the three dimensional model is greater than that with the two dimensional model it can be confirmed by the trajectory of a bellmouth position with the three dimensional model which is somewhat close to the anchor position comparing with that with the two dimensional model more detail the three dimensional motion of the floating structure and the mooring line are portrayed in fig 14 case i i meanwhile a tendency similar to the results for case i i appears for case i i i in which the various directions of the environmental loads are considered they are presented in figs 12 and 13 for case i i i and can be verified in detail in fig 14 case i i i according to the figures the floating structure with the three dimensional model in this case is also slightly more pulled by the mooring line than that with two dimensional model the mooring line tension generated by three dimensional model is greater than that for two dimensional model the mooring line tension increases due to the effect of lateral force components induced by the environmental loads coming from various directions based on these three comparison results even the trajectory of the floating structure with two and three dimensional models are similar some peculiarities occur in the implementation of a two dimensional model especially for the mooring line tension these peculiarities increase when considering the complicated directions of environmental loads this situation can affect the accuracy of the prediction of structural reliability for the mooring line and hence the safety of the floating structure therefore the results of dynamic performance of a mooring line based on a two dimensional model may inflict the lack of calculation accuracy and thereby the three dimensional treatment of mooring line is necessary 6 numerical simulation of coupled dynamic model of three dimensional lumped mass to ship type floating offshore structure 6 1 simulation conditions in order to verify the capability of the proposed three dimensional dynamics model of a multi component mooring line analyses of coupled motions of multi component mooring lines and a ship type floating offshore structure are conducted in these analyses the floating structure is moored by single point multi leg mooring system whereby the mooring lines are collected to three groups each group contains three multi component mooring lines and they are deployed by 10 each other meanwhile the groups of the mooring lines are spread off by 120 the schematic view of the multi component mooring lines coupled to the ship type floating offshore structure is shown in fig 15 moreover similar with two previous calculations the sensitivity analysis of the number of mooring line nodes is also conducted at first to ensure the accuracy the moored floating structure is assumed to be subjected to realistic environmental loads representing operations at sea then the newest gas field discovered in indonesia known as masela field is adopted as an operation field used in the analyses the principle dimensions of the ship type floating offshore structure are assumed referring those of a vlcc esso osaka which has equivalent capacity complying with the required dimensions at the offshore field the locations of the masela field and the principle dimensions of the floating structure is presented in fig 16 and table 2 additionally the properties of a multi component mooring line are defined based on conventional mooring line properties used in indonesian sea the combination of r3 studless chains having different material properties and length are used in order to attain the sufficient tension and cost efficiency of the mooring line in the combination the strongest segment with enough length is placed at the bottom of the mooring line to increase holding power the middle segment has the weakest properties but is the longest segment to accommodate the flexible motions of the mooring line the uppermost segment is composed by material having sufficient properties and enough length to restrain tension acting on the connection point of the floating structure without giving excessive weight the properties of these segments are presented in table 3 a set of metocean data at the masela field is applied to calculate environmental loads acting on the ship type floating offshore structure and its mooring lines the metocean data including wave height wind speed and their directions are taken from the global database presented in the ftp site of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa water depth is taken from noaa national center for environmental information while current velocity is defined from dnv os e301 rules det norske veritas 2013 due to the limitation of available data these metocean data are further processed to provide long term environmental data required by the rules regulations in this study dnv os e301 rule is adopted and wave and wind data for100 years return period and current data for 10 years return period are generated according to the rule as presented in table 4 moreover appropriate simulation cases must be considered to verify the proposed mooring line model in present analyses simulation cases for collinear wave wind and current come from same direction and non collinear wave wind and current come from different directions conditions given by the dnv os e301 rule are applied the collinear condition is considered as case 1 while the non collinear condition is case 2 the entire variation of cases applied in the analyses are presented in table 5 the entire numerical simulations are conducted for regular wave condition while the duration of simulation and time increment are same with the two previous simulations 6 2 simulation results in this simulation case variations for collinear case 1 and non collinear case 2 conditions are taken according to dnv os e301 rule all external disturbances for the collinear condition come from 15 relative to the bow while wave wind and current come from 0 30 and 45 respectively for the non collinear condition the trajectory of the ship type floating offshore structure and horizontal forces acting on the floating structure both in the collinear and non collinear conditions are presented in fig 17 according to the figure it can be found that the mooring lines can move simultaneously interrelating each other following the external disturbances the final heading of the floating structure in both collinear and non collinear conditions correspond to the directions of the external disturbances moreover it can be understood from vessel shapes drawn every 500 s on the trajectories that the vessel experiences larger lateral motion in the non collinear condition comparing with the collinear condition the lateral motion is caused by the increase of lateral force and yawing moment due to the spread of the directions of external disturbances the 6 dof motions of the ship type floating offshore structure are presented in fig 18 based on the figure motion in x 0 direction in the collinear condition is slightly greater than that in the non collinear condition while motion in y 0 direction and yaw motion in the non collinear condition are much greater than those in the collinear condition external disturbances applied for the collinear condition have the same direction which is close to the heading of the floating structure they tend to force the floating structure to move toward longitudinal direction then motion in x 0 direction is relatively greater than the rest of motions in horizontal plane on the other hand greater lateral motions motion in y 0 direction and yaw can be observed in the non collinear condition and heave motion is slightly greater than that in the collinear condition it means that the effect of the environmental loads in lateral direction increases the heave motions in additions while pitch motion for both conditions show the identical results the roll motion for the non collinear condition is considerably greater than that for the collinear condition due to the increase of lateral force it also enlarges the roll motion for the non collinear condition whilst longitudinal force which is dominant in the collinear condition leads minuscule roll motion furthermore dynamic coupling between mooring line tension and the motion of the floating structure can be observed in fig 19 the tendency of the tension of each mooring line for both collinear and non collinear conditions is completely different it strongly relates to the motions of the floating structure and the position of a bellmouth on the vessel during the simulation according to the figure the following description may be able to figure the relations between the motions of the floating structure and the tension of its mooring line since the floating structure moves away from the anchor point of the line 3 in both collinear and non collinear conditions the maximum tension occur in the line 3 even so the floating structure moves backward which is almost negative direction of the x 0 axis in the collinear condition this movement is almost vertical to line group gl ii and hence the mean tension of lines in gl ii line 4 6 is almost constant on the other hand in the non collinear condition the floating structure tends to move away from gl ii thus the tension of mooring lines 4 6 increases these conditions can be also confirmed by the tension of the line 1 which is greater than that for the non collinear condition in addition as the result that the floating structure moves toward the gl iii for both collinear and non collinear conditions three lines associated with gl iii lines 7 9 experience slack condition it means that the tension of these three mooring lines decrease during the simulation as pictured in fig 19 finally it can be said that the proposed dynamics model for a multi component mooring line can simulate mooring line tension well in coupling with the motion of a ship type floating offshore structure under the rule requirement conditions the detail of the motion of the mooring line and floating structure in three dimensional view are presented in fig 20 7 concluding remarks three dimensional multi component mooring line dynamics model has been developed in present study based on three dimensional lumped mass method the model takes the complexity which may inherent to a multi component mooring line including segments having different properties sea bottom interaction elasticity and anchoring problem into consideration the model is then coupled with a ship type floating offshore structure and firstly verified against the motion of a single component mooring line simulated by validated numerical method the verification is carried out by comparing the simulated motion of a multi component mooring line consists of identical segment with the motion of an equivalent single component mooring line good agreements are gained between the results of both mooring lines in the coupled analysis under wave wind and current the developed model is then compared with two dimensional dynamics model to investigate the effect of three dimensional motions in calculating mooring line dynamics the comparison results note that the similar results are gained when the external disturbances dominantly come from the longitudinal direction of the mooring line however the mooring line tension significantly increases when the external forces coming from the lateral direction of mooring line increase moreover the comparison results also conclude that the dynamic performance of mooring line need to be conducted in three dimensional manner since the implementation of two dimensional model may give the deficiency of pertinence especially in complicated external loads condition at the end of the works the proposed model is applied for the analysis of a moored ship type floating offshore structure subjected to actual environmental conditions representing realistic operations the analyses are conducted based on a rule under collinear and non collinear of external disturbances according to the analyses external disturbances in the collinear condition force the floating structure to move in longitudinal direction rather than lateral direction whilst those in the non collinear conditions increase lateral force and yawing moment as well as associated motions due to the various directions of external disturbances in the non collinear condition motion in y 0 direction roll heave and yaw motions are relatively greater than those in the collinear condition while a slight diversity is observed on motion in x 0 direction and pitch motion moreover the results generally show that the proposed dynamics model is considered to be an adequate model for representing dynamic behavior of a multi component mooring line since the coupling of the model with the floating structure provides appropriate relations between them as well as against the environmental conditions therefore confirming the results the proposed coupled dynamics model of a multi component mooring line is capable to be applied for the analyses of the motion of a floating structure to investigate the coupled dynamic motions and mooring line tension even for dealing with realistic environmental conditions it also can provide the motion of a multi component mooring line in three dimensional manner comparing with the method used in the existing commercial software two main enhancements were made in this proposed coupled model i e the method for calculating three dimensional dynamic motions of multi component mooring lines and the coupled motion equations for reproducing the motions of a floating structure for multi component mooring line calculation method the treatment of the joint node between two different segment lines was improved focusing on the presence of attached component this manner is proven for handling the cluster mass effects due to the presence of attached component at the joint which may affect to the dynamic behavior of the entire mooring line the calculation procedure to generate mooring lines motions is also improved from the direct calculation of entire mooring line adopted in the commercial software to the individual calculation of segment line by segment line in this proposed method whilst the manoeuvring equations are used to improve the coupled motion equations of a floating structure by coupling the motion equations of the floating structure generated from the combination of manoeuvring and vertical motions of the floating body with the proposed mooring line dynamics model coupled motions between the floating structure and its multi component mooring lines can be reproduced properly more further since only regular waves are taken into account in this paper the consideration of irregular waves should be involved in the future study on the other hand because a number of commercial software models have included the advanced features of the mooring line model such as non zero bending and torsional stiffness the effect of wave forces on the mooring line and the effect of vertical component of mooring line tension in the coupled motion equations consideration of those features is necessary in the future improvement of the proposed coupled model for the sake of the achievement of more accurate results moreover in order to examine the proposed mooring line model comparing with that used in the existing commercial software in detail the investigation of the differences between the two line models and the comparison of calculation results between both methods are needed to be conducted in near future furthermore further study is expected to be performed to validate the present model using commercial software for mooring line analysis or experimental work in the coupled motion analysis the model will also be applied for solving other problems related to mooring line to study the ability of the model against the existing mooring line problems more detailed consideration will be included to improve the accuracy of the model author contribution statement yuda apri hermawan conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation

22038,the effects of asymmetric boundary conditions on the flow past rectangular cylinders are relevant for many engineering applications pertinently the influence of wall proximity on the flow around cylinders has been widely investigated and the flow regimes depending on the distance to the wall have been identified however a comprehensive study of the flow around rectangular cylinders near a free surface is lacking the classifications of the flow have not been tackled and the connection between the flow behaviors and the force variations with the depth has not been demonstrated in this study multiphase simulations over a broad range of depth to length ratios 0 3 4 5 and width to length ratios 0 7 5 0 were conducted flow results show that the anti symmetric vortex shedding becomes asymmetric and then suppressed as the depth decreases three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on the width to length ratio were observed asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the force variations with the depth for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 show different trends due to the occurrence of different asymmetric

past rectangular cylinders is one of classical problems in fluid mechanics extensive investigations on the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders have been conducted due to its practical importance in engineering applications and scientific significance in fluid mechanics mannini et al 2010 norberg 1993 okajima 1982 schewe 2013 recently research on the flow past rectangular cylinders has been extended to incorporate the effects of asymmetric boundary conditions i e in the vicinity of a free surface this type of flow is relevant for many civil and marine engineering applications for example bridge decks during river flood or tsunami events may become partially or fully submerged malavasi and guadagnini 2003 hydrokinetic turbines for river current applications operate near the water surface and their performance is affected by the surface liu et al 2016 two parameters of interests in this study are the width to length ratio w l where w and l are the width and length of the rectangular cylinder respectively and the depth to length ratio d l where d is the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the rectangular cylinder the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders is classified by the absence or presence of reattachment of the shear layers depending on w l as archived by a number of papers nakaguchi et al 1968 norberg 1993 sohankar 2008 the value 2 8 marks the flow change from separated to reattached with the change of the flow the strouhal number which reflects the vortex shedding frequency varies abruptly shimada and ishihara 2002 reported two discontinuities in the strouhal number at w l 2 8 and w l 6 0 through using a modified k ε model they provided a division of the flow around rectangular cylinders separated w l 2 8 intermittently reattached 2 8 w l 6 0 and fully reattached w l 6 0 besides okajima 1982 argued that for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 0 and 3 0 there was found to be a certain range of re where a discontinuity in the strouhal number occurs an explanation for this is the change of the flow from steadily reattached to occasionally reattached or separated as re increases in the range from 70 to 2 0 104 with the introduction of an asymmetric boundary condition the flow around rectangular cylinders and consequently the force are affected causing deviations from the infinite medium reference case relevant to the present study is the flow past cylinders near a wall bosch et al 1996 found based on experiments that when the gap to length ratio g l decreases from 1 5 to 0 75 the flow from a square cylinder becomes strongly affected by the wall which is characterized by the asymmetric shedding motion when g l is lower than a critical value the vortex shedding is suppressed bosch et al 1996 reported that the critical g l is in the range from 0 35 to 0 5 representing a transition rather than a sharp change martinuzzi et al 2003 studied the influence of wall proximity on the flow past a square cylinder re 2 2 104 and identified four flow regimes depending on g l a negligible influence from the wall g l 0 9 b increased wall influence 0 6 g l 0 9 c transition between regular vortex shedding and vortex suppression 0 3 g l 0 6 and d suppressed vortex shedding g l 0 3 similar flow phenomena arise for circular cylinders approaching a wall price et al 2002 classified four patterns of flow around a circular cylinder near a wall 1200 re 4960 a negligible influence on the vortex shedding and no separation of the wall boundary layer g l 1 0 b onset of the vortex shedding from the cylinder 0 5 g l 0 75 c pairing between the lower shear layer from the cylinder and the separated wall boundary layer 0 125 g l 0 5 and d suppressed vortex shedding g l 0 125 the difference between the limits of different flow regions reported by martinuzzi et al 2003 and price et al 2002 is mostly due to the different cross sections wang and tan 2008 demonstrated that the wake spreading and momentum exchange of square cylinders are lower than those of circular cylinders at the same g l due to a more straightened effect of the shear layers in the former case angrilli et al 1982 observed the asymmetric distribution of mean velocity across the wake when a circular cylinder locates near a wall lei et al 2000 conducted a study of the suppressed vortex shedding past circular cylinders over a broad range of g l for different re ranging from 80 to 1000 they found that at low g l due to the contact of the lower shear layer from the cylinder and the separated wall boundary layer the vorticity in the lower shear layer is cancelled by the opposite signed vorticity in the wall boundary layer thus the lower shear layer loses the strength to roll up and interact with the upper shear layer and the vortex shedding is suppressed rashidi et al 2016b summarized nine categories of methods for controlling the wake destructive behavior and suppressing the vortex shedding behind bluff objects including active methods e g introducing external objects in one of the shear layers imposing self oscillation on the objects and utilizing electric magnetic or thermal effects bovand et al 2016 rashidi et al 2015 2016a rashidi and esfahani 2015 and passive methods e g modifying surface roughness and approaching a plane boundary lei et al 2000 goktun 1975 found that on reducing g l the drag coefficient of circular cylinders first increases before rapidly decreases and the peak drag coefficient occurs at around g l 0 5 the lift coefficient on the other hand increases monotonically with g l goktun 1975 also observed an initial increase in the strouhal number as g l decreases to 0 5 and a drop at lower g l which reflects the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding directly related to the present study is the flow past a cylinder near a free surface sheridan et al 1997 studied the flow around a circular cylinder close to a free surface and observed that the surface jet develops at plenty of d l and fr combinations other than the pair reported in sheridan et al 1995 sheridan et al 1997 reported that the jet of fluid passing over the circular cylinder exhibits three metastable states a attachment to the free surface b attachment to the cylinder and c an intermediate state in between each state was found to possess limited stability and switches to other state spontaneously with a low non dimensional frequency of the order of 10 3 the same flow problem has been investigated by reichl et al 2005 who focused more on physical parameters such as shedding frequency forces etc reichl et al 2005 found that the surface jet emerges owing to the local high fr approaching unity which results from the combined effects of the locally increased velocity and the lowered water surface they also pointed out that the suppression of vortex shedding accompanying the surface jet is because of the surface vorticity entering the wake and cross annihilating the wake vorticity reichl et al 2005 plotted a map showing the occurrence or non occurrence of vortex shedding as functions of fr and d l the surface jet has also been observed for a plate with w l 0 1 in the vicinity of a free surface liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 found that as d l decreases the wake structures behind the plate become irregular and a jet like flow forms from the surface on top of the plate when d l is 0 3 re 5 0 104 the suppressed vortex shedding was observed by zhong et al 2019 who studied the flow past rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 close to a free surface re 2 5 104 but the surface jet was not displayed in their study most papers on the flow past rectangular cylinders near a free surface focus more on the force aspects liu et al 2016 reported that the drag coefficient of the plate w l 0 1 reduces as d l decreases and a dramatic reduction occurs between d l 0 6 and d l 0 5 similar variations of the drag coefficient with d l were observed for circular cylinders near a free surface except that the critical d l at which the drag coefficient decreases sharply is about 0 4 miyata et al 1990 malavasi and guadagnini 2007 experimentally investigated the interaction between the free surface and a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l equal to 3 0 they reported that when the water depth is fixed at 7 0l the drag coefficient of the cylinder increases as d l decreases from 4 5 to 0 while the lift coefficient approximately levels from d l 4 5 to d l 1 5 and decreases from d l 1 5 to d l 0 zhong et al 2019 indicated that the disagreement between the variations of force coefficients with d l reported by liu et al 2016 and malavasi and guadagnini 2007 is attributed to the difference in w l zhong et al 2019 concluded that there is a close connection between the effects of d l and w l they also reported that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder first increases and then decreases sharply as d l decreases and the strouhal number varies slightly for most d l but drops suddenly when d l decreases passing a critical value the force variations of the square cylinder with d l reported by zhong et al 2019 are very similar to those of circular cylinders approaching a wall reported by goktun 1975 although the flow structures and force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with some w l near a free surface have been investigated e g liu et al 2016 malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and zhong et al 2019 a comprehensive study of rectangular cylinders with various w l approaching a free surface has not be conducted particularly classifications of the flow depending on d l and w l have not been tackled besides a clear demonstration of the relation between the flow behaviors and the force variations with d l is also lacking in the present study numerical simulations of flow past rectangular cylinders beneath the free surface are conducted using the computational fluid dynamics cfd method the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach is adopted the turbulence is modeled with the mentor shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1994 and the free surface evolution is captured with the volume of fluid vof multiphase model hirt and nichols 1981 a broad range of d l 0 3 4 5 and w l 0 7 5 0 is considered the flow structures velocity field and force coefficients are analyzed flow results show that the anti symmetric vortex shedding becomes asymmetric when the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on w l are observed asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the vortex shedding is suppressed when d l is lower than a critical value the variations of force coefficients with d l for rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges of 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 show different trends due to the occurrence of different asymmetric flows associated with the three w l ranges the boundaries between different flow patterns are defined based on the variations of the force coefficients with d l the findings from the present study provide a deep understanding of the flow and forces of structural members with a rectangular cross section located close to the free surface the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the physics of the flow problem is described in the following section details of the numerical simulations are provided in section 3 the simulation results including the flow results velocity field and forces and their discussions are presented in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem description two dimensional simulations of flow past rectangular cylinders near the water surface are conducted a schematic of the computational configuration and the coordinate system is drawn in fig 1 the coordinate system is fixed at the center of the rectangular cylinder with the x axis aligned with the inlet flow direction the inlet and outlet are 20l upstream and 50l downstream of the cylinder respectively the entire domain is composed of air on the top and water at the bottom the top boundary is 10l away from undisturbed free surface and the bottom is 10l away from the cylinder center the rectangular cylinder is placed beneath the surface the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the rectangular cylinder denoted by d has a significant impact on the flow and forces of the cylinder details of the sizes of the rectangular cylinder along with other parameters used in the simulations are presented in table 1 note that the re value selected in the present simulations is 2 5 104 which would be in the order of 107 for a full scale model and thus is of significance to engineering applications the following assumptions are made in the present study 1 the flow is two dimensional incompressible viscous and turbulent two dimensional simulations are employed due to the significance of two dimensional flow structures when the rectangular cylinder with w l 0 7 approaches a free surface zhong et al 2019 2 the distance between the rectangular cylinder and the outlet is assumed to be sufficiently large such that the outlet effects on the wake structures are negligible liu et al 2016 sohankar 2008 3 numerical simulations 3 1 governing equations the simulation of free surface flows involves modeling two immiscible fluids i e water and air in the present simulations the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to capture the surface evolution one notable advantage inherent in the model s surface capturing is static mesh allowance which makes this method popular among cfd practitioners and engineers applicability of the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 in modeling regular or irregular waves was demonstrated by higuera et al 2013a hu et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2012 and machado et al 2018 and its engineering applications were explored by bruinsma et al 2018 higuera et al 2013b and martínez ferrer et al 2018 the surface capturing in vof hirt and nichols 1981 is realized through introducing the volume fraction which varies from 0 to 1 according to the proportion of one fluid occupying the cell volume a water cell is marked with α 1 an air cell is marked with α 0 and the air water interface is presented where 0 α 1 the classic advection equation of the volume fraction is given as 1 α t u j α x j 0 in order to maintain a sharp air water interface and guarantee the bounded α between 0 and 1 an artificial compression term is integrated into equation 1 leading to 2 α t u j α x j u c j α 1 α x j 0 where u c is the relative velocity between water and air designated as the compression velocity for further reference see rusche 2003 and ubbink 1997 with the introduction of the volume fraction the fluid properties at each cell are evaluated in the form ϕ αϕ water 1 α ϕ air for example the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid are calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air and μ αμ water 1 α μ air respectively the continuity and navier stokes n s equations are averaged over time to derive the reynolds averaged equations for the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid 3 u j x j 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j x j μ u i x j u i x j μ x j p r g h x i g x j ρ x j μ 2 u i x j 2 σ κ α x i ρ u i u j x j where u i and u i i 1 2 3 denote the mean velocity and fluctuating component of the velocity in the x i direction respectively the modified pressure p rgh defined as p rgh p ρ g x is used in equation 4 in order to simplify the definition of pressure condition for each phase i e air and water at wall boundaries the surface tension at the air water interface is accounted for by the fourth term on the right hand side of equation 4 which is evaluated per unit volume using the continuum surface force csf model ubbink 1997 5 f σ σ κ α where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the mean curvature of the interface determined from the following expression 6 κ α α the time averaging process gives rise to the unknown reynolds stress terms in the momentum equations see equation 4 bringing the benefits of using statistical analyses to account for turbulence effects although the accuracy of rans relies on the statistical models its favorable performance in industrial applications is acknowledged by the cfd community successful applications of rans to high reynolds number flows around bluff objects can be found in plenty of literatures e g mannini et al 2010 ong et al 2009 stringer et al 2014 and tian et al 2013 the reynolds stress terms in equation 4 are approximated with the boussinesq equation which is an essential equation for eddy viscosity models that transforms the calculation of the reynolds stress to the computation of the turbulent eddy viscosity the mentor sst k ω model menter 1994 is adopted to compute the turbulent eddy viscosity in the present simulations the turbulent eddy viscosity is obtained by solving two

the calculation of the turbulent eddy viscosity by equation 9 is favorable as it guarantees that bradshow s assumption is satisfied moukalled et al 2015 3 2 numerical methods the continuity and reynolds averaged n s equations the transport equation of the volume fraction and the turbulence model equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm performed in the open source package openfoam openfoam is a bundle of c libraries designed to solve problems like fluid flows combustion electromagnetics chemical reactions etc a comprehensive comparison between openfoam and ansys cfx 13 0 was given in stringer et al 2014 as stated in moukalled et al 2015 the fvm is implemented by integrating each term in the equations over a control volume and relating the volume integrals to the surface integrals using gauss s theorem the surface and volume integrals are both evaluated with the mid point integration approximation which yields second order accuracy the convective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces are evaluated with the second order upwind sou and central differencing cd schemes respectively the second order crank nicolson cn scheme is used for the time integration the interfoam solver in openfoam is adopted the interfoam is capable of solving two phase flow problems using the fvm discretization and the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a detailed flow chart describing this solver was given in higuera et al 2013a the interfoam employs the pimple algorithm to treat the pressure velocity coupling problem the principal of the algorithm is as follows holzmann 2016 within each time step both the inner pressure correction loop piso loop and outer pressure momentum correction loop simple loop are executed in the inner loop the pressure is recalculated with the new updated flux in the outer loop the velocity matrix is first rebuilt with the new flux the pressure is then corrected with the new velocity matrix and the flux is finally corrected with the new pressure the calculations are repeated until convergence is achieved a visual description of the pimple algorithm is referred to higuera et al 2013a in the present simulations three inner loops and three outer loops are executed within each time step the solutions are regarded as being converged when the residuals of the velocity and pressure are lower than 1e 06 3 3 boundary and initial conditions the fluid domain boundaries include the inlet s i the outlet s o the atmosphere s a the bottom s b and the structural surface s s as shown in fig 1 at the inlet a uniform velocity u 1 u is imposed and the pressure is set to zero normal gradient the volume fraction at the water inlet is set to 1 and k and ω are given by 10 k 1 5 u i 2 11 ω k 0 5 c μ 0 25 l where i 5 is the turbulence

respectively 3 4 convergence study the meshes are generated by an algebraic method fig 2 shows that the grid is fully orthogonal and dense areas of the grid points appear in the region near the rectangular cylinder and the free surface a small mesh size near the rectangular cylinder is chosen δx 1 40l this small mesh size is used in the region between 0 5l upstream and 3 0l downstream of the cylinder see fig 2 b and increases toward the inlet or outlet with a low ratio see fig 2 a a grid convergence study is conducted for four cases d l 0 3 and w l 1 0 d l 0 3 and w l 5 0 d l 4 5 and w l 1 0 d l 4 5 and w l 5 0 details of the convergence study are referred to zhong et al 2019 the medium mesh densities are chosen for all the cases in the present simulations considering the tradeoff between accuracy and computing time in the present study the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are calculated over the time period 300s 400s and 200s 300s when d l is lower and higher than 1 0 respectively zhong et al 2019 in addition the distance of the first internal grid point to the wall is selected to be 0 025 l at the surface of the rectangular cylinder and 0 050 l at the bottom respectively the time averaged y around the surface of the cylinder is between 11 06 and 50 00 indicating that the first internal grid points are located in the logarithmic layer 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical procedure anti symmetric vortex shedding the numerical procedure is validated by comparing the present results with the published results the cases with d l 4 5 are used for the validation with d l equal to 4 5 the influence of the free surface on the flow around rectangular cylinders is considered weak malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the validation details are referred to zhong et al 2019 the validation test indicates that the present rans simulations are capable of accurately predicting the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders when w l 0 7 flow visualizations in zhong et al 2019 confirmed the capability of the two dimensional simulations in reproducing the flow structures a better visual representation of the flow is illustrated in fig 3 the figures in fig 3 correspond to the instants when the lift is minimum the solid and dashed contour lines represent the positive and negative vorticity contours respectively the agreement between the predicted flow and the flow results by shimada and ishihara 2002 who used a modified two dimensional k ε model and sohankar 2006 who focused on the large eddy simulation les is good particularly the separated flow at w l 2 8 and the reattached flow at w l 2 8 are well reproduced by the present simulations moreover the velocity and pressure around the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 are compared with the published results bearman and obasaju 1982 durao et al 1988 farhadi and rahnama 2005 lee 1975 lyn et al 1995 ohtsuki 1978 fig 4 a and b show the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the square and the pressure coefficient over the surface of the cross section respectively the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 12 c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference pressure p ref is taken as the pressure at the inlet boundary with the same depth as the square center fig 4 a shows that the velocity upstream of the square and in the recirculation region is in agreement with the numerical results obtained by 3d les farhadi and rahnama 2005 the velocity downstream of the square in near wake 1 0 x l 3 0 agrees with the experimental results by durao et al 1988 and lyn et al 1995 but in the intermediate wake 3 0 x l 8 0 there are differences between the present results and the experimental results durao et al 1988 lyn et al 1995 the discrepancy is probably due to the different settings e g reynolds number and blockage ratio in these studies simulation results in fig 4 b indicate that the predicted pressure coefficient on the front side of the square 0 0 x l 0 5 agrees well with the experimental data bearman and obasaju 1982 lee 1975 ohtsuki 1978 the pressure coefficient on the upper and back sides 0 5 x l 1 5 1 5 x l 2 0 agrees with the results by ohtsuki 1978 but is overpredicted comparing to the results by bearman and obasaju 1982 and lee 1975 overall it is reasonable to believe that the present k ω model can give satisfactory predictions of the velocity and pressure for the square case it is worth mentioning that the vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is anti symmetric when the cylinder is located at d l 4 5 fig 3 shows that positive vortices with relatively higher strengths are shed from the upper corner of the leading edge when the lift is minimum it will be shown that when the lift reaches maximum value negative vortices with approximately equal strengths are formed at the lower corner of the leading edge the symmetry of the flow is evidently demonstrated by the time averaged vorticity contours as shown in fig 5 the occurrence of the anti symmetric vortex shedding implies that when the rectangular cylinder is deeply submerged e g d l 4 5 the interaction between the free surface and the cylinder is weak the weak interaction is also reflected by the undisturbed water surface above the rectangular cylinder not shown in fig 3 4 2 asymmetric vortex shedding it has been documented that the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders with w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 is separated and intermittently reattached respectively shimada and ishihara 2002 the separated flow is characterized by the periodic vortex shedding moving across the cross section without reattaching the side surfaces while the prominent feature of the reattached flow is the periodic reattachment of the vortices on the side surfaces besides as reported by okajima 1982 when w l is between 2 0 and 2 8 a bimodal vortex shedding emerges accompanying the occasional reattachment of the separated shear layers onto the rearmost surfaces of the cross sections the difference between the flow past rectangular cylinders with different w l causes significant differences in the interaction between the free surface and the cylinder observations on the present flow results reveal that with the approaching of a free surface the anti symmetric vortex shedding around the rectangular cylinder is affected and the flow becomes asymmetric as w l varies from 0 7 to 5 0 the asymmetric flow falls into three patterns i e asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached details on the three asymmetric flow patterns are discussed in the following 4 2 1 asymmetrically separated vortex shedding fig 6 shows eight instants of vorticity around the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 located at d l 0 7 the instants cover one cycle of vortex shedding and the time intervals between the instants are equal the black line above the square denotes the free surface it is seen in fig 6 that the separated flow around the square is asymmetric due to the effect of the free surface specifically the constraint by the free surface above causes the overall downward movement of the vortices through pressing and pushing the upper and lower shear layers respectively the positive vortices above the square are pressed and shed nearly in parallel with the surface the negative vortices under the square are pushed downward and stretch in a direction away from the square however although the vortex shedding is asymmetric the flow remains separated the positive or negative vortices shed from the leading edge move across the square without reattaching the side surfaces moreover the range of motion of the vortices about the square is narrowed and the centers of both the positive and negative vortices lie closer to the trailing edge in comparison to the case when the square is deeply submerged as a result spacings between successively shed positive or negative vortices are reduced indicating that the shedding frequency is enhanced the asymmetrically separated flow resulting from the unbalanced effects of the free surface on the shear layers above and under the square represents a typical pattern of vortex shedding past rectangular cylinders with low w l ratios near a water surface the time dependent evolution of the free surface on top of the square is also depicted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a e when the lift varies from the minimum to the maximum the free surface experiences an overall decline and a trough forms when the lift is maximum the trough arises from the sinking of the water surface near the trailing edge which is caused by the regression of the positive vortices above the square the trough holds for a while and vanishes when the lift lowers back to minimum value fig 6 e h show that as the lift varies from the maximum to the minimum the free surface rises with the trough fading away gradually the elevated surface results from the progression of the positive vortices above the square 4 2 2 one sidedly reattached vortex shedding the asymmetric flow past rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 shows different features from those when w l is lower than 1 5 due to the occurrence of the one sided flow reattachment fig 7 illustrates this flow pattern through eight instants of vorticity during one cycle of vortex shedding past the rectangular cylinder with w l 2 5 located at d l 1 0 as shown in fig 7 the positive vortices separated from the upper corner of the leading edge are pressed to reattach the rear portion of the upper surface and by contrast the negative vortices shed at the lower corner of the leading edge move away from the lower surface the overall downward movement of the vortices is induced by the free surface effect in a similar way to that of the asymmetrically separated flow but the upper shear layer is reattached herein due to the relatively larger width of the rectangular cylinder note that the occasionally reattached shear layer above the rectangular cylinder with 2 0 w l 2 8 reported in okajima 1982 becomes constantly reattached with the help of the free surface the vortices around the rectangular cylinder are greatly lengthened due to the reattachment of the upper shear layer the one sided flow reattachment causes asymmetric vortical structures about the centerline of the cross section in the wake fig 7 indicates that the positive vortices produced at the upper corner of the trailing edge interact and join with the positive vortices shed from the leading edge forming the wake structures that are different from those originated from the negative vortices shed along the lower surface despite the asymmetric vortex shedding the vortices in the wake move almost in parallel with the free surface moreover the vortex shedding frequency is enhanced as a result of the flow reattachment fig 7 also shows that fluctuations of the free surface are small and vary slightly over one cycle of vortex shedding which is different from that in the asymmetrically separated flow see fig 6 fig 7 demonstrates that due to the lengthened vortices the regression and progression of the positive vortices above the rectangular cylinder are not as significant as the case with w l 1 0 in which the flow is asymmetrically separated the water surface seems to be constrained by the rectangular cylinder and evolves slightly as the upper positive vortices shed through however although the evolution of the surface is reduced the significant free surface effect on the vortex shedding is evident 4 2 3 asymmetrically reattached vortex shedding it was known that the flow past rectangular cylinders with w l between 2 8 and 5 0 in an infinite domain is intermittently reattached shimada and ishihara 2002 as the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface the reattached flow becomes asymmetric fig 8 shows eight instants of vorticity about the rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 located at d l 1 0 as shown in fig 8 the positive vortices shed from the upper corner of the leading edge are pressed and as a result the reattaching point of the vortices on the upper surface moves upstream in contrast the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are stretched downward with the reattaching point on the lower surface moving downstream the pushing effect by the free surface above results in the asymmetry of the reattaching behaviors between the upper and lower shear layers it is seen that the angle of the shedding direction of the positive vortices with respect to the upper surface when the lift is minimum see fig 8 a is visibly smaller than that between the shedding direction of the negative vortices and the lower surface when the lift is maximum see fig 8 e the asymmetric reattachment of the shear layers has little impact on the wake structures as shown in fig 8 the positive and negative vortices in the wake move nearly in parallel with the free surface and are roughly symmetric the vortex shedding frequency remains almost unvaried despite the asymmetric reattachment of the flow fig 8 also shows similar surface fluctuations to those in the one sidedly reattached flow see fig 7 4 3 suppressed vortex shedding reichl et al 2005 reported that a jet like flow forms around circular cylinders when the cylinder is placed in close proximity to a free surface with the formation of the surface jet the vortex shedding around the circular cylinder is suppressed the suppression of vortex shedding is also observed in the flow around rectangular cylinders with various w l when d l is low fig 9 shows the instantaneous vorticity about rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 2 5 and 3 0 located at d l 0 3 the flow is apparently different from that when the cylinder is moderately or deeply submerged as shown in fig 9 the positive vortices shed along the upper surface are significantly pressed and the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are forced to stretch away from the lower surface the vortex shedding is suppressed while both the positive and negative vortices are greatly lengthened the suppressed vortex shedding around a shallowly submerged rectangular cylinder has also been observed by zhong et al 2019 who reported that when d l is lower than a critical value the vortex shedding is suppressed due to the dominant free surface effect reichl et al 2005 plotted a map showing the occurrence or non occurrence of vortex shedding as functions of fr and d l in the present study the existence or non existence of vortex shedding past rectangular cylinders as functions of d l and w l is discussed and is used as a mean to distinguish the different flow patterns the time dependent surface evolution on top of rectangular cylinders located at d l 0 3 is different from that of the aforementioned flow patterns as shown in fig 9 the water surface fluctuates significantly and the shape of the fluctuations resembles regular waves the wave surface beginning with a trough above the cylinder spreads downstream and vanishes after several wave lengths the shape of the surface varies slightly throughout fig 9 also shows that significant vortices are generated at the free surface which is similar to the jet like flow past circular cylinders however in contrast to the dramatically curving surface in the jet like flow which helps facilitate the transportation of surface vortices into the wake reichl et al 2005 the surface fluctuations above rectangular cylinders are relatively small the surface jet is not developed and the jet like flow around rectangular cylinders is not observed thus the vortices formed at the free surface are restricted by diffusion from moving a long distance and joining the wake while no extra contributions to facilitate the vertical movement of the vortices are received from the slightly curving surface the interaction between the free surface and the rectangular cylinder is in the form of one sided constraint from the surface and the vortex interaction between them is insignificant nevertheless as revealed by an ongoing research by the present authors when the reynolds number is larger than a critical value the surface curvature increases dramatically leading to the development of surface jet the formation of jet like flow around rectangular cylinders has been observed by liu et al 2016 who investigated the flow past a plate with w l 0 1 the reynolds number adopted by liu et al 2016 is 5 0 104 which is higher than 2 5 104 in the present study lei et al 2000 found that for a circular cylinder placed near a wall the cessation of vortex shedding is due to the cancellation of the vorticity in the lower shear layer by the opposite signed vorticity in the wall boundary layer which prevents the lower shear layer from rolling up and interacting with the upper shear layer for a rectangular cylinder close to a free surface in the present research the reduction of the vorticity in the upper shear layer is evident as shown in fig 9 besides it is important to note that the suppressed vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders is different from that around circular cylinders the curved surface of circular cylinders permits the move of the point where the positive and negative vortices meet in the wake and the flow is evidently skewed when the cylinder approaches a free surface thus metastable behaviors display as the jet of fluid passes over the circular cylinder reichl et al 2005 however for rectangular cylinders the flow is separated fixedly at the corners and thus the location where the positive and negative vortices meet moves in a restricted way fig 9 shows that the positive vortices separated at the upper corner of the trailing edge move in parallel with the negative vortices which shed slantingly from the lower corner of the leading edge it is reasonable to deduce that due to the presence of the upper corner of the trailing edge the positive vortices above the rectangular cylinder forced to reattach the upper surface of the cross section is restricted from moving downward leading to the separation of the upper and lower shear layers thus the pairing of vortices is absent and the vortex shedding phenomena disappear the instantaneous streamlines around rectangular cylinders shown in fig 10 demonstrate that large scale counter rotating vortices are established behind the trailing edge for the square a large portion of the area in the wake is occupied by two counter rotating vortices which maintain their presence throughout with the strengths rising and falling periodically for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 5 and 3 0 the upper vortical area arises when the lift rises to maximum value but vanishes when the lift lowers back to minimum value on the other side the lower vortical area consists of two distinct vortices with one right under the rectangular cylinder and the other behind the trailing edge interacting with the upper vortex the two patterns of streamline in fig 10 reveal two differed patterns of suppressed vortex shedding for the separated and reattached flow respectively it is worth noting that the rise and fall of the counter rotating vortices in the wake result in the periodicity of the flow which is distinctly different from that of the vortex shedding flows discussed above 4 4 discussion on the velocity fig 11 a c and e depict the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 2 5 and 3 0 respectively the effect of decreasing d l on the velocity upstream of the cylinder is significant only when the asymmetric vortex shedding becomes suppressed as d l decreases by contrast the velocity downstream of the cylinder varies significantly with d l particularly the time averaged length of the recirculation region changes greatly when d l decreases except the cases with w l 2 5 it is also observed that the suppression of vortex shedding leads to the dramatically reduced velocity in the wake fig 11 a c and e show that the streamwise velocity downstream of the rectangular cylinder is notably lower than the incoming velocity lower than half of the incoming velocity this is due to the large scale counter rotating vortices in the wake causing a low time averaged value of the velocity the velocity above the rectangular cylinder is of interests since the resultant local froude number fr u gd 0 5 where g is the acceleration due to gravity in the area between the free surface and the cylinder would be significantly larger than the global froude number fig 11 b d and f show the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the local area between the free surface and the upper surface of the rectangular cylinder it is seen that when d l is 4 5 the velocity above the rectangular cylinder is roughly equal to the incoming velocity except a slight rise near the top of the cylinder the slight rise of the velocity is not caused by the free surface effect but stems from the cylinder which exists to accelerate the surrounding fluid particles in the sense of mass conservation as the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface the velocity above the cylinder increases remarkably fig 11 b shows that for the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 located at d l 0 7 the highest velocity reaches about 1 7 times the incoming velocity and occurs at around 0 6l downstream of the leading edge in contrast the velocity upstream and downstream of the square decreases jointly to preserve the overall mass conservation similar situations apply to rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 5 and 3 0 located at d l 1 0 fig 11 d and f show that the highest velocities reach about 1 5 times the incoming velocity and occur at around 0 8l downstream of the leading edge it is noted that the flow reattachment of rectangular cylinders with w l 2 5 and w l 3 0 acts to reduce the highest local velocity and push the position where the highest velocity obtains downstream comparing to the square case to put it more clearly the dramatic surface evolution in the asymmetrically separated flow cause higher local velocity while the reduced fluctuations of the surface associated with the one sidedly or asymmetrically reattached flow contribute to the relatively lower local velocity moreover fig 11 d and f show that with the reattachment of the flow the rate of variation of the velocity along the centerline of the local area undergoes a sudden change at near the trailing edge this is due to the interaction of the vortices at the upper corner of the trailing edge accompanying the reattachment of the upper shear layer as the submersion depth of the rectangular cylinder further decreases when the vortex shedding is suppressed the highest velocity varies slightly but the velocity profile changes notably fig 11 b d and f show that when d l is 0 3 the velocity rises and falls multiple times on top of the cylinder before descending sharply at near the trailing edge this is believed to be the result of the wave fluctuations of the free surface fig 12 a and b plot the highest streamwise velocity along the centerline of the area between the free surface and the rectangular cylinder and along the line at the same distance below the cylinder at various d l respectively it is observed that when d l is 4 5 the highest velocity above and under the rectangular cylinder is approximately equal as d l decreases the highest velocity above the cylinder increases continuously except an unexpected fall from d l 0 5 to d l 0 3 while the highest velocity under the cylinder increases first and then drops dramatically when d l is lower than a value this d l value is related to the change of the flow from anti symmetric to asymmetric as d l decreases based on the discussions on the flow structures zhong et al 2019 reported that for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 0 and w l 3 0 the free surface effect becomes significant when d l is lower than 1 0 the present study puts it further based on fig 12 b that for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 and w l 1 5 the d l ratios below which the free surface effect becomes significant are in the ranges from 0 8 to 1 0 and from 1 0 to 1 5 respectively this conclusion will be confirmed by the discussions on the force coefficients in the following section fig 12 also illustrates the different variation trends of the highest velocity with d l for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 and w l 1 5 this reflects their different variation processes of the interaction between the free surface and the vortex shedding as d l decreases and highlights the difference between the asymmetrically separated flow and the one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached flows 4 5 discussion on the force coefficients the behaviors of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 under varying d l have been analyzed and a close connection between the effects of d l and w l has been reported by zhong et al 2019 in the present paper a comprehensive analysis of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with various w l ranging from 0 7 to 5 0 located at different d l is conducted the drag coefficient of rectangular cylinders located at different d l is drawn in fig 13 a when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 the drag coefficient varies with d l in a similar way which represents the typical behaviors of the drag coefficient with decreasing d l when the separated vortex shedding successively becomes asymmetric and suppressed specifically the rise of the drag coefficient from d l 4 5 to around d l 0 8 reflects the process in which the interaction between the free surface and the separated flow becomes significant and the low drag coefficient at d l 0 5 implies the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding the maximum drag coefficient of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 0 8 and 1 0 occurs at around d l 0 8 which marks the beginning of the asymmetric vortex shedding as d l decreases when w l is 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 the drag coefficient also varies similarly with d l this variation of the drag coefficient corresponds to the change of the reattached flow when approaching a free surface the maximum drag coefficient for rectangular cylinders with w l 2 8 is predicted to be obtained in the extreme case of d 0 which is consistent with zhong et al 2019 it is found that the variation trends of the drag coefficient with d l in the two w l ranges are basically similar although the amplitudes of variation and the corresponding d l ranges are different these differences are apparently attributed to the different patterns of interaction between the free surface and the cylinder for rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 the variations of the drag coefficient with d l are generally in resemblance to the cases with w l 2 8 the cause for this is the one sided reattachment of the flow when the cylinder approaches the free surface the three patterns of flow variations associated with the three w l ranges are also reflected in the variations of the lift coefficient fig 13 b clearly shows three distinct variation trends of the lift coefficient with d l importantly the lift coefficient varies remarkably in the d l range from 1 0 to 0 3 the sharp rise of the lift coefficient begins at around d l 0 9 and ends at d l 0 6 when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 while when w l is larger than 2 8 the lift coefficient starts rising at d l 1 0 or 1 5 and peaks at around d l 0 8 for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 the lift coefficient decreases sharply from around d l 0 9 to d l 0 3 the d l at which the lift coefficient starts varying dramatically is also reflected in the variations of the r m s value of the lift coefficient as shown in fig 13 c and is consistent with the variations of the local velocity under the rectangular cylinder see fig 12 b these d l are regarded as important values below which the free surface effect becomes significant and can be used to define the boundary between the anti symmetric flow and the asymmetric flow fig 13 d indicates that when w l is within 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 the strouhal number is of the same order of magnitude as the infinite medium cases and increases as d l decreases from 4 5 to a critical value for example when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 the strouhal number rises generally as d l decreases from 4 5 to 0 6 which is consistent with the discussions on the vortex shedding frequency in fig 6 when w l falls between 1 5 and 2 8 due to the occurrence of the one sided flow reattachment the strouhal number rises suddenly at some d l ratio as shown by the dashed lines representing w l 1 5 w l 2 0 and w l 2 5 in fig 13 d the sharp rise of the strouhal number occurs at d l 1 5 or d l 2 0 depending on w l in addition it is observed that for all the cases when d l decreases passing a critical value the strouhal number drops sharply the low strouhal number at low d l reflects the low flow period which is the typical characteristic of the suppressed vortex shedding recently zhong et al 2019 reported the critical d l values for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 in the present study a general relationship between the critical d l and w l is given fig 13 d demonstrates that the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges from 0 7 to 1 5 and from 2 8 to 5 0 are in the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 respectively the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 varies slightly as w l increases and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 4 6 boundaries between different flow patterns based on the above discussions it is clear that there is a close relation between the change of the flow and the variations of the force coefficients with d l therefore it is possible that the boundaries between different flow patterns can be defined based on the behaviors of the force coefficients under varying d l the boundaries between different flow patterns for rectangular cylinders with various w l approaching a free surface are given in fig 14 the criteria for defining the boundaries are as follows a the boundary between the anti symmetric flow and the asymmetric flow depends on the pattern of the asymmetric flow when the asymmetric flow is asymmetrically separated or asymmetrically reattached since there is no substantial rise of the strouhal number with decreasing d l the boundary is selected as the d l value at which the lift coefficient starts rising as d l decreases when the asymmetric flow is one sidedly reattached the d l at which the strouhal number jumps abruptly as d l decreases is selected to be the boundary b the boundary between the asymmetric flow and the suppressed vortex shedding is defined as the critical d l below which the strouhal number drops suddenly fig 14 shows that the d l above which the flow is anti symmetric depends on w l it is observed that when d l is larger than 1 5 the interaction between the free surface and rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is insignificant the d l range over which the asymmetric flow displays is small comparing to that of the anti symmetric flow the flow rapidly becomes dominated by the free surface effect as d l decreases and the critical d l is dependent on w l it is revealed by fig 14 that the critical d l for the reattached flow is larger than that of the separated flow specifically for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 the critical d l falls within the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 respectively for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 the critical d l varies slightly with w l and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 it is preferable to avoid placing the rectangular cylinder lower than the critical d l value since a large portion of the wake is occupied by the large scale counter rotating vortices which may cause adverse impacts on surrounding structural components a research on the flow around rectangular cylinders in a tandem arrangement close to a free surface is needed in order to understand the phenomena 5 concluding remarks flow past rectangular cylinders in the vicinity of a free surface was investigated in the present study two dimensional simulations were conducted using the mentor sst k ω model and the vof method the flow structures velocity field and force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 located at different d l ranging from 0 3 to 4 5 were analyzed the following conclusions were drawn 1 the flow around a deeply submerged rectangular cylinder is anti symmetric which is similar to that in an infinite medium case when the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface the flow becomes asymmetric due to the one sided constraint from the surface there are three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on w l asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the asymmetrically separated flow appears around rectangular cylinders with low w l i e w l 1 5 and is characterized by the separation of the flow even under the effect of the free surface when w l is between 1 5 and 2 8 the upper shear layer is reattached onto the upper surface of the cylinder while the lower shear layer is detached causing the one sidedly reattached flow when w l is larger than 2 8 the reattached flow displayed at deep depths becomes asymmetrically reattached when the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface with the reattaching points on the upper and lower surfaces moving upstream and downstream respectively 2 the vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders becomes suppressed when d l is low and consequently large scale counter rotating vortices are established in the wake there are two patterns of streamline for the suppressed vortex shedding one is featured by two counter rotating vortices which maintain their presence throughout with the strengths rising and falling periodically the other is featured by the upper periodically arising vortex and the lower vortical area which consists of two vortices under the cross section and behind the trailing edge respectively the two streamline patterns reveal two differed patterns of suppressed vortex shedding for the separated and reattached flow respectively 3 the streamline velocity downstream of the rectangular cylinder varies dramatically as d l decreases especially when the vortex shedding is suppressed with the suppression of vortex shedding the velocity in the wake is notably lower than the incoming velocity due to the large scale counter rotating vortices moreover the velocity above the rectangular cylinder rises remarkably higher than the incoming velocity as d l decreases leading to a local high froude number variations of the local velocity with d l provide a mean to distinguish the different flow patterns 4 the behaviors of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges of 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 under varying d l show different characteristics due to the different patterns of flow variations associated with the three w l ranges the maximum drag coefficient occurs at around d l 0 8 when w l is lower than 1 5 while the maximum drag coefficient for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 is predicted to be obtained in the extreme case of d 0 the lift coefficient varies dramatically in the d l range from 1 0 to 0 3 corresponding to the change of the flow from asymmetric to suppressed the low strouhal number appearing at low d l indicates the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding 5 the boundaries between different flow patterns were defined based on the variations of the force coefficients with d l when d l is larger than 1 5 the interaction between the free surface and rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is insignificant the critical d l below which the vortex shedding is suppressed falls within the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 respectively the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 varies slightly with w l and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 credit authorship contribution statement wenjie zhong

22038,the effects of asymmetric boundary conditions on the flow past rectangular cylinders are relevant for many engineering applications pertinently the influence of wall proximity on the flow around cylinders has been widely investigated and the flow regimes depending on the distance to the wall have been identified however a comprehensive study of the flow around rectangular cylinders near a free surface is lacking the classifications of the flow have not been tackled and the connection between the flow behaviors and the force variations with the depth has not been demonstrated in this study multiphase simulations over a broad range of depth to length ratios 0 3 4 5 and width to length ratios 0 7 5 0 were conducted flow results show that the anti symmetric vortex shedding becomes asymmetric and then suppressed as the depth decreases three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on the width to length ratio were observed asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the force variations with the depth for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 show different trends due to the occurrence of different asymmetric

past rectangular cylinders is one of classical problems in fluid mechanics extensive investigations on the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders have been conducted due to its practical importance in engineering applications and scientific significance in fluid mechanics mannini et al 2010 norberg 1993 okajima 1982 schewe 2013 recently research on the flow past rectangular cylinders has been extended to incorporate the effects of asymmetric boundary conditions i e in the vicinity of a free surface this type of flow is relevant for many civil and marine engineering applications for example bridge decks during river flood or tsunami events may become partially or fully submerged malavasi and guadagnini 2003 hydrokinetic turbines for river current applications operate near the water surface and their performance is affected by the surface liu et al 2016 two parameters of interests in this study are the width to length ratio w l where w and l are the width and length of the rectangular cylinder respectively and the depth to length ratio d l where d is the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the rectangular cylinder the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders is classified by the absence or presence of reattachment of the shear layers depending on w l as archived by a number of papers nakaguchi et al 1968 norberg 1993 sohankar 2008 the value 2 8 marks the flow change from separated to reattached with the change of the flow the strouhal number which reflects the vortex shedding frequency varies abruptly shimada and ishihara 2002 reported two discontinuities in the strouhal number at w l 2 8 and w l 6 0 through using a modified k ε model they provided a division of the flow around rectangular cylinders separated w l 2 8 intermittently reattached 2 8 w l 6 0 and fully reattached w l 6 0 besides okajima 1982 argued that for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 0 and 3 0 there was found to be a certain range of re where a discontinuity in the strouhal number occurs an explanation for this is the change of the flow from steadily reattached to occasionally reattached or separated as re increases in the range from 70 to 2 0 104 with the introduction of an asymmetric boundary condition the flow around rectangular cylinders and consequently the force are affected causing deviations from the infinite medium reference case relevant to the present study is the flow past cylinders near a wall bosch et al 1996 found based on experiments that when the gap to length ratio g l decreases from 1 5 to 0 75 the flow from a square cylinder becomes strongly affected by the wall which is characterized by the asymmetric shedding motion when g l is lower than a critical value the vortex shedding is suppressed bosch et al 1996 reported that the critical g l is in the range from 0 35 to 0 5 representing a transition rather than a sharp change martinuzzi et al 2003 studied the influence of wall proximity on the flow past a square cylinder re 2 2 104 and identified four flow regimes depending on g l a negligible influence from the wall g l 0 9 b increased wall influence 0 6 g l 0 9 c transition between regular vortex shedding and vortex suppression 0 3 g l 0 6 and d suppressed vortex shedding g l 0 3 similar flow phenomena arise for circular cylinders approaching a wall price et al 2002 classified four patterns of flow around a circular cylinder near a wall 1200 re 4960 a negligible influence on the vortex shedding and no separation of the wall boundary layer g l 1 0 b onset of the vortex shedding from the cylinder 0 5 g l 0 75 c pairing between the lower shear layer from the cylinder and the separated wall boundary layer 0 125 g l 0 5 and d suppressed vortex shedding g l 0 125 the difference between the limits of different flow regions reported by martinuzzi et al 2003 and price et al 2002 is mostly due to the different cross sections wang and tan 2008 demonstrated that the wake spreading and momentum exchange of square cylinders are lower than those of circular cylinders at the same g l due to a more straightened effect of the shear layers in the former case angrilli et al 1982 observed the asymmetric distribution of mean velocity across the wake when a circular cylinder locates near a wall lei et al 2000 conducted a study of the suppressed vortex shedding past circular cylinders over a broad range of g l for different re ranging from 80 to 1000 they found that at low g l due to the contact of the lower shear layer from the cylinder and the separated wall boundary layer the vorticity in the lower shear layer is cancelled by the opposite signed vorticity in the wall boundary layer thus the lower shear layer loses the strength to roll up and interact with the upper shear layer and the vortex shedding is suppressed rashidi et al 2016b summarized nine categories of methods for controlling the wake destructive behavior and suppressing the vortex shedding behind bluff objects including active methods e g introducing external objects in one of the shear layers imposing self oscillation on the objects and utilizing electric magnetic or thermal effects bovand et al 2016 rashidi et al 2015 2016a rashidi and esfahani 2015 and passive methods e g modifying surface roughness and approaching a plane boundary lei et al 2000 goktun 1975 found that on reducing g l the drag coefficient of circular cylinders first increases before rapidly decreases and the peak drag coefficient occurs at around g l 0 5 the lift coefficient on the other hand increases monotonically with g l goktun 1975 also observed an initial increase in the strouhal number as g l decreases to 0 5 and a drop at lower g l which reflects the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding directly related to the present study is the flow past a cylinder near a free surface sheridan et al 1997 studied the flow around a circular cylinder close to a free surface and observed that the surface jet develops at plenty of d l and fr combinations other than the pair reported in sheridan et al 1995 sheridan et al 1997 reported that the jet of fluid passing over the circular cylinder exhibits three metastable states a attachment to the free surface b attachment to the cylinder and c an intermediate state in between each state was found to possess limited stability and switches to other state spontaneously with a low non dimensional frequency of the order of 10 3 the same flow problem has been investigated by reichl et al 2005 who focused more on physical parameters such as shedding frequency forces etc reichl et al 2005 found that the surface jet emerges owing to the local high fr approaching unity which results from the combined effects of the locally increased velocity and the lowered water surface they also pointed out that the suppression of vortex shedding accompanying the surface jet is because of the surface vorticity entering the wake and cross annihilating the wake vorticity reichl et al 2005 plotted a map showing the occurrence or non occurrence of vortex shedding as functions of fr and d l the surface jet has also been observed for a plate with w l 0 1 in the vicinity of a free surface liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 found that as d l decreases the wake structures behind the plate become irregular and a jet like flow forms from the surface on top of the plate when d l is 0 3 re 5 0 104 the suppressed vortex shedding was observed by zhong et al 2019 who studied the flow past rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 close to a free surface re 2 5 104 but the surface jet was not displayed in their study most papers on the flow past rectangular cylinders near a free surface focus more on the force aspects liu et al 2016 reported that the drag coefficient of the plate w l 0 1 reduces as d l decreases and a dramatic reduction occurs between d l 0 6 and d l 0 5 similar variations of the drag coefficient with d l were observed for circular cylinders near a free surface except that the critical d l at which the drag coefficient decreases sharply is about 0 4 miyata et al 1990 malavasi and guadagnini 2007 experimentally investigated the interaction between the free surface and a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l equal to 3 0 they reported that when the water depth is fixed at 7 0l the drag coefficient of the cylinder increases as d l decreases from 4 5 to 0 while the lift coefficient approximately levels from d l 4 5 to d l 1 5 and decreases from d l 1 5 to d l 0 zhong et al 2019 indicated that the disagreement between the variations of force coefficients with d l reported by liu et al 2016 and malavasi and guadagnini 2007 is attributed to the difference in w l zhong et al 2019 concluded that there is a close connection between the effects of d l and w l they also reported that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder first increases and then decreases sharply as d l decreases and the strouhal number varies slightly for most d l but drops suddenly when d l decreases passing a critical value the force variations of the square cylinder with d l reported by zhong et al 2019 are very similar to those of circular cylinders approaching a wall reported by goktun 1975 although the flow structures and force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with some w l near a free surface have been investigated e g liu et al 2016 malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and zhong et al 2019 a comprehensive study of rectangular cylinders with various w l approaching a free surface has not be conducted particularly classifications of the flow depending on d l and w l have not been tackled besides a clear demonstration of the relation between the flow behaviors and the force variations with d l is also lacking in the present study numerical simulations of flow past rectangular cylinders beneath the free surface are conducted using the computational fluid dynamics cfd method the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach is adopted the turbulence is modeled with the mentor shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1994 and the free surface evolution is captured with the volume of fluid vof multiphase model hirt and nichols 1981 a broad range of d l 0 3 4 5 and w l 0 7 5 0 is considered the flow structures velocity field and force coefficients are analyzed flow results show that the anti symmetric vortex shedding becomes asymmetric when the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on w l are observed asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the vortex shedding is suppressed when d l is lower than a critical value the variations of force coefficients with d l for rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges of 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 show different trends due to the occurrence of different asymmetric flows associated with the three w l ranges the boundaries between different flow patterns are defined based on the variations of the force coefficients with d l the findings from the present study provide a deep understanding of the flow and forces of structural members with a rectangular cross section located close to the free surface the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the physics of the flow problem is described in the following section details of the numerical simulations are provided in section 3 the simulation results including the flow results velocity field and forces and their discussions are presented in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem description two dimensional simulations of flow past rectangular cylinders near the water surface are conducted a schematic of the computational configuration and the coordinate system is drawn in fig 1 the coordinate system is fixed at the center of the rectangular cylinder with the x axis aligned with the inlet flow direction the inlet and outlet are 20l upstream and 50l downstream of the cylinder respectively the entire domain is composed of air on the top and water at the bottom the top boundary is 10l away from undisturbed free surface and the bottom is 10l away from the cylinder center the rectangular cylinder is placed beneath the surface the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the rectangular cylinder denoted by d has a significant impact on the flow and forces of the cylinder details of the sizes of the rectangular cylinder along with other parameters used in the simulations are presented in table 1 note that the re value selected in the present simulations is 2 5 104 which would be in the order of 107 for a full scale model and thus is of significance to engineering applications the following assumptions are made in the present study 1 the flow is two dimensional incompressible viscous and turbulent two dimensional simulations are employed due to the significance of two dimensional flow structures when the rectangular cylinder with w l 0 7 approaches a free surface zhong et al 2019 2 the distance between the rectangular cylinder and the outlet is assumed to be sufficiently large such that the outlet effects on the wake structures are negligible liu et al 2016 sohankar 2008 3 numerical simulations 3 1 governing equations the simulation of free surface flows involves modeling two immiscible fluids i e water and air in the present simulations the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to capture the surface evolution one notable advantage inherent in the model s surface capturing is static mesh allowance which makes this method popular among cfd practitioners and engineers applicability of the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 in modeling regular or irregular waves was demonstrated by higuera et al 2013a hu et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2012 and machado et al 2018 and its engineering applications were explored by bruinsma et al 2018 higuera et al 2013b and martínez ferrer et al 2018 the surface capturing in vof hirt and nichols 1981 is realized through introducing the volume fraction which varies from 0 to 1 according to the proportion of one fluid occupying the cell volume a water cell is marked with α 1 an air cell is marked with α 0 and the air water interface is presented where 0 α 1 the classic advection equation of the volume fraction is given as 1 α t u j α x j 0 in order to maintain a sharp air water interface and guarantee the bounded α between 0 and 1 an artificial compression term is integrated into equation 1 leading to 2 α t u j α x j u c j α 1 α x j 0 where u c is the relative velocity between water and air designated as the compression velocity for further reference see rusche 2003 and ubbink 1997 with the introduction of the volume fraction the fluid properties at each cell are evaluated in the form ϕ αϕ water 1 α ϕ air for example the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid are calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air and μ αμ water 1 α μ air respectively the continuity and navier stokes n s equations are averaged over time to derive the reynolds averaged equations for the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid 3 u j x j 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j x j μ u i x j u i x j μ x j p r g h x i g x j ρ x j μ 2 u i x j 2 σ κ α x i ρ u i u j x j where u i and u i i 1 2 3 denote the mean velocity and fluctuating component of the velocity in the x i direction respectively the modified pressure p rgh defined as p rgh p ρ g x is used in equation 4 in order to simplify the definition of pressure condition for each phase i e air and water at wall boundaries the surface tension at the air water interface is accounted for by the fourth term on the right hand side of equation 4 which is evaluated per unit volume using the continuum surface force csf model ubbink 1997 5 f σ σ κ α where σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is the mean curvature of the interface determined from the following expression 6 κ α α the time averaging process gives rise to the unknown reynolds stress terms in the momentum equations see equation 4 bringing the benefits of using statistical analyses to account for turbulence effects although the accuracy of rans relies on the statistical models its favorable performance in industrial applications is acknowledged by the cfd community successful applications of rans to high reynolds number flows around bluff objects can be found in plenty of literatures e g mannini et al 2010 ong et al 2009 stringer et al 2014 and tian et al 2013 the reynolds stress terms in equation 4 are approximated with the boussinesq equation which is an essential equation for eddy viscosity models that transforms the calculation of the reynolds stress to the computation of the turbulent eddy viscosity the mentor sst k ω model menter 1994 is adopted to compute the turbulent eddy viscosity in the present simulations the turbulent eddy viscosity is obtained by solving two additional equations i e the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific turbulence dissipation ω 7 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j 1 ρ p k β k ω 8 ω t u j ω x j x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j c α ω k ν t u i x j u j x i u i x j c β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j 9 ν t 0 31 k max 0 31 ω 2 s r f 2 where p k is the production of the turbulent kinetic energy and s r is the magnitude of the strain rate the constants in equations 7 and 8 depend on the blending function f 1 in the form ϕ f 1 ϕ 1 1 f 1 ϕ 2 where ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the corresponding constants in the original k ω and k ε models respectively the constants of the original models are assigned the following values c α1 0 5532 c β1 0 075 β 0 09 σ k1 2 00 σ ω1 2 00 c α2 0 4403 c β2 0 0828 σ k2 1 00 and σ ω2 1 186 the calculation of the turbulent eddy viscosity by equation 9 is favorable as it guarantees that bradshow s assumption is satisfied moukalled et al 2015 3 2 numerical methods the continuity and reynolds averaged n s equations the transport equation of the volume fraction and the turbulence model equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm performed in the open source package openfoam openfoam is a bundle of c libraries designed to solve problems like fluid flows combustion electromagnetics chemical reactions etc a comprehensive comparison between openfoam and ansys cfx 13 0 was given in stringer et al 2014 as stated in moukalled et al 2015 the fvm is implemented by integrating each term in the equations over a control volume and relating the volume integrals to the surface integrals using gauss s theorem the surface and volume integrals are both evaluated with the mid point integration approximation which yields second order accuracy the convective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces are evaluated with the second order upwind sou and central differencing cd schemes respectively the second order crank nicolson cn scheme is used for the time integration the interfoam solver in openfoam is adopted the interfoam is capable of solving two phase flow problems using the fvm discretization and the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a detailed flow chart describing this solver was given in higuera et al 2013a the interfoam employs the pimple algorithm to treat the pressure velocity coupling problem the principal of the algorithm is as follows holzmann 2016 within each time step both the inner pressure correction loop piso loop and outer pressure momentum correction loop simple loop are executed in the inner loop the pressure is recalculated with the new updated flux in the outer loop the velocity matrix is first rebuilt with the new flux the pressure is then corrected with the new velocity matrix and the flux is finally corrected with the new pressure the calculations are repeated until convergence is achieved a visual description of the pimple algorithm is referred to higuera et al 2013a in the present simulations three inner loops and three outer loops are executed within each time step the solutions are regarded as being converged when the residuals of the velocity and pressure are lower than 1e 06 3 3 boundary and initial conditions the fluid domain boundaries include the inlet s i the outlet s o the atmosphere s a the bottom s b and the structural surface s s as shown in fig 1 at the inlet a uniform velocity u 1 u is imposed and the pressure is set to zero normal gradient the volume fraction at the water inlet is set to 1 and k and ω are given by 10 k 1 5 u i 2 11 ω k 0 5 c μ 0 25 l where i 5 is the turbulence intensity and l 0 07l is the turbulence length the empirical constant c μ is 0 09 at the outlet zero normal gradient conditions are applied to all variables at the atmosphere a constant total pressure is prescribed the pressure adjusts according to the velocity as p 0 p 0 5ρ u 2 at the surface of the rectangular cylinder and at the bottom no flux and no slip boundary conditions are specified for the velocity and the pressure is set to be zero gradient in order to reduce the computing time wall functions are used in the near wall region the first internal grid point is placed in the inertial layer 11 06 y 200 00 where the empirical relations apply moukalled et al 2015 the initial velocities in the air and water portion of the computational domain are set to zero and the inlet velocity u respectively 3 4 convergence study the meshes are generated by an algebraic method fig 2 shows that the grid is fully orthogonal and dense areas of the grid points appear in the region near the rectangular cylinder and the free surface a small mesh size near the rectangular cylinder is chosen δx 1 40l this small mesh size is used in the region between 0 5l upstream and 3 0l downstream of the cylinder see fig 2 b and increases toward the inlet or outlet with a low ratio see fig 2 a a grid convergence study is conducted for four cases d l 0 3 and w l 1 0 d l 0 3 and w l 5 0 d l 4 5 and w l 1 0 d l 4 5 and w l 5 0 details of the convergence study are referred to zhong et al 2019 the medium mesh densities are chosen for all the cases in the present simulations considering the tradeoff between accuracy and computing time in the present study the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are calculated over the time period 300s 400s and 200s 300s when d l is lower and higher than 1 0 respectively zhong et al 2019 in addition the distance of the first internal grid point to the wall is selected to be 0 025 l at the surface of the rectangular cylinder and 0 050 l at the bottom respectively the time averaged y around the surface of the cylinder is between 11 06 and 50 00 indicating that the first internal grid points are located in the logarithmic layer 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical procedure anti symmetric vortex shedding the numerical procedure is validated by comparing the present results with the published results the cases with d l 4 5 are used for the validation with d l equal to 4 5 the influence of the free surface on the flow around rectangular cylinders is considered weak malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the validation details are referred to zhong et al 2019 the validation test indicates that the present rans simulations are capable of accurately predicting the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders when w l 0 7 flow visualizations in zhong et al 2019 confirmed the capability of the two dimensional simulations in reproducing the flow structures a better visual representation of the flow is illustrated in fig 3 the figures in fig 3 correspond to the instants when the lift is minimum the solid and dashed contour lines represent the positive and negative vorticity contours respectively the agreement between the predicted flow and the flow results by shimada and ishihara 2002 who used a modified two dimensional k ε model and sohankar 2006 who focused on the large eddy simulation les is good particularly the separated flow at w l 2 8 and the reattached flow at w l 2 8 are well reproduced by the present simulations moreover the velocity and pressure around the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 are compared with the published results bearman and obasaju 1982 durao et al 1988 farhadi and rahnama 2005 lee 1975 lyn et al 1995 ohtsuki 1978 fig 4 a and b show the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the square and the pressure coefficient over the surface of the cross section respectively the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 12 c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ u 2 where the reference pressure p ref is taken as the pressure at the inlet boundary with the same depth as the square center fig 4 a shows that the velocity upstream of the square and in the recirculation region is in agreement with the numerical results obtained by 3d les farhadi and rahnama 2005 the velocity downstream of the square in near wake 1 0 x l 3 0 agrees with the experimental results by durao et al 1988 and lyn et al 1995 but in the intermediate wake 3 0 x l 8 0 there are differences between the present results and the experimental results durao et al 1988 lyn et al 1995 the discrepancy is probably due to the different settings e g reynolds number and blockage ratio in these studies simulation results in fig 4 b indicate that the predicted pressure coefficient on the front side of the square 0 0 x l 0 5 agrees well with the experimental data bearman and obasaju 1982 lee 1975 ohtsuki 1978 the pressure coefficient on the upper and back sides 0 5 x l 1 5 1 5 x l 2 0 agrees with the results by ohtsuki 1978 but is overpredicted comparing to the results by bearman and obasaju 1982 and lee 1975 overall it is reasonable to believe that the present k ω model can give satisfactory predictions of the velocity and pressure for the square case it is worth mentioning that the vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is anti symmetric when the cylinder is located at d l 4 5 fig 3 shows that positive vortices with relatively higher strengths are shed from the upper corner of the leading edge when the lift is minimum it will be shown that when the lift reaches maximum value negative vortices with approximately equal strengths are formed at the lower corner of the leading edge the symmetry of the flow is evidently demonstrated by the time averaged vorticity contours as shown in fig 5 the occurrence of the anti symmetric vortex shedding implies that when the rectangular cylinder is deeply submerged e g d l 4 5 the interaction between the free surface and the cylinder is weak the weak interaction is also reflected by the undisturbed water surface above the rectangular cylinder not shown in fig 3 4 2 asymmetric vortex shedding it has been documented that the unbounded flow past rectangular cylinders with w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 is separated and intermittently reattached respectively shimada and ishihara 2002 the separated flow is characterized by the periodic vortex shedding moving across the cross section without reattaching the side surfaces while the prominent feature of the reattached flow is the periodic reattachment of the vortices on the side surfaces besides as reported by okajima 1982 when w l is between 2 0 and 2 8 a bimodal vortex shedding emerges accompanying the occasional reattachment of the separated shear layers onto the rearmost surfaces of the cross sections the difference between the flow past rectangular cylinders with different w l causes significant differences in the interaction between the free surface and the cylinder observations on the present flow results reveal that with the approaching of a free surface the anti symmetric vortex shedding around the rectangular cylinder is affected and the flow becomes asymmetric as w l varies from 0 7 to 5 0 the asymmetric flow falls into three patterns i e asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached details on the three asymmetric flow patterns are discussed in the following 4 2 1 asymmetrically separated vortex shedding fig 6 shows eight instants of vorticity around the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 located at d l 0 7 the instants cover one cycle of vortex shedding and the time intervals between the instants are equal the black line above the square denotes the free surface it is seen in fig 6 that the separated flow around the square is asymmetric due to the effect of the free surface specifically the constraint by the free surface above causes the overall downward movement of the vortices through pressing and pushing the upper and lower shear layers respectively the positive vortices above the square are pressed and shed nearly in parallel with the surface the negative vortices under the square are pushed downward and stretch in a direction away from the square however although the vortex shedding is asymmetric the flow remains separated the positive or negative vortices shed from the leading edge move across the square without reattaching the side surfaces moreover the range of motion of the vortices about the square is narrowed and the centers of both the positive and negative vortices lie closer to the trailing edge in comparison to the case when the square is deeply submerged as a result spacings between successively shed positive or negative vortices are reduced indicating that the shedding frequency is enhanced the asymmetrically separated flow resulting from the unbalanced effects of the free surface on the shear layers above and under the square represents a typical pattern of vortex shedding past rectangular cylinders with low w l ratios near a water surface the time dependent evolution of the free surface on top of the square is also depicted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a e when the lift varies from the minimum to the maximum the free surface experiences an overall decline and a trough forms when the lift is maximum the trough arises from the sinking of the water surface near the trailing edge which is caused by the regression of the positive vortices above the square the trough holds for a while and vanishes when the lift lowers back to minimum value fig 6 e h show that as the lift varies from the maximum to the minimum the free surface rises with the trough fading away gradually the elevated surface results from the progression of the positive vortices above the square 4 2 2 one sidedly reattached vortex shedding the asymmetric flow past rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 shows different features from those when w l is lower than 1 5 due to the occurrence of the one sided flow reattachment fig 7 illustrates this flow pattern through eight instants of vorticity during one cycle of vortex shedding past the rectangular cylinder with w l 2 5 located at d l 1 0 as shown in fig 7 the positive vortices separated from the upper corner of the leading edge are pressed to reattach the rear portion of the upper surface and by contrast the negative vortices shed at the lower corner of the leading edge move away from the lower surface the overall downward movement of the vortices is induced by the free surface effect in a similar way to that of the asymmetrically separated flow but the upper shear layer is reattached herein due to the relatively larger width of the rectangular cylinder note that the occasionally reattached shear layer above the rectangular cylinder with 2 0 w l 2 8 reported in okajima 1982 becomes constantly reattached with the help of the free surface the vortices around the rectangular cylinder are greatly lengthened due to the reattachment of the upper shear layer the one sided flow reattachment causes asymmetric vortical structures about the centerline of the cross section in the wake fig 7 indicates that the positive vortices produced at the upper corner of the trailing edge interact and join with the positive vortices shed from the leading edge forming the wake structures that are different from those originated from the negative vortices shed along the lower surface despite the asymmetric vortex shedding the vortices in the wake move almost in parallel with the free surface moreover the vortex shedding frequency is enhanced as a result of the flow reattachment fig 7 also shows that fluctuations of the free surface are small and vary slightly over one cycle of vortex shedding which is different from that in the asymmetrically separated flow see fig 6 fig 7 demonstrates that due to the lengthened vortices the regression and progression of the positive vortices above the rectangular cylinder are not as significant as the case with w l 1 0 in which the flow is asymmetrically separated the water surface seems to be constrained by the rectangular cylinder and evolves slightly as the upper positive vortices shed through however although the evolution of the surface is reduced the significant free surface effect on the vortex shedding is evident 4 2 3 asymmetrically reattached vortex shedding it was known that the flow past rectangular cylinders with w l between 2 8 and 5 0 in an infinite domain is intermittently reattached shimada and ishihara 2002 as the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface the reattached flow becomes asymmetric fig 8 shows eight instants of vorticity about the rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 located at d l 1 0 as shown in fig 8 the positive vortices shed from the upper corner of the leading edge are pressed and as a result the reattaching point of the vortices on the upper surface moves upstream in contrast the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are stretched downward with the reattaching point on the lower surface moving downstream the pushing effect by the free surface above results in the asymmetry of the reattaching behaviors between the upper and lower shear layers it is seen that the angle of the shedding direction of the positive vortices with respect to the upper surface when the lift is minimum see fig 8 a is visibly smaller than that between the shedding direction of the negative vortices and the lower surface when the lift is maximum see fig 8 e the asymmetric reattachment of the shear layers has little impact on the wake structures as shown in fig 8 the positive and negative vortices in the wake move nearly in parallel with the free surface and are roughly symmetric the vortex shedding frequency remains almost unvaried despite the asymmetric reattachment of the flow fig 8 also shows similar surface fluctuations to those in the one sidedly reattached flow see fig 7 4 3 suppressed vortex shedding reichl et al 2005 reported that a jet like flow forms around circular cylinders when the cylinder is placed in close proximity to a free surface with the formation of the surface jet the vortex shedding around the circular cylinder is suppressed the suppression of vortex shedding is also observed in the flow around rectangular cylinders with various w l when d l is low fig 9 shows the instantaneous vorticity about rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 2 5 and 3 0 located at d l 0 3 the flow is apparently different from that when the cylinder is moderately or deeply submerged as shown in fig 9 the positive vortices shed along the upper surface are significantly pressed and the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are forced to stretch away from the lower surface the vortex shedding is suppressed while both the positive and negative vortices are greatly lengthened the suppressed vortex shedding around a shallowly submerged rectangular cylinder has also been observed by zhong et al 2019 who reported that when d l is lower than a critical value the vortex shedding is suppressed due to the dominant free surface effect reichl et al 2005 plotted a map showing the occurrence or non occurrence of vortex shedding as functions of fr and d l in the present study the existence or non existence of vortex shedding past rectangular cylinders as functions of d l and w l is discussed and is used as a mean to distinguish the different flow patterns the time dependent surface evolution on top of rectangular cylinders located at d l 0 3 is different from that of the aforementioned flow patterns as shown in fig 9 the water surface fluctuates significantly and the shape of the fluctuations resembles regular waves the wave surface beginning with a trough above the cylinder spreads downstream and vanishes after several wave lengths the shape of the surface varies slightly throughout fig 9 also shows that significant vortices are generated at the free surface which is similar to the jet like flow past circular cylinders however in contrast to the dramatically curving surface in the jet like flow which helps facilitate the transportation of surface vortices into the wake reichl et al 2005 the surface fluctuations above rectangular cylinders are relatively small the surface jet is not developed and the jet like flow around rectangular cylinders is not observed thus the vortices formed at the free surface are restricted by diffusion from moving a long distance and joining the wake while no extra contributions to facilitate the vertical movement of the vortices are received from the slightly curving surface the interaction between the free surface and the rectangular cylinder is in the form of one sided constraint from the surface and the vortex interaction between them is insignificant nevertheless as revealed by an ongoing research by the present authors when the reynolds number is larger than a critical value the surface curvature increases dramatically leading to the development of surface jet the formation of jet like flow around rectangular cylinders has been observed by liu et al 2016 who investigated the flow past a plate with w l 0 1 the reynolds number adopted by liu et al 2016 is 5 0 104 which is higher than 2 5 104 in the present study lei et al 2000 found that for a circular cylinder placed near a wall the cessation of vortex shedding is due to the cancellation of the vorticity in the lower shear layer by the opposite signed vorticity in the wall boundary layer which prevents the lower shear layer from rolling up and interacting with the upper shear layer for a rectangular cylinder close to a free surface in the present research the reduction of the vorticity in the upper shear layer is evident as shown in fig 9 besides it is important to note that the suppressed vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders is different from that around circular cylinders the curved surface of circular cylinders permits the move of the point where the positive and negative vortices meet in the wake and the flow is evidently skewed when the cylinder approaches a free surface thus metastable behaviors display as the jet of fluid passes over the circular cylinder reichl et al 2005 however for rectangular cylinders the flow is separated fixedly at the corners and thus the location where the positive and negative vortices meet moves in a restricted way fig 9 shows that the positive vortices separated at the upper corner of the trailing edge move in parallel with the negative vortices which shed slantingly from the lower corner of the leading edge it is reasonable to deduce that due to the presence of the upper corner of the trailing edge the positive vortices above the rectangular cylinder forced to reattach the upper surface of the cross section is restricted from moving downward leading to the separation of the upper and lower shear layers thus the pairing of vortices is absent and the vortex shedding phenomena disappear the instantaneous streamlines around rectangular cylinders shown in fig 10 demonstrate that large scale counter rotating vortices are established behind the trailing edge for the square a large portion of the area in the wake is occupied by two counter rotating vortices which maintain their presence throughout with the strengths rising and falling periodically for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 5 and 3 0 the upper vortical area arises when the lift rises to maximum value but vanishes when the lift lowers back to minimum value on the other side the lower vortical area consists of two distinct vortices with one right under the rectangular cylinder and the other behind the trailing edge interacting with the upper vortex the two patterns of streamline in fig 10 reveal two differed patterns of suppressed vortex shedding for the separated and reattached flow respectively it is worth noting that the rise and fall of the counter rotating vortices in the wake result in the periodicity of the flow which is distinctly different from that of the vortex shedding flows discussed above 4 4 discussion on the velocity fig 11 a c and e depict the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 2 5 and 3 0 respectively the effect of decreasing d l on the velocity upstream of the cylinder is significant only when the asymmetric vortex shedding becomes suppressed as d l decreases by contrast the velocity downstream of the cylinder varies significantly with d l particularly the time averaged length of the recirculation region changes greatly when d l decreases except the cases with w l 2 5 it is also observed that the suppression of vortex shedding leads to the dramatically reduced velocity in the wake fig 11 a c and e show that the streamwise velocity downstream of the rectangular cylinder is notably lower than the incoming velocity lower than half of the incoming velocity this is due to the large scale counter rotating vortices in the wake causing a low time averaged value of the velocity the velocity above the rectangular cylinder is of interests since the resultant local froude number fr u gd 0 5 where g is the acceleration due to gravity in the area between the free surface and the cylinder would be significantly larger than the global froude number fig 11 b d and f show the time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the local area between the free surface and the upper surface of the rectangular cylinder it is seen that when d l is 4 5 the velocity above the rectangular cylinder is roughly equal to the incoming velocity except a slight rise near the top of the cylinder the slight rise of the velocity is not caused by the free surface effect but stems from the cylinder which exists to accelerate the surrounding fluid particles in the sense of mass conservation as the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface the velocity above the cylinder increases remarkably fig 11 b shows that for the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 located at d l 0 7 the highest velocity reaches about 1 7 times the incoming velocity and occurs at around 0 6l downstream of the leading edge in contrast the velocity upstream and downstream of the square decreases jointly to preserve the overall mass conservation similar situations apply to rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 2 5 and 3 0 located at d l 1 0 fig 11 d and f show that the highest velocities reach about 1 5 times the incoming velocity and occur at around 0 8l downstream of the leading edge it is noted that the flow reattachment of rectangular cylinders with w l 2 5 and w l 3 0 acts to reduce the highest local velocity and push the position where the highest velocity obtains downstream comparing to the square case to put it more clearly the dramatic surface evolution in the asymmetrically separated flow cause higher local velocity while the reduced fluctuations of the surface associated with the one sidedly or asymmetrically reattached flow contribute to the relatively lower local velocity moreover fig 11 d and f show that with the reattachment of the flow the rate of variation of the velocity along the centerline of the local area undergoes a sudden change at near the trailing edge this is due to the interaction of the vortices at the upper corner of the trailing edge accompanying the reattachment of the upper shear layer as the submersion depth of the rectangular cylinder further decreases when the vortex shedding is suppressed the highest velocity varies slightly but the velocity profile changes notably fig 11 b d and f show that when d l is 0 3 the velocity rises and falls multiple times on top of the cylinder before descending sharply at near the trailing edge this is believed to be the result of the wave fluctuations of the free surface fig 12 a and b plot the highest streamwise velocity along the centerline of the area between the free surface and the rectangular cylinder and along the line at the same distance below the cylinder at various d l respectively it is observed that when d l is 4 5 the highest velocity above and under the rectangular cylinder is approximately equal as d l decreases the highest velocity above the cylinder increases continuously except an unexpected fall from d l 0 5 to d l 0 3 while the highest velocity under the cylinder increases first and then drops dramatically when d l is lower than a value this d l value is related to the change of the flow from anti symmetric to asymmetric as d l decreases based on the discussions on the flow structures zhong et al 2019 reported that for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 0 and w l 3 0 the free surface effect becomes significant when d l is lower than 1 0 the present study puts it further based on fig 12 b that for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 and w l 1 5 the d l ratios below which the free surface effect becomes significant are in the ranges from 0 8 to 1 0 and from 1 0 to 1 5 respectively this conclusion will be confirmed by the discussions on the force coefficients in the following section fig 12 also illustrates the different variation trends of the highest velocity with d l for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 and w l 1 5 this reflects their different variation processes of the interaction between the free surface and the vortex shedding as d l decreases and highlights the difference between the asymmetrically separated flow and the one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached flows 4 5 discussion on the force coefficients the behaviors of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 under varying d l have been analyzed and a close connection between the effects of d l and w l has been reported by zhong et al 2019 in the present paper a comprehensive analysis of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with various w l ranging from 0 7 to 5 0 located at different d l is conducted the drag coefficient of rectangular cylinders located at different d l is drawn in fig 13 a when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 the drag coefficient varies with d l in a similar way which represents the typical behaviors of the drag coefficient with decreasing d l when the separated vortex shedding successively becomes asymmetric and suppressed specifically the rise of the drag coefficient from d l 4 5 to around d l 0 8 reflects the process in which the interaction between the free surface and the separated flow becomes significant and the low drag coefficient at d l 0 5 implies the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding the maximum drag coefficient of rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 0 8 and 1 0 occurs at around d l 0 8 which marks the beginning of the asymmetric vortex shedding as d l decreases when w l is 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 the drag coefficient also varies similarly with d l this variation of the drag coefficient corresponds to the change of the reattached flow when approaching a free surface the maximum drag coefficient for rectangular cylinders with w l 2 8 is predicted to be obtained in the extreme case of d 0 which is consistent with zhong et al 2019 it is found that the variation trends of the drag coefficient with d l in the two w l ranges are basically similar although the amplitudes of variation and the corresponding d l ranges are different these differences are apparently attributed to the different patterns of interaction between the free surface and the cylinder for rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 the variations of the drag coefficient with d l are generally in resemblance to the cases with w l 2 8 the cause for this is the one sided reattachment of the flow when the cylinder approaches the free surface the three patterns of flow variations associated with the three w l ranges are also reflected in the variations of the lift coefficient fig 13 b clearly shows three distinct variation trends of the lift coefficient with d l importantly the lift coefficient varies remarkably in the d l range from 1 0 to 0 3 the sharp rise of the lift coefficient begins at around d l 0 9 and ends at d l 0 6 when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 while when w l is larger than 2 8 the lift coefficient starts rising at d l 1 0 or 1 5 and peaks at around d l 0 8 for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 the lift coefficient decreases sharply from around d l 0 9 to d l 0 3 the d l at which the lift coefficient starts varying dramatically is also reflected in the variations of the r m s value of the lift coefficient as shown in fig 13 c and is consistent with the variations of the local velocity under the rectangular cylinder see fig 12 b these d l are regarded as important values below which the free surface effect becomes significant and can be used to define the boundary between the anti symmetric flow and the asymmetric flow fig 13 d indicates that when w l is within 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 the strouhal number is of the same order of magnitude as the infinite medium cases and increases as d l decreases from 4 5 to a critical value for example when w l is 0 8 or 1 0 the strouhal number rises generally as d l decreases from 4 5 to 0 6 which is consistent with the discussions on the vortex shedding frequency in fig 6 when w l falls between 1 5 and 2 8 due to the occurrence of the one sided flow reattachment the strouhal number rises suddenly at some d l ratio as shown by the dashed lines representing w l 1 5 w l 2 0 and w l 2 5 in fig 13 d the sharp rise of the strouhal number occurs at d l 1 5 or d l 2 0 depending on w l in addition it is observed that for all the cases when d l decreases passing a critical value the strouhal number drops sharply the low strouhal number at low d l reflects the low flow period which is the typical characteristic of the suppressed vortex shedding recently zhong et al 2019 reported the critical d l values for rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 in the present study a general relationship between the critical d l and w l is given fig 13 d demonstrates that the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges from 0 7 to 1 5 and from 2 8 to 5 0 are in the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 respectively the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with w l between 1 5 and 2 8 varies slightly as w l increases and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 4 6 boundaries between different flow patterns based on the above discussions it is clear that there is a close relation between the change of the flow and the variations of the force coefficients with d l therefore it is possible that the boundaries between different flow patterns can be defined based on the behaviors of the force coefficients under varying d l the boundaries between different flow patterns for rectangular cylinders with various w l approaching a free surface are given in fig 14 the criteria for defining the boundaries are as follows a the boundary between the anti symmetric flow and the asymmetric flow depends on the pattern of the asymmetric flow when the asymmetric flow is asymmetrically separated or asymmetrically reattached since there is no substantial rise of the strouhal number with decreasing d l the boundary is selected as the d l value at which the lift coefficient starts rising as d l decreases when the asymmetric flow is one sidedly reattached the d l at which the strouhal number jumps abruptly as d l decreases is selected to be the boundary b the boundary between the asymmetric flow and the suppressed vortex shedding is defined as the critical d l below which the strouhal number drops suddenly fig 14 shows that the d l above which the flow is anti symmetric depends on w l it is observed that when d l is larger than 1 5 the interaction between the free surface and rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is insignificant the d l range over which the asymmetric flow displays is small comparing to that of the anti symmetric flow the flow rapidly becomes dominated by the free surface effect as d l decreases and the critical d l is dependent on w l it is revealed by fig 14 that the critical d l for the reattached flow is larger than that of the separated flow specifically for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 the critical d l falls within the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 respectively for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 the critical d l varies slightly with w l and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 it is preferable to avoid placing the rectangular cylinder lower than the critical d l value since a large portion of the wake is occupied by the large scale counter rotating vortices which may cause adverse impacts on surrounding structural components a research on the flow around rectangular cylinders in a tandem arrangement close to a free surface is needed in order to understand the phenomena 5 concluding remarks flow past rectangular cylinders in the vicinity of a free surface was investigated in the present study two dimensional simulations were conducted using the mentor sst k ω model and the vof method the flow structures velocity field and force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 located at different d l ranging from 0 3 to 4 5 were analyzed the following conclusions were drawn 1 the flow around a deeply submerged rectangular cylinder is anti symmetric which is similar to that in an infinite medium case when the rectangular cylinder approaches a free surface the flow becomes asymmetric due to the one sided constraint from the surface there are three patterns of asymmetric flow depending on w l asymmetrically separated one sidedly reattached and asymmetrically reattached the asymmetrically separated flow appears around rectangular cylinders with low w l i e w l 1 5 and is characterized by the separation of the flow even under the effect of the free surface when w l is between 1 5 and 2 8 the upper shear layer is reattached onto the upper surface of the cylinder while the lower shear layer is detached causing the one sidedly reattached flow when w l is larger than 2 8 the reattached flow displayed at deep depths becomes asymmetrically reattached when the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface with the reattaching points on the upper and lower surfaces moving upstream and downstream respectively 2 the vortex shedding around rectangular cylinders becomes suppressed when d l is low and consequently large scale counter rotating vortices are established in the wake there are two patterns of streamline for the suppressed vortex shedding one is featured by two counter rotating vortices which maintain their presence throughout with the strengths rising and falling periodically the other is featured by the upper periodically arising vortex and the lower vortical area which consists of two vortices under the cross section and behind the trailing edge respectively the two streamline patterns reveal two differed patterns of suppressed vortex shedding for the separated and reattached flow respectively 3 the streamline velocity downstream of the rectangular cylinder varies dramatically as d l decreases especially when the vortex shedding is suppressed with the suppression of vortex shedding the velocity in the wake is notably lower than the incoming velocity due to the large scale counter rotating vortices moreover the velocity above the rectangular cylinder rises remarkably higher than the incoming velocity as d l decreases leading to a local high froude number variations of the local velocity with d l provide a mean to distinguish the different flow patterns 4 the behaviors of the force coefficients of rectangular cylinders with w l in the ranges of 0 7 w l 1 5 1 5 w l 2 8 and 2 8 w l 5 0 under varying d l show different characteristics due to the different patterns of flow variations associated with the three w l ranges the maximum drag coefficient occurs at around d l 0 8 when w l is lower than 1 5 while the maximum drag coefficient for rectangular cylinders with w l 1 5 is predicted to be obtained in the extreme case of d 0 the lift coefficient varies dramatically in the d l range from 1 0 to 0 3 corresponding to the change of the flow from asymmetric to suppressed the low strouhal number appearing at low d l indicates the occurrence of the suppressed vortex shedding 5 the boundaries between different flow patterns were defined based on the variations of the force coefficients with d l when d l is larger than 1 5 the interaction between the free surface and rectangular cylinders with w l between 0 7 and 5 0 is insignificant the critical d l below which the vortex shedding is suppressed falls within the ranges from 0 5 to 0 6 and from 0 8 to 0 9 for rectangular cylinders with 0 7 w l 1 5 and w l 2 8 respectively the critical d l for rectangular cylinders with 1 5 w l 2 8 varies slightly with w l and is located between 0 7 and 1 0 credit authorship contribution statement wenjie zhong

22039,the power umbilical is mainly composed of several unbonded spiral layers with high axial strength and flexibility in bending in order to analyze the influence of the key parameters on the static stiffness of the power umbilical a three dimensional 3d finite element method fem model was developed through the program anasys where the modeling method showed an improvement over the other studies based on the model the contact and friction between layers were taken into consideration and the results were calibrated by the present theoretical results and experimental results in addition the parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out from the views of friction coefficient lay angle and external pressure the results show an obvious correspondence between the model and the published solutions which means that the fem model can describe the static stiffness of the power umbilical accurately it is also shown that the lay angle of the wires will affect the tensile and torsional stiffness of the power umbilical to a large extent while the bending stiffness is mainly sensitive to friction coefficient the achievements of this study can provide technical support for the section

2016 cao et al 2016 due to the harsh marine operation conditions in deeper water the performance requirements of such key equipment are getting higher and higher liu et al 2018 it is an important task to improve the strength of power umbilical on the premise of ensuring the diversity of functions according to the review on failure modes research of power umbilical lu et al 2017 drumond et al 2018 li et al 2018 tension bending and torsion are the main failure modes of power umbilical during installation and operation in view of the complexity of the structure many researchers have studied it from the perspectives of experimental measurement theoretical analysis and finite element method fem at present there are mature standards for the structure design of umbilical american petroleum institute 2017 international organization for standardization 2009 but the experimental requirements in these standards are ambiguous aiming to the experiment of the power umbilical different scholars proposed different designs vaz et al 1998 conducted an experimental test of the production control umbilical with the coupling effect of tension and torsion carlos and ney 2001 placed the umbilical specimen vertically fixed one end of the specimen and applied displacement load at the other end to measure the bending stiffness sævik and gjøsteen 2012 tested the tensile stiffness of flexible umbilical with different sections these experiments above are always difficult to conduct and complicated to operate and sometimes they are expensive besides the umbilical is a multilayer unbonded structure it is inevitable that if the experimental joint cannot clamp the wires in an ideal state it will result in large experimental errors carlos and ney 2001 in terms of theoretical analysis based on the structure of helical winding cylinder a lot of mechanical properties of umbilical were studied knapp 1975 1979 used energy method to study the helical armored cable which considers tension and torsion then based on the torsion characteristics of armored cable and the stress distribution in wires he proposed the design method of torsion balance and stress balance through the analysis of the single helical winding cylinder by the theory of material mechanics the coupling relation between axial elongation and torsion of the whole structure was obtained mcconnell and zemke 1982 taking poisson effect into account velinsky et al 1984 analyzed the helical structure with complex cross section considering the characteristics of material nonlinearity interlayer gap and internal contact the response of umbilical born a single load was analyzed custódio and vaz 2002 using equivalent principle of bending stiffness a simplified helical tube model was proposed and the bending stiffness was obtained probyn et al 2007 in order to simplify the calculation the analytical methods either ignore the inter layer friction or neglect the internal contact which makes the result more idealization due to the complexity of umbilical structure and problems such as extrusion contact sliding friction and large deformation the numerical simulation based on fem has obvious advantages at present domestic and foreign scholars used fem to carry out a large number of numerical simulation studies most of which were based on steel tube umbilical a two dimensional 2d numerical analysis software cable cad was developed by knapp 2007 to analyze the whole deformation of umbilical and the stress response of each component on the other hand lecorre and probyn 2009 used abaqus a general fem software to simulate the torsion and bend of the steel tube umbilical tang et al 2014 used radial stiffness to predict the tensile stiffness of power umbilical however there was an error in derivation process which created a huge difference with published papers besides the steel tube umbilical the research achievements of the other types of umbilical e g hose tube umbilical power umbilical and integrated service umbilical are relatively poor in this paper the general finite element program ansys was employed to develop the three dimensional 3d model of the power umbilical the contact and friction between the components were considered adequately the line surface contact between layers and line line contact inside the layer were set separately and the coulomb law was set to describe the friction behavior material simplified methods i e nonlinear materials such as polymers are simplified to elastic isotropic materials and wires element selection i e beam solid element in this study show some differences compared with other models which makes this study more meaningful on this basis aiming at the main failure modes of the power umbilical several key factors affecting its stiffness were emphasized and studied the parameters sensitivity of static stiffness were obtained finally 2 the fem model 2 1 modeling procedures the typical cross sectional of the power umbilical is shown in fig 1 besides the outer protection sheath the structure is made up of two parts one is the central cylinder composed of filler and functional units the other is a helical component mainly made of wires the helical component is wrapped around the outside of the central cylinder which can provide the power umbilical with large tensile stiffness and small bending stiffness because the layers of the power umbilical are independent of each other the wires may slide and result in the change of static stiffness during the operation there are two problems to be solved during the process of the investigation of the umbilical static stiffness by fem the one is the establishment of the helical component which has various parameters and complex construction and the other is the simplified treatment of the nonlinear polymers in the tang s work 2014 a relatively simplified two dimensional fem model of the internal core of the power umbilical was presented but this incomplete model has limitations in learning the response of the axial loads and in the fem model of achievement lu et al 2017 all elements were molded by the s4r shell element and the simulation of filler as well as the sheath was not mentioned that is to say the two problems mentioned above have not been taken into account in this study the ansys parametric design language apdl is employed for parameterization modeling to describe the complex structure there are three materials such as steel copper and polymer in umbilical steel and copper are both metal materials most numerical simulation of umbilical simplify the metal and polymer as linear elasticity lecorre and probyn 2009 lu et al 2017 tang et al 2014 metal material is an elastic plastic material whose resistance to deformation is concentrated in the linear elastic stage thus the plasticity of metal material is not studied in this paper besides although there are many kinds of steel and copper most steel and most copper have little difference in young s modulus and poisson s ratio therefore the sensitivity of metal materials is not analyzed in this paper the polymers in the umbilical can be low density polyethylene ldpe high density polyethylene hdpe or polypropylene pp their elastic modulus are far less than that of metal materials that is to say the polymers play a very small role in the static stiffness it is not significant to analyze the sensitivity of polymers to static stiffness as a result a certain polymer material parameter is selected to simplify the calculation and the nonlinear material properties are simplified to linear elastic isotropic material properties an overall fem model with length of 1000 mm is developed based on apdl as shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the initial lay angle of the wires is 15 the number of the wires in internal and external layer are 55 and 62 in opposite direction and there are 125 elements in the axial direction of the model considering the complexity of the model the 3d 2 node beam element beam188 is used to model the wires the rest parts are meshed with 3d 8 node structural solid element solid185 the main specifications and material properties of the power umbilical are summarized in table 1 another difficulty in analyzing the static stiffness by fem is the complexity of the contact between adjacent components there are two main types of internal contact modes the interstratified contact between layers and the adjacent contact between wires as shown in fig 3 a the interstratified contact is the line surface contact between wires and straight components it can be constructed by 3d line surface contact element conta177 and 3d target segment targe170 fig 3 b illustrates that the contact between wires is line line contact which can be described by 3d line line contact element conta176 and targe170 as for the boundary condition and load application of the model one end of the model is fixed the other end is free and the nodes on it are coupled to a reference point the corresponding stiffness can be obtained by applying tension force bending moment and torque moment on the reference point 2 2 calibration of the fem results as mentioned in the introduction it is very hard to consider the contact and friction in the theoretical derivation besides the experimental of umbilical is very complicated it is difficult for us to carry out the umbilical experiments in our laboratory as an alternative we utilized the published theoretical and experimental results to verify the accuracy of the fem results considering the radial contraction of central cylinder knapp 1979 derived an explicit tensile stiffness expression based on the compressible core compressible core closes to the actual situation but the calculation is complex in order to improve the calculation efficiency he simplified the core into two ideal materials rigid material the core is non deformable and incompressible material the total volume remains unchanged after core deformation and deduced the stiffness of the rigid or incompressible core in addition yue et al 2013 derived the tensile stiffness based on radial stiffness but they ignored the friction and the rotation of wires the analytical formula of knapp 1979 is not able to analyze the influence of internal friction on tensile stiffness but it is mature and widely accepted within the industry the accuracy of the fem model ignoring friction can be verified with the analytical formula of knapp 1979 on the other hand in terms of the bending stiffness of the power umbilical witz and tan 1992 presented an analytical model to predict the bending behavior of the umbilical by using the principle of energy considering the slip mechanism the bending state is divided into non slip state and full slip state however there is no friction to prevent the slip of the wires when the umbilical does not bear the axisymmetric load the umbilical enters the stage of full slip state directly under the bending load dong et al 2013 based on these basics dong et al 2013 proposed that the bending stiffness is supplied by the local bending and torsion of individual helical wires during the full slip state dong s theory is used to verify the accuracy of the bending stiffness of fem model in the fem model the expression of tensile stiffness of the power umbilical calculated by using stress strain method is as follows 1 e a f δ l l f ε as shown in fig 4 combining the deflection of the end of the structure under the bending moment according to the theory of pure bending beam in material mechanics the bending stiffness of the fem model can be determined as 2 e i m l 2 2 f b the tensile and bending stiffness was calculated and compared with analytical model as shown in table 2 the fem result of tensile stiffness is more similar to the result of compressible core and the difference between the results of other two idealized results is not significant the maximum difference is 3 6 besides there is an obvious correspondence between the analytic bending stiffness and the fem model predictions which can provide accuracy for the modeling procedure custódio and vaz 2002 carried out a series of tensile and torsional experiments on a nine hose umbilical and the experimental data obtained was cited by sævik and gjøsteen 2012 combining the umbilical specification of custódio and vaz 2002 with the modeling procedures mentioned in section 2 1 the umbilical under single tension and single torsion were simulated respectively the comparison results between the fem and experiment are obtained as shown in fig 5 taking axial extension direction and anticlockwise direction as positive direction the slopes in fig 5 a b correspond to the tensile stiffness and torsional stiffness respectively through comparison it is found that the fem results are in good agreement with the experimental results which can provide confidence for the further investigations below 2 3 comparison of the wires element types the fem model built in this paper not only ensures the accuracy but also improves the computational efficiency notably in order to prove the latter point this paper build a full solid fem model with the same specification shown in table 1 all components including wires are meshed by solid elements solid185 corresponding to the solid element all contact modes in the full solid model are surface surface contact and the contact element and the target segment are 3d 8 node surface surface contact conta174 and targe170 respectively other settings such as element size boundary conditions and load application are consistent with the beam solid model after the calculation the two fem models were compared in terms of element number calculation time and calculation results as shown in table 3 it can be seen by the comparison that the beam solid model of ansys can significantly reduce the element number which could improve the efficiency dramatically in addition the fem results of beam solid model are similar to those of full solid model and they are similar to the analytical results which ensures the accuracy of calculation thus the beam solid element is employed to simulate the wires of the power umbilical for the static stiffness research 3 results and discussion 3 1 theory of parameter sensitivity in the theoretical derivation of the helical winding structure the lay angle has influence on the static stiffness however influences of other parameters such as friction and external pressure on static stiffness cannot be analyzed by theoretical formula based on the variable controlling approach the sensitivity of these parameters on the static stiffness were analyzed by fem and theoretical analysis which can not only highlight the superiority of fem but also provide references for umbilical design to quantitatively analyze the sensitivity the dimensionless treatment is adopted to define the sensitivity coefficient of parameter on the static stiffness as s p a 3 s p a δ p p δ a a δ p δ a a p where p represents the value of a concrete static stiffness a is on behalf of a specific influencing parameter δ p p δ a a are their relative errors besides in allusion to a specific influencing parameter p can be represented as a function of a p a in the case of δ a a is always small s p a can be approximately expressed as 4 s p a d p a d a a p a the value of s p a is always positive and with the increase of the parameter sensitivity s p a the influence of the key parameter on the static stiffness of the umbilical grows by comparing the sensitivity coefficient we can determine the sensitivity of each parameter in addition we can draw the sensitivity function curve s p a of a specific influencing parameter a according to the sensitivity function curves of every parameter the difference between the fem result and the theoretical result can be analyzed 3 2 effect of friction coefficient the power umbilical is a multilayer unbonded structure so there is inevitable friction between each two layers which may affect the static stiffness of the umbilical the effect of the friction coefficient on the power umbilical is investigated in this section the initial condition of the model is that the external pressure is kept to zero and the lay angle of the wires is controlled at 15 the effect of the friction coefficient 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 on the tensile bending and torsional stiffness are shown in fig 6 and it should be noted that the direction of the torque is clockwise the same direction of the internal wires in the power umbilical umbilical usually operates at a relatively low level of tension li and vaz 2019 therefore in this paper the tension applied in the analysis of tensile stiffness is small and the nonlinear large deformation is not considered consistent with the conclusion of utting and jones 1987a b the tensile stiffness does not change with the friction coefficient as shown in fig 6 a because the tension force is uniformly applied at the end surface the internal components do not slip relatively and the maximum contact stress keeps in a stable state as demonstrated in fig 7 therefore under the premise of linear deformation the friction does not play a role in resisting tensile deformation in addition it can be illustrated clearly from fig 6 b that the theoretical formula cannot reveal the change of bending stiffness with friction coefficient while the fem model with friction considering can describe it truly fig 8 shows the stress distribution of the fem model results with the friction coefficient of 0 2 the helical component is used to resist tension and torque sævik and gjøsteen 2012 it plays a small role in resisting bending deformation so the stress of the helical component under bending moment is small in addition the elastic modulus of polymer material is much smaller than that of metal so the stress of central cylinder is also small in this study the maximum von mises stress increases gradually from 465 69 mpa to 471 77 mpa with the growth of the friction coefficient from 0 to 0 2 besides the bending stiffness increases with the increase of friction coefficient in fem by a factor of about 21 7 this is because the great friction will prevent relative sliding between adjacent layers when the power umbilical is exposed to bending loads therefore the reduction of friction between components can guarantee the flexibility of the power umbilical similarly with results of the case of tension loads fig 6 c shows the effect of friction coefficient on torsional stiffness is also not obvious in this fem model only increased by about 0 8 this is also because the relative displacement does not appear in the umbilical model although many theoretical results have been obtained in the research of the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical knapp 1979 custódio and vaz 2002 sævik and bruaseth 2005 there are still some limitations in these analytical solutions such as model idealization or too many assumptions due to the lack of analytical methods we cannot find out the analytical solution of the influence of the friction coefficient on the power umbilical s torsional stiffness by fitting the curves in fig 6 the function between tensile stiffness te bending stiffness b as well as the torsional stiffness to and friction coefficient f can be obtained 5a t e 4 96576 0 0018 f fem result t e 4 94 theoretical result 5b b 39 93174 60 71429 f 8 57143 f 2 fem result b 40 7 theoretical result 5c t o 60 69 2 14 f combined with eq 4 the sensitivity coefficient of friction coefficient on the tensile stiffness s t e f bending stiffness s b f and torsional stiffness s t o f are derived and demonstrated in fig 9 due to the friction coefficient is not considered in the theoretical formula as a result the sensitivity coefficient of the three types of stiffness in theoretical result is always zero on the contrary the fem model can describe the small change of the sensitivity of the tensile and torsional stiffness as shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 c which also shows the advantages of the finite element method on the other although the sensitivity coefficient increases with the increase of the friction coefficient its value is so small so that it close to zero this indicates that the tensile and torsional stiffness is not sensitive to the friction coefficient the effect of friction coefficient under these working conditions can be ignored besides the fem can reflect the change of sensitivity coefficient on the bending stiffness of the umbilical well the results in fig 9 b show that the sensitivity increases first and then decreases and the maximum value is obtained at the friction coefficient of about 0 15 this means that the bending stiffness will gradually approach a stable value after the friction coefficient exceeds 0 15 therefore an anti friction layer can be considered to be added to the power umbilical to ensure that the friction coefficient is as small as possible in this way the bending stiffness can be reduced and the sensitivity can be guaranteed 3 3 effect of the lay angle of wires the lay angle of wires refers to the angle between the axis of the power umbilical and the armor wires which plays a key role in the mechanical performance in order to analyze the effect of lay angle on the tensile bending and torsional stiffness comparative study is carried out in this section the friction coefficient between layers is kept at 0 1 and the initial external pressure of the model is zero as a controlled parameter the lay angle of wires is 5 10 15 and 20 combined with fem apdl model and the published theoretical formula the results of the lay angle on the stiffness of power umbilical are shown in fig 10 as illustrated in fig 10 a under the premise of linear deformation the tensile stiffness of the power umbilical decreases with the increase of wires lay angle by a factor of 0 21 for the fem results while by a factor of 0 15 for the analytical solution this shows that when the lay angle is smaller the armor wires of the power umbilical withstands a larger tensile load the wire structure is just similar to a spring and the wire with small angle is like an elongate spring therefore it has a large tensile stiffness the bending stiffness of the power umbilical decreases slightly with the increase of lay angle in the fem results as shown in fig 10 b so that its flexibility increases it is mentioned that the bending stiffness of the theoretical formula is less than that of fem which can be accounted for the fact that the friction is ignored in the theoretical formula fig 10 c illustrates the torsional stiffness increases linearly with the increase of lay angle from 16 95 kn m2 to 76 03 kn m2 by a time of 4 5 fig 11 provides the fem results of the power umbilical under torsion load and study shows that the maximum von mises stress decreases from 152 70 mpa to 98 07 mpa when the lay angle increases from 5 to 20 this is because the power umbilical with larger lay angle wires has the stronger stability to resist torsional loads which indicates that the helical structure of wires can play a significant role in resisting torsional deformation in the same way by fitting the curves in fig 10 the relationship between tensile stiffness te bending stiffness b and torsional stiffness to and lay angle h can be expressed as 6a t e 5 8702 0 0106 h 0 00288 h 2 fem result t e 5 52094 0 00737 h 0 00183 h 2 theoretical result 6b b 47 15641 0 04952 h fem result b 40 75181 0 00267 h theoretical result 6c t o 2 78016 3 95603 h according to eq 4 the sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on the tensile stiffness s t e h bending stiffness s b f and torsional stiffness s t o f are illustrated in fig 12 as illustrated in fig 12 a the sensitivity coefficient of tensile stiffness increases when the lay angle grows it is worth mentioning that the theoretical analysis underestimates the sensitivity of lay angle on the tensile stiffness and the increase of the lay angle will lead to the more difference the contact stress of two adjacent wires is shown in fig 13 although the maximum contact stress occurs in the surface where helical wire touches straight component there is essential contact stress between adjacent wires however knapp 1979 ignores the contact between adjacent wires which gives rise to the underestimation of the sensitivity the maximum sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on bending stiffness is 0 024 in the fem results as shown in fig 12 b it is less than the sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on tensile stiffness when increasing a certain lay angle under the same condition the effect of increasing the flexibility is smaller than that of decreasing the tensile strength that is to say during the process of design and manufacture of the power umbilical the lay angle of wires should not be too large although the increase of lay angle can improve the torsional stiffness of umbilical the sensitivity coefficient of it decreases with the increase of lay angle and finally tends to a stable value at 18 20 as shown in fig 12 c this indicates that the increase of lay angle cannot infinitely increase the ability of umbilical to resist torsional deformation and the lay angle should depend on comprehensive consideration in many aspects 3 4 effect of external pressure under different operation condition or various working ocean depths the power umbilical may be exposed in different external hydrostatic pressures the effect of external pressure 0 5 10 and 15 mpa on the stiffness of the power umbilical is examined in this section the lay angle of wires is kept at 15 the friction coefficient between layers is 0 1 the fem model and the analytical solution results are illustrated in fig 14 under the premise of linear deformation the tensile stiffness of the power umbilical does not change obviously in the results of the two methods similarly the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical remains about 60 98 kn m2 with the change of external hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 14 c by combining the definition eq 4 the parameter sensitivity of the external pressure to the tensile and bending stiffness of the power umbilical is obtained as shown in fig 15 the stiffness in fig 14 a has a little change that is difficult to observe with the naked eye thus the change of sensitivity coefficient of tensile stiffness is small from 0 to 0 001 since the value of torsional stiffness is approximately constant in this model its sensitive curve is a line equal to zero which is unnecessary to demonstrate sensitivity coefficient of bending stiffness increases with the increase of the external pressure but the effect of external pressure on the stiffness of the power umbilical is smaller than that of lay angle 4 conclusion in this study the fem numerical modeling of the power umbilical was carried out by the program ansys the beam element and solid element were employed to describe the helical component and central cylinder respectively the interaction between the components was simulated by line surface contact and line line contact and finally the key parameters sensitivity s p a on the static stiffness was investigated and discussed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 theoretical method is complex in form and difficult to describe the internal interaction of the power umbilical accurately which might make the research of the key parameters sensitivity imprecise on the contrary the fem results in this paper were calibrated by the theoretical results and it showed that the fem model could reflect the influence of different key parameters on the static stiffness clearly 2 the influence of each parameter in this study on the static stiffness of the power umbilical is also different the friction coefficient has little effect on the tensile and torsional stiffness while it affects the bending performance of the power umbilical obviously it can be considered to add anti friction layers in the power umbilical to reduce friction and ultimately ensure flexibility 3 the lay angle has the highest sensitivity on the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical which is over 20 times larger than it on the bending stiffness increasing the lay angle of the wires can improve the torsion resistance of the umbilical but it will reduce the tensile stiffness when the lay angle of the wires is 14 16 in this model the power umbilical shows the best mechanical properties 4 it has been proved that external hydrostatic pressure has little effect on the tensile and torsional stiffness but it plays an important role in influencing the bending stiffness of the power umbilical that is to say the power umbilical has different bending stiffness in different working conditions during the process of design and manufacture of the power umbilical the service life of it can be improved by considering the influence of external hydrostatic pressure on

22039,the power umbilical is mainly composed of several unbonded spiral layers with high axial strength and flexibility in bending in order to analyze the influence of the key parameters on the static stiffness of the power umbilical a three dimensional 3d finite element method fem model was developed through the program anasys where the modeling method showed an improvement over the other studies based on the model the contact and friction between layers were taken into consideration and the results were calibrated by the present theoretical results and experimental results in addition the parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out from the views of friction coefficient lay angle and external pressure the results show an obvious correspondence between the model and the published solutions which means that the fem model can describe the static stiffness of the power umbilical accurately it is also shown that the lay angle of the wires will affect the tensile and torsional stiffness of the power umbilical to a large extent while the bending stiffness is mainly sensitive to friction coefficient the achievements of this study can provide technical support for the section

2016 cao et al 2016 due to the harsh marine operation conditions in deeper water the performance requirements of such key equipment are getting higher and higher liu et al 2018 it is an important task to improve the strength of power umbilical on the premise of ensuring the diversity of functions according to the review on failure modes research of power umbilical lu et al 2017 drumond et al 2018 li et al 2018 tension bending and torsion are the main failure modes of power umbilical during installation and operation in view of the complexity of the structure many researchers have studied it from the perspectives of experimental measurement theoretical analysis and finite element method fem at present there are mature standards for the structure design of umbilical american petroleum institute 2017 international organization for standardization 2009 but the experimental requirements in these standards are ambiguous aiming to the experiment of the power umbilical different scholars proposed different designs vaz et al 1998 conducted an experimental test of the production control umbilical with the coupling effect of tension and torsion carlos and ney 2001 placed the umbilical specimen vertically fixed one end of the specimen and applied displacement load at the other end to measure the bending stiffness sævik and gjøsteen 2012 tested the tensile stiffness of flexible umbilical with different sections these experiments above are always difficult to conduct and complicated to operate and sometimes they are expensive besides the umbilical is a multilayer unbonded structure it is inevitable that if the experimental joint cannot clamp the wires in an ideal state it will result in large experimental errors carlos and ney 2001 in terms of theoretical analysis based on the structure of helical winding cylinder a lot of mechanical properties of umbilical were studied knapp 1975 1979 used energy method to study the helical armored cable which considers tension and torsion then based on the torsion characteristics of armored cable and the stress distribution in wires he proposed the design method of torsion balance and stress balance through the analysis of the single helical winding cylinder by the theory of material mechanics the coupling relation between axial elongation and torsion of the whole structure was obtained mcconnell and zemke 1982 taking poisson effect into account velinsky et al 1984 analyzed the helical structure with complex cross section considering the characteristics of material nonlinearity interlayer gap and internal contact the response of umbilical born a single load was analyzed custódio and vaz 2002 using equivalent principle of bending stiffness a simplified helical tube model was proposed and the bending stiffness was obtained probyn et al 2007 in order to simplify the calculation the analytical methods either ignore the inter layer friction or neglect the internal contact which makes the result more idealization due to the complexity of umbilical structure and problems such as extrusion contact sliding friction and large deformation the numerical simulation based on fem has obvious advantages at present domestic and foreign scholars used fem to carry out a large number of numerical simulation studies most of which were based on steel tube umbilical a two dimensional 2d numerical analysis software cable cad was developed by knapp 2007 to analyze the whole deformation of umbilical and the stress response of each component on the other hand lecorre and probyn 2009 used abaqus a general fem software to simulate the torsion and bend of the steel tube umbilical tang et al 2014 used radial stiffness to predict the tensile stiffness of power umbilical however there was an error in derivation process which created a huge difference with published papers besides the steel tube umbilical the research achievements of the other types of umbilical e g hose tube umbilical power umbilical and integrated service umbilical are relatively poor in this paper the general finite element program ansys was employed to develop the three dimensional 3d model of the power umbilical the contact and friction between the components were considered adequately the line surface contact between layers and line line contact inside the layer were set separately and the coulomb law was set to describe the friction behavior material simplified methods i e nonlinear materials such as polymers are simplified to elastic isotropic materials and wires element selection i e beam solid element in this study show some differences compared with other models which makes this study more meaningful on this basis aiming at the main failure modes of the power umbilical several key factors affecting its stiffness were emphasized and studied the parameters sensitivity of static stiffness were obtained finally 2 the fem model 2 1 modeling procedures the typical cross sectional of the power umbilical is shown in fig 1 besides the outer protection sheath the structure is made up of two parts one is the central cylinder composed of filler and functional units the other is a helical component mainly made of wires the helical component is wrapped around the outside of the central cylinder which can provide the power umbilical with large tensile stiffness and small bending stiffness because the layers of the power umbilical are independent of each other the wires may slide and result in the change of static stiffness during the operation there are two problems to be solved during the process of the investigation of the umbilical static stiffness by fem the one is the establishment of the helical component which has various parameters and complex construction and the other is the simplified treatment of the nonlinear polymers in the tang s work 2014 a relatively simplified two dimensional fem model of the internal core of the power umbilical was presented but this incomplete model has limitations in learning the response of the axial loads and in the fem model of achievement lu et al 2017 all elements were molded by the s4r shell element and the simulation of filler as well as the sheath was not mentioned that is to say the two problems mentioned above have not been taken into account in this study the ansys parametric design language apdl is employed for parameterization modeling to describe the complex structure there are three materials such as steel copper and polymer in umbilical steel and copper are both metal materials most numerical simulation of umbilical simplify the metal and polymer as linear elasticity lecorre and probyn 2009 lu et al 2017 tang et al 2014 metal material is an elastic plastic material whose resistance to deformation is concentrated in the linear elastic stage thus the plasticity of metal material is not studied in this paper besides although there are many kinds of steel and copper most steel and most copper have little difference in young s modulus and poisson s ratio therefore the sensitivity of metal materials is not analyzed in this paper the polymers in the umbilical can be low density polyethylene ldpe high density polyethylene hdpe or polypropylene pp their elastic modulus are far less than that of metal materials that is to say the polymers play a very small role in the static stiffness it is not significant to analyze the sensitivity of polymers to static stiffness as a result a certain polymer material parameter is selected to simplify the calculation and the nonlinear material properties are simplified to linear elastic isotropic material properties an overall fem model with length of 1000 mm is developed based on apdl as shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the initial lay angle of the wires is 15 the number of the wires in internal and external layer are 55 and 62 in opposite direction and there are 125 elements in the axial direction of the model considering the complexity of the model the 3d 2 node beam element beam188 is used to model the wires the rest parts are meshed with 3d 8 node structural solid element solid185 the main specifications

are two main types of internal contact modes the interstratified contact between layers and the adjacent contact between wires as shown in fig 3 a the interstratified contact is the line surface

effect of friction coefficient the power umbilical is a multilayer unbonded structure so there is inevitable friction between each two layers which may affect the static stiffness of the umbilical the effect of the friction coefficient on the power umbilical is investigated in this section the initial condition of the model is that the external pressure is kept to zero and the lay angle of the wires is controlled at 15 the effect of the friction coefficient 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 on the tensile bending and torsional stiffness are shown in fig 6 and it should be noted that the direction of the torque is clockwise the same direction of the internal wires in the power umbilical umbilical usually operates at a relatively low level of tension li and vaz 2019 therefore in this paper the tension applied in the analysis of tensile stiffness is small and the nonlinear large deformation is not considered consistent with the conclusion of utting and jones 1987a b the tensile stiffness does not change with the friction coefficient as shown in fig 6 a because the tension force is uniformly applied at the end surface the internal components do not slip relatively and the maximum contact stress keeps in a stable state as demonstrated in fig 7 therefore under the premise of linear deformation the friction does not play a role in resisting tensile deformation in addition it can be illustrated clearly from fig 6 b that the theoretical formula cannot reveal the change of bending stiffness with friction coefficient while the fem model with friction considering can describe it truly fig 8 shows the stress distribution of the fem model results with the friction coefficient of 0 2 the helical component is used to resist tension and torque sævik and gjøsteen 2012 it plays a small role in resisting bending deformation so the stress of the helical component under bending moment is small in addition the elastic modulus of polymer material is much smaller than that of metal so the stress of central cylinder is also small in this study the maximum von mises stress increases gradually from 465 69 mpa to 471 77 mpa with the growth of the friction coefficient from 0 to 0 2 besides the bending stiffness increases with the increase of friction coefficient in fem by a factor of about 21 7 this is because the great friction will prevent relative sliding between adjacent layers when the power umbilical is exposed to bending loads therefore the reduction of friction between components can guarantee the flexibility of the power umbilical similarly with results of the case of tension loads fig 6 c shows the effect of friction coefficient on torsional stiffness is also not obvious in this fem model only increased by about 0 8 this is also because the relative displacement does not appear in the umbilical model although many theoretical results have been obtained in the research of the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical knapp 1979 custódio and vaz 2002 sævik and bruaseth 2005 there are still some limitations in these analytical solutions such as model idealization or too many assumptions due to the lack of analytical methods we cannot find out the analytical solution of the influence of the friction coefficient on the power umbilical s torsional stiffness by fitting the curves in fig 6 the function between tensile stiffness te bending stiffness b as well as the torsional stiffness to and friction coefficient f can be obtained 5a t e 4 96576 0 0018 f fem result t e 4 94 theoretical result 5b b 39 93174 60 71429 f 8 57143 f 2 fem result b 40 7 theoretical result 5c t o 60 69 2 14 f combined with eq 4 the sensitivity coefficient of friction coefficient on the tensile stiffness s t e f bending stiffness s b f and torsional stiffness s t o f are derived and demonstrated in fig 9 due to the friction coefficient is not considered in the theoretical formula as a result the sensitivity coefficient of the three types of stiffness in theoretical result is always zero on the contrary the fem model can describe the small change of the sensitivity of the tensile and torsional stiffness as shown in fig 9 a and fig 9 c which also shows the advantages of the finite element method on the other although the sensitivity coefficient increases with the increase of the friction coefficient its value is so small so that it close to zero this indicates that the tensile and torsional stiffness is not sensitive to the friction coefficient the effect of friction coefficient under these working conditions can be ignored besides the fem can reflect the change of sensitivity coefficient on the bending stiffness of the umbilical well the results in fig 9 b show that the sensitivity increases first and then decreases and the maximum value is obtained at the friction coefficient of about 0 15 this means that the bending stiffness will gradually approach a stable value after the friction coefficient exceeds 0 15 therefore an anti friction layer can be considered to be added to the power umbilical to ensure that the friction coefficient is as small as possible in this way the bending stiffness can be reduced and the sensitivity can be guaranteed 3 3 effect of the lay angle of wires the lay angle of wires refers to the angle between the axis of the power umbilical and the armor wires which plays a key role in the mechanical performance in order to analyze the effect of lay angle on the tensile bending and torsional stiffness comparative study is carried out in this section the friction coefficient between layers is kept at 0 1 and the initial external pressure of the model is zero as a controlled parameter the lay angle of wires is 5 10 15 and 20 combined with fem apdl model and the published theoretical formula the results of the lay angle on the stiffness of power umbilical are shown in fig 10 as illustrated in fig 10 a under the premise of linear deformation the tensile stiffness of the power umbilical decreases with the increase of wires lay angle by a factor of 0 21 for the fem results while by a factor of 0 15 for the analytical solution this shows that when the lay angle is smaller the armor wires of the power umbilical withstands a larger tensile load the wire structure is just similar to a spring and the wire with small angle is like an elongate spring therefore it has a large tensile stiffness the bending stiffness of the power umbilical decreases slightly with the increase of lay angle in the fem results as shown in fig 10 b so that its flexibility increases it is mentioned that the bending stiffness of the theoretical formula is less than that of fem which can be accounted for the fact that the friction is ignored in the theoretical formula fig 10 c illustrates the torsional stiffness increases linearly with the increase of lay angle from 16 95 kn m2 to 76 03 kn m2 by a time of 4 5 fig 11 provides the fem results of the power umbilical under torsion load and study shows that the maximum von mises stress decreases from 152 70 mpa to 98 07 mpa when the lay angle increases from 5 to 20 this is because the power umbilical with larger lay angle wires has the stronger stability to resist torsional loads which indicates that the helical structure of wires can play a significant role in resisting torsional deformation in the same way by fitting the curves in fig 10 the relationship between tensile stiffness te bending stiffness b and torsional stiffness to and lay angle h can be expressed as 6a t e 5 8702 0 0106 h 0 00288 h 2 fem result t e 5 52094 0 00737 h 0 00183 h 2 theoretical result 6b b 47 15641 0 04952 h fem result b 40 75181 0 00267 h theoretical result 6c t o 2 78016 3 95603 h according to eq 4 the sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on the tensile stiffness s t e h bending stiffness s b f and torsional stiffness s t o f are illustrated in fig 12 as illustrated in fig 12 a the sensitivity coefficient of tensile stiffness increases when the lay angle grows it is worth mentioning that the theoretical analysis underestimates the sensitivity of lay angle on the tensile stiffness and the increase of the lay angle will lead to the more difference the contact stress of two adjacent wires is shown in fig 13 although the maximum contact stress occurs in the surface where helical wire touches straight component there is essential contact stress between adjacent wires however knapp 1979 ignores the contact between adjacent wires which gives rise to the underestimation of the sensitivity the maximum sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on bending stiffness is 0 024 in the fem results as shown in fig 12 b it is less than the sensitivity coefficient of lay angle on tensile stiffness when increasing a certain lay angle under the same condition the effect of increasing the flexibility is smaller than that of decreasing the tensile strength that is to say during the process of design and manufacture of the power umbilical the lay angle of wires should not be too large although the increase of lay angle can improve the torsional stiffness of umbilical the sensitivity coefficient of it decreases with the increase of lay angle and finally tends to a stable value at 18 20 as shown in fig 12 c this indicates that the increase of lay angle cannot infinitely increase the ability of umbilical to resist torsional deformation and the lay angle should depend on comprehensive consideration in many aspects 3 4 effect of external pressure under different operation condition or various working ocean depths the power umbilical may be exposed in different external hydrostatic pressures the effect of external pressure 0 5 10 and 15 mpa on the stiffness of the power umbilical is examined in this section the lay angle of wires is kept at 15 the friction coefficient between layers is 0 1 the fem model and the analytical solution results are illustrated in fig 14 under the premise of linear deformation the tensile stiffness of the power umbilical does not change obviously in the results of the two methods similarly the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical remains about 60 98 kn m2 with the change of external hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 14 c by combining the definition eq 4 the parameter sensitivity of the external pressure to the tensile and bending stiffness of the power umbilical is obtained as shown in fig 15 the stiffness in fig 14 a has a little change that is difficult to observe with the naked eye thus the change of sensitivity coefficient of tensile stiffness is small from 0 to 0 001 since the value of torsional stiffness is approximately constant in this model its sensitive curve is a line equal to zero which is unnecessary to demonstrate sensitivity coefficient of bending stiffness increases with the increase of the external pressure but the effect of external pressure on the stiffness of the power umbilical is smaller than that of lay angle 4 conclusion in this study the fem numerical modeling of the power umbilical was carried out by the program ansys the beam element and solid element were employed to describe the helical component and central cylinder respectively the interaction between the components was simulated by line surface contact and line line contact and finally the key parameters sensitivity s p a on the static stiffness was investigated and discussed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 theoretical method is complex in form and difficult to describe the internal interaction of the power umbilical accurately which might make the research of the key parameters sensitivity imprecise on the contrary the fem results in this paper were calibrated by the theoretical results and it showed that the fem model could reflect the influence of different key parameters on the static stiffness clearly 2 the influence of each parameter in this study on the static stiffness of the power umbilical is also different the friction coefficient has little effect on the tensile and torsional stiffness while it affects the bending performance of the power umbilical obviously it can be considered to add anti friction layers in the power umbilical to reduce friction and ultimately ensure flexibility 3 the lay angle has the highest sensitivity on the torsional stiffness of the power umbilical which is over 20 times larger than it on the bending stiffness increasing the lay angle of the wires can improve the torsion resistance of the umbilical but it will reduce the tensile stiffness when the lay angle of the wires is 14 16 in this model the power umbilical shows the best mechanical properties 4 it has been proved that external hydrostatic pressure has little effect on the tensile and torsional stiffness but it plays an important role in influencing the bending stiffness of the power umbilical that is to say the power umbilical has different bending stiffness in different working conditions during the process of design and manufacture of the power umbilical the service life of it can be improved by considering the influence of external hydrostatic pressure on
