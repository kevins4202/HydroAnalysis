13350,rapid expansion of the unconventional oil and gas extraction has increased american energy independence but also led to increased production of large amounts of contaminated water wastewater from the oil and gas industry contains a wide range of contaminants injecting such contaminated water into disposal wells or discharging it to the environment jeopardizes freshwater resources conventional and membrane based wastewater treatment techniques are often not effective choices to treat highly contaminated wastewater however a suitable way to remove contaminants from wastewater is to selectively separate water in a process analogous to humidification dehumidification hdh only a few studies have investigated the use of hdh for wastewater treatment in this study a novel hdh system is introduced for treating highly contaminated water such as oil and gas flowback and produced water in this hdh process a non condensable gas such as air mixes with wastewater vapor to facilitate the separation of contaminants as a result clean water condenses from the multicomponent gaseous mixture while air carries organic contaminants out of the dehumidification section a laboratory apparatus was constructed and experiments were performed to investigate the hdh process for wastewater treatment and to study the effects of flow dynamics including air flow rate on the composition of treated water different contaminants including benzene toluene 2 propanol and 2 butoxyethanol were tested experimental results showed that the system can be successfully applied for removing volatile and or toxic organic contaminants from wastewater a representative multicomponent mixture of fracking wastewater was successfully treated using the experimental setup and clean water with quality of 98 3 was obtained it was revealed that increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves purity of treated water quantitative analysis showed that by increasing the air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 the fraction of separated 2 propanol through the air was improved from 43 to more than 96 of the initial amount aspen software was employed to simulate equilibrium conditions experimental results were observed to have lower mass fraction of residual contaminant in the treated water compared to equilibrium state keywords wastewater treatment humidification dehumidification selective condensation oil and gas extraction 1 introduction freshwater resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to population growth rapid industrialization and changing rainfall patterns 1 3 many industries use large quantities of clean water in their processes one of the best ways for industries to have continuous access to clean water is to treat and recycle their wastewater produced water is the water generated in oil and gas extraction processes 4 in the water intensive oil and gas sector the treatment of produced water can prevent environmental problems and provide clean water for other applications the global rate of produced water generation is estimated at more than 39 000 m3 day 5 this water has a complex composition that contains a diverse array of contaminants including salts and hydrocarbons 6 10 total dissolved solids tds have been regarded as the main concern in the produced water for some wells in the united states tds concentrations as great as 400 000 mg l have been reported 11 other major groups of contaminants in produced water are oil grease and btex i e benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes the concentration of benzene and toluene in produced water is in the range of 0 032 778 51 mg l and 0 058 5 86 mg l respectively 5 10 polyaromatic hydrocarbons organic acids phenol calcium magnesium sulfates barium biocides and corrosion inhibitors are other contaminants in produced water 5 some of hydrocarbons in produced water such as benzene and toluene are toxic for humans and the environment benzene is highly carcinogenic 12 14 therefore it is important to remove these compounds before wastewater is discharged into the environment 6 12 13 aside from these toxic compounds produced water also has a very complex composition even within the same well composition may change over time therefore a single treatment process may not be effective for treating produced water and then reusing it for irrigation or industrial purposes 10 a broad literature review of treatment techniques 15 16 for produced water revealed that there are different methods for degradation of organic compounds in wastewater these methods can be classified into three main approaches physical chemical and biological physical methods include adsorption filtration and membrane separation they are high in operating costs and membrane based techniques have fouling problems 13 17 chemical techniques such as electrochemical methods and advanced oxidative processes are generally very expensive and not economical in biological methods like activated sludge treatment and biological aerated filters microorganisms are used to biologically transform or biodegrade organic contaminants to less harmful products selection of suitable microorganisms nutrient availability and ph sensitivity are some of the challenges also due to the low solubility of benzene and toluene in water bioavailability is limited in scope 13 specific to physical processes different membrane based techniques including membrane distillation reverse osmosis micro filtration nano filtration and ultra filtration membrane processes have been suggested 18 implementing these methods for the treatment of produced water has several disadvantages membrane distillation requires pretreatment steps for removing hydrocarbons from produced water 18 other considerable disadvantages are mineral scaling and fouling 11 reverse osmosis has been successful in removing salts and dissolved contaminants from produced water however it has considerable limitations such as high operating pressure and susceptibility to fouling 11 19 micro filtration and ultra filtration membrane processes require periodic cleaning of the membrane therefore a post treatment process is necessary for the generated wastewater prior to disposal nano filtration membrane techniques have high sensitivity toward the composition of produced water and cannot operate at temperatures higher than 45 c 10 in general different membrane techniques are only effective for specific contaminants consequently without adequate suitable pretreatment processes they are not effective for produced water treatment for more detailed information on challenges in using membrane based techniques for produced water treatment see the review study 20 another physical technique is adsorption some studies have been conducted on the adsorption treatment of produced water this method has a high retention time and produces waste i e used adsorbents accordingly it is not efficient for high concentration or highly contaminated wastewater streams adsorption can be used as a pretreatment process for other techniques 21 biological techniques such as activated sludge are simpler and cheaper however their main disadvantage is producing a large amount of sludge at the end of the process as well as requiring large size filters 19 22 chemical process such as advanced oxidation is another technique the fenton process using h2o2 and ozonation process are some of the well known advanced oxidation processes these techniques are either very expensive or have disadvantages such as the requirement of managing the generated sludge and operating at low ph 5 in summary conventional water treatment techniques are not efficient for treating produced water the main concerns are fouling high treatment costs the requirement of pretreatment or post treatment processes and high operating pressure furthermore when using membrane techniques contaminants are merely transferred to a secondary wastewater stream which necessitates the need for post treatment see review studies 5 10 in this study hdh was used in a novel water treatment process to selectively condense water from a contaminated gaseous mixture the principle of this method is the capacity of air to carry large amounts of water as vapor this capacity increases significantly at higher temperatures 23 the hdh method has been used successfully in water desalination and producing freshwater from seawater 24 in water desalination during the humidification process water vapor is added to dry air while salts remain in the original stream then in the subsequent dehumidification water vapor is condensed producing desalinated water one of the critical issues in management of hdh desalination technology is the adverse impacts of discharging large volume of residual brine to environment one way to resolve this problem is minimizing the discharge flow by recirculating a portion of brine flow 25 however hdh has significant advantages including possibility of operating with low grade energy simple construction and inexpensive maintenance another advantage is feasibility of using sustainable energy sources such as solar and geothermal as an example using geothermal energy sources the hdh process can produce a large rate of freshwater at a low cost of 2 1 m3 26 hdh systems can also be operated by heat pumps 27 another advantage is that hdh systems are applicable to decentralized and small scale water production 28 all these characteristics make hdh an economical and environmentally friendly technology specially for small scale processes 29 a suitable way for removing contaminants from produced water or wastewater is to selectively separate water in a process analogous to hdh many studies have been conducted on using the hdh system for water desalination 30 31 a modified hdh process may be a good choice for water remediation due to its low maintenance cost and the potential for using low grade heat and renewable energy sources 32 33 in this study a novel hdh system is introduced for treating highly contaminated water rather than only water desalination 34 few studies have investigated the use of hdh in water treatment p gao et al 35 proposed a solar energy driven hdh system for the treatment of coal mine wastewater they provided a mathematical model for their system to evaluate effects of air flow rate and solar radiation intensity on water production r santosh et al 36 developed an hdh system to treat domestic wastewater their idea was to utilize waste heat rejected from an air conditioning unit for the process they defined optimum flow conditions that maximize water productivity in their system k li et al 37 designed a water treatment system based on the hdh process to replace household water filtration systems they investigated the effect of different water temperatures on the performance of their system results from their experiments showed that the system was successful in removing tds in water below 4 mg l however they reported that purified water from their system needed post treatment processes to be potable x li et al 38 carried out experiments using an hdh process for produced water desalination their system could reduce tds and total organic carbons toc of produced water to 76 35 mg l and 17 83 mg l respectively they also investigated the effect of feed water temperature on water productivity per units of time and area in their system they showed that water productivity increases with increase in feed water temperature the maximum water recovery for their system was 20 7 achieved at 80 c there are other similar applications of hdh for example p wang et al 39 used an hdh process to concentrate a biogas slurry which is a by product of biogas plants they studied effects of operating conditions including heating temperature heating time and air flow rate on water removal and nh3 n i e ammonia nitrogen recovery under optimum conditions they could successfully remove 34 12 of water and obtain nh3 n recovery of 98 04 in the works cited thus far the hdh process has been used for wastewater desalination or domestic wastewater treatment to the authors best knowledge no study has been conducted on the use of hdh for treating toxic contaminants in produced water the goal of this study is to investigate the use of a novel hdh system for the removal of different toxic contaminants using benzene and toluene as representative contaminants in the proposed hdh system wastewater and air are mixed through humidification and then dehumidification is conducted the hypothesis behind dehumidification is that water will be preferentially condensed and air will carry the majority of pollutants out of the system the thermodynamic properties of contaminants are listed in table 5 comparing saturation vapor pressures at a constant temperature indicates that benzene and toluene have higher saturation vapor pressure compared to water this explains why benzene and toluene tend to be carried by the air flow in this system accordingly the first important feature of this novel hdh system is that it can be used for purifying water from any volatile organic contaminants with vapor pressure higher than that of water the second feature is that this is a scalable and portable system and its required heat can be obtained from low grade heat and sustainable energy sources such as solar or geothermal energy as well as industrial waste heat in fracking sites and etc in summary using this system not only can tds be removed but the vast majority of toxic contaminants such as benzene and toluene are separated through the air flow simple fabrication process is another advantage of this technique these features make our hdh system a novel attractive option treating highly contaminated water such as produced water and fracking or hydraulic fracturing wastewater which contain numerous different types of organic contaminants in an effort to better understand and optimize the process an experimental facility has been built and key factors explored that affect the removal of contaminants in this study water contaminated with benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol was used as feed water to a new hdh process different compositions in the range of 3 7 wt to 8 wt of total contamination were tested the process was performed for several air to vapor mass ratios between 0 6 and 5 9 and at a fixed water flow rate of 2000 μl min experimental results showed that the hdh process can successfully treat wastewater removing up to 95 of volatile hydrocarbons from a feed water containing 8 wt contaminant it was revealed that increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves the purity of treated water the process was successful in treating highly contaminated mixture it was shown that using a representative mixture of fracking wastewater as feed to the process water with high purity of 98 3 wt can be achieved 2 the present humidification dehumidification process 2 1 process description the focus of this study is on using our humidification dehumidification process to treat highly contaminated produced water the novel water treatment process can be applied to treat produced water or any highly contaminated water containing salts hydrocarbons and toxic chemicals such as benzene and toluene the process consists of three main units heating zone humidification and selective condensation initially wastewater at a specific flow rate is injected into an evaporator the generated vapor enters a spiral mixer where it mixes with hot air air and vapor pass through the mixer and as a result a gaseous mixture enters a dehumidification section the dehumidification section includes a condensing tube and a cooling jacket the gaseous mixture passing through the condensing tube is indirectly cooled by the coolant the process is carefully controlled so only water condenses while contaminants and carrier air exit the system in this process the relatively higher vapor pressure of volatile compounds enables them to be separated from water by blowing hot air these volatile compounds separate from contaminated flow and exit the system in this study water is selectively condensed from a multicomponent gaseous mixture contaminated with different compounds including benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol an experimental setup was developed to establish the hdh process as simulated in aspen plus 2 2 aspen simulation aspen plus software was used to simulate a process with each unit operation at equilibrium the process flow sheet is depicted in fig 1 a highly contaminated wastewater is the input i e wste wtr stream to the process since this mixture contains salts it is a liquid electrolyte solution therefore elecnrtl is used as the thermodynamic property method in the aspen simulation elecnrtl is the most versatile electrolyte property method that can handle aqueous and mixed solvent systems at any concentration and at low pressures and up to 10 atm in this method the redlich kwong equation of state is used for all vapor phase properties and heats of mixing are calculated using the electrolyte nrtl model 40 the theoretical basis of the model is explained in 40 and the working equations are given in its appendix as shown in fig 1 multiple blocks are used to model each unit of the process the three blocks pond heater 2 and evaporat together represent the heating zone the purpose of the heating zone is to separate solids and dissolved salts as well as less volatile compounds i e species possessing a vapor pressure less than water from raw wastewater i e wste wtr first the wste wtr stream enters the pond and is preheated to 60 c using low grade heat that can be supplied from any waste heat in the system heated wastewater leaving the pond enters heater 2 which operates at 112 c and 1 atm the output stream from heater 2 is sent to a flash column i e evaporat to separate the vapor phase all salts are separated and exit with a small portion of water in the bottom stream i e salts vapor exiting from the top of the column i e feed is transferred to the humidification unit in the humidification unit which is simulated by heater 1 and mixer the contaminated vapor stream i e feed enters the mixer where it mixes with a flow of hot air at 126 c the resulting gaseous mixture i e gas mix exits the humidification section at 120 c this stream is transferred to the dehumidification i e dehumid section which is modeled as a flash column operating at 30 c and 1 atm 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup a laboratory apparatus was constructed to simulate the hdh process fig 2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup in this apparatus contaminated liquid water i e feed water is injected through a syringe pump component 1 in figs 2 and 4 into an evaporator component 2 in figs 2 and 4 the evaporator includes two cartridge heaters 1500 w each in parallel configuration to ensure enough heating power for generating a vapor stream at a temperature above 110 c to avoid unwanted condensation it also includes a water channel shown in fig 3 which is a horizontal passage drilled in an aluminum bar and an inkbird pid temperature controllers component 8 in fig 4 steam generated in the evaporator is directed to a stainless steel inline pipe static mixer from the other side air passes through a gas mass flow controller component 5 in figs 2 and 4 and then enters the air heater component 4 in figs 2 and 4 the air heater design is similar to the evaporator the mixing zone component 3 in figs 2 and 4 is a static mixer installed in the pipeline it has no moving parts and requires no external power source as air and vapor streams pass over the mixer fixed spiral blades guarantee their mixing the mixing zone is large enough to ensure full mixing of contaminants and carrier air supplementary heat is provided to the mixing zone by installing an ultra high temperature heater for pipe 156 w below the mixer is the dehumidification section component 6 in figs 2 and 4 where condensed water accumulates at the bottom and air carrying contaminants exits through the gas outlet component 7 in figs 2 and 4 the dehumidification section consists of a vertical vessel wherein the gaseous mixture flows through a cooling jacket with surface area of 475 cm2 where circulating coolant dissipates the latent heat of condensation the gas outlet and a valve to store the condensed water this apparatus allows for examining effects of different operating conditions such as temperature and mass flow rates on the separation of contaminants treated water quality and water recovery fig 4 shows the hdh experimental setup under the fume hood table 1 provides detailed information about each component and their specifications 3 2 experimental methodology different feed compositions were used to test the performance of the hdh process in the first phase experiments a mixture of water and 2 propanol 8 wt was used as the feed in this set of experiments a flow of 2000 μl min feed water was injected into the evaporator and the generated vapor was mixed with air at 120 c air flow rate was varied in the range of 1 slpm to 9 7 slpm dehumidification temperature was maintained at 59 5 c operating conditions for these experiments are tabulated in table 3 the condensate was analyzed by gas chromatography gc gas chromatography gc analysis was performed on a trace 1310 gas chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with a flame ionization detector fid a vf 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the temperature program was 1 min hold at 30 c 6 c min from 30 to 110 c 2 min hold at 110 c he was used as carrier gas in a typical analysis 0 5 μl of the liquid sample was injected by a triplus rsh autosampler the response factors of the analytes i e benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol were calibrated by injection of aqueous solutions of known concentrations all samples included an internal standard of ethanol to analyze the gas phase composition a quantitative gas analyzer qga was employed to provide real time chemical measurement during the experiment the qga is a mass spectrometer that allows for monitoring the concentration of each component in the air flow exiting the dehumidification section for each component qga detector provides signals which are proportional to the partial pressure of the component in the gas mixture flow in a multicomponent gas mixture wherein ideal gas law is valid by knowing the mole flow rate of one of the species the mole flow rate of other species can be obtained from signal values provided by qga in other words signal ratio of two components is proportional to their mole ratio in a gaseous flow this proportionality is linear and to define the corresponding relation i e calibration plot qga was employed to measure generated signals for different species in flows with different molar concentration of the species the obtained relation between signal ratio and mole ratio was used for quantifying the amount of each species in the gas outlet during experiments with quantitative results from both the gas and liquid phases a mass balance relative to the inlet feed conditions could be performed for each species the maximum error in mass balance was 15 and mean absolute error mae was 9 comparison of experimental results at different air flow rates revealed that at higher air flow rates qga results have smaller error therefore mass balance error is less this is because higher air flow rates improve mixing and diminish the chance of condensation at the gas outlet these two are important factors that ensure the accuracy of qga technique using gas chromatography capable of detecting chemicals in concentration as small as 1 ppm it was possible to quantify the purity of condensate samples i e treated water from all experiments in the second phase experiments the experimental setup ran a multicomponent mixture for this purpose a feed solution with a composition containing 0 05 wt benzene 0 03 wt toluene and 8 wt 2 propanol in water was used feed water and air at flow rates of 805 μl min and 2 slpm respectively entered the setup to maintain the air to vapor mass ratio equal to 3 the dehumidification temperature during this test was 30 c finally a representative composition of fracking wastewater as shown in table 6 was used to perform the experiment under the same operating conditions 3 3 instrument and uncertainty analysis during experiments temperatures and flow rates were measured with proper instruments while velocity and air to vapor mass ratio were calculated using measured data the feed water flow rate was measure and controlled using a new era programmable single syringe pump model ne 1000 the dispensing accuracy of the pump is 1 an alicat gas mass flow controller with an accuracy of 0 6 of reading was used to measure and control air flow rates the dehumidification temperature was measured using a type k thermocouple with an accuracy of 0 75 and a response time as fast as 0 3 s two other thermocouples of the same type were used to measure the temperatures of vapor and air vapor mixture at the exit of the evaporator and in the mixing zone respectively a thermocouple type k with an accuracy of 2 2 c was used to measure the air temperature at the outlet of air heater kline and mcclintock s technique provided in the journal of heat transfer 41 was used to estimate the uncertainty of calculated parameters such as velocity and air to vapor mass ratio knowing volumetric flow rates from measured data the velocity of the gaseous flow along the tube with an inner diameter of 10 92 mm can be obtained from eq 1 1 v q a where v is velocity q is the volumetric flow rate and a is the cross sectional area the uncertainty propagated to the velocity can be obtained from eq 2 2 u v v q u q 2 v a u a 2 where u q and u a are uncertainties of measured volumetric flow rate and area respectively each of these uncertainties is calculated from eq 3 3 u u 0 2 u c 2 where u 0 is half of the resolution and u c is the absolute accuracy of the instrument uncertainties of measured experimental data and calculated parameters are shown as error bars on plots table 2 presents uncertainty in different parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 binary feed mixture the first set of experiments were conducted to study the effect of varied air flow rate on the separation of contaminant and water condensation rate in these experiments a binary mixture of water and 2 propanol 8 wt was used as feed water table 3 shows the operating conditions for the experiments as the results shown in fig 5 indicate increasing air flow rate improved the separation of 2 propanol from water according to quantitative analysis of the exiting gas flow by increasing air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 the fraction of separated 2 propanol through the air was improved from 43 to more than 96 of the initial amount aspen simulation results were then compared with those experimental results as shown in fig 5 experimental results have the same trend as aspen results however numbers from the aspen model show larger residual 2 propanol in treated water at the lowest air flow rate 1 slpm the experimental result is 44 smaller than the estimated values by aspen by increasing the air flow rate this difference also increased at the highest flow rate 9 7 slpm the experimental result has difference of 77 of aspen result this is because aspen results represent an equilibrium state of the mixture at a given operating condition whereas in the experiments the gaseous mixture has a limited residence time in the dehumidification section a shorter residence time combined with the flow dynamics has a direct effect on the composition of the treated water accordingly experimental results were observed to have lower mass fraction of residual contaminant in the treated water compared to the equilibrium state i e aspen results even though increasing air flow rate or increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves the purity of treated water it significantly reduces the condensation rate in the dehumidification section the larger air to vapor mass ratio is the smaller water recovery rate is for a feed water flow rate of 2000 μl min and constant dehumidification temperature of 59 5 c by increasing the air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 water recovery decreases from 82 to 40 this is because by increasing air to vapor ratio the dew point temperature of the air vapor mixture decreases therefore at the same dehumidification temperature less amount of water condenses fig 6 illustrates this trade off between a larger recovery rate and a higher water purity experiment results plotted in fig 6 help identify the optimum operating condition in this study the intersection of the two plots was chosen to specify the optimum air to vapor mass ratio therefore in all subsequent experiments vapor and air flow rates were selected as to maintain an air to vapor mass ratio equal to 3 for each of the above experiments a mass balance analysis was conducted for each component figs 7 and 8 show 2 propanol and water mass balance analysis respectively on each plot black dashes represent total initial amount of the corresponding component in feed water from the total amount of each component i e 100 of the component in feed water a fraction remains in treated water i e condensate and the rest exit the system through the exiting gas the percentage of component in the condensate and the exiting gas are marked with gray and white respectively error bars indicate the experimental errors for mass balance if there was no error total mass of each component i e 100 of the component in the feed should be equal to the summation of percentage of component in gas and condensate the difference between these values is the experimental error and has been illustrated with error bars the maximum error in mass balance was 15 and mean absolute error mae was 9 as explained above by increasing the air flow rate less error is observed for 2 propanol mass balance analysis however the error of water mass balance analysis is independent of the air flow rate this is mainly because the humidity ratio of air entering the system varies between experiments to minimize this error the humidity ratio of the air was measured at the beginning of each experiment but the variation in the humidity ratio during the experiment was not under control 4 2 multicomponent feed mixture the second phase experiments focused on a multicomponent feed mixture for this purpose an aqueous feed solution containing benzene toluene and 2 propanol was used it was important to use a completely miscible one phase solution as feed to avoid potential experimental error due to pre separation of compounds creation of two liquid phases therefore aspen software was used to determine maximum solubility of benzene and toluene in feed solution the composition presented in table 4 is determined based on the aspen results table 4 also shows the operating conditions and experimental results from using the multicomponent mixture as feed water to the setup in this experiment feed water with flow rate of 805 μl min was injected to the evaporator as explained in section 4 1 the optimum air to vapor mass ratio in the binary feed mixture experiments for the studied conditions was found to be 3 accordingly in the multicomponent mixture experiments air flow rate was selected such that air to vapor mass ratio is maintained at 3 dehumidification temperature was 30 c according to experimental results 43 7 wt of the initial contaminants were separated through the air also the concentrations of toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene were less than 2 ppm in the treated water water recovery as much 88 of feed water was achieved fig 9 shows mass balance analysis for different components in the multicomponent feed mixture experiments on this plot black dashes represent initial mass of the corresponding component in feed water from total initial amount of each component in the feed i e 100 of the component in the feed a fraction remains in the treated water i e condensate and the rest exit the system through the exiting gas the percentage of component in the condensate and the exiting gas are marked with gray and white respectively error bars indicate the experimental errors for mass balance if there was no error total mass of each component i e 100 of the component in the feed should be equal to the summation of percentage of component in gas and condensate the difference between these values is the experimental error and has been illustrated with error bars mass balances for water 2 propanol and toluene have been satisfied and the error is less than 3 for these components experimental error in benzene mass balance analysis is 29 the larger error for benzene is due to higher uncertainty of the qga calibration for benzene detection in the gas outlet to improve the accuracy of qga analysis different detectors including faraday and secondary electron multiplier sem detectors were examined it was found that sem detector is more appropriate for benzene and toluene which have very small concentrations in the exiting gas in this study reported values for benzene and toluene in mass balance analysis are based on results from sem detector for detecting other gases 2 propanol and water vapor faraday detector was employed 4 3 fracking wastewater representative composition in the third phase experiments a representative composition of fracking wastewater 42 was considered as the feed input to the process shown in fig 1 in order to perform the hdh experiments it was required to estimate the composition of vapor stream that exits the heating zone and mixes with air the validated aspen model was used to determine this composition table 6 shows the representative composition of fracking wastewater i e process input stream as well as the feed stream composition based on these modeling results feed water solutions i e feed stream were prepared for performing hdh experiments comparing representative and feed compositions indicated that as wastewater passed through the heating zone all salts and a great fraction of ethylene glycol were removed however there was a small increase in the mass fraction of other compounds this was due to the absence of salts at the outlet of the heating zone furthermore a fraction of water remained as liquid in the heating zone thus total mass of the flow was decreased according to the experimental results by running the feed solution through the hdh process 56 of total contaminants were separated through the carrier air concentrations of toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene were less than 2 ppm in treated water that being said more than 99 of residual contaminants in treated water were the less volatile compounds i e ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol accordingly the hdh process was very successful in removing hazardous volatile contaminants from the representative fracking wastewater but only 26 of less volatile compounds were removed from water thermodynamic properties of contaminants and water are listed in table 5 as it was explained in section 2 2 the hdh process was also simulated in aspen see fig 1 as gaseous mixture passes through the dehumid section temperature reduces and condensate forms the temperature at which first drop of liquid forms is called dew point assuming ideal mixture dew point can be calculated using dalton s and raoult s law at operating condition of 1 atm gas mix stream has dew point temperature equal to 80 c by reducing temperature below the dew point more liquid condenses composition of condensed liquid varies with reducing temperature fig 10 shows how concentrations of benzene and toluene in the condensed liquid change with temperature in the simulated process for fracking representative mixture dehumid operates at 25 c which is 54 c bellow the dew point of gas mix stream the bottom output from the dehumid is treated water according to aspen results the purity of treated water is 97 8 wt the total fraction of benzene and toluene in the treated water is less than 25 ppm the top output from the dehumid is air carrying more than 99 of initial toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene and 11 of less volatile chemicals table 7 shows the comparison between experimental and aspen results as discussed before results from the aspen model show larger residual contaminants in the treated water for benzene and toluene experimental results for the residual amounts in treated water were respectively 84 and 80 less than the corresponding equilibrium state estimated by aspen model for the less volatile compounds ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol experimental values were 32 and 13 less than aspen results respectively fig 11 depicts the above illustrating a comparison between the experiment results and equilibrium states obtained from aspen in this figure experiment result for each component has been normalized to the corresponding equilibrium condition i e aspen results this difference is because aspen results represent an equilibrium state of the multiphase mixture at a given operating condition whereas in the experimental setup the gaseous mixture has a limited residence time in the dehumidification section as explained before shorter residence time and changes in flow dynamics due to an increase in flow rate velocity affect the composition of treated water therefore there is a clear advantage in operating at non equilibrium conditions accordingly there were lower mass fractions of residual contaminants observed in the water treated through the experimental setup compared to what was estimated for the equilibrium state process conditions and input data used in the simulation are also tabulated in table 7 5 levelized cost of water lcow and techno economic analysis tea a sophisticated techno economic analysis tea model was developed for estimating the levelized cost of water lcow for each us state based on the rate of electricity available thermal and electrical energy labor required permits construction cost and inflation rate over the life of the plant public data on the current treatment and disposal cost of oil and gas o g wastewater are scarce and unreliable most of the produced water generated in the oilfield is injected in underground disposal wells that can be expensive costing about 0 3 10 per barrel 1 88 62 89 m3 43 however these numbers do not capture the environmental and health costs caused by inadequate treatment of fracking wastewater when freshwater is used in fracturing operations the total water cost varies with different oilfield locations table 8 shows the price of water for some oil and gas operations the in house tea model for the proposed technology estimated 3 05 m3 lcow for the state of texas table 9 also the financial assessment of the plant estimated 27m of revenue over the life of the project for tx fig 12 the average lcow for us operations was estimated at 3 5 m3 our average lcow 3 5 m3 is significantly lower than the average price of freshwater for the o g industry compare to 12 5 106 9 m3 47 and highly competitive with underground reinjection compare to 1 88 62 89 m3 48 the model can perform the same calculations for any us state it should be mentioned that the lcow varies with the operation location for example when freshwater is used in fracturing operations the total cost can include the acquisition cost of the freshwater transportation cost to ship the freshwater to the job sites transportation cost to ship the flowback water produced water to the disposal facilities and the disposal cost of the flowback water produced water the proposed process potentially can eliminate the mentioned associated cost 6 conclusion in this study humidification dehumidification was used to treat water contaminated with different organic contaminants it was shown that using a flow of non condensable gas like air can separate toxic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene and other organic contaminants by sweeping them from contaminated water vapor experiments were performed to test the hdh process for treating water contaminated with different chemicals including benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol in the hdh process hot air was mixed with contaminated water vapor and then in a subsequent dehumidification section water was selectively condensed out of a multicomponent gaseous mixture gas chromatography was employed to test clean water purity also a quantitative gas analyzer was used to close the mass balance for each component by real time monitoring of each component in the exiting airflow quantitative analysis showed that increasing airflow rate improves the separation of contaminants from the gaseous mixture however it also reduced water recovery rates a parametric study was conducted to determine the optimum air to vapor mass ratio that maximizes both water recovery and water purity it was found that for the airflow rates in the range of 1 slpm to 9 7 slpm and a constant feedwater flow rate of 2000 μl min an air to vapor mass ratio of 3 is the optimum ratio that leads to 62 water recovery and removal of 71 of contaminants from water operating at dehumidification temperature of 59 5 c maximum removal of up to 95 of the total initial contaminant was achieved in the binary feed mixture experiments experiment results showed that as much as 99 wt of hazardous contaminants including benzene and toluene can be removed from the representative mixture of fracking wastewater this study illustrates the difference between multicomponent species separation under both equilibrium and non equilibrium states even small changes in flow dynamics and residence time can have a large impact on species separation future research will focus on quantifying how exactly flow properties affect separation and how to correlate separation enhancement with

13350,rapid expansion of the unconventional oil and gas extraction has increased american energy independence but also led to increased production of large amounts of contaminated water wastewater from the oil and gas industry contains a wide range of contaminants injecting such contaminated water into disposal wells or discharging it to the environment jeopardizes freshwater resources conventional and membrane based wastewater treatment techniques are often not effective choices to treat highly contaminated wastewater however a suitable way to remove contaminants from wastewater is to selectively separate water in a process analogous to humidification dehumidification hdh only a few studies have investigated the use of hdh for wastewater treatment in this study a novel hdh system is introduced for treating highly contaminated water such as oil and gas flowback and produced water in this hdh process a non condensable gas such as air mixes with wastewater vapor to facilitate the separation of contaminants as a result clean water condenses from the multicomponent gaseous mixture while air carries organic contaminants out of the dehumidification section a laboratory apparatus was constructed and experiments were performed to investigate the hdh process for wastewater treatment and to study the effects of flow dynamics including air flow rate on the composition of treated water different contaminants including benzene toluene 2 propanol and 2 butoxyethanol were tested experimental results showed that the system can be successfully applied for removing volatile and or toxic organic contaminants from wastewater a representative multicomponent mixture of fracking wastewater was successfully treated using the experimental setup and clean water with quality of 98 3 was obtained it was revealed that increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves purity of treated water quantitative analysis showed that by increasing the air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 the fraction of separated 2 propanol through the air was improved from 43 to more than 96 of the initial amount aspen software was employed to simulate equilibrium conditions experimental results were observed to have lower mass fraction of residual contaminant in the treated water compared to equilibrium state keywords wastewater treatment humidification dehumidification selective condensation oil and gas extraction 1 introduction freshwater resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to population growth rapid industrialization and changing rainfall patterns 1 3 many industries use large quantities of clean water in their processes one of the best ways for industries to have continuous access to clean water is to treat and recycle their wastewater produced water is the water generated in oil and gas extraction processes 4 in the water intensive oil and gas sector the treatment of produced water can prevent environmental problems and provide clean water for other applications the global rate of produced water generation is estimated at more than 39 000 m3 day 5 this water has a complex composition that contains a diverse array of contaminants including salts and hydrocarbons 6 10 total dissolved solids tds have been regarded as the main concern in the produced water for some wells in the united states tds concentrations as great as 400 000 mg l have been reported 11 other major groups of contaminants in produced water are oil grease and btex i e benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes the concentration of benzene and toluene in produced water is in the range of 0 032 778 51 mg l and 0 058 5 86 mg l respectively 5 10 polyaromatic hydrocarbons organic acids phenol calcium magnesium sulfates barium biocides and corrosion inhibitors are other contaminants in produced water 5 some of hydrocarbons in produced water such as benzene and toluene are toxic for humans and the environment benzene is highly carcinogenic 12 14 therefore it is important to remove these compounds before wastewater is discharged into the environment 6 12 13 aside from these toxic compounds produced water also has a very complex composition even within the same well composition may change over time therefore a single treatment process may not be effective for treating produced water and then reusing it for irrigation or industrial purposes 10 a broad literature review of treatment techniques 15 16 for produced water revealed that there are different methods for degradation of organic compounds in wastewater these methods can be classified into three main approaches physical chemical and biological physical methods include adsorption filtration and membrane separation they are high in operating costs and membrane based techniques have fouling problems 13 17 chemical techniques such as electrochemical methods and advanced oxidative processes are generally very expensive and not economical in biological methods like activated sludge treatment and biological aerated filters microorganisms are used to biologically transform or biodegrade organic contaminants to less harmful products selection of suitable microorganisms nutrient availability and ph sensitivity are some of the challenges also due to the low solubility of benzene and toluene in water bioavailability is limited in scope 13 specific to physical processes different membrane based techniques including membrane distillation reverse osmosis micro filtration nano filtration and ultra filtration membrane processes have been suggested 18 implementing these methods for the treatment of produced water has several disadvantages membrane distillation requires pretreatment steps for removing hydrocarbons from produced water 18 other considerable disadvantages are mineral scaling and fouling 11 reverse osmosis has been successful in removing salts and dissolved contaminants from produced water however it has considerable limitations such as high operating pressure and susceptibility to fouling 11 19 micro filtration and ultra filtration membrane processes require periodic cleaning of the membrane therefore a post treatment process is necessary for the generated wastewater prior to disposal nano filtration membrane techniques have high sensitivity toward the composition of produced water and cannot operate at temperatures higher than 45 c 10 in general different membrane techniques are only effective for specific contaminants consequently without adequate suitable pretreatment processes they are not effective for produced water treatment for more detailed information on challenges in using membrane based techniques for produced water treatment see the review study 20 another physical technique is adsorption some studies have been conducted on the adsorption treatment of produced water this method has a high retention time and produces waste i e used adsorbents accordingly it is not efficient for high concentration or highly contaminated wastewater streams adsorption can be used as a pretreatment process for other techniques 21 biological techniques such as activated sludge are simpler and cheaper however their main disadvantage is producing a large amount of sludge at the end of the process as well as requiring large size filters 19 22 chemical process such as advanced oxidation is another technique the fenton process using h2o2 and ozonation process are some of the well known advanced oxidation processes these techniques are either very expensive or have disadvantages such as the requirement of managing the generated sludge and operating at low ph 5 in summary conventional water treatment techniques are not efficient for treating produced water the main concerns are fouling high treatment costs the requirement of pretreatment or post treatment processes and high operating pressure furthermore when using membrane techniques contaminants are merely transferred to a secondary wastewater stream which necessitates the need for post treatment see review studies 5 10 in this study hdh was used in a novel water treatment process to selectively condense water from a contaminated gaseous mixture the principle of this method is the capacity of air to carry large amounts of water as vapor this capacity increases significantly at higher temperatures 23 the hdh method has been used successfully in water desalination and producing freshwater from seawater 24 in water desalination during the humidification process water vapor is added to dry air while salts remain in the original stream then in the subsequent dehumidification water vapor is condensed producing desalinated water one of the critical issues in management of hdh desalination technology is the adverse impacts of discharging large volume of residual brine to environment one way to resolve this problem is minimizing the discharge flow by recirculating a portion of brine flow 25 however hdh has significant advantages including possibility of operating with low grade energy simple construction and inexpensive maintenance another advantage is feasibility of using sustainable energy sources such as solar and geothermal as an example using geothermal energy sources the hdh process can produce a large rate of freshwater at a low cost of 2 1 m3 26 hdh systems can also be operated by heat pumps 27 another advantage is that hdh systems are applicable to decentralized and small scale water production 28 all these characteristics make hdh an economical and environmentally friendly technology specially for small scale processes 29 a suitable way for removing contaminants from produced water or wastewater is to selectively separate water in a process analogous to hdh many studies have been conducted on using the hdh system for water desalination 30 31 a modified hdh process may be a good choice for water remediation due to its low maintenance cost and the potential for using low grade heat and renewable energy sources 32 33 in this study a novel hdh system is introduced for treating highly contaminated water rather than only water desalination 34 few studies have investigated the use of hdh in water treatment p gao et al 35 proposed a solar energy driven hdh system for the treatment of coal mine wastewater they provided a mathematical model for their system to evaluate effects of air flow rate and solar radiation intensity on water production r santosh et al 36 developed an hdh system to treat domestic wastewater their idea was to utilize waste heat rejected from an air conditioning unit for the process they defined optimum flow conditions that maximize water productivity in their system k li et al 37 designed a water treatment system based on the hdh process to replace household water filtration systems they investigated the effect of different water temperatures on the performance of their system results from their experiments showed that the system was successful in removing tds in water below 4 mg l however they reported that purified water from their system needed post treatment processes to be potable x li et al 38 carried out experiments using an hdh process for produced water desalination their system could reduce tds and total organic carbons toc of produced water to 76 35 mg l and 17 83 mg l respectively they also investigated the effect of feed water temperature on water productivity per units of time and area in their system they showed that water productivity increases with increase in feed water temperature the maximum water recovery for their system was 20 7 achieved at 80 c there are other similar applications of hdh for example p wang et al 39 used an hdh process to concentrate a biogas slurry which is a by product of biogas plants they studied effects of operating conditions including heating temperature heating time and air flow rate on water removal and nh3 n i e ammonia nitrogen recovery under optimum conditions they could successfully remove 34 12 of water and obtain nh3 n recovery of 98 04 in the works cited thus far the hdh process has been used for wastewater desalination or domestic wastewater treatment to the authors best knowledge no study has been conducted on the use of hdh for treating toxic contaminants in produced water the goal of this study is to investigate the use of a novel hdh system for the removal of different toxic contaminants using benzene and toluene as representative contaminants in the proposed hdh system wastewater and air are mixed through humidification and then dehumidification is conducted the hypothesis behind dehumidification is that water will be preferentially condensed and air will carry the majority of pollutants out of the system the thermodynamic properties of contaminants are listed in table 5 comparing saturation vapor pressures at a constant temperature indicates that benzene and toluene have higher saturation vapor pressure compared to water this explains why benzene and toluene tend to be carried by the air flow in this system accordingly the first important feature of this novel hdh system is that it can be used for purifying water from any volatile organic contaminants with vapor pressure higher than that of water the second feature is that this is a scalable and portable system and its required heat can be obtained from low grade heat and sustainable energy sources such as solar or geothermal energy as well as industrial waste heat in fracking sites and etc in summary using this system not only can tds be removed but the vast majority of toxic contaminants such as benzene and toluene are separated through the air flow simple fabrication process is another advantage of this technique these features make our hdh system a novel attractive option treating highly contaminated water such as produced water and fracking or hydraulic fracturing wastewater which contain numerous different types of organic contaminants in an effort to better understand and optimize the process an experimental facility has been built and key factors explored that affect the removal of contaminants in this study water contaminated with benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol was used as feed water to a new hdh process different compositions in the range of 3 7 wt to 8 wt of total contamination were tested the process was performed for several air to vapor mass ratios between 0 6 and 5 9 and at a fixed water flow rate of 2000 μl min experimental results showed that the hdh process can successfully treat wastewater removing up to 95 of volatile hydrocarbons from a feed water containing 8 wt contaminant it was revealed that increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves the purity of treated water the process was successful in treating highly contaminated mixture it was shown that using a representative mixture of fracking wastewater as feed to the process water with high purity of 98 3 wt can be achieved 2 the present humidification dehumidification process 2 1 process description the focus of this study is on using our humidification dehumidification process to treat highly contaminated produced water the novel water treatment process can be applied to treat produced water or any highly contaminated water containing salts hydrocarbons and toxic chemicals such as benzene and toluene the process consists of three main units heating zone humidification and selective condensation initially wastewater at a specific flow rate is injected into an evaporator the generated vapor enters a spiral mixer where it mixes with hot air air and vapor pass through the mixer and as a result a gaseous mixture enters a dehumidification section the dehumidification section includes a condensing tube and a cooling jacket the gaseous mixture passing through the condensing tube is indirectly cooled by the coolant the process is carefully controlled so only water condenses while contaminants and carrier air exit the system in this process the relatively higher vapor pressure of volatile compounds enables them to be separated from water by blowing hot air these volatile compounds separate from contaminated flow and exit the system in this study water is selectively condensed from a multicomponent gaseous mixture contaminated with different compounds including benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol an experimental setup was developed to establish the hdh process as simulated in aspen plus 2 2 aspen simulation aspen plus software was used to simulate a process with each unit operation at equilibrium the process flow sheet is depicted in fig 1 a highly contaminated wastewater is the input i e wste wtr stream to the process since this mixture contains salts it is a liquid electrolyte solution therefore elecnrtl is used as the thermodynamic property method in the aspen simulation elecnrtl is the most versatile electrolyte property method that can handle aqueous and mixed solvent systems at any concentration and at low pressures and up to 10 atm in this method the redlich kwong equation of state is used for all vapor phase properties and heats of mixing are calculated using the electrolyte nrtl model 40 the theoretical basis of the model is explained in 40 and the working equations are given in its appendix as shown in fig 1 multiple blocks are used to model each unit of the process the three blocks pond heater 2 and evaporat together represent the heating zone the purpose of the heating zone is to separate solids and dissolved salts as well as less volatile compounds i e species possessing a vapor pressure less than water from raw wastewater i e wste wtr first the wste wtr stream enters the pond and is preheated to 60 c using low grade heat that can be supplied from any waste heat in the system heated wastewater leaving the pond enters heater 2 which operates at 112 c and 1 atm the output stream from heater 2 is sent to a flash column i e evaporat to separate the vapor phase all salts are separated and exit with a small portion of water in the bottom stream i e salts vapor exiting from the top of the column i e feed is transferred to the humidification unit in the humidification unit which is simulated by heater 1 and mixer the contaminated vapor stream i e feed enters the mixer where it mixes with a flow of hot air at 126 c the resulting gaseous mixture i e gas mix exits the humidification section at 120 c this stream is transferred to the dehumidification i e dehumid section which is modeled as a flash column operating at 30 c and 1 atm 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup a laboratory apparatus was constructed to simulate the hdh process fig 2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup in this apparatus contaminated liquid water i e feed water is injected through a syringe pump component 1 in figs 2 and 4 into an evaporator component 2 in figs 2 and 4 the evaporator includes two cartridge heaters 1500 w each in parallel configuration to ensure enough heating power for generating a vapor stream at a temperature above 110 c to avoid unwanted condensation it also includes a water channel shown in fig 3 which is a horizontal passage drilled in an aluminum bar and an inkbird pid temperature controllers component 8 in fig 4 steam generated in the evaporator is directed to a stainless steel inline pipe static mixer from the other side air passes through a gas mass flow controller component 5 in figs 2 and 4 and then enters the air heater component 4 in figs 2 and 4 the air heater design is similar to the evaporator the mixing zone component 3 in figs 2 and 4 is a static mixer installed in the pipeline it has no moving parts and requires no external power source as air and vapor streams pass over the mixer fixed spiral blades guarantee their mixing the mixing zone is large enough to ensure full mixing of contaminants and carrier air supplementary heat is provided to the mixing zone by installing an ultra high temperature heater for pipe 156 w below the mixer is the dehumidification section component 6 in figs 2 and 4 where condensed water accumulates at the bottom and air carrying contaminants exits through the gas outlet component 7 in figs 2 and 4 the dehumidification section consists of a vertical vessel wherein the gaseous mixture flows through a cooling jacket with surface area of 475 cm2 where circulating coolant dissipates the latent heat of condensation the gas outlet and a valve to store the condensed water this apparatus allows for examining effects of different operating conditions such as temperature and mass flow rates on the separation of contaminants treated water quality and water recovery fig 4 shows the hdh experimental setup under the fume hood table 1 provides detailed information about each component and their specifications 3 2 experimental methodology different feed compositions were used to test the performance of the hdh process in the first phase experiments a mixture of water and 2 propanol 8 wt was used as the feed in this set of experiments a flow of 2000 μl min feed water was injected into the evaporator and the generated vapor was mixed with air at 120 c air flow rate was varied in the range of 1 slpm to 9 7 slpm dehumidification temperature was maintained at 59 5 c operating conditions for these experiments are tabulated in table 3 the condensate was analyzed by gas chromatography gc gas chromatography gc analysis was performed on a trace 1310 gas chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with a flame ionization detector fid a vf 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the temperature program was 1 min hold at 30 c 6 c min from 30 to 110 c 2 min hold at 110 c he was used as carrier gas in a typical analysis 0 5 μl of the liquid sample was injected by a triplus rsh autosampler the response factors of the analytes i e benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol were calibrated by injection of aqueous solutions of known concentrations all samples included an internal standard of ethanol to analyze the gas phase composition a quantitative gas analyzer qga was employed to provide real time chemical measurement during the experiment the qga is a mass spectrometer that allows for monitoring the concentration of each component in the air flow exiting the dehumidification section for each component qga detector provides signals which are proportional to the partial pressure of the component in the gas mixture flow in a multicomponent gas mixture wherein ideal gas law is valid by knowing the mole flow rate of one of the species the mole flow rate of other species can be obtained from signal values provided by qga in other words signal ratio of two components is proportional to their mole ratio in a gaseous flow this proportionality is linear and to define the corresponding relation i e calibration plot qga was employed to measure generated signals for different species in flows with different molar concentration of the species the obtained relation between signal ratio and mole ratio was used for quantifying the amount of each species in the gas outlet during experiments with quantitative results from both the gas and liquid phases a mass balance relative to the inlet feed conditions could be performed for each species the maximum error in mass balance was 15 and mean absolute error mae was 9 comparison of experimental results at different air flow rates revealed that at higher air flow rates qga results have smaller error therefore mass balance error is less this is because higher air flow rates improve mixing and diminish the chance of condensation at the gas outlet these two are important factors that ensure the accuracy of qga technique using gas chromatography capable of detecting chemicals in concentration as small as 1 ppm it was possible to quantify the purity of condensate samples i e treated water from all experiments in the second phase experiments the experimental setup ran a multicomponent mixture for this purpose a feed solution with a composition containing 0 05 wt benzene 0 03 wt toluene and 8 wt 2 propanol in water was used feed water and air at flow rates of 805 μl min and 2 slpm respectively entered the setup to maintain the air to vapor mass ratio equal to 3 the dehumidification temperature during this test was 30 c finally a representative composition of fracking wastewater as shown in table 6 was used to perform the experiment under the same operating conditions 3 3 instrument and uncertainty analysis during experiments temperatures and flow rates were measured with proper instruments while velocity and air to vapor mass ratio were calculated using measured data the feed water flow rate was measure and controlled using a new era programmable single syringe pump model ne 1000 the dispensing accuracy of the pump is 1 an alicat gas mass flow controller with an accuracy of 0 6 of reading was used to measure and control air flow rates the dehumidification temperature was measured using a type k thermocouple with an accuracy of 0 75 and a response time as fast as 0 3 s two other thermocouples of the same type were used to measure the temperatures of vapor and air vapor mixture at the exit of the evaporator and in the mixing zone respectively a thermocouple type k with an accuracy of 2 2 c was used to measure the air temperature at the outlet of air heater kline and mcclintock s technique provided in the journal of heat transfer 41 was used to estimate the uncertainty of calculated parameters such as velocity and air to vapor mass ratio knowing volumetric flow rates from measured data the velocity of the gaseous flow along the tube with an inner diameter of 10 92 mm can be obtained from eq 1 1 v q a where v is velocity q is the volumetric flow rate and a is the cross sectional area the uncertainty propagated to the velocity can be obtained from eq 2 2 u v v q u q 2 v a u a 2 where u q and u a are uncertainties of measured volumetric flow rate and area respectively each of these uncertainties is calculated from eq 3 3 u u 0 2 u c 2 where u 0 is half of the resolution and u c is the absolute accuracy of the instrument uncertainties of measured experimental data and calculated parameters are shown as error bars on plots table 2 presents uncertainty in different parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 binary feed mixture the first set of experiments were conducted to study the effect of varied air flow rate on the separation of contaminant and water condensation rate in these experiments a binary mixture of water and 2 propanol 8 wt was used as feed water table 3 shows the operating conditions for the experiments as the results shown in fig 5 indicate increasing air flow rate improved the separation of 2 propanol from water according to quantitative analysis of the exiting gas flow by increasing air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 the fraction of separated 2 propanol through the air was improved from 43 to more than 96 of the initial amount aspen simulation results were then compared with those experimental results as shown in fig 5 experimental results have the same trend as aspen results however numbers from the aspen model show larger residual 2 propanol in treated water at the lowest air flow rate 1 slpm the experimental result is 44 smaller than the estimated values by aspen by increasing the air flow rate this difference also increased at the highest flow rate 9 7 slpm the experimental result has difference of 77 of aspen result this is because aspen results represent an equilibrium state of the mixture at a given operating condition whereas in the experiments the gaseous mixture has a limited residence time in the dehumidification section a shorter residence time combined with the flow dynamics has a direct effect on the composition of the treated water accordingly experimental results were observed to have lower mass fraction of residual contaminant in the treated water compared to the equilibrium state i e aspen results even though increasing air flow rate or increasing the air to vapor mass ratio improves the purity of treated water it significantly reduces the condensation rate in the dehumidification section the larger air to vapor mass ratio is the smaller water recovery rate is for a feed water flow rate of 2000 μl min and constant dehumidification temperature of 59 5 c by increasing the air to vapor mass ratio from 0 6 to 5 9 water recovery decreases from 82 to 40 this is because by increasing air to vapor ratio the dew point temperature of the air vapor mixture decreases therefore at the same dehumidification temperature less amount of water condenses fig 6 illustrates this trade off between a larger recovery rate and a higher water purity experiment results plotted in fig 6 help identify the optimum operating condition in this study the intersection of the two plots was chosen to specify the optimum air to vapor mass ratio therefore in all subsequent experiments vapor and air flow rates were selected as to maintain an air to vapor mass ratio equal to 3 for each of the above experiments a mass balance analysis was conducted for each component figs 7 and 8 show 2 propanol and water mass balance analysis respectively on each plot black dashes represent total initial amount of the corresponding component in feed water from the total amount of each component i e 100 of the component in feed water a fraction remains in treated water i e condensate and the rest exit the system through the exiting gas the percentage of component in the condensate and the exiting gas are marked with gray and white respectively error bars indicate the experimental errors for mass balance if there was no error total mass of each component i e 100 of the component in the feed should be equal to the summation of percentage of component in gas and condensate the difference between these values is the experimental error and has been illustrated with error bars the maximum error in mass balance was 15 and mean absolute error mae was 9 as explained above by increasing the air flow rate less error is observed for 2 propanol mass balance analysis however the error of water mass balance analysis is independent of the air flow rate this is mainly because the humidity ratio of air entering the system varies between experiments to minimize this error the humidity ratio of the air was measured at the beginning of each experiment but the variation in the humidity ratio during the experiment was not under control 4 2 multicomponent feed mixture the second phase experiments focused on a multicomponent feed mixture for this purpose an aqueous feed solution containing benzene toluene and 2 propanol was used it was important to use a completely miscible one phase solution as feed to avoid potential experimental error due to pre separation of compounds creation of two liquid phases therefore aspen software was used to determine maximum solubility of benzene and toluene in feed solution the composition presented in table 4 is determined based on the aspen results table 4 also shows the operating conditions and experimental results from using the multicomponent mixture as feed water to the setup in this experiment feed water with flow rate of 805 μl min was injected to the evaporator as explained in section 4 1 the optimum air to vapor mass ratio in the binary feed mixture experiments for the studied conditions was found to be 3 accordingly in the multicomponent mixture experiments air flow rate was selected such that air to vapor mass ratio is maintained at 3 dehumidification temperature was 30 c according to experimental results 43 7 wt of the initial contaminants were separated through the air also the concentrations of toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene were less than 2 ppm in the treated water water recovery as much 88 of feed water was achieved fig 9 shows mass balance analysis for different components in the multicomponent feed mixture experiments on this plot black dashes represent initial mass of the corresponding component in feed water from total initial amount of each component in the feed i e 100 of the component in the feed a fraction remains in the treated water i e condensate and the rest exit the system through the exiting gas the percentage of component in the condensate and the exiting gas are marked with gray and white respectively error bars indicate the experimental errors for mass balance if there was no error total mass of each component i e 100 of the component in the feed should be equal to the summation of percentage of component in gas and condensate the difference between these values is the experimental error and has been illustrated with error bars mass balances for water 2 propanol and toluene have been satisfied and the error is less than 3 for these components experimental error in benzene mass balance analysis is 29 the larger error for benzene is due to higher uncertainty of the qga calibration for benzene detection in the gas outlet to improve the accuracy of qga analysis different detectors including faraday and secondary electron multiplier sem detectors were examined it was found that sem detector is more appropriate for benzene and toluene which have very small concentrations in the exiting gas in this study reported values for benzene and toluene in mass balance analysis are based on results from sem detector for detecting other gases 2 propanol and water vapor faraday detector was employed 4 3 fracking wastewater representative composition in the third phase experiments a representative composition of fracking wastewater 42 was considered as the feed input to the process shown in fig 1 in order to perform the hdh experiments it was required to estimate the composition of vapor stream that exits the heating zone and mixes with air the validated aspen model was used to determine this composition table 6 shows the representative composition of fracking wastewater i e process input stream as well as the feed stream composition based on these modeling results feed water solutions i e feed stream were prepared for performing hdh experiments comparing representative and feed compositions indicated that as wastewater passed through the heating zone all salts and a great fraction of ethylene glycol were removed however there was a small increase in the mass fraction of other compounds this was due to the absence of salts at the outlet of the heating zone furthermore a fraction of water remained as liquid in the heating zone thus total mass of the flow was decreased according to the experimental results by running the feed solution through the hdh process 56 of total contaminants were separated through the carrier air concentrations of toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene were less than 2 ppm in treated water that being said more than 99 of residual contaminants in treated water were the less volatile compounds i e ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol accordingly the hdh process was very successful in removing hazardous volatile contaminants from the representative fracking wastewater but only 26 of less volatile compounds were removed from water thermodynamic properties of contaminants and water are listed in table 5 as it was explained in section 2 2 the hdh process was also simulated in aspen see fig 1 as gaseous mixture passes through the dehumid section temperature reduces and condensate forms the temperature at which first drop of liquid forms is called dew point assuming ideal mixture dew point can be calculated using dalton s and raoult s law at operating condition of 1 atm gas mix stream has dew point temperature equal to 80 c by reducing temperature below the dew point more liquid condenses composition of condensed liquid varies with reducing temperature fig 10 shows how concentrations of benzene and toluene in the condensed liquid change with temperature in the simulated process for fracking representative mixture dehumid operates at 25 c which is 54 c bellow the dew point of gas mix stream the bottom output from the dehumid is treated water according to aspen results the purity of treated water is 97 8 wt the total fraction of benzene and toluene in the treated water is less than 25 ppm the top output from the dehumid is air carrying more than 99 of initial toxic contaminants i e benzene and toluene and 11 of less volatile chemicals table 7 shows the comparison between experimental and aspen results as discussed before results from the aspen model show larger residual contaminants in the treated water for benzene and toluene experimental results for the residual amounts in treated water were respectively 84 and 80 less than the corresponding equilibrium state estimated by aspen model for the less volatile compounds ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol experimental values were 32 and 13 less than aspen results respectively fig 11 depicts the above illustrating a comparison between the experiment results and equilibrium states obtained from aspen in this figure experiment result for each component has been normalized to the corresponding equilibrium condition i e aspen results this difference is because aspen results represent an equilibrium state of the multiphase mixture at a given operating condition whereas in the experimental setup the gaseous mixture has a limited residence time in the dehumidification section as explained before shorter residence time and changes in flow dynamics due to an increase in flow rate velocity affect the composition of treated water therefore there is a clear advantage in operating at non equilibrium conditions accordingly there were lower mass fractions of residual contaminants observed in the water treated through the experimental setup compared to what was estimated for the equilibrium state process conditions and input data used in the simulation are also tabulated in table 7 5 levelized cost of water lcow and techno economic analysis tea a sophisticated techno economic analysis tea model was developed for estimating the levelized cost of water lcow for each us state based on the rate of electricity available thermal and electrical energy labor required permits construction cost and inflation rate over the life of the plant public data on the current treatment and disposal cost of oil and gas o g wastewater are scarce and unreliable most of the produced water generated in the oilfield is injected in underground disposal wells that can be expensive costing about 0 3 10 per barrel 1 88 62 89 m3 43 however these numbers do not capture the environmental and health costs caused by inadequate treatment of fracking wastewater when freshwater is used in fracturing operations the total water cost varies with different oilfield locations table 8 shows the price of water for some oil and gas operations the in house tea model for the proposed technology estimated 3 05 m3 lcow for the state of texas table 9 also the financial assessment of the plant estimated 27m of revenue over the life of the project for tx fig 12 the average lcow for us operations was estimated at 3 5 m3 our average lcow 3 5 m3 is significantly lower than the average price of freshwater for the o g industry compare to 12 5 106 9 m3 47 and highly competitive with underground reinjection compare to 1 88 62 89 m3 48 the model can perform the same calculations for any us state it should be mentioned that the lcow varies with the operation location for example when freshwater is used in fracturing operations the total cost can include the acquisition cost of the freshwater transportation cost to ship the freshwater to the job sites transportation cost to ship the flowback water produced water to the disposal facilities and the disposal cost of the flowback water produced water the proposed process potentially can eliminate the mentioned associated cost 6 conclusion in this study humidification dehumidification was used to treat water contaminated with different organic contaminants it was shown that using a flow of non condensable gas like air can separate toxic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene and other organic contaminants by sweeping them from contaminated water vapor experiments were performed to test the hdh process for treating water contaminated with different chemicals including benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol in the hdh process hot air was mixed with contaminated water vapor and then in a subsequent dehumidification section water was selectively condensed out of a multicomponent gaseous mixture gas chromatography was employed to test clean water purity also a quantitative gas analyzer was used to close the mass balance for each component by real time monitoring of each component in the exiting airflow quantitative analysis showed that increasing airflow rate improves the separation of contaminants from the gaseous mixture however it also reduced water recovery rates a parametric study was conducted to determine the optimum air to vapor mass ratio that maximizes both water recovery and water purity it was found that for the airflow rates in the range of 1 slpm to 9 7 slpm and a constant feedwater flow rate of 2000 μl min an air to vapor mass ratio of 3 is the optimum ratio that leads to 62 water recovery and removal of 71 of contaminants from water operating at dehumidification temperature of 59 5 c maximum removal of up to 95 of the total initial contaminant was achieved in the binary feed mixture experiments experiment results showed that as much as 99 wt of hazardous contaminants including benzene and toluene can be removed from the representative mixture of fracking wastewater this study illustrates the difference between multicomponent species separation under both equilibrium and non equilibrium states even small changes in flow dynamics and residence time can have a large impact on species separation future research will focus on quantifying how exactly flow properties affect separation and how to correlate separation enhancement with

13351,currently electrolyzed water a sustainable and environmentally friendly disinfectant produced through electrolysis of an acid or salt has become very popular because of its applications in various sectors such as health agriculture and food influencing factors are important for optimizing the electrolyzed water production process and maximizing application efficiency factors that influence the production and efficiency of electrolyzed water including water and electrolyte properties electrode material current storage and application factors were reviewed in this study moreover some commercially available generator models their specifications and issues are discussed along with future recommendations this work summarizes the available literature from january 2000 to december 2020 reporting studies that can assist in understanding various parameters affecting the production and stability of electrolyzed water this can provide further insights and aid researchers in optimizing the process and address the issues faced by the existing systems by offering new perspectives in future studies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords available chlorine concentration disinfectant electrolyzed water free chlorine hypochlorous acid sanitizer 1 introduction with the rise in different disease causing pathogens in recent years effective disinfection has become important in controlling pathogens in various sectors in particular the recent covid 19 pandemic has forced researchers to find economically feasible and environmentally friendly disinfectants although several disinfectants have been extensively used constraints such as chemical residues low efficiency cost and impact on the environment have been cited 1 electrolyzed water ew is widely accepted as a practical disinfectant because it does not make use of hazardous chemical substances and processes 2 studies have shown that ew has gained immense popularity because of its ease of production and application therefore it has been extensively applied in food sanitization 1 10 environmental sanitization 11 livestock farming 12 18 and medical sterilization 19 23 ew is generated by the electrolysis of sodium chloride nacl in an electrolysis chamber with a membrane or diaphragm between the negative and positive electrodes of the generator 24 however recent studies have shown novel electrolysis generators that have no diaphragms separating the anode and cathode the emergence of membrane less reactors is linked to the problems associated with electrolysis systems such as the risk of reactor malfunction due to membrane fouling membrane cost and device durability which directly increases reactor maintenance and lifespan 25 membrane less reactors contrastingly have several principal advantages over the membrane containing types first membrane less reactors lessen the concerns of long device assemble steps material cost and complexity of reactor this allows the manufacture of reactors with basically three vital components the device body anode and cathode 26 secondly while membrane containing reactors usually have constraints associated with the type of electrolyte membrane less ones can be electrolyte agnostic they can function using a variety of aqueous conductive electrolytes 27 this flexibility is possible because ionic conduction across the electrolyte gap between the anode and cathode is relatively unaffected by electrolyte ions and ph this versatility favors the production of acidic slightly acidic alkaline and neutral ews 28 one major problem reported to be associated with electrolysis systems with membranes is the vulnerability of the membranes to exhibit ohmic resistance in the presence of cation impurities which are sometimes introduced into the reactor through device component leach or feed water 29 membrane less reactors however have the potential to be impurity tolerant and withstand extreme operating conditions that would otherwise affect a membrane this makes membrane less reactors potentially resilient devices with long operational lifespans 27 furthermore the weak acidic species of ew makes membrane less reactors a very attractive option in the single celled chamber electrolysis of hydrochloric acid hcl or nacl results in the production of slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew with a ph range of 5 0 6 5 30 at this ph range chlorine is present as hypochlorous acid hocl an efficient germicidal compound that is 80 times more effective than an equivalent concentration of hypochlorite ion clo 31 generators that produce saew and neutral electrolyzed water new using hcl or salt in combination with hcl as a booster have also emerged the use of acid in these generators complicates the electrolysis process compared to the relatively less cumbersome method of using nacl as an electrolyte however electrolysis of hcl is helpful in terms of corrosion prevention when salt is applied as an electrolyte 32 33 in the method that uses only salt a major advantage is that the ew produced is non toxic to humans and environmentally friendly therefore it can be applied in food industries sanitizing surfaces and cleaning 34 the disadvantage of using salt as an electrolyte is the corrosion of generator parts with long term use 35 the most commonly used electrolytes in ew production are chlorides of sodium and magnesium making metal components mostly electrodes of the reactor susceptible to electrochemical corrosion these hygroscopic salts raise the conductivity of moisture on reactor metal components and speed up the corrosion process by reacting with the metals during electrolysis corrosion occurs especially at the anode of some reactors because of the oxidation process at the anode 36 some metal compounds such as zinc and titanium can also leach from the electrodes to react with the salts accumulation of deposits from electrochemical corrosion in membrane containing reactors limits the ion exchange process between the anode and the cathode consequently limiting chlorine device efficiency 37 the literature presents a list of commercially available ew generators that have been used in different studies the manufacturers of ew generators recognize the influence of the operating parameters on the output of the generators in response to this some ew generator manufacturers provide buyers with preset user specifications these specifications include but are not limited to the desired amperage or voltage free chlorine concentration and adjustable feed water flow rate for instance ew generator manufacturers such as hoshizaki nippon intek amano and ecoloxtech provide generators that automatically adjust the flow rate voltage or amperage according to the desired hocl concentration selected by the buyer 38 the efficacy of ew is highly dependent on the stable concentration of hocl which depends on several factors and operational parameters 36 therefore it is essential to understand the parameters influencing ew production to maximize the production and efficiency of ew generators hence this review seeks to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the factors and parameters that affect the production and quality of ews the aim is to discuss the literature focused on influencing parameters including 1 electrolyte properties 2 water characteristics 3 electrolysis reactor operational parameters and electrode material 4 storage and application of disinfectants in terms of hocl stability 5 commercially available ew generators and their specifications and 6 problems and future recommendations for economic and environmental sustainability of ew generators this article provides insights about ew from production to stability and application efficiency of hocl in ew and draws reasonable conclusions to provide a complete understanding of the overall impact of these parameters on ew and provide a guide for the development of newer systems 1 1 ew types and some recent applications different ew types can be generated based on the kind of ew device electrolyte and electrolysis parameters ew can be divided into acidic electrolyzed water aew neutral electrolyzed water new and basic alkaline electrolyzed water bew 39 however other novel forms such as slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew weak acidic ew waew have emerged acidic ew aew is generated at the anode with clo hocl hcl cl and o2 it has a low ph of 2 3 5 oxidation reduction potential orp 1100 mv and free chlorine concentration of 10 90 ppm 38 aew has strong sanitizer properties and its antimicrobial efficiency is the synergistic effect of active free chlorine and low ph to alter the cell membrane structure of pathogens 40 while the higher antimicrobial efficacy of aew is desirable for food product sanitization concerns about the quality and nutritive properties of food products have been raised when used at sub optimal ph values 41 the volatility of aew also allows the loss of cl gas from aew which in turn reduces its antimicrobial efficacy 8 the high acidic ph of aew increases the susceptibility of metal surfaces to corrosion and this has limited the use of aew in certain applications 42 recent applications of aew have been on meat 43 fish 44 pathogen biofilms 45 46 fruit quality and storage 41 47 slightly acidic ew saew is produced by electrolysis of hcl only or in combination with nacl in a membrane less ew reactor 30 with a ph of 5 0 6 5 and orp of 800 900 ppm its active constituent is hocl 10 80 ppm which has a disinfection efficacy 80 times more than that of an equivalent concentration of clo under similar conditions 48 saew is extensively used in sanitization owing to its high efficacy on a broad spectrum of pathogens and ease of production the ph of saew makes it a preferred sanitizer over aew as it is less corrosive 49 several recent research publications have reported the strong antimicrobial efficacy of saew most of these studies used pure cultures of escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis to assess the efficacy of saew in the deactivation of these pathogens 50 54 preservation of squid 55 disinfection of vegetables 56 57 fruits 58 facility surfaces 59 basic ew bew is produced at the cathode and has a high ph of 10 13 and a lower orp of 800 to 900 mv at the cathode na and oh also react to form naoh 60 the naoh and negative orp provides bew with detergent like characteristics and bacterial inactivation functionality 40 bew is not as significantly researched as compared to the other types of ew nonetheless a few recent have reported the effect of the high ph of bew for the sanitization of food items bew has been used to inactivate yeast and brettanomyces bruxellensis on grapes 61 62 and storage of beefsteak 63 with a ph of 7 8 and an orp of 750 900 mv neutral ew new can be generated using a membrane less reactor or produced from the anode with a partial mix of hydroxide ions 64 the orp and ph of new can be adjusted by varying the reactor settings the active disinfection component of new is primarily hocl and hcl compared to aew new is considered a safer option because of its less corrosive ph higher orp and longer shelf life under particular conditions new has shown higher antimicrobial characteristics when compared with bew 24 new has been used in the antimicrobial reduction of fish 65 pork 66 and fruits 47 with good results on different pathogens 2 methodology 2 1 literature sources and search strategy we conducted an online systematic literature review to find literature according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma protocol fig 1 67 publications were screened on various journal databases using the following keywords electrolyzed water production electrolyzed water generators factors affecting electrolyzed water production stability of electrolyzed water the database sites searched for this work were web of science google scholar science direct wiley online scopus and pubmed articles were considered for this study if they satisfied the following criteria 1 original english research articles 2 published between january 2002 and december 2020 3 focused on ew generators and production and 4 reported influencing factors and examined their impact on ew production a total of 147 articles were found through a database search as presented in fig 1 after the manual screening 96 articles fulfilled the set criteria and were therefore considered for the final review the bibliographies of the selected articles were further checked for additional references the screened articles were subsequently grouped according to factors that influence ew production hocl stability and efficiency during ew applications 2 2 electrolysis process and influencing factors in ew production the electrolysis of nacl occurs in a chamber containing an anode and cathode by dissociating the salt into sodium ions na and chloride ions cl with the formation of hydroxide oh and hydrogen h ions in the solution as shown in fig 2 the negatively charged oh and cl ions move towards the anode where oxidation occurs to produce hocl clo hcl oxygen gas o2 and chlorine gas cl2 positively charged na and h ions travel to the cathode where they undergo reduction generating sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrogen gas h2 as given in eqs 1 5 therefore two types of ew can be produced simultaneously an acidic solution from the anode and a basic solution from the cathode 24 reactions at the anode 1 2 nacl cl 2 2 na 2 e 2 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 3 cl 2 h 2 o l hocl hcl reactions at the cathode 4 2 nacl 2 oh 2 naoh cl 5 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 oh aq h 2 g in reactors that use hcl as an electrolyte the acid dissociates into h and cl ions at the start of electrolysis the negatively charged cl ions are attracted to the anode where they undergo oxidation to release cl2 cl2 mixes with the water in the reactor to form hocl and hcl concurrently the positively charged h moves to the cathode to undergo reduction to release h2 as shown in eqs 6 8 reactions at the anode 6 2 cl aq cl 2 g 2 e 7 cl 2 h 2 o l hocl hcl reaction at the cathode 8 2 h aq 2 e h 2 g the influencing factors for ew production were classified based on feed water characteristics and electrolyte properties electrode material used in the electrolysis reactor operating conditions storage and application parameters as shown in fig 2 further insights showed the main parameters during the production of ew included feed water hardness organic matter temperature ph concentration and type of electrolyte feed water flow rate electric current voltage and the flow rate of electrolyte in terms of the ew efficiency and hocl stability ph orp temperature and storage environment were considered important factors 3 factors affecting ew production and application efficiency there are several reports in the literature regarding the effects of the factors mentioned above on the physicochemical properties of ew however the properties of the solution which define germicidal efficacy are influenced by several factors such as feed water characteristics electrode material and operating parameters such as electric current electrolyte water flowrates and electrolyte concentration type as shown in fig 3 after ew production storage is another factor that affects its potency these factors are discussed individually in the subsequent sections 3 1 effect of feed water characteristics on ew production 3 1 1 effect of water hardness in recent years few researchers have investigated and reported the impact of water hardness on the properties and antimicrobial efficacy of ew water hardness is an important factor that positively affects the ew properties and its sanitizing efficacy 11 calcium and magnesium carbonates are primarily the cause of water hardness hardness forming metallic cations such as calcium and magnesium present in water can react with electrodes leading to deposition of sediments that can affect current density in the electrolytic cell 68 when bicarbonate ions are present during the electrolysis process the deposition reaction is accelerated through the formation of caco3 precipitate in the solution and on reactor metal parts especially on electrodes the caco3 formation is facilitated by increasing calcium bicarbonate ions concentration and the water flow rates due to the mass exchange process occurring at the electrode surface the total concentration of chlorine generated during the electrolysis process is affected by the accumulation of deposits on electrodes and the by reactions of chlorine with ca2 and mg2 ions present in the solution 69 pangloli and hung 70 stated that hardness influences the available chlorine concentration acc ph and orp of ew eventually affecting the disinfection efficiency they observed that increasing the water hardness increased the values of acc and orp with a decrease in the ew ph resulting in a decreased germicidal potential the observed acc increase was attributed to the high concentration of electrolyte molecules and conductivity resulting from the increased water hardness forghani et al 30 also showed that the hardness of water is crucial for the production and enhancement of ew properties they studied the influence of water hardness on the characteristics of ew and reported a decrease in ph as the water hardness increased the increased hardness of the water might have enhanced the concentration and conductivity of the electrolyte solution thereby increasing the acc in the ew hsu 71 stated that water hardness could be optimized by varying parameters such as the concentration of electrolytes or a combination of electrolytes to achieve improved ew production kim et al 72 investigated the influence of water hardness on saew produced from the tap and underground water the results indicated that tap water with caco3 hardness of 29 mg l exhibited better potential to generate saew efficiently than underground water with caco3 hardness of 12 mg l with a general ph decrease moreover a combination of hcl and a salt kcl or nacl boosted the hardness of the water resulting in higher acc and lower ph values although water hardness reportedly improved the germicidal efficacy of ew through increased electrolyte concentration and increased orp values the observed decrease in ph is a trend that cannot be ignored 3 1 2 effect of organic matter the germicidal efficiency of ew is highly affected by the reducing agents present in the water medium 73 organic matter is present in the feed water and on the surfaces where ew is applied the free available chlorine deteriorates by reacting with different organic and inorganic substances 74 the efficiency of ew is therefore affected by these substances and the strength of ew is not equal to that of acc organic matter combines with amino acids and ammonia to form n chloro compounds 75 organic compounds containing proteins and carbohydrates result in the deterioration of acc through oxidation and considerably affect the germicidal efficiency of ew 32 although chloramines are oxidators with disinfecting properties like chlorine they exhibit less efficiency due to slower reaction mechanisms despite the slow reaction rate this form of combined chlorine can deactivate microorganisms by invasion of the cell wall and obstructing the organism s metabolism monochloramine is the most effective chloramine at ph values 7 and above and deactivates microorganisms by direct reaction with the amino acids of bacterial dna 76 in the presence of large amounts of organic matter above 3 ppm organic nitrogen reacts with the organic nitrogen to form organic chloramine this type of chloramine has less disinfection characteristics as compared to inorganic chloramines they therefore offer less sanitizing efficiency in the elimination of pathogens 77 we found several reports on the influence of organic substances on chlorinated water tanaka et al 78 in their work stated that in acidic ew free chlorine is converted to the combined form in the presence of organic matter chlorine neutralization in acidic ew can be attributed to organic substances 79 white 80 reported that the reaction of proteins with chlorine leads to the formation of organic chloramines oomori et al 73 studied the effect of organic materials on acc in ew and noticed the removal of free available chlorine they further observed that amino acids reacted with the free available chlorine to form n chloro compounds they concluded that the bactericidal efficacy of ew is reduced when organic matter such as protein containing compounds is present ayebah et al 79 reported that although acidic ew is an efficient sanitizer for food borne germs many factors inhibit the anti microbicidal ability of ew including organic matter concentration this study investigated the effect of acidic ew on the inactivation of l monocytogenes in the presence of an organic contaminant chicken serum they reported a reduction in l monocytogenes by only 0 46 and 0 11 log cfu g 1 ml 1 with 5 and 10 ml serum respectively and a reduced level of l monocytogenes biofilm population with increasing serum concentrations park et al 81 investigated the influence of organic materials on the deactivation of food borne microbes in lettuce and spinach using ew they reported that the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of acidic ew in reducing microbes on lettuce and spinach ogunniyi et al 82 also showed that ew is highly inhibited by increasing organics which affects the efficacy of ew in reducing microbial load they explained that organic materials reduce the efficiency of ew by reducing the concentration of free chlorine chen and hung 83 tested the effect of organic matter on the chlorine demand for lettuce wash water naocl solution and ew they observed a significant increase in chlorine demand p 0 05 with increasing organic matter load and concluded that organic matter has a significant effect on chlorine demand additionally a decrease in ew virucidal effect with increasing organic matter load was reported by fang et al 84 when organic matter is present they recommended higher acc levels and longer contact times for efficient sanitization goda et al 85 investigated the antibacterial action of weakly acidic chlorous water and sodium hypochlorite naclo solution on two pathogens in the presence of proteins they reported that although the germicidal activity of naclo was significantly affected the weakly acidified chlorous water remained comparatively stable in the presence of proteins concluding that weakly acidic chlorous water was a useful disinfectant in inactivating the pathogens in the presence of human excretion contaminants the type of organic matter and the degree of contamination are crucial details to be considered in the optimization of ew production and treatment procedures jo et al 75 tested the influence of different types of organic matter on the acc of saew they reported that although the efficacy of saew was reduced with increased organic matter concentration protein compounds showed a more deteriorating effect on the efficiency of ew compared to carbohydrates and lipids hocl reacts with different types of organic matter during disinfection however the reaction is controlled by the distribution and affinity for the available functional groups of the organic matter and the physico chemical characteristics of the sanitizer 86 amino acids are the major component of organic matter in the formation of organic chloramines during chlorination 87 the type of chloramine formed from a reaction between amines and hocl is determined by the kinds of functional groups present chlorine to organic compound ratio and ph 88 primary and secondary amines react rapidly with hocl to form n chloramines although the introduction of a pre treatment system can reduce the reaction of hocl with organic matter during production reaction during a disinfection process in the presence of a nutrient matrix is of significant concern some measures can however be used to ensure the presence of adequate free chlorine during disinfection these include 1 prewashing of extraneous organic matter on food items 2 use of sanitizers of near neutral ph the sanitization efficacy of free chlorine is dependent on the ph and level of organic matter present with the issues associated with sanitizers of high ph it is advantageous to utilize sanitizers of near neutral ph to achieve optimum disinfection and reduce the formation of chloramine fang et al 84 and jadeja and hung 49 have reported the antimicrobial potential of near neutral electrolyzed water of ph 6 7 in the presence of organic matter 3 replenishing depleted free chlorine in the treatment solution in the food sanitizing industry provision of a continual fixed dose of free chlorine using automated or manual demand based injection systems is a common practice to replenish depleted chlorine to achieve recommended disinfection targets 89 however the procedure should be moderated by using predictive models to prevent hyper chlorination which can lead to the formation of toxic by products 90 3 1 3 effect of feed water ph and temperature among the factors that influence the production of ew in an electrolysis generator ph and temperature of the feed water have received limited attention from researchers during this review we found very few studies that reported the effects of feed water ph and feed water temperature on the production of ew the focus of most of the existing literature was on the effect of ph and temperature during sanitization disinfection efficiency tests however pangloli and hung 70 investigated the effect of feed water hardness by varying its ph they reported that although a significant increase in acc was observed as the ph of the feed water increased from 5 to 7 and then 8 no significant effect was detected on the ph and orp values of the ew produced hsu 71 91 studied the influence of feed water temperature on the ph orp and acc of ew and reported an insignificant effect of feed water temperature on ph and orp with a minor effect on acc levels the authors attributed the low influence of temperature to the small range of temperatures studied further studies are therefore needed to justify the previous work or test whether different results can be achieved by varying the feed water source a summary of the impact of increasing the physicochemical characteristics discussed above on ew production and product properties is illustrated in table 1 3 2 effect of electrolyte properties reactor configuration and operating parameters 3 2 1 effect of electrolyte properties type and concentration the quality of the ew generated can be affected by the choice of electrolyte electrolyte flow rate and concentration various electrolytes including nacl mgcl2 kcl and hcl have been used for the production of ew sodium chloride nacl is the most common electrolyte used in ew production 30 60 64 71 92 however other researchers 60 70 92 have reported the use of other salts such as mgcl2 kcl and hcl instead of nacl the acc is strongly determined by the concentration of the electrolyte rather than the type 71 93 from the literature review although increasing electrolyte concentrations generally improves the concentration of chlorine produced an optimum electrolyte concentration exists for each system at which optimal production is achieved a rise in electrolyte concentration has been reported to enhance electrolytic efficiency and power consumption of the system this is because an increase in electrolyte ions increases current efficiency at the anode with a rise in acc 94 this can be attributed to the relationship between the concentration of chloride ions in solution and the electrode potential of the chlorine evolution reaction when the chloride ions increase the electrode potential decreases and the chlorine production reaction is enhanced the improvement in anode current efficiency further lowers the energy consumption of the reactor the determination of optimum electrolyte concentration values is therefore crucial to increase anode current efficiency and maximize energy consumption 94 hsu 91 reported an increase in the concentrations of na and cl with an increase in the nacl solution flow rate and concentration resulting in high acc production this agrees with whangchai et al 95 who reported an increase in acc with increasing nacl solution concentration they opined that at 5 nacl concentration there were enough electrolyte ions available to undergo an oxidation reaction to produce more chlorine gas forghani et al 30 stated that a higher electrolyte concentration increases chlorine production which enhances the sanitizing ability of ew this was because the increased concentration of electrolyte causes an increase in conductivity with a satisfactory increase in the ph range suitable for the generation of saew several authors have reported a linear correlation between the concentration of salt and the concentration of acc generated by the electrolysis generator 24 92 96 97 kiura et al 97 reported a strong correlation between the amount of salt duration of electrolysis and acc production a study by ezeike and hung 98 reported that a higher orp and acc of ew could be achieved with a higher salt concentration the assessment by 98 is consistent with that of zhang et al 99 who reported an increase in acc and orp with increasing electrolyte concentration kim et al 72 also reported that an increase in the electrolyte hcl nacl concentration resulted in a ph decrease with increasing orp and acc forghani et al 30 reported higher acc levels for higher electrolyte concentrations hcl nacl used in the electrolysis process they explained that a higher electrolyte concentration increased the conductivity and hence improved chlorine generation 3 2 2 effect of electrode material and setting compared to the many parameters that may influence the production of the oxidant ew the most significant parameter is the material from which the electrode is made 100 101 several authors 37 94 100 102 have reported the influence of electrode material type and electrode settings on the properties of the ew produced platinum pt is often used at the anode in ew generators 8 30 103 104 other researchers have used different materials for ew generators 105 hsu et al 37 stated that an electrode material with excellent conductivity has the potential to conduct higher electrical flow of current to boost the ion exchange during the ew electrolysis khalid et al 36 on the contrary recently reported a non significant effect on chlorine production using different electrodes of different electrical conductivity however among the electro catalytic materials used as anodes particularly among the dimensionally stable anodes dsa ir ruo2 coated titanium ti has been reported to exhibit lower corrosion tendencies the efficiency of the conversion of chlorine ions to chlorine gas is in the order ti iro2 ti ruo2 ti pt iro2 bdd boron doped diamond pt 24 106 108 li and kim 105 showed that iridium oxide coated anode and cathode electrodes produced increased amounts of acc compared to ruthenium oxide electrodes under the same working parameters and attributed their results to the higher electro catalytic ability of iridium however zhang et al 99 reported ruo2 iro2 tio2 electrodes as more effective for chlorine production rahman et al 24 reported that the type of material used for the anode affects the production of chlorine and other reactive species such as h2 o2 and o3 hsu et al 37 reported that submersing the electrodes deeper into the solution significantly increases the current density and the reactor s energy consumption capacity the immersion of electrodes deeper into the solution provided better mixing and more effective transport of ions which accelerated the electrolysis process resulting in increased chlorine evolution the rise in the electrolysis process however produced an increase in electric current density which eventually put a strain on the system s energy consumption efficiency an alteration in the electrode size and electrode gap remarkably influenced the electric current and chlorine production they explained that although the use of a half sized electrode substantially lowered the electric current and amount of chlorine produced there was no significant effect on the current efficiency of the system notably a 12 cm gap increase resulted in a significant decrease in electric current and chlorine produced a decrease in electrode size creates a reduction in electrode surface area resulting in a drop in current density and decreased electrolysis rate furthermore widening the electrode gap slows down the movement of ions and decreases electric current density with a subsequent decrease in the rate of chlorine production jafry et al 109 also reported that an increase in the electrode gap results in the introduction of larger quantities of electrolytes which takes considerable time for efficient electrolysis of hcl to hocl thereby reducing the production of acc as per hsu et al 37 the size of electrodes and electrode spacing should be considered when lower concentrations of chlorine are required to maximize energy consumption the characteristics of the different ews produced using electrodes made from different materials are presented in table 2 3 2 3 effect of electric current and water electrolyte flow rate in the production of ew electrolysis parameters such as current and flow rates of water or electrolyte have been reported to affect the overall properties of the ew produced 112 additionally researchers have reported the influence of these parameters 9 24 71 91 park et al 113 also stated that the strength of the current in the generator affects the concentration of available chlorine which further determines the efficacy of the ew generated according to song et al 110 an increase in the current density enhances the chlorine evolution reaction which results in a high acc rahman et al 9 reported the influence of current amperage on the sanitizing power of ew on food borne pathogens in their study an electric current increase from 1 15 to 1 45a increased orp and acc which determines the germicidal efficacy of the ew another study by jafry et al 109 reported a general acc increase with a higher electric current however at a certain level the current increment resulted in an increased production of bubbles which led to a decline in acc levels the authors explained that the decline in acc occurred because the bubble reduced the surface area for an efficient electrolytic reaction hsu 91 reported a general decrease in the efficiency of electrolysis as the water flow rate increased he attributed the decrease in electrolysis efficiency at high water flow rates to shorter residence time and reaction time for the ions in the electrolytic cell in another study hsu 71 reported that increasing the water flow rate resulted in a decrease in the acc and orp of the ew produced hsu 71 opined that the electrolytic cell has a positive correlation between the amount of electrolyte and the sanitizing power of the produced ew this is in agreement with jafry et al s 109 report on the influence of electrolyte flow rate on the free and total chlorine concentrations in the generated ew their study showed an increase in the acc with increasing hcl flow rate however this trend alters beyond a certain flow rate threshold decreasing the acc because of the limited residence time available for electrolysis they recommended an optimized flow rate of 3 ml min at 13 a as the optimal conditions for saew production the electrolyte flow rate used for ew production influences the acc 93 maruyama et al 93 explained that increasing the amount of electrolyte significantly decreased the electrolytic efficiency of the reactor in summary although an increase in acc concentration was observed with increased electrolyte flow rate and current a general decrease in the acc with increasing water flow rate was also observed table 3 shows a simplified illustration of the influence of increasing operation parameters during ew production and characteristics of the final product 3 3 factors affecting application efficiency of produced ew 3 3 1 effect of ew ph on sanitizing efficiency the ph of ew is a significant factor in determining its efficiency as a disinfectant in ew disinfection processes the orp values correlate weakly with acc because they are a measure of two different parameters orp is a measure of oxidative disinfection power while acc is a measure of hocl and clo concentrations moreover orp does not correlate well with acc because ph plays a significant role in the determination of orp and acc values when the ph is high acc occurs in the form of clo and the orp is low therefore acc readings could be high however the orp will decrease because of the high ph orp ph and acc as hocl or clo have a powerful influence on the germicidal efficiency of ew 114 at ph 5 and 6 5 the available chlorine is in its strongest form as hocl 31 at higher ph however hocl dissociates to clo and cl2 gas at low ph values hocl works by penetrating the germ cell membrane and generates hydroxyl radicals destroying the pathogen through oxidation 112 rahman et al 2 found that the antimicrobial efficacy of ew was diminished at ph 9 0 because the orp and acc decreased significantly with an increase in ph from the acidic region of 2 5 to the basic region of 9 0 park et al 115 investigated the effect of acc and ph of aew on the inactivation of l monocytogenes and e coli they observed that within a wide ph range of 3 0 7 0 ew was extremely efficient in retarding pathogenic activity when adequate amounts of acc were present they attributed the ews ability to reduce the bacterial population to ph which increases the susceptibility of the external coat of the pathogens to hocl chen and hung 83 also evaluated the effect of ph on the chlorine demand of a naocl solution wash water for lettuce they observed that a rise in ph resulted in a decrease in chlorine demand except for a minor increase from 6 0 to 8 0 and concluded that ph has a significant effect on chlorine demand table 4 summarizes the sanitizing efficiencies of some ew solutions under different ph conditions 3 3 2 effect of orp on the efficiency of produced ew researchers have considered that a high orp is a major factor responsible for the disinfecting action of ew 112 116 117 hocl inactivation of pathogens is a synergistic effect of high orp levels and low ph values of ew 116 118 the high orp results in oxidation affecting the outer layer of microorganisms causing further oxidation reactions and ultimate destruction of the metabolic pathway in the organism s cell leading to inactivation 117 rahman et al 9 reported a 5 0 log cfu ml decrease in pathogens with the use of ew with an orp value range of 500 700 mv koseki et al 120 stated that orp could not be the principal factor responsible for the sanitization process they observed that ozonated water with a higher orp showed lower germicidal efficiency compared with aew which has a lower orp and attributed the strong antibacterial effect of aew to the acc mostly as hocl in addition stevenson et al 121 found total inactivation of bacterial cells with a decrease in orp at less than 848 mv the antimicrobial efficacy of ew largely depends on the optimal concentration of hocl high orp values and optimal low ph levels 48 3 3 3 effect of temperature on the efficiency of produced ew the temperature of ew during sanitization has been reported to affect the germicidal efficiency of ew 2 30 31 70 122 fabrizio and cutter 122 stated that the efficacy of aew on pathogens increased at 25 c as opposed to 4 c when they experimented with the efficacy of aew against s typhimurium and l monocytogenes the authors observed a maximum reduction of 8 log cfu ml at 25 c rahman et al 2 reported similar observations after treating e coli s typhimurium s aureus and l monocytogenes for approximately a min at temperatures of 4 c and 50 c they observed that at 50 c there was a total reduction in bacterial species of circa 7 42 8 02 log cfu ml this decrease was attributed to a significant increase in the water temperature from 4 c to 50 c other researchers agree with the observation that the sanitizing efficiency of saew improves with increasing temperature 31 123 124 forghani et al 30 reported that preheating water at 40 c for saew production slightly increased the acc and antimicrobial efficacy of l monocytogenes and e coli however heating ew after production negatively affected the inactivation efficacy because of the partial loss of chlorine upon heating to 40 c 3 4 factors affecting ew stability 3 4 1 storage environment several studies have reported the effect of storage conditions on ew stability the antimicrobial efficiency of ew is affected by storage conditions attributed to the decomposition of the major antimicrobial component hocl and evaporation of cl2 over time especially when stored under open conditions 8 60 92 125 additionally the physicochemical properties of ew have been reported to undergo drastic changes when stored in both open and closed environments in storage under closed conditions acc is lost in ew via self decomposition however the acc loss in closed environments is less compared to the loss via evaporation under open storage conditions white 80 reported complete chlorine loss in acidic electrolyzed water aew kept in an open environment after 30 h of shaking and in 100 h when not agitated bonde et al 126 reported a decrease in acc of 80 after 2 h of agitation however the orp remained unchanged indicating the presence of other strong oxidizing agents rahman et al 8 investigated the effect of storage on low concentration slightly acidic ew lcsaew under closed and open conditions at ph ranges of 6 8 7 4 they observed a gradual decrease from the initial 10 mg l acc to 0 mg l acc within 7 days in an open dark environment and a decline from 10 mg l acc to 0 mg l in 21 days under closed dark conditions they observed that the ph of the lcsaew stored under both conditions increased after 28 days of storage with a decrease in the orp values the authors also showed that the antimicrobial potential of lcsaew was preserved against l monocytogenes and e coli for 6 days in open and 14 days in closed storage conditions 8 xuan et al 127 also confirmed the assertion that closed dark condition is well suited for ew storage when they researched the changes in ph orp and acc of ew during storage under closed and open conditions saew stored in tight lid containers in the absence of light retained 91 5 of acc after a week whereas 4 2 of acc was lost in another container stored with a loose lid 128 it has also been reported that lower temperatures are conducive to ew storage 129 physicochemical properties of ew stored at 4 c exhibited more stability than ew stored at 25 c and exhibited efficient bactericidal activity for over 12 months 122 129 130 however ew exhibits different properties under diverse storage conditions for example 129 131 reported that new has higher stability than aew throughout the storage period cui et al 131 reported no change in the ph and electrical conductivity of new and aew after 30 days of storage however when aew was kept under open conditions a 22 decrease in orp 52 in do and 100 in acc were observed with a sharp decrease in the bactericidal efficiency of aew the efficiency of new was not significantly affected by the storage conditions moreover hsu and kao 132 reported no change in the orp electrical conductivity and ph of aew during storage however the acc and do content remarkably decreased during storage the authors concluded that ew should be stored in closed containers to avoid chlorine loss waters and hung 133 reported that during long term storage the ph of chlorine based sanitizers should be kept close to neutral because low ph sanitizers are unstable and can lose a significant amount of chlorine during storage in conclusion chlorine loss from ew is mostly due to agitation and storage under open and bright light conditions under these conditions agitation speeds up the mass transfer of chlorine gas at the gas liquid interface resulting in the loss of gas through evaporation table 5 presents an illustrative view of the effect of major factors influencing ew efficiency during application and stability of the ew properties during storage 3 5 commercially available generators and emerging issues the frequency of several studies regarding the production of ew through electrolysis of salt or acid is increasing to meet disinfection demands because of the covid 19 pandemic it is therefore important to find workable and compatible generators in terms of economic viability literature studies have presented some commercially recognized ew generators that have used different electrolytes and operated at different parameters to yield varied acc levels for disinfection a summary of some types of ews produced from these generators and the characteristics of the ew produced are presented in table 6 notably ew generators experience lapses in production consistency using different water sources because of changes in water chemistry most ew reactor electrodes are manufactured from expensive metals which increases the capital cost and corrosion of the electrodes is another problem that needs to be addressed to increase the commercial applications of this process additionally it has been reported that some ew generator models emit chlorine gas when operated at ph 5 96 which can cause discomfort and health related issues to the operator during long term exposure 4 future recommendations the use of ew as a sustainable and green alternative against toxic chemicals has become a common practice for disinfection and sanitization therefore new technologies and generators that are more efficient are emerging regularly owing to the many useful attributes of ew it is rapidly developing as a sanitizer of the future 137 therefore the provision of efficient and cost effective conditions for production is prudent from the review above the authors recommend the following effect of feed water ph and temperature should be an area of interest for research in the production of ew although tap water is the typical source of feed water in ew production the versatility for on site production makes ew more desirable over other disinfectants in situations where the access to tap water is limited and the ph of the available water is of concern or in regions of high temperature values such research will go a long way to enhance ew generation when the feed water contains organics the installation of a pre treatment system is suggested to achieve maximum and steady production water treatment technologies such as ion exchange nanofiltration reverse osmosis microfiltration and ultrafiltration can be utilized for the removal of organic matter in water treatment for ew production however issues relating to economic feasibility pose an obstacle to the implementation of these techniques adsorption presents an advantageous option with its simple design low capital cost and excellent efficiency for electrode manufacture cheaper metals as should be tested for their economic feasibility a recent study by givirovskiy et al 38 reported favorable electrolysis results using stainless steel electrodes stainless steel can therefore be considered in the quest for potentially cost efficient electrode material or for coatings on electrolysis systems regular cleaning and replacement of the electrode connection joint with the power source are encouraged to avoid any disruption in production and to attain a stable product the application of anti corrosion metals as coating agents for connection joints can be considered in future studies further research into new technologies and design of electrolysers that can reduce chlorine gas emissions still be operational in the presence of common contaminants is recommended 5 conclusion this study reviewed the literature to identify the factors that affect the production and application of ew the effects of factors such as feed water characteristics electrolyte properties electrode material storage conditions and operating parameters feed water flow rate electrolyte flow rate and electric current were investigated additionally some commercially available ew generator models their specifications and issues were discussed along with future recommendations for economic feasibility and sustainability this review work found three categories being the most researched and cited in ew literature these are reactor and electrolyte properties operating parameters application and storage parameters with operating parameters reactor and electrolyte properties being the most dominant this is a reflection of the importance of these factors on ew production and application the electrode material type and settings yielded different accs with ti iro2 converting most of the chlorine ions to chlorine gas an increase in the feed water flow rate resulted in a decrease in the acc while a high flow rate of the electrolyte produced more chlorine moreover an increase in the current density resulted in a high acc effective disinfection was found to decrease at higher ph and lower orp values and dark conditions were the best storage options in reducing acc loss water hardness increased orp and acc levels with a decrease in the ph of ew while organic matter presence reduced acc in conclusion although a trend can be established for the influence of the parameters on the production of ew some researchers have reported thresholds within which this trend is curtailed therefore it is imperative to determine the specific thresholds for ew systems in future research credit authorship contribution statement rea retrieved curated data and wrote initial draft my analyzed data reviewed and revised initial draft wl

13351,currently electrolyzed water a sustainable and environmentally friendly disinfectant produced through electrolysis of an acid or salt has become very popular because of its applications in various sectors such as health agriculture and food influencing factors are important for optimizing the electrolyzed water production process and maximizing application efficiency factors that influence the production and efficiency of electrolyzed water including water and electrolyte properties electrode material current storage and application factors were reviewed in this study moreover some commercially available generator models their specifications and issues are discussed along with future recommendations this work summarizes the available literature from january 2000 to december 2020 reporting studies that can assist in understanding various parameters affecting the production and stability of electrolyzed water this can provide further insights and aid researchers in optimizing the process and address the issues faced by the existing systems by offering new perspectives in future studies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords available chlorine concentration disinfectant electrolyzed water free chlorine hypochlorous acid sanitizer 1 introduction with the rise in different disease causing pathogens in recent years effective disinfection has become important in controlling pathogens in various sectors in particular the recent covid 19 pandemic has forced researchers to find economically feasible and environmentally friendly disinfectants although several disinfectants have been extensively used constraints such as chemical residues low efficiency cost and impact on the environment have been cited 1 electrolyzed water ew is widely accepted as a practical disinfectant because it does not make use of hazardous chemical substances and processes 2 studies have shown that ew has gained immense popularity because of its ease of production and application therefore it has been extensively applied in food sanitization 1 10 environmental sanitization 11 livestock farming 12 18 and medical sterilization 19 23 ew is generated by the electrolysis of sodium chloride nacl in an electrolysis chamber with a membrane or diaphragm between the negative and positive electrodes of the generator 24 however recent studies have shown novel electrolysis generators that have no diaphragms separating the anode and cathode the emergence of membrane less reactors is linked to the problems associated with electrolysis systems such as the risk of reactor malfunction due to membrane fouling membrane cost and device durability which directly increases reactor maintenance and lifespan 25 membrane less reactors contrastingly have several principal advantages over the membrane containing types first membrane less reactors lessen the concerns of long device assemble steps material cost and complexity of reactor this allows the manufacture of reactors with basically three vital components the device body anode and cathode 26 secondly while membrane containing reactors usually have constraints associated with the type of electrolyte membrane less ones can be electrolyte agnostic they can function using a variety of aqueous conductive electrolytes 27 this flexibility is possible because ionic conduction across the electrolyte gap between the anode and cathode is relatively unaffected by electrolyte ions and ph this versatility favors the production of acidic slightly acidic alkaline and neutral ews 28 one major problem reported to be associated with electrolysis systems with membranes is the vulnerability of the membranes to exhibit ohmic resistance in the presence of cation impurities which are sometimes introduced into the reactor through device component leach or feed water 29 membrane less reactors however have the potential to be impurity tolerant and withstand extreme operating conditions that would otherwise affect a membrane this makes membrane less reactors potentially resilient devices with long operational lifespans 27 furthermore the weak acidic species of ew makes membrane less reactors a very attractive option in the single celled chamber electrolysis of hydrochloric acid hcl or nacl results in the production of slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew with a ph range of 5 0 6 5 30 at this ph range chlorine is present as hypochlorous acid hocl an efficient germicidal compound that is 80 times more effective than an equivalent concentration of hypochlorite ion clo 31 generators that produce saew and neutral electrolyzed water new using hcl or salt in combination with hcl as a booster have also emerged the use of acid in these generators complicates the electrolysis process compared to the relatively less cumbersome method of using nacl as an electrolyte however electrolysis of hcl is helpful in terms of corrosion prevention when salt is applied as an electrolyte 32 33 in the method that uses only salt a major advantage is that the ew produced is non toxic to humans and environmentally friendly therefore it can be applied in food industries sanitizing surfaces and cleaning 34 the disadvantage of using salt as an electrolyte is the corrosion of generator parts with long term use 35 the most commonly used electrolytes in ew production are chlorides of sodium and magnesium making metal components mostly electrodes of the reactor susceptible to electrochemical corrosion these hygroscopic salts raise the conductivity of moisture on reactor metal components and speed up the corrosion process by reacting with the metals during electrolysis corrosion occurs especially at the anode of some reactors because of the oxidation process at the anode 36 some metal compounds such as zinc and titanium can also leach from the electrodes to react with the salts accumulation of deposits from electrochemical corrosion in membrane containing reactors limits the ion exchange process between the anode and the cathode consequently limiting chlorine device efficiency 37 the literature presents a list of commercially available ew generators that have been used in different studies the manufacturers of ew generators recognize the influence of the operating parameters on the output of the generators in response to this some ew generator manufacturers provide buyers with preset user specifications these specifications include but are not limited to the desired amperage or voltage free chlorine concentration and adjustable feed water flow rate for instance ew generator manufacturers such as hoshizaki nippon intek amano and ecoloxtech provide generators that automatically adjust the flow rate voltage or amperage according to the desired hocl concentration selected by the buyer 38 the efficacy of ew is highly dependent on the stable concentration of hocl which depends on several factors and operational parameters 36 therefore it is essential to understand the parameters influencing ew production to maximize the production and efficiency of ew generators hence this review seeks to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the factors and parameters that affect the production and quality of ews the aim is to discuss the literature focused on influencing parameters including 1 electrolyte properties 2 water characteristics 3 electrolysis reactor operational parameters and electrode material 4 storage and application of disinfectants in terms of hocl stability 5 commercially available ew generators and their specifications and 6 problems and future recommendations for economic and environmental sustainability of ew generators this article provides insights about ew from production to stability and application efficiency of hocl in ew and draws reasonable conclusions to provide a complete understanding of the overall impact of these parameters on ew and provide a guide for the development of newer systems 1 1 ew types and some recent applications different ew types can be generated based on the kind of ew device electrolyte and electrolysis parameters ew can be divided into acidic electrolyzed water aew neutral electrolyzed water new and basic alkaline electrolyzed water bew 39 however other novel forms such as slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew weak acidic ew waew have emerged acidic ew aew is generated at the anode with clo hocl hcl cl and o2 it has a low ph of 2 3 5 oxidation reduction potential orp 1100 mv and free chlorine concentration of 10 90 ppm 38 aew has strong sanitizer properties and its antimicrobial efficiency is the synergistic effect of active free chlorine and low ph to alter the cell membrane structure of pathogens 40 while the higher antimicrobial efficacy of aew is desirable for food product sanitization concerns about the quality and nutritive properties of food products have been raised when used at sub optimal ph values 41 the volatility of aew also allows the loss of cl gas from aew which in turn reduces its antimicrobial efficacy 8 the high acidic ph of aew increases the susceptibility of metal surfaces to corrosion and this has limited the use of aew in certain applications 42 recent applications of aew have been on meat 43 fish 44 pathogen biofilms 45 46 fruit quality and storage 41 47 slightly acidic ew saew is produced by electrolysis of hcl only or in combination with nacl in a membrane less ew reactor 30 with a ph of 5 0 6 5 and orp of 800 900 ppm its active constituent is hocl 10 80 ppm which has a disinfection efficacy 80 times more than that of an equivalent concentration of clo under similar conditions 48 saew is extensively used in sanitization owing to its high efficacy on a broad spectrum of pathogens and ease of production the ph of saew makes it a preferred sanitizer over aew as it is less corrosive 49 several recent research publications have reported the strong antimicrobial efficacy of saew most of these studies used pure cultures of escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis to assess the efficacy of saew in the deactivation of these pathogens 50 54 preservation of squid 55 disinfection of vegetables 56 57 fruits 58 facility surfaces 59 basic ew bew is produced at the cathode and has a high ph of 10 13 and a lower orp of 800 to 900 mv at the cathode na and oh also react to form naoh 60 the naoh and negative orp provides bew with detergent like characteristics and bacterial inactivation functionality 40 bew is not as significantly researched as compared to the other types of ew nonetheless a few recent have reported the effect of the high ph of bew for the sanitization of food items bew has been used to inactivate yeast and brettanomyces bruxellensis on grapes 61 62 and storage of beefsteak 63 with a ph of 7 8 and an orp of 750 900 mv neutral ew new can be generated using a membrane less reactor or produced from the anode with a partial mix of hydroxide ions 64 the orp and ph of new can be adjusted by varying the reactor settings the active disinfection component of new is primarily hocl and hcl compared to aew new is considered a safer option because of its less corrosive ph higher orp and longer shelf life under particular conditions new has shown higher antimicrobial characteristics when compared with bew 24 new has been used in the antimicrobial reduction of fish 65 pork 66 and fruits 47 with good results on different pathogens 2 methodology 2 1 literature sources and search strategy we conducted an online systematic literature review to find literature according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma protocol fig 1 67 publications were screened on various journal databases using the following keywords electrolyzed water production electrolyzed water generators factors affecting electrolyzed water production stability of electrolyzed water the database sites searched for this work were web of science google scholar science direct wiley online scopus and pubmed articles were considered for this study if they satisfied the following criteria 1 original english research articles 2 published between january 2002 and december 2020 3 focused on ew generators and production and 4 reported influencing factors and examined their impact on ew production a total of 147 articles were found through a database search as presented in fig 1 after the manual screening 96 articles fulfilled the set criteria and were therefore considered for the final review the bibliographies of the selected articles were further checked for additional references the screened articles were subsequently grouped according to factors that influence ew production hocl stability and efficiency during ew applications 2 2 electrolysis process and influencing factors in ew production the electrolysis of nacl occurs in a chamber containing an anode and cathode by dissociating the salt into sodium ions na and chloride ions cl with the formation of hydroxide oh and hydrogen h ions in the solution as shown in fig 2 the negatively charged oh and cl ions move towards the anode where oxidation occurs to produce hocl clo hcl oxygen gas o2 and chlorine gas cl2 positively charged na and h ions travel to the cathode where they undergo reduction generating sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrogen gas h2 as given in eqs 1 5 therefore two types of ew can be produced simultaneously an acidic solution from the anode and a basic solution from the cathode 24 reactions at the anode 1 2 nacl cl 2 2 na 2 e 2 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 3 cl 2 h 2 o l hocl hcl reactions at the cathode 4 2 nacl 2 oh 2 naoh cl 5 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 oh aq h 2 g in reactors that use hcl as an electrolyte the acid dissociates into h and cl ions at the start of electrolysis the negatively charged cl ions are attracted to the anode where they undergo oxidation to release cl2 cl2 mixes with the water in the reactor to form hocl and hcl concurrently the positively charged h moves to the cathode to undergo reduction to release h2 as shown in eqs 6 8 reactions at the anode 6 2 cl aq cl 2 g 2 e 7 cl 2 h 2 o l hocl hcl reaction at the cathode 8 2 h aq 2 e h 2 g the influencing factors for ew production were classified based on feed water characteristics and electrolyte properties electrode material used in the electrolysis reactor operating conditions storage and application parameters as shown in fig 2 further insights showed the main parameters during the production of ew included feed water hardness organic matter temperature ph concentration and type of electrolyte feed water flow rate electric current voltage and the flow rate of electrolyte in terms of the ew efficiency and hocl stability ph orp temperature and storage environment were considered important factors 3 factors affecting ew production and application efficiency there are several reports in the literature regarding the effects of the factors mentioned above on the physicochemical properties of ew however the properties of the solution which define germicidal efficacy are influenced by several factors such as feed water characteristics electrode material and operating parameters such as electric current electrolyte water flowrates and electrolyte concentration type as shown in fig 3 after ew production storage is another factor that affects its potency these factors are discussed individually in the subsequent sections 3 1 effect of feed water characteristics on ew production 3 1 1 effect of water hardness in recent years few researchers have investigated and reported the impact of water hardness on the properties and antimicrobial efficacy of ew water hardness is an important factor that positively affects the ew properties and its sanitizing efficacy 11 calcium and magnesium carbonates are primarily the cause of water hardness hardness forming metallic cations such as calcium and magnesium present in water can react with electrodes leading to deposition of sediments that can affect current density in the electrolytic cell 68 when bicarbonate ions are present during the electrolysis process the deposition reaction is accelerated through the formation of caco3 precipitate in the solution and on reactor metal parts especially on electrodes the caco3 formation is facilitated by increasing calcium bicarbonate ions concentration and the water flow rates due to the mass exchange process occurring at the electrode surface the total concentration of chlorine generated during the electrolysis process is affected by the accumulation of deposits on electrodes and the by reactions of chlorine with ca2 and mg2 ions present in the solution 69 pangloli and hung 70 stated that hardness influences the available chlorine concentration acc ph and orp of ew eventually affecting the disinfection efficiency they observed that increasing the water hardness increased the values of acc and orp with a decrease in the ew ph resulting in a decreased germicidal potential the observed acc increase was attributed to the high concentration of electrolyte molecules and conductivity resulting from the increased water hardness forghani et al 30 also showed that the hardness of water is crucial for the production and enhancement of ew properties they studied the influence of water hardness on the characteristics of ew and reported a decrease in ph as the water hardness increased the increased hardness of the water might have enhanced the concentration and conductivity of the electrolyte solution thereby increasing the acc in the ew hsu 71 stated that water hardness could be optimized by varying parameters such as the concentration of electrolytes or a combination of electrolytes to achieve improved ew production kim et al 72 investigated the influence of water hardness on saew produced from the tap and underground water the results indicated that tap water with caco3 hardness of 29 mg l exhibited better potential to generate saew efficiently than underground water with caco3 hardness of 12 mg l with a general ph decrease moreover a combination of hcl and a salt kcl or nacl boosted the hardness of the water resulting in higher acc and lower ph values although water hardness reportedly improved the germicidal efficacy of ew through increased electrolyte concentration and increased orp values the observed decrease in ph is a trend that cannot be ignored 3 1 2 effect of organic matter the germicidal efficiency of ew is highly affected by the reducing agents present in the water medium 73 organic matter is present in the feed water and on the surfaces where ew is applied the free available chlorine deteriorates by reacting with different organic and inorganic substances 74 the efficiency of ew is therefore affected by these substances and the strength of ew is not equal to that of acc organic matter combines with amino acids and ammonia to form n chloro compounds 75 organic compounds containing proteins and carbohydrates result in the deterioration of acc through oxidation and considerably affect the germicidal efficiency of ew 32 although chloramines are oxidators with disinfecting properties like chlorine they exhibit less efficiency due to slower reaction mechanisms despite the slow reaction rate this form of combined chlorine can deactivate microorganisms by invasion of the cell wall and obstructing the organism s metabolism monochloramine is the most effective chloramine at ph values 7 and above and deactivates microorganisms by direct reaction with the amino acids of bacterial dna 76 in the presence of large amounts of organic matter above 3 ppm organic nitrogen reacts with the organic nitrogen to form organic chloramine this type of chloramine has less disinfection characteristics as compared to inorganic chloramines they therefore offer less sanitizing efficiency in the elimination of pathogens 77 we found several reports on the influence of organic substances on chlorinated water tanaka et al 78 in their work stated that in acidic ew free chlorine is converted to the combined form in the presence of organic matter chlorine neutralization in acidic ew can be attributed to organic substances 79 white 80 reported that the reaction of proteins with chlorine leads to the formation of organic chloramines oomori et al 73 studied the effect of organic materials on acc in ew and noticed the removal of free available chlorine they further observed that amino acids reacted with the free available chlorine to form n chloro compounds they concluded that the bactericidal efficacy of ew is reduced when organic matter such as protein containing compounds is present ayebah et al 79 reported that although acidic ew is an efficient sanitizer for food borne germs many factors inhibit the anti microbicidal ability of ew including organic matter concentration this study investigated the effect of acidic ew on the inactivation of l monocytogenes in the presence of an organic contaminant chicken serum they reported a reduction in l monocytogenes by only 0 46 and 0 11 log cfu g 1 ml 1 with 5 and 10 ml serum respectively and a reduced level of l monocytogenes biofilm population with increasing serum concentrations park et al 81 investigated the influence of organic materials on the deactivation of food borne microbes in lettuce and spinach using ew they reported that the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of acidic ew in reducing microbes on lettuce and spinach ogunniyi et al 82 also showed that ew is highly inhibited by increasing organics which affects the efficacy of ew in reducing microbial load they explained that organic materials reduce the efficiency of ew by reducing the concentration of free chlorine chen and hung 83 tested the effect of organic matter on the chlorine demand for lettuce wash water naocl solution and ew they observed a significant increase in chlorine demand p 0 05 with increasing organic matter load and concluded that organic matter has a significant effect on chlorine demand additionally a decrease in ew virucidal effect with increasing organic matter load was reported by fang et al 84 when organic matter is present they recommended higher acc levels and longer contact times for efficient sanitization goda et al 85 investigated the antibacterial action of weakly acidic chlorous water and sodium hypochlorite naclo solution on two pathogens in the presence of proteins they reported that although the germicidal activity of naclo was significantly affected the weakly acidified chlorous water remained comparatively stable in the presence of proteins concluding that weakly acidic chlorous water was a useful disinfectant in inactivating the pathogens in the presence of human excretion contaminants the type of organic matter and the degree of contamination are crucial details to be considered in the optimization of ew production and treatment procedures jo et al 75 tested the influence of different types of organic matter on the acc of saew they reported that although the efficacy of saew was reduced with increased organic matter concentration protein compounds showed a more deteriorating effect on the efficiency of ew compared to carbohydrates and lipids hocl reacts with different types of organic matter during disinfection however the reaction is controlled by the distribution and affinity for the available functional groups of the organic matter and the physico chemical characteristics of the sanitizer 86 amino acids are the major component of organic matter in the formation of organic chloramines during chlorination 87 the type of chloramine formed from a reaction between amines and hocl is determined by the kinds of functional groups present chlorine to organic compound ratio and ph 88 primary and secondary amines react rapidly with hocl to form n chloramines although the introduction of a pre treatment system can reduce the reaction of hocl with organic matter during production reaction during a disinfection process in the presence of a nutrient matrix is of significant concern some measures can however be used to ensure the presence of adequate free chlorine during disinfection these include 1 prewashing of extraneous organic matter on food items 2 use of sanitizers of near neutral ph the sanitization efficacy of free chlorine is dependent on the ph and level of organic matter present with the issues associated with sanitizers of high ph it is advantageous to utilize sanitizers of near neutral ph to achieve optimum disinfection and reduce the formation of chloramine fang et al 84 and jadeja and hung 49 have reported the antimicrobial potential of near neutral electrolyzed water of ph 6 7 in the presence of organic matter 3 replenishing depleted free chlorine in the treatment solution in the food sanitizing industry provision of a continual fixed dose of free chlorine using automated or manual demand based injection systems is a common practice to replenish depleted chlorine to achieve recommended disinfection targets 89 however the procedure should be moderated by using predictive models to prevent hyper chlorination which can lead to the formation of toxic by products 90 3 1 3 effect of feed water ph and temperature among the factors that influence the production of ew in an electrolysis generator ph and temperature of the feed water have received limited attention from researchers during this review we found very few studies that reported the effects of feed water ph and feed water temperature on the production of ew the focus of most of the existing literature was on the effect of ph and temperature during sanitization disinfection efficiency tests however pangloli and hung 70 investigated the effect of feed water hardness by varying its ph they reported that although a significant increase in acc was observed as the ph of the feed water increased from 5 to 7 and then 8 no significant effect was detected on the ph and orp values of the ew produced hsu 71 91 studied the influence of feed water temperature on the ph orp and acc of ew and reported an insignificant effect of feed water temperature on ph and orp with a minor effect on acc levels the authors attributed the low influence of temperature to the small range of temperatures studied further studies are therefore needed to justify the previous work or test whether different results can be achieved by varying the feed water source a summary of the impact of increasing the physicochemical characteristics discussed above on ew production and product properties is illustrated in table 1 3 2 effect of electrolyte properties reactor configuration and operating parameters 3 2 1 effect of electrolyte properties type and concentration the quality of the ew generated can be affected by the choice of electrolyte electrolyte flow rate and concentration various electrolytes including nacl mgcl2 kcl and hcl have been used for the production of ew sodium chloride nacl is the most common electrolyte used in ew production 30 60 64 71 92 however other researchers 60 70 92 have reported the use of other salts such as mgcl2 kcl and hcl instead of nacl the acc is strongly determined by the concentration of the electrolyte rather than the type 71 93 from the literature review although increasing electrolyte concentrations generally improves the concentration of chlorine produced an optimum electrolyte concentration exists for each system at which optimal production is achieved a rise in electrolyte concentration has been reported to enhance electrolytic efficiency and power consumption of the system this is because an increase in electrolyte ions increases current efficiency at the anode with a rise in acc 94 this can be attributed to the relationship between the concentration of chloride ions in solution and the electrode potential of the chlorine evolution reaction when the chloride ions increase the electrode potential decreases and the chlorine production reaction is enhanced the improvement in anode current efficiency further lowers the energy consumption of the reactor the determination of optimum electrolyte concentration values is therefore crucial to increase anode current efficiency and maximize energy consumption 94 hsu 91 reported an increase in the concentrations of na and cl with an increase in the nacl solution flow rate and concentration resulting in high acc production this agrees with whangchai et al 95 who reported an increase in acc with increasing nacl solution concentration they opined that at 5 nacl concentration there were enough electrolyte ions available to undergo an oxidation reaction to produce more chlorine gas forghani et al 30 stated that a higher electrolyte concentration increases chlorine production which enhances the sanitizing ability of ew this was because the increased concentration of electrolyte causes an increase in conductivity with a satisfactory increase in the ph range suitable for the generation of saew several authors have reported a linear correlation between the concentration of salt and the concentration of acc generated by the electrolysis generator 24 92 96 97 kiura et al 97 reported a strong correlation between the amount of salt duration of electrolysis and acc production a study by ezeike and hung 98 reported that a higher orp and acc of ew could be achieved with a higher salt concentration the assessment by 98 is consistent with that of zhang et al 99 who reported an increase in acc and orp with increasing electrolyte concentration kim et al 72 also reported that an increase in the electrolyte hcl nacl concentration resulted in a ph decrease with increasing orp and acc forghani et al 30 reported higher acc levels for higher electrolyte concentrations hcl nacl used in the electrolysis process they explained that a higher electrolyte concentration increased the conductivity and hence improved chlorine generation 3 2 2 effect of electrode material and setting compared to the many parameters that may influence the production of the oxidant ew the most significant parameter is the material from which the electrode is made 100 101 several authors 37 94 100 102 have reported the influence of electrode material type and electrode settings on the properties of the ew produced platinum pt is often used at the anode in ew generators 8 30 103 104 other researchers have used different materials for ew generators 105 hsu et al 37 stated that an electrode material with excellent conductivity has the potential to conduct higher electrical flow of current to boost the ion exchange during the ew electrolysis khalid et al 36 on the contrary recently reported a non significant effect on chlorine production using different electrodes of different electrical conductivity however among the electro catalytic materials used as anodes particularly among the dimensionally stable anodes dsa ir ruo2 coated titanium ti has been reported to exhibit lower corrosion tendencies the efficiency of the conversion of chlorine ions to chlorine gas is in the order ti iro2 ti ruo2 ti pt iro2 bdd boron doped diamond pt 24 106 108 li and kim 105 showed that iridium oxide coated anode and cathode electrodes produced increased amounts of acc compared to ruthenium oxide electrodes under the same working parameters and attributed their results to the higher electro catalytic ability of iridium however zhang et al 99 reported ruo2 iro2 tio2 electrodes as more effective for chlorine production rahman et al 24 reported that the type of material used for the anode affects the production of chlorine and other reactive species such as h2 o2 and o3 hsu et al 37 reported that submersing the electrodes deeper into the solution significantly increases the current density and the reactor s energy consumption capacity the immersion of electrodes deeper into the solution provided better mixing and more effective transport of ions which accelerated the electrolysis process resulting in increased chlorine evolution the rise in the electrolysis process however produced an increase in electric current density which eventually put a strain on the system s energy consumption efficiency an alteration in the electrode size and electrode gap remarkably influenced the electric current and chlorine production they explained that although the use of a half sized electrode substantially lowered the electric current and amount of chlorine produced there was no significant effect on the current efficiency of the system notably a 12 cm gap increase resulted in a significant decrease in electric current and chlorine produced a decrease in electrode size creates a reduction in electrode surface area resulting in a drop in current density and decreased electrolysis rate furthermore widening the electrode gap slows down the movement of ions and decreases electric current density with a subsequent decrease in the rate of chlorine production jafry et al 109 also reported that an increase in the electrode gap results in the introduction of larger quantities of electrolytes which takes considerable time for efficient electrolysis of hcl to hocl thereby reducing the production of acc as per hsu et al 37 the size of electrodes and electrode spacing should be considered when lower concentrations of chlorine are required to maximize energy consumption the characteristics of the different ews produced using electrodes made from different materials are presented in table 2 3 2 3 effect of electric current and water electrolyte flow rate in the production of ew electrolysis parameters such as current and flow rates of water or electrolyte have been reported to affect the overall properties of the ew produced 112 additionally researchers have reported the influence of these parameters 9 24 71 91 park et al 113 also stated that the strength of the current in the generator affects the concentration of available chlorine which further determines the efficacy of the ew generated according to song et al 110 an increase in the current density enhances the chlorine evolution reaction which results in a high acc rahman et al 9 reported the influence of current amperage on the sanitizing power of ew on food borne pathogens in their study an electric current increase from 1 15 to 1 45a increased orp and acc which determines the germicidal efficacy of the ew another study by jafry et al 109 reported a general acc increase with a higher electric current however at a certain level the current increment resulted in an increased production of bubbles which led to a decline in acc levels the authors explained that the decline in acc occurred because the bubble reduced the surface area for an efficient electrolytic reaction hsu 91 reported a general decrease in the efficiency of electrolysis as the water flow rate increased he attributed the decrease in electrolysis efficiency at high water flow rates to shorter residence time and reaction time for the ions in the electrolytic cell in another study hsu 71 reported that increasing the water flow rate resulted in a decrease in the acc and orp of the ew produced hsu 71 opined that the electrolytic cell has a positive correlation between the amount of electrolyte and the sanitizing power of the produced ew this is in agreement with jafry et al s 109 report on the influence of electrolyte flow rate on the free and total chlorine concentrations in the generated ew their study showed an increase in the acc with increasing hcl flow rate however this trend alters beyond a certain flow rate threshold decreasing the acc because of the limited residence time available for electrolysis they recommended an optimized flow rate of 3 ml min at 13 a as the optimal conditions for saew production the electrolyte flow rate used for ew production influences the acc 93 maruyama et al 93 explained that increasing the amount of electrolyte significantly decreased the electrolytic efficiency of the reactor in summary although an increase in acc concentration was observed with increased electrolyte flow rate and current a general decrease in the acc with increasing water flow rate was also observed table 3 shows a simplified illustration of the influence of increasing operation parameters during ew production and characteristics of the final product 3 3 factors affecting application efficiency of produced ew 3 3 1 effect of ew ph on sanitizing efficiency the ph of ew is a significant factor in determining its efficiency as a disinfectant in ew disinfection processes the orp values correlate weakly with acc because they are a measure of two different parameters orp is a measure of oxidative disinfection power while acc is a measure of hocl and clo concentrations moreover orp does not correlate well with acc because ph plays a significant role in the determination of orp and acc values when the ph is high acc occurs in the form of clo and the orp is low therefore acc readings could be high however the orp will decrease because of the high ph orp ph and acc as hocl or clo have a powerful influence on the germicidal efficiency of ew 114 at ph 5 and 6 5 the available chlorine is in its strongest form as hocl 31 at higher ph however hocl dissociates to clo and cl2 gas at low ph values hocl works by penetrating the germ cell membrane and generates hydroxyl radicals destroying the pathogen through oxidation 112 rahman et al 2 found that the antimicrobial efficacy of ew was diminished at ph 9 0 because the orp and acc decreased significantly with an increase in ph from the acidic region of 2 5 to the basic region of 9 0 park et al 115 investigated the effect of acc and ph of aew on the inactivation of l monocytogenes and e coli they observed that within a wide ph range of 3 0 7 0 ew was extremely efficient in retarding pathogenic activity when adequate amounts of acc were present they attributed the ews ability to reduce the bacterial population to ph which increases the susceptibility of the external coat of the pathogens to hocl chen and hung 83 also evaluated the effect of ph on the chlorine demand of a naocl solution wash water for lettuce they observed that a rise in ph resulted in a decrease in chlorine demand except for a minor increase from 6 0 to 8 0 and concluded that ph has a significant effect on chlorine demand table 4 summarizes the sanitizing efficiencies of some ew solutions under different ph conditions 3 3 2 effect of orp on the efficiency of produced ew researchers have considered that a high orp is a major factor responsible for the disinfecting action of ew 112 116 117 hocl inactivation of pathogens is a synergistic effect of high orp levels and low ph values of ew 116 118 the high orp results in oxidation affecting the outer layer of microorganisms causing further oxidation reactions and ultimate destruction of the metabolic pathway in the organism s cell leading to inactivation 117 rahman et al 9 reported a 5 0 log cfu ml decrease in pathogens with the use of ew with an orp value range of 500 700 mv koseki et al 120 stated that orp could not be the principal factor responsible for the sanitization process they observed that ozonated water with a higher orp showed lower germicidal efficiency compared with aew which has a lower orp and attributed the strong antibacterial effect of aew to the acc mostly as hocl in addition stevenson et al 121 found total inactivation of bacterial cells with a decrease in orp at less than 848 mv the antimicrobial efficacy of ew largely depends on the optimal concentration of hocl high orp values and optimal low ph levels 48 3 3 3 effect of temperature on the efficiency of produced ew the temperature of ew during sanitization has been reported to affect the germicidal efficiency of ew 2 30 31 70 122 fabrizio and cutter 122 stated that the efficacy of aew on pathogens increased at 25 c as opposed to 4 c when they experimented with the efficacy of aew against s typhimurium and l monocytogenes the authors observed a maximum reduction of 8 log cfu ml at 25 c rahman et al 2 reported similar observations after treating e coli s typhimurium s aureus and l monocytogenes for approximately a min at temperatures of 4 c and 50 c they observed that at 50 c there was a total reduction in bacterial species of circa 7 42 8 02 log cfu ml this decrease was attributed to a significant increase in the water temperature from 4 c to 50 c other researchers agree with the observation that the sanitizing efficiency of saew improves with increasing temperature 31 123 124 forghani et al 30 reported that preheating water at 40 c for saew production slightly increased the acc and antimicrobial efficacy of l monocytogenes and e coli however heating ew after production negatively affected the inactivation efficacy because of the partial loss of chlorine upon heating to 40 c 3 4 factors affecting ew stability 3 4 1 storage environment several studies have reported the effect of storage conditions on ew stability the antimicrobial efficiency of ew is affected by storage conditions attributed to the decomposition of the major antimicrobial component hocl and evaporation of cl2 over time especially when stored under open conditions 8 60 92 125 additionally the physicochemical properties of ew have been reported to undergo drastic changes when stored in both open and closed environments in storage under closed conditions acc is lost in ew via self decomposition however the acc loss in closed environments is less compared to the loss via evaporation under open storage conditions white 80 reported complete chlorine loss in acidic electrolyzed water aew kept in an open environment after 30 h of shaking and in 100 h when not agitated bonde et al 126 reported a decrease in acc of 80 after 2 h of agitation however the orp remained unchanged indicating the presence of other strong oxidizing agents rahman et al 8 investigated the effect of storage on low concentration slightly acidic ew lcsaew under closed and open conditions at ph ranges of 6 8 7 4 they observed a gradual decrease from the initial 10 mg l acc to 0 mg l acc within 7 days in an open dark environment and a decline from 10 mg l acc to 0 mg l in 21 days under closed dark conditions they observed that the ph of the lcsaew stored under both conditions increased after 28 days of storage with a decrease in the orp values the authors also showed that the antimicrobial potential of lcsaew was preserved against l monocytogenes and e coli for 6 days in open and 14 days in closed storage conditions 8 xuan et al 127 also confirmed the assertion that closed dark condition is well suited for ew storage when they researched the changes in ph orp and acc of ew during storage under closed and open conditions saew stored in tight lid containers in the absence of light retained 91 5 of acc after a week whereas 4 2 of acc was lost in another container stored with a loose lid 128 it has also been reported that lower temperatures are conducive to ew storage 129 physicochemical properties of ew stored at 4 c exhibited more stability than ew stored at 25 c and exhibited efficient bactericidal activity for over 12 months 122 129 130 however ew exhibits different properties under diverse storage conditions for example 129 131 reported that new has higher stability than aew throughout the storage period cui et al 131 reported no change in the ph and electrical conductivity of new and aew after 30 days of storage however when aew was kept under open conditions a 22 decrease in orp 52 in do and 100 in acc were observed with a sharp decrease in the bactericidal efficiency of aew the efficiency of new was not significantly affected by the storage conditions moreover hsu and kao 132 reported no change in the orp electrical conductivity and ph of aew during storage however the acc and do content remarkably decreased during storage the authors concluded that ew should be stored in closed containers to avoid chlorine loss waters and hung 133 reported that during long term storage the ph of chlorine based sanitizers should be kept close to neutral because low ph sanitizers are unstable and can lose a significant amount of chlorine during storage in conclusion chlorine loss from ew is mostly due to agitation and storage under open and bright light conditions under these conditions agitation speeds up the mass transfer of chlorine gas at the gas liquid interface resulting in the loss of gas through evaporation table 5 presents an illustrative view of the effect of major factors influencing ew efficiency during application and stability of the ew properties during storage 3 5 commercially available generators and emerging issues the frequency of several studies regarding the production of ew through electrolysis of salt or acid is increasing to meet disinfection demands because of the covid 19 pandemic it is therefore important to find workable and compatible generators in terms of economic viability literature studies have presented some commercially recognized ew generators that have used different electrolytes and operated at different parameters to yield varied acc levels for disinfection a summary of some types of ews produced from these generators and the characteristics of the ew produced are presented in table 6 notably ew generators experience lapses in production consistency using different water sources because of changes in water chemistry most ew reactor electrodes are manufactured from expensive metals which increases the capital cost and corrosion of the electrodes is another problem that needs to be addressed to increase the commercial applications of this process additionally it has been reported that some ew generator models emit chlorine gas when operated at ph 5 96 which can cause discomfort and health related issues to the operator during long term exposure 4 future recommendations the use of ew as a sustainable and green alternative against toxic chemicals has become a common practice for disinfection and sanitization therefore new technologies and generators that are more efficient are emerging regularly owing to the many useful attributes of ew it is rapidly developing as a sanitizer of the future 137 therefore the provision of efficient and cost effective conditions for production is prudent from the review above the authors recommend the following effect of feed water ph and temperature should be an area of interest for research in the production of ew although tap water is the typical source of feed water in ew production the versatility for on site production makes ew more desirable over other disinfectants in situations where the access to tap water is limited and the ph of the available water is of concern or in regions of high temperature values such research will go a long way to enhance ew generation when the feed water contains organics the installation of a pre treatment system is suggested to achieve maximum and steady production water treatment technologies such as ion exchange nanofiltration reverse osmosis microfiltration and ultrafiltration can be utilized for the removal of organic matter in water treatment for ew production however issues relating to economic feasibility pose an obstacle to the implementation of these techniques adsorption presents an advantageous option with its simple design low capital cost and excellent efficiency for electrode manufacture cheaper metals as should be tested for their economic feasibility a recent study by givirovskiy et al 38 reported favorable electrolysis results using stainless steel electrodes stainless steel can therefore be considered in the quest for potentially cost efficient electrode material or for coatings on electrolysis systems regular cleaning and replacement of the electrode connection joint with the power source are encouraged to avoid any disruption in production and to attain a stable product the application of anti corrosion metals as coating agents for connection joints can be considered in future studies further research into new technologies and design of electrolysers that can reduce chlorine gas emissions still be operational in the presence of common contaminants is recommended 5 conclusion this study reviewed the literature to identify the factors that affect the production and application of ew the effects of factors such as feed water characteristics electrolyte properties electrode material storage conditions and operating parameters feed water flow rate electrolyte flow rate and electric current were investigated additionally some commercially available ew generator models their specifications and issues were discussed along with future recommendations for economic feasibility and sustainability this review work found three categories being the most researched and cited in ew literature these are reactor and electrolyte properties operating parameters application and storage parameters with operating parameters reactor and electrolyte properties being the most dominant this is a reflection of the importance of these factors on ew production and application the electrode material type and settings yielded different accs with ti iro2 converting most of the chlorine ions to chlorine gas an increase in the feed water flow rate resulted in a decrease in the acc while a high flow rate of the electrolyte produced more chlorine moreover an increase in the current density resulted in a high acc effective disinfection was found to decrease at higher ph and lower orp values and dark conditions were the best storage options in reducing acc loss water hardness increased orp and acc levels with a decrease in the ph of ew while organic matter presence reduced acc in conclusion although a trend can be established for the influence of the parameters on the production of ew some researchers have reported thresholds within which this trend is curtailed therefore it is imperative to determine the specific thresholds for ew systems in future research credit authorship contribution statement rea retrieved curated data and wrote initial draft my analyzed data reviewed and revised initial draft wl

13352,this study aims to successfully demonstrate natural clinoptilolite based ammonia capture from real swine wastewater and simulated anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr treated swine permeate through extensive experimental analysis the surface structure as well as elemental and chemical composition of both treated and untreated clinoptilolite particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir column experiments revealed that the breakthrough times for the real swine and synthetic swine wastewaters were similar indicating that the wastewater matrix did not really have an effect on ammonia adsorption ion release profiles showed na to be the main counterion for nh4 capture the presence of k ion had the greatest impact on ammonia adsorption and the selectivity series was determined to be k ca2 na mg2 simultaneous removal of p from real and synthetic swine wastewaters was observed and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds data as well as the ion release profile data additionally sustained regenerability of sorbed clinoptilolite was demonstrated using brine solution through alternating cycles of adsorption and desorption keywords swine wastewater natural clinoptilolite ammonia recovery slow release fertilizer anaerobic membrane bioreactor 1 introduction there is growing environmental concern about the massive amounts of wastewater generated from large scale confined animal feeding operations cafos including swine feeding operations which contain high concentrations of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter 1 2 if discharged untreated it can pose adverse public health risks and environmental impacts including harmful freshwater algal blooms exposure to harmful pathogens and negative effects to surface water and ground water quality 3 4 however swine wastewater also presents the opportunity for beneficial recovery of carbon nitrogen as ammonia and phosphorus using sustainable resource recovery technologies 5 7 the most common strategies for ammonia removal involve biological nitrification denitrification air stripping ion exchange chemical precipitation bioelectro chemical systems bes and breakthrough chlorination 8 12 although biological nitrification and denitrification can be effective in ammonia removal they are limited by the high cost of operation to supplement oxygen during the nitrification stage and the need for an external carbon source for denitrification 13 in addition biological nitrogen removal also generates nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas as a by product 9 these challenges pose a pressing need to develop novel treatment technologies for swine waste treatment that couple nutrient management with carbon recovery one such technology to address the shortcomings is the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr an emerging energy positive technology that combines anaerobic biological treatment with membrane filtration delivering high quality treated permeate and energy rich biogas with high methane content additionally anmbr facilitates tailored recovery of n as ammonia and p from the permeate using ion exchange adsorption coagulation flocculation and chemical precipitation 14 18 table 1 shows a brief summary of various adsorbents and ion exchange materials that have been studied for ammonia removal from swine wastes ion exchange using low cost zeolite materials such as clinoptilolite has been extensively used in various types of wastewaters for ammonia and heavy metal removal 26 29 clinoptilolite an abundant natural zeolite is a microporous crystalline aluminosilicate material having high surface area with a three dimensional framework composed of exchangeable cations 30 apart from ion exchange clinoptilolite can also capture ammonia by molecular adsorption mechanism 31 the ammonia recovery capacity is affected by presence of commonly occurring cations in wastewater such as potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na and depends on the selectivity of the clinoptilolite towards these different ions k having a similar ionic size and monovalent charge as ammonium has been reported to effectively compete with ammonium 32 the selectivity of ammonia relative to other cations are reported disparately in the literature 26 33 34 this is attributed to various factors including the presence of co existing ions variable initial nh4 n concentration ph temperature composition and chemical modification of clinoptilolite that are known to impact the adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite 35 37 although clinoptilolite has been extensively studied for ammonia adsorption only a few studies have focused on clinoptilolite based ammonia recovery from swine wastewater 5 31 38 41 furthermore there are no known studies on targeted ammonia recovery from anmbr treated swine permeate using natural clinoptilolite which has obvious benefits as discussed earlier in this context this is the first comprehensive study to evaluate clinoptilolite based ammonia recovery from simulated synthetic anmbr swine permeate using batch experiments combined with appropriate modeling analysis and detailed surface elemental characterization by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds additionally to evaluate the applicability and scale up potential replicable dynamic column experiments with side by side breakthrough curve comparisons for both synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater were performed with detailed temporal characterization of ion release profile from the columns the breakthrough curves were intimately coupled with fixed bed modeling analysis thereby enabling extrapolation of clinoptilolite adsorption performance for a variety of ammonia capture scenarios from swine permeate real swine wastewater and potentially other comparable wastewater types experiments on the effects of co existing competing ions on ammonia recovery and sorbed clinoptilolite regenerability evaluations with nacl were also performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 clinoptilolite characteristics clinoptilolite media zeobest used in this study to remove ammonia was purchased from northern filter media inc iowa usa the chemical composition of the clinoptilolite media was provided by the vendor and is shown in si table s1 the total cation exchange capacity determined for ammonium n was reported to be between 1 2 and 1 8 meq g clinoptilolite as per the manufacturer s specifications for all experiments in this study the clinoptilolite media was used as received without any pretreatment or rinsing with di water 2 2 synthetic swine permeate composition synthetic swine effluent simulating treated permeate from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr system was prepared in reference to 42 43 and the wastewater composition from the swine waste lagoon located at the kansas state university animal farm manhattan kansas usa in addition the following assumptions were made 1 90 chemical oxygen demand cod removal can be achieved within the anmbr system treating an influent total cod of 10 800 mg l resulting in an effluent cod of 1080 mg l based on the system s previous performance 18 2 no nutrient removal occurs within the bioreactor and hence the concentrations of nh4 n p and other cations in the effluent will remain the same as the influent the composition of the prepared solution is shown in table 2 2 3 effect of contact time and kinetics of ammonia recovery the effect of contact time to reach equilibrium was studied for an initial concentration of 400 mg l nh4 n in nh4cl solution samples were collected periodically for 840 min a duration long enough to achieve equilibrium based on preliminary contact time experiments these samples were filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters and analyzed for ammonium concentration subsequently kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo 44 and pseudo second order pso 45 were evaluated to understand the kinetics of ammonia removal using clinoptilolite further to understand the mechanism of ammonia capture intra particle diffusion model 46 was also investigated on the kinetic data the kinetic experiment was performed in duplicate and average ammonia concentration was used to plot the graph and modeling analysis 2 4 particle characterization using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir surface high resolution imaging to determine the surface morphology and elemental composition of the clinoptilolite particles from the batch experiment with synthetic swine wastewater before and after ammonia capture was done using an fei nova nanosem 450 scanning electron microscope sem with an oxford x max 20mm2 integrated edax silicon drift detector located at the electron nanoscopy instrumentation facility university of nebraska lincoln usa the working distance and accelerating voltage were set to around 5 mm and 20 kv respectively prior to the sem analysis the synthetic swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles were allowed to dry in a desiccator to remove all the moisture and the dried clinoptilolite was used for surface imaging ftir analysis was performed to identify the main chemical groups on raw untreated natural clinoptilolite and clinoptilolite particles treated with nh4cl synthetic swine permeate filtered real swine wastewater respectively using the agilent cary 630 ftir spectrometer for this analysis the treated wet clinoptilolite particles were dried in a desiccator at room temperature and ground to fine powder prior to performing the ftir analysis 2 5 interference of competing ions on ammonia adsorption the impact of co occurring competitive cations such as k mg 2 ca2 and na on ammonia capture was investigated using the respective binary solutions with ammonia the maximum expected swine wastewater concentration of 400 mg l nh4 n and each correspondingly different competing ion of choice added at an initial concentration of 28 meq l corresponding to 400 mg l nh4 n to10g l clinoptilolite in 100 ml di water in addition the effect of simultaneous competition from multiple competing ions in the same working solution was evaluated by adding each of the different ions k mg 2 ca2 and na along with nh4 n at an equal concentration of 28 meq l respectively all the experimental solutions were placed in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm aliquot samples were collected after 24 h and filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters to analyze the concentrations of ammonia and the corresponding competing ion s the experiment was performed in duplicate and average values are reported in this study 2 6 column studies on synthetic swine permeate fixed bed column adsorption studies were performed with a glass column having a diameter of 2 5 cm column height of 15 cm and a packed bed height of 10 cm breakthrough curves to understand the ammonia capture pattern was performed by feeding the synthetic swine permeate composition shown in table 2 into the column in upflow mode using a masterflex peristaltic pump at 1 ml min the breakthrough data from the experiments were fitted to thomas model 47 and compared to the model predicted curves to predict the maximum adsorbate removal capacity as well as understand the dynamic behavior of the ammonia capture in the packed bed column the breakthrough data were also fitted to the yoon nelson model 48 to predict the 50 column breakthrough time each column run was repeated twice 2 7 application on actual swine wastewater to evaluate the potential use of clinoptilolite as a pre treatment system untreated actual swine wastewater collected from the swine waste lagoon at the kansas state university animal farm was treated in a clinoptilolite packed bed column having the same dimension as used in the previous column experiment at flow rate of 1 ml min all column experiments were performed at an environmentally relevant temperature of 25 c prior to column feeding the collected swine wastewater was centrifuged for 10 min in an eppendorf centrifuge 5920 r hauppauge new york usa at 10 000 rpm rotations per minute the supernatant was then filtered through a 1 6 μm glass fiber filter paper the composition of the actual filtered swine wastewater was characterized and is also shown in table 2 additionally synthetic swine wastewater simulating the average composition of the collected real swine wastewater was also prepared and treated in the column to compare the breakthrough behavior of the two different types of wastewaters each column experiment was repeated twice 2 8 regeneration of spent clinoptilolite the recoverability of ammonia and reusability of spent clinoptilolite was evaluated in a batch experiment involving four successive adsorption and desorption cycles each adsorption cycle involved adding 1 g of clinoptilolite in 100 ml of each of the two synthetic swine permeate solutions having different initial ammonia concentrations of 400 mg l nh4 n or 100 mg l nh4 n respectively and placed on an orbital shaker for 24 h at 300 rpm at the end of each adsorption cycle the spent clinoptilolite was filtered out from the swine permeate solutions using 1 6 μm glass fiber filter and added to 100 ml solutions of 0 5 m nacl to desorb the captured ammonia and regenerate the spent clinoptilolite all experiments were performed in duplicate initial and final sample aliquots were collected and analyzed for ammonia concentrations to determine the amount of ammonia adsorbed or desorbed 2 9 analytical methods the concentration of ammonia in the batch isotherm experiments and desorption study was analyzed with hach tnt 832 high range ammonia kit using a hach dr3900 loveland co usa spectrophotometer in all other experiments concentration of ions including na k ca2 mg2 nh4 so4 2 and no3 were measured using dionex ics 5000 ion chromatography system po4 3 was also analyzed using the dionex ics 5000 ion chromatography system with a few exceptions when hach tnt 846 phosphorus reactive ortho kit was used deionized water 18 2 mω cm resistivity was used to make stock solutions for preparing dilutions and all chemical analyses chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed with hach kits tnt 825 ph was monitored using fisherbrand accumet ab150 ph benchtop meters 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of ammonia adsorption the kinetics of ammonia adsorption was studied using the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models the nonlinear pseudo first order kinetic rate order proposed by lagergren 44 is represented by eq 1 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t where qt qe and k1 are the amount of ammonia captured per gram clinoptilolite at time t mg g amount of ammonia captured at equilibrium mg g and the pfo rate constant min 1 respectively the nonlinear form of pseudo second order model is represented by eq 2 2 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where qt mg g is the amount of ammonia capture per gram clinoptilolite at time t min qe mg g is the amount of ammonia capture at equilibrium and k2 is the pso rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the kinetic experiment data were fitted to both the models by nonlinear regression curve fitting using the levenberg marquardt algorithm in originpro 2019b software fig 1a presents the nonlinear regression curve fitting plots of both models along with the experimental ammonia uptake data and the estimated model parameters are summarized in table 3 based on the r2 value pseudo second order r2 0 98 seems a better fit than pseudo first order r2 0 93 and the pso model calculated qe 15 8 mg g was also very close to the experimental equilibrium uptake of 15 77 mg g the better fit with pseudo second order kinetic model suggests that ammonia capture by clinoptilolite is likely governed by chemisorption or ion exchange mechanism and dependent on both the adsorbent clinoptilolite and the adsorbate ammonia 49 51 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models do not give any information on the ammonia diffusion mechanism therefore to gain insight into the diffusion mechanisms of ammonia adsorption and determine the rate controlling steps the experimental data were applied to the intra particle diffusion model described by weber and morris 46 eq 3 3 q t k t 0 5 c where qt mg g is the ammonia uptake at time t min and k mg g 1 min 0 5 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c is the intercept of the slope of the curve which is also indicative of the boundary layer thickness the model assumes intraparticle diffusion to be rate controlling if the line from the plot of qt versus t0 5 intercepts the origin fig 1b shows three linear regions of ammonia uptake region 1 with a steeper slope represents the external film diffusion controlled adsorption and the region 2 likely being pore diffusion controlled followed by the equilibrium stage in region 3 the results reveal that ammonium adsorption occurs as a combination of both external film diffusion and pore diffusion the former with a steeper slope occurs very fast and the latter is the slower rate controlling process this was further investigated by determining the film diffusion df and particle diffusion dp coefficients to understand the contribution of each diffusion mechanism using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 film diffusion model ln 1 q t q e k f t 5 particle diffusion model ln 1 q t q e 2 2 k p t where qt and qe are the amount of ammonia uptake per gram clinoptilolite at time t mg g kf is the film diffusion rate constant represented by kf dfc czhr and kp is the particle diffusion rate constant represented by kp dp π 2 r2 c and cz mg kg are the concentration of ammonia in solution and on the zeolite respectively r is the average particle radius 0 0005 m of clinoptilolite used in the present study h is the thickness of film around the clinoptilolite particle 10 5 m for poorly stirred solution 8 52 the calculated values of df and dp are summarized in table 3 the value of film diffusion coefficient df was greater than the particle diffusion coefficient dp which further confirmed particle diffusion to be the rate limiting step a similar conclusion was reached by lin et al 53 for natural clinoptilolite based ammonia removal at an initial concentration of 1000 mg n l batch equilibrium isotherm experiments were also performed and modeled using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the results of the isotherm experiment are discussed in the supplementary information si the isotherm data and model parameters are shown and summarized in si fig s 1 and table s 2 respectively 3 2 scanning electron microscopy and surface elemental composition of clinoptilolite scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed to compare the surface morphology of the clinoptilolite particle before and after contact with synthetic swine permeate the scanning electron micrographs of the untreated clinoptilolite particle fig 2a and synthetic swine permeate contacted particle fig 2b showed the particle surface as rough and irregular additionally the untreated raw natural clinoptilolite particle surface appeared to be covered with fine particles on the surface unlike the synthetic swine permeate treated micrograph which appeared more refined likely due to the absence of fine particles this refined appearance of the treated clinoptilolite could possibly be due to the rinsing effect of permeate treatment on the particles which were under constant agitation during the batch experiments the representative eds spectrum for both raw and treated clinoptilolite samples is shown in fig 2c and fig 2d respectively the raw clinoptilolite spectrum had peaks corresponding to calcium sodium oxygen silica aluminum iron and potassium the presence of the above mentioned ions is similar to the elemental composition from the xrf data for raw clinoptilolite provided by the manufacturer si table s1 the eds based surface elemental composition of both synthetic swine permeate treated and raw clinoptilolite is represented as atomic percentage and weight percentage in table 4 the sodium percentage contribution in the raw clinoptilolite reduced from 1 73 to 0 41 wt in the treated sample indicating loss of sodium ion from the particle this is indicative of sodium likely being a counter ion for ion exchange of ammonia on the clinoptilolite surface a similar pattern of decrease in sodium and potassium from natural clinoptilolite after adsorption in nh4cl solution was observed by lin et al 53 furthermore the treated clinoptilolite also witnessed a decrease in potassium k and iron fe percentages which may have also been involved in the ion exchange process interestingly magnesium mg and phosphorus p were detected in the treated particles but their absence from the raw natural clinoptilolite indicate that they likely originated from the synthetic swine permeate the presence of p indicated that apart from ion exchange mechanism of ammonia capture there is also the possibility of precipitation of phosphate based minerals that occurs when phosphate reacts with ammonia magnesium or calcium the detection of p in the present study is consistent with the eds result from a previous study that reported the formation of phosphate based precipitates calcium phosphate and struvite and that the zeolite could provide nucleation sites for precipitate formation 5 further investigation with xrd or other relevant surface characterization can confirm this possibility the results of the ftir analysis in si fig s3 shows the ir spectra of raw natural clinoptilolite particles and clinoptilolite after treatment with nh4cl solution synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater the transmittance spectra revealed no significant differences between the raw natural clinoptilolite and ammonia saturated clinoptilolites from different solutions the absorption peaks representative of clinoptilolite were observed in all the different conditions the absorption peak around 605 cm 1 signifies bicyclovibration of o si o or o al o 54 the absorption peak around 1030 cm 1 was likely due to si o si skeletal vibration 25 the peak representing h o h vibration around 1630 cm 1 represents the water of hydration within the clinoptilolite particles 55 interestingly a noticeable difference between the raw untreated clinoptilolite and ammonia saturated clinoptilolite was observed by the absorption peak around 1400 cm 1 all the ammonia saturated clinoptilolite treated with nh4cl initial concentration 400 mg n l synthetic swine permeate initial concentration 400 mg n l and filtered real swine wastewater initial concentration 81 mg n l had the absorption peak around 1400 1430 cm 1 this absorption band is representative of nh4 bending vibration indicating the presence of ammonium ions on the clinoptilolite 38 55 56 the intensity of the ammonia absorption peak is lower in the real swine wastewater treated clinoptilolite particles which could be attributed to its lower initial ammonium concentration overall these results in a way indicate that organic moieties did not play a big role in specific ammonia adsorption and were mainly driven by ion exchange as evidenced by the ion release profiles and sem edx 3 3 column adsorption study with synthetic swine permeate the breakthrough curves of two synthetic swine permeate replicate runs are shown in fig 3a and 3b respectively the breakthrough curve of each run appeared s shaped and the breakpoint c c0 0 1 occurred around 10 5 h in both replicates the column reached exhaustion c c0 0 9 after 28 h in run 1 and 30 h in run 2 the breakthrough curves are also represented with respect to the bed volumes treated in si fig s4 the adsorption capacity of the clinoptilolite bed at breakthrough and exhaustion were calculated using eq 6 6 q t c 0 q 0 t 1 c c o dt m where qt mg g is the adsorption capacity at time t hour c0 mg l is the initial influent ammonium concentration c mg l is the effluent ammonium concentration at time t hours m g is the mass of clinoptilolite in the column bed q l h is the flow rate of synthetic swine permeate fed into the column at breakthrough point the adsorption capacity of the column was found to be 5 55 mg g and 5 63 mg g for run 1 and 2 respectively the total ammonia capture capacity of the column calculated at c c0 1 was 10 15 mg g for run1 and 9 68 mg g for run 2 these values were slightly lower than 11 2 mg g from the batch study si fig s2 at similar initial concentration 400 mg l nh4 n in the synthetic swine permeate the lower adsorption capacity of the column may be due to the column bed not reaching equilibrium due to shorter contact time than the batch experiment 57 the ion exchange mechanism within the column was investigated by analyzing the temporal ion release or capture profile of different cations in samples collected from the column outlet the release profiles for each column are presented in fig 3c and 3d respectively results indicate that sodium ions were abundantly released from the column during the initial phase of operation while witnessing simultaneous capture of ammonium and potassium ions from the solution approximately 33 8 meq l of na was released in the third hour sample of the first column run while all the ammonium 27 8 meq l in the feed water was captured in the column by that time the release trend showed that na ions were sharply released during the first 3 h before its concentration in the effluent gradually decreased with continuous operation of the column in addition 7 1 meq l of k was captured in the column as per the sample collected in the third hour the release of sodium during the initial duration indicated that the sodium ions were displaced in exchange for ammonia and potassium capture the equivalent amount of sodium released compared to the equivalents of ammonium and potassium captured indicated that sodium was the main counter ion for ammonia capture during this initial phase apart from sodium calcium and potassium ions were also observed to increase with the duration of operation after the column reached breakthrough c c0 0 1 the concentration of na started to gradually decrease while the ammonium and potassium started to increase in the outlet samples these findings are further supported by the sem edx data table 4 shown earlier which confirmed the decrease in na and to a lesser extent k from the synthetic swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles fig 3c and 3d the reversal in adsorption pattern for potassium after reaching breakthrough was also reported by karadag et al 58 who studied ammonia removal from leachate wastewater in a clinoptilolite bed column the affinity of clinoptilolite for potassium is known to be greater than ammonium 59 60 however in the present study potassium eluted from the column prior to ammonium which may have been due to the ammonium equivalents being far greater than potassium in the feed and thereby possibly outcompeting potassium on the clinoptilolite surface overall ion release profile of each column run showed replicable trends of ion elution and needs complementary investigation using deeper analysis tools such as xanes xps spectra for a more mechanistic understanding of ammonia adsorption behavior in the presence of competing ions 3 3 1 breakthrough curve modeling the experimental data based breakthrough curve from each run was applied to the thomas model and yoon nelson model thomas model represented by eq 7 is used to estimate the maximum ammonia adsorption capacity and adsorption rate on the column 47 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t h q e m q k t h c 0 t where ct mg l and c0 mg l are the concentration of ammonia in the effluent at time t hour and the concentration of ammonia in the influent feed respectively the flow time t hour in the expression is calculated as a ratio of effluent volume l at time t and flow rate q l h kth is the model rate constant l hour 1 mg 1 qe is the amount of ammonia adsorbed at equilibrium per gram clinoptilolite mg g and m is the mass of clinoptilolite used in the column g the yoon nelson model represented by eq 8 is useful in predicting the time required to reach 50 adsorbate saturation in the column 8 c t c 0 1 1 exp k yn τ k yn t where kyn hour 1 is the yoon nelson rate constant and τ is the time required to reach 50 adsorbate saturation in the column hour it is to be noted that both the yoon nelson and thomas models are mathematically equivalent and can be expressed as a logistic function eq 9 61 since both the models are mathematically similar it cannot be compared based on the r2 value fitting but can be used simultaneously to determine the different derived parameters from each model 61 9 c t c 0 1 1 exp a bt the model parameters were estimated using non linear regression analysis as it gives a better fit than linear regression 62 using the levenberg marquadt algorithm in originpro 2019b software since both the thomas and yoon nelson models are mathematically equivalent the model predicted breakthrough curves had similar fit qualities and shape for this reason only the thomas model predicted breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3a and fig 3b while the predicted parameters for both the models are summarized in table 5 the thomas model predicted maximum ammonia uptake capacity of 9 8 mg g and 9 54 mg g for each of the column run was very close to the experimentally determined column capacity of 10 15 mg g for run1 and 9 68 mg g for run 2 additionally the time required to reach 50 ammonia breakthrough predicted by the yoon nelson model was also in close agreement with the experimental data for instance 50 ammonia breakthrough time for synthetic permeate run 1 fig 3a was achieved close to 18 h and the model predicted it to be at 17 49 h table 5 overall thomas model and yoon nelson models fit well with the experimental data and can be used to predict ammonia capture from synthetic swine permeate in fixed bed clinoptilolite columns 3 3 2 ammonia capture from real swine wastewater column studies additional column experiments to study ammonia capture from real swine wastewater were performed in duplicate according to the results of the breakthrough curve shown in fig 4a breakpoint c c0 0 1 of ammonia occurred at around 18 h for both replicate runs the column exhaustion c c0 0 9 happened faster for the first run of real swine waste c0 104 mg l after 35 h while taking 44 h for the second run of real swine waste c0 81 mg l this difference of bed exhaustion time between the two swine wastewater runs could be attributed to the slightly higher ammonium concentration in run 1 than run 2 leading to a faster saturation of column 63 the breakthrough curves are also represented with respect to the bed volumes treated in si fig s5 comparing the breakthrough curves of the simulated swine wastewater with those from the real swine runs fig 4a it was seen that there is not much difference in the breakpoint times of the two samples which bodes well for extending the mechanistic understanding from the synthetic swine permeate to the real swine wastewater fig 4a also demonstrated that ammonia recovery on clinoptilolite was not adversely impacted by the real wastewater matrix the ion release profile of the two different samples shown in fig 4b and 4c showed similar trends of ion capture and release as the synthetic permeate runs which is one of the first side by side comparisons for ammonia sorption from synthetic and real swine wastewater on clinoptilolite the impact of temperature needs to be investigated for future works based on published literature ammonia adsorption using bentonite is not really affected by low temperatures at the same ph and is impacted by the presence of competing ions such as na and ca2 at lower temperatures 64 according to wasielewski et al 65 temperature did not really impact the clinoptilolite based ammonia rate kinetics when comparing the ammonia removal efficiencies at 10 22 and 30 c although removal efficiency at equilibrium was found to be slightly higher as temperature increased 3 3 3 simultaneous phosphorus removal from swine waste in all the column studies there was a decline in phosphate po4 3 concentration while treating both the synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater for both the simulated swine permeate column runs fig 3 c and 3d the concentration of phosphate gradually declined from 8 meq l in the feed to 2 7 meq l a similar pattern of phosphate removal was observed in the real swine wastewater run 2 fig 4b during which the po4 3 concentration declined from 4 7 meq l in the feed to as low as 1 8 meq l this was further confirmed by using synthetic swine wastewater with similar composition to the real swine wastewater fig 4c as the po4 3 concentration decreased from 2 9 meq l in the feed to 1 5 meq l in the column effluent after 18 h these results further confirm the detection of phosphorus in the eds results for clinoptilolite particles treated with the synthetic swine permeate which could be due to the formation of phosphate based precipitates previous studies 5 38 66 68 have reported removal of phosphorus on zeolites although natural clinoptilolite does not have any anion exchange capacity the removal mechanism postulated is that cations ca2 and mg2 released from the surface of the zeolite during nh4 capture bind to phosphate to form calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite and struvite precipitates 32 38 67 in the present study the localized precipitation on the clinoptilolite surface did not decrease the overall ammonia capture efficiency indicating that precipitation neither caused pore clogging nor consequently decrease the ion exchange capacity apart from binding with the cations released from the zeolite phosphate could also possibly participate in precipitation reactions with the cations present in the wastewater overall clinoptilolite can effectively remove ammonia from swine wastewater with simultaneous recovery of phosphorus additionally the sorbed clinoptilolite can be directly applied as a soil amendment enabling slow release of nutrients in the soil 3 4 effect of competing ions on ammonia sorption the ammonium selectivity with respect to each of the tested competing ions was assessed by comparing the adsorption capacity of ammonium in the different solutions and is shown in fig 5 it was observed that ammonium adsorption was lowest at 7 22 mg n g in the presence of potassium followed by calcium 14 4 mg n g sodium 15 4 mg n g and magnesium 16 mg n g in the solution containing the same equivalent concentration of all the ions the ammonia adsorption was lowest at 4 7 mg n g which is likely due to the high equivalent concentration of all ions exerting a greater competition for the adsorption sites on the clinoptilolite than in any of the binary solution mixtures based on the observed results the order of selectivity of different cations with respect to ammonia recovery was found to be k ca2 na mg2 this is in agreement with previous studies which have also reported a similar selectivity of k ca2 na 34 69 however there is variability in the selectivity preference of calcium sodium and potassium ions in the literature some studies have reported greater affinity for sodium over potassium and calcium 33 35 while others have reported an order of preference of ca2 mg2 k na 38 this variability in preference could be attributed to the properties and composition of the zeolite used and the conditions that they are used in in summary the present study investigated the effect of different cations that are most commonly encountered in wastewater and are anticipated to have the greatest impact on ammonia recovery it is recommended to study the effects of various other cations and anions including fe3 cl co3 2 and so4 2 to develop a deeper understanding and further optimize real world applicability of clinoptilolite for swine wastewater ammonia capture 3 5 clinoptilolite regeneration using brine solution the results of the regeneration efficiency of the spent clinoptilolite are shown in fig 6 the amount of ammonia desorbed and desorption efficiency are calculated by eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 q d c d v m 11 desorption efficiency q d q e 100 where qd mg g and qe mg g are the amount of ammonia desorbed and amount of ammonia adsorbed respectively cd mg l is the concentration of ammonia released from the clinoptilolite in the regenerant solution v is the volume of regenerant used l and m is the mass of clinoptilolite g the adsorption capacity at 400 mg l nh4 n in synthetic swine permeate gradually declined from 11 6 mg g cycle 1 7 5 mg g cycle 4 in the desorption experiments ammonia desorption capacity was 8 3 mg g cycle 1 7 57 mg g cycle 2 7 8 mg g cycle 3 6 64 mg cycle 4 indicating that although the 0 5 m nacl brine solution could not completely desorb all the ammonium ions from the clinoptilolite it was consistently able to maintain a desorption efficiency greater than 69 from clinoptilolite treated with 400 mg l nh4 n the variability in the adsorption and desorption capacities is attributed to accumulation of ammonium along with other cations k mg2 or ca2 present in the synthetic swine permeate on the clinoptilolite 39 the ammonia adsorption capacity in 100 mg l nh4 n simulated swine permeate solution was in the range of 2 97 to 4 6 mg g and desorption efficiency was consistently above 78 for the 4 cycles overall the regeneration results indicate that nacl as a regenerant can be applied in an anmbr treatment system to maximize nh4 recovery while minimizing volatilization losses furthermore the brine solution needed for this purpose can be sustainably recovered from the swine wastewater itself with microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrec 70 4 conclusion the results of this study represent a comprehensive and reliable demonstration of the potential of clinoptilolite as an effective adsorbent for sustainably capturing and recovering ammonia from both synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater the kinetic experimental data fitted better with pseudo second order model and intraparticle pore diffusion was determined to be the rate limiting process for ammonia adsorption by clinoptilolite eds results revealed changes in surface elemental composition on the synthetic swine treated clinoptilolite particles with increases in phosphorus and magnesium and reduction in sodium weight percentages replicate column studies showed successful capture of ammonia from the swine wastewater with simultaneous phosphate based mineral precipitation ion release profiles revealed that na and ca2 were the main counterions for ammonia capture which further support the earlier observations from sem eds analyses of the swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles ammonia capture is affected by the presence of competing ions especially k and the selectivity of different cations with respect to ammonia exchange was found to be k ca2 na mg2 regeneration of spent clinoptilolite with nacl consistently achieved desorption efficiency greater than 69 over 4 cycles which showed that brine solution can be an effective way to recover ammonia in the liquid form while reusing the clinoptilolite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13352,this study aims to successfully demonstrate natural clinoptilolite based ammonia capture from real swine wastewater and simulated anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr treated swine permeate through extensive experimental analysis the surface structure as well as elemental and chemical composition of both treated and untreated clinoptilolite particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir column experiments revealed that the breakthrough times for the real swine and synthetic swine wastewaters were similar indicating that the wastewater matrix did not really have an effect on ammonia adsorption ion release profiles showed na to be the main counterion for nh4 capture the presence of k ion had the greatest impact on ammonia adsorption and the selectivity series was determined to be k ca2 na mg2 simultaneous removal of p from real and synthetic swine wastewaters was observed and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds data as well as the ion release profile data additionally sustained regenerability of sorbed clinoptilolite was demonstrated using brine solution through alternating cycles of adsorption and desorption keywords swine wastewater natural clinoptilolite ammonia recovery slow release fertilizer anaerobic membrane bioreactor 1 introduction there is growing environmental concern about the massive amounts of wastewater generated from large scale confined animal feeding operations cafos including swine feeding operations which contain high concentrations of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter 1 2 if discharged untreated it can pose adverse public health risks and environmental impacts including harmful freshwater algal blooms exposure to harmful pathogens and negative effects to surface water and ground water quality 3 4 however swine wastewater also presents the opportunity for beneficial recovery of carbon nitrogen as ammonia and phosphorus using sustainable resource recovery technologies 5 7 the most common strategies for ammonia removal involve biological nitrification denitrification air stripping ion exchange chemical precipitation bioelectro chemical systems bes and breakthrough chlorination 8 12 although biological nitrification and denitrification can be effective in ammonia removal they are limited by the high cost of operation to supplement oxygen during the nitrification stage and the need for an external carbon source for denitrification 13 in addition biological nitrogen removal also generates nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas as a by product 9 these challenges pose a pressing need to develop novel treatment technologies for swine waste treatment that couple nutrient management with carbon recovery one such technology to address the shortcomings is the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr an emerging energy positive technology that combines anaerobic biological treatment with membrane filtration delivering high quality treated permeate and energy rich biogas with high methane content additionally anmbr facilitates tailored recovery of n as ammonia and p from the permeate using ion exchange adsorption coagulation flocculation and chemical precipitation 14 18 table 1 shows a brief summary of various adsorbents and ion exchange materials that have been studied for ammonia removal from swine wastes ion exchange using low cost zeolite materials such as clinoptilolite has been extensively used in various types of wastewaters for ammonia and heavy metal removal 26 29 clinoptilolite an abundant natural zeolite is a microporous crystalline aluminosilicate material having high surface area with a three dimensional framework composed of exchangeable cations 30 apart from ion exchange clinoptilolite can also capture ammonia by molecular adsorption mechanism 31 the ammonia recovery capacity is affected by presence of commonly occurring cations in wastewater such as potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na and depends on the selectivity of the clinoptilolite towards these different ions k having a similar ionic size and monovalent charge as ammonium has been reported to effectively compete with ammonium 32 the selectivity of ammonia relative to other cations are reported disparately in the literature 26 33 34 this is attributed to various factors including the presence of co existing ions variable initial nh4 n concentration ph temperature composition and chemical modification of clinoptilolite that are known to impact the adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite 35 37 although clinoptilolite has been extensively studied for ammonia adsorption only a few studies have focused on clinoptilolite based ammonia recovery from swine wastewater 5 31 38 41 furthermore there are no known studies on targeted ammonia recovery from anmbr treated swine permeate using natural clinoptilolite which has obvious benefits as discussed earlier in this context this is the first comprehensive study to evaluate clinoptilolite based ammonia recovery from simulated synthetic anmbr swine permeate using batch experiments combined with appropriate modeling analysis and detailed surface elemental characterization by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds additionally to evaluate the applicability and scale up potential replicable dynamic column experiments with side by side breakthrough curve comparisons for both synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater were performed with detailed temporal characterization of ion release profile from the columns the breakthrough curves were intimately coupled with fixed bed modeling analysis thereby enabling extrapolation of clinoptilolite adsorption performance for a variety of ammonia capture scenarios from swine permeate real swine wastewater and potentially other comparable wastewater types experiments on the effects of co existing competing ions on ammonia recovery and sorbed clinoptilolite regenerability evaluations with nacl were also performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 clinoptilolite characteristics clinoptilolite media zeobest used in this study to remove ammonia was purchased from northern filter media inc iowa usa the chemical composition of the clinoptilolite media was provided by the vendor and is shown in si table s1 the total cation exchange capacity determined for ammonium n was reported to be between 1 2 and 1 8 meq g clinoptilolite as per the manufacturer s specifications for all experiments in this study the clinoptilolite media was used as received without any pretreatment or rinsing with di water 2 2 synthetic swine permeate composition synthetic swine effluent simulating treated permeate from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr system was prepared in reference to 42 43 and the wastewater composition from the swine waste lagoon located at the kansas state university animal farm manhattan kansas usa in addition the following assumptions were made 1 90 chemical oxygen demand cod removal can be achieved within the anmbr system treating an influent total cod of 10 800 mg l resulting in an effluent cod of 1080 mg l based on the system s previous performance 18 2 no nutrient removal occurs within the bioreactor and hence the concentrations of nh4 n p and other cations in the effluent will remain the same as the influent the composition of the prepared solution is shown in table 2 2 3 effect of contact time and kinetics of ammonia recovery the effect of contact time to reach equilibrium was studied for an initial concentration of 400 mg l nh4 n in nh4cl solution samples were collected periodically for 840 min a duration long enough to achieve equilibrium based on preliminary contact time experiments these samples were filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters and analyzed for ammonium concentration subsequently kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo 44 and pseudo second order pso 45 were evaluated to understand the kinetics of ammonia removal using clinoptilolite further to understand the mechanism of ammonia capture intra particle diffusion model 46 was also investigated on the kinetic data the kinetic experiment was performed in duplicate and average ammonia concentration was used to plot the graph and modeling analysis 2 4 particle characterization using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir surface high resolution imaging to determine the surface morphology and elemental composition of the clinoptilolite particles from the batch experiment with synthetic swine wastewater before and after ammonia capture was done using an fei nova nanosem 450 scanning electron microscope sem with an oxford x max 20mm2 integrated edax silicon drift detector located at the electron nanoscopy instrumentation facility university of nebraska lincoln usa the working distance and accelerating voltage were set to around 5 mm and 20 kv respectively prior to the sem analysis the synthetic swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles were allowed to dry in a desiccator to remove all the moisture and the dried clinoptilolite was used for surface imaging ftir analysis was performed to identify the main chemical groups on raw untreated natural clinoptilolite and clinoptilolite particles treated with nh4cl synthetic swine permeate filtered real swine wastewater respectively using the agilent cary 630 ftir spectrometer for this analysis the treated wet clinoptilolite particles were dried in a desiccator at room temperature and ground to fine powder prior to performing the ftir analysis 2 5 interference of competing ions on ammonia adsorption the impact of co occurring competitive cations such as k mg 2 ca2 and na on ammonia capture was investigated using the respective binary solutions with ammonia the maximum expected swine wastewater concentration of 400 mg l nh4 n and each correspondingly different competing ion of choice added at an initial concentration of 28 meq l corresponding to 400 mg l nh4 n to10g l clinoptilolite in 100 ml di water in addition the effect of simultaneous competition from multiple competing ions in the same working solution was evaluated by adding each of the different ions k mg 2 ca2 and na along with nh4 n at an equal concentration of 28 meq l respectively all the experimental solutions were placed in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm aliquot samples were collected after 24 h and filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters to analyze the concentrations of ammonia and the corresponding competing ion s the experiment was performed in duplicate and average values are reported in this study 2 6 column studies on synthetic swine permeate fixed bed column adsorption studies were performed with a glass column having a diameter of 2 5 cm column height of 15 cm and a packed bed height of 10 cm breakthrough curves to understand the ammonia capture pattern was performed by feeding the synthetic swine permeate composition shown in table 2 into the column in upflow mode using a masterflex peristaltic pump at 1 ml min the breakthrough data from the experiments were fitted to thomas model 47 and compared to the model predicted curves to predict the maximum adsorbate removal capacity as well as understand the dynamic behavior of the ammonia capture in the packed bed column the breakthrough data were also fitted to the yoon nelson model 48 to predict the 50 column breakthrough time each column run was repeated twice 2 7 application on actual swine wastewater to evaluate the potential use of clinoptilolite as a pre treatment system untreated actual swine wastewater collected from the swine waste lagoon at the kansas state university animal farm was treated in a clinoptilolite packed bed column having the same dimension as used in the previous column experiment at flow rate of 1 ml min all column experiments were performed at an environmentally relevant temperature of 25 c prior to column feeding the collected swine wastewater was centrifuged for 10 min in an eppendorf centrifuge 5920 r hauppauge new york usa at 10 000 rpm rotations per minute the supernatant was then filtered through a 1 6 μm glass fiber filter paper the composition of the actual filtered swine wastewater was characterized and is also shown in table 2 additionally synthetic swine wastewater simulating the average composition of the collected real swine wastewater was also prepared and treated in the column to compare the breakthrough behavior of the two different types of wastewaters each column experiment was repeated twice 2 8 regeneration of spent clinoptilolite the recoverability of ammonia and reusability of spent clinoptilolite was evaluated in a batch experiment involving four successive adsorption and desorption cycles each adsorption cycle involved adding 1 g of clinoptilolite in 100 ml of each of the two synthetic swine permeate solutions having different initial ammonia concentrations of 400 mg l nh4 n or 100 mg l nh4 n respectively and placed on an orbital shaker for 24 h at 300 rpm at the end of each adsorption cycle the spent clinoptilolite was filtered out from the swine permeate solutions using 1 6 μm glass fiber filter and added to 100 ml solutions of 0 5 m nacl to desorb the captured ammonia and regenerate the spent clinoptilolite all experiments were performed in duplicate initial and final sample aliquots were collected and analyzed for ammonia concentrations to determine the amount of ammonia adsorbed or desorbed 2 9 analytical methods the concentration of ammonia in the batch isotherm experiments and desorption study was analyzed with hach tnt 832 high range ammonia kit using a hach dr3900 loveland co usa spectrophotometer in all other experiments concentration of ions including na k ca2 mg2 nh4 so4 2 and no3 were measured using dionex ics 5000 ion chromatography system po4 3 was also analyzed using the dionex ics 5000 ion chromatography system with a few exceptions when hach tnt 846 phosphorus reactive ortho kit was used deionized water 18 2 mω cm resistivity was used to make stock solutions for preparing dilutions and all chemical analyses chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed with hach kits tnt 825 ph was monitored using fisherbrand accumet ab150 ph benchtop meters 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of ammonia adsorption the kinetics of ammonia adsorption was studied using the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models the nonlinear pseudo first order kinetic rate order proposed by lagergren 44 is represented by eq 1 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t where qt qe and k1 are the amount of ammonia captured per gram clinoptilolite at time t mg g amount of ammonia captured at equilibrium mg g and the pfo rate constant min 1 respectively the nonlinear form of pseudo second order model is represented by eq 2 2 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where qt mg g is the amount of ammonia capture per gram clinoptilolite at time t min qe mg g is the amount of ammonia capture at equilibrium and k2 is the pso rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the kinetic experiment data were fitted to both the models by nonlinear regression curve fitting using the levenberg marquardt algorithm in originpro 2019b software fig 1a presents the nonlinear regression curve fitting plots of both models along with the experimental ammonia uptake data and the estimated model parameters are summarized in table 3 based on the r2 value pseudo second order r2 0 98 seems a better fit than pseudo first order r2 0 93 and the pso model calculated qe 15 8 mg g was also very close to the experimental equilibrium uptake of 15 77 mg g the better fit with pseudo second order kinetic model suggests that ammonia capture by clinoptilolite is likely governed by chemisorption or ion exchange mechanism and dependent on both the adsorbent clinoptilolite and the adsorbate ammonia 49 51 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models do not give any information on the ammonia diffusion mechanism therefore to gain insight into the diffusion mechanisms of ammonia adsorption and determine the rate controlling steps the experimental data were applied to the intra particle diffusion model described by weber and morris 46 eq 3 3 q t k t 0 5 c where qt mg g is the ammonia uptake at time t min and k mg g 1 min 0 5 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c is the intercept of the slope of the curve which is also indicative of the boundary layer thickness the model assumes intraparticle diffusion to be rate controlling if the line from the plot of qt versus t0 5 intercepts the origin fig 1b shows three linear regions of ammonia uptake region 1 with a steeper slope represents the external film diffusion controlled adsorption and the region 2 likely being pore diffusion controlled followed by the equilibrium stage in region 3 the results reveal that ammonium adsorption occurs as a combination of both external film diffusion and pore diffusion the former with a steeper slope occurs very fast and the latter is the slower rate controlling process this was further investigated by determining the film diffusion df and particle diffusion dp coefficients to understand the contribution of each diffusion mechanism using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 film diffusion model ln 1 q t q e k f t 5 particle diffusion model ln 1 q t q e 2 2 k p t where qt and qe are the amount of ammonia uptake per gram clinoptilolite at time t mg g kf is the film diffusion rate constant represented by kf dfc czhr and kp is the particle diffusion rate constant represented by kp dp π 2 r2 c and cz mg kg are the concentration of ammonia in solution and on the zeolite respectively r is the average particle radius 0 0005 m of clinoptilolite used in the present study h is the thickness of film around the clinoptilolite particle 10 5 m for poorly stirred solution 8 52 the calculated values of df and dp are summarized in table 3 the value of film diffusion coefficient df was greater than the particle diffusion coefficient dp which further confirmed particle diffusion to be the rate limiting step a similar conclusion was reached by lin et al 53 for natural clinoptilolite based ammonia removal at an initial concentration of 1000 mg n l batch equilibrium isotherm experiments were also performed and modeled using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the results of the isotherm experiment are discussed in the supplementary information si the isotherm data and model parameters are shown and summarized in si fig s 1 and table s 2 respectively 3 2 scanning electron microscopy and surface elemental composition of clinoptilolite scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed to compare the surface morphology of the clinoptilolite particle before and after contact with synthetic swine permeate the scanning electron micrographs of the untreated clinoptilolite particle fig 2a and synthetic swine permeate contacted particle fig 2b showed the particle surface as rough and irregular additionally the untreated raw natural clinoptilolite particle surface appeared to be covered with fine particles on the surface unlike the synthetic swine permeate treated micrograph which appeared more refined likely due to the absence of fine particles this refined appearance of the treated clinoptilolite could possibly be due to the rinsing effect of permeate treatment on the particles which were under constant agitation during the batch experiments the representative eds spectrum for both raw and treated clinoptilolite samples is shown in fig 2c and fig 2d respectively the raw clinoptilolite spectrum had peaks corresponding to calcium sodium oxygen silica aluminum iron and potassium the presence of the above mentioned ions is similar to the elemental composition from the xrf data for raw clinoptilolite provided by the manufacturer si table s1 the eds based surface elemental composition of both synthetic swine permeate treated and raw clinoptilolite is represented as atomic percentage and weight percentage in table 4 the sodium percentage contribution in the raw clinoptilolite reduced from 1 73 to 0 41 wt in the treated sample indicating loss of sodium ion from the particle this is indicative of sodium likely being a counter ion for ion exchange of ammonia on the clinoptilolite surface a similar pattern of decrease in sodium and potassium from natural clinoptilolite after adsorption in nh4cl solution was observed by lin et al 53 furthermore the treated clinoptilolite also witnessed a decrease in potassium k and iron fe percentages which may have also been involved in the ion exchange process interestingly magnesium mg and phosphorus p were detected in the treated particles but their absence from the raw natural clinoptilolite indicate that they likely originated from the synthetic swine permeate the presence of p indicated that apart from ion exchange mechanism of ammonia capture there is also the possibility of precipitation of phosphate based minerals that occurs when phosphate reacts with ammonia magnesium or calcium the detection of p in the present study is consistent with the eds result from a previous study that reported the formation of phosphate based precipitates calcium phosphate and struvite and that the zeolite could provide nucleation sites for precipitate formation 5 further investigation with xrd or other relevant surface characterization can confirm this possibility the results of the ftir analysis in si fig s3 shows the ir spectra of raw natural clinoptilolite particles and clinoptilolite after treatment with nh4cl solution synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater the transmittance spectra revealed no significant differences between the raw natural clinoptilolite and ammonia saturated clinoptilolites from different solutions the absorption peaks representative of clinoptilolite were observed in all the different conditions the absorption peak around 605 cm 1 signifies bicyclovibration of o si o or o al o 54 the absorption peak around 1030 cm 1 was likely due to si o si skeletal vibration 25 the peak representing h o h vibration around 1630 cm 1 represents the water of hydration within the clinoptilolite particles 55 interestingly a noticeable difference between the raw untreated clinoptilolite and ammonia saturated clinoptilolite was observed by the absorption peak around 1400 cm 1 all the ammonia saturated clinoptilolite treated with nh4cl initial concentration 400 mg n l synthetic swine permeate initial concentration 400 mg n l and filtered real swine wastewater initial concentration 81 mg n l had the absorption peak around 1400 1430 cm 1 this absorption band is representative of nh4 bending vibration indicating the presence of ammonium ions on the clinoptilolite 38 55 56 the intensity of the ammonia absorption peak is lower in the real swine wastewater treated clinoptilolite particles which could be attributed to its lower initial ammonium concentration overall these results in a way indicate that organic moieties did not play a big role in specific ammonia adsorption and were mainly driven by ion exchange as evidenced by the ion release profiles and sem edx 3 3 column adsorption study with synthetic swine permeate the breakthrough curves of two synthetic swine permeate replicate runs are shown in fig 3a and 3b respectively the breakthrough curve of each run appeared s shaped and the breakpoint c c0 0 1 occurred around 10 5 h in both replicates the column reached exhaustion c c0 0 9 after 28 h in run 1 and 30 h in run 2 the breakthrough curves are also represented with respect to the bed volumes treated in si fig s4 the adsorption capacity of the clinoptilolite bed at breakthrough and exhaustion were calculated using eq 6 6 q t c 0 q 0 t 1 c c o dt m where qt mg g is the adsorption capacity at time t hour c0 mg l is the initial influent ammonium concentration c mg l is the effluent ammonium concentration at time t hours m g is the mass of clinoptilolite in the column bed q l h is the flow rate of synthetic swine permeate fed into the column at breakthrough point the adsorption capacity of the column was found to be 5 55 mg g and 5 63 mg g for run 1 and 2 respectively the total ammonia capture capacity of the column calculated at c c0 1 was 10 15 mg g for run1 and 9 68 mg g for run 2 these values were slightly lower than 11 2 mg g from the batch study si fig s2 at similar initial concentration 400 mg l nh4 n in the synthetic swine permeate the lower adsorption capacity of the column may be due to the column bed not reaching equilibrium due to shorter contact time than the batch experiment 57 the ion exchange mechanism within the column was investigated by analyzing the temporal ion release or capture profile of different cations in samples collected from the column outlet the release profiles for each column are presented in fig 3c and 3d respectively results indicate that sodium ions were abundantly released from the column during the initial phase of operation while witnessing simultaneous capture of ammonium and potassium ions from the solution approximately 33 8 meq l of na was released in the third hour sample of the first column run while all the ammonium 27 8 meq l in the feed water was captured in the column by that time the release trend showed that na ions were sharply released during the first 3 h before its concentration in the effluent gradually decreased with continuous operation of the column in addition 7 1 meq l of k was captured in the column as per the sample collected in the third hour the release of sodium during the initial duration indicated that the sodium ions were displaced in exchange for ammonia and potassium capture the equivalent amount of sodium released compared to the equivalents of ammonium and potassium captured indicated that sodium was the main counter ion for ammonia capture during this initial phase apart from sodium calcium and potassium ions were also observed to increase with the duration of operation after the column reached breakthrough c c0 0 1 the concentration of na started to gradually decrease while the ammonium and potassium started to increase in the outlet samples these findings are further supported by the sem edx data table 4 shown earlier which confirmed the decrease in na and to a lesser extent k from the synthetic swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles fig 3c and 3d the reversal in adsorption pattern for potassium after reaching breakthrough was also reported by karadag et al 58 who studied ammonia removal from leachate wastewater in a clinoptilolite bed column the affinity of clinoptilolite for potassium is known to be greater than ammonium 59 60 however in the present study potassium eluted from the column prior to ammonium which may have been due to the ammonium equivalents being far greater than potassium in the feed and thereby possibly outcompeting potassium on the clinoptilolite surface overall ion release profile of each column run showed replicable trends of ion elution and needs complementary investigation using deeper analysis tools such as xanes xps spectra for a more mechanistic understanding of ammonia adsorption behavior in the presence of competing ions 3 3 1 breakthrough curve modeling the experimental data based breakthrough curve from each run was applied to the thomas model and yoon nelson model thomas model represented by eq 7 is used to estimate the maximum ammonia adsorption capacity and adsorption rate on the column 47 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t h q e m q k t h c 0 t where ct mg l and c0 mg l are the concentration of ammonia in the effluent at time t hour and the concentration of ammonia in the influent feed respectively the flow time t hour in the expression is calculated as a ratio of effluent volume l at time t and flow rate q l h kth is the model rate constant l hour 1 mg 1 qe is the amount of ammonia adsorbed at equilibrium per gram clinoptilolite mg g and m is the mass of clinoptilolite used in the column g the yoon nelson model represented by eq 8 is useful in predicting the time required to reach 50 adsorbate saturation in the column 8 c t c 0 1 1 exp k yn τ k yn t where kyn hour 1 is the yoon nelson rate constant and τ is the time required to reach 50 adsorbate saturation in the column hour it is to be noted that both the yoon nelson and thomas models are mathematically equivalent and can be expressed as a logistic function eq 9 61 since both the models are mathematically similar it cannot be compared based on the r2 value fitting but can be used simultaneously to determine the different derived parameters from each model 61 9 c t c 0 1 1 exp a bt the model parameters were estimated using non linear regression analysis as it gives a better fit than linear regression 62 using the levenberg marquadt algorithm in originpro 2019b software since both the thomas and yoon nelson models are mathematically equivalent the model predicted breakthrough curves had similar fit qualities and shape for this reason only the thomas model predicted breakthrough curves are shown in fig 3a and fig 3b while the predicted parameters for both the models are summarized in table 5 the thomas model predicted maximum ammonia uptake capacity of 9 8 mg g and 9 54 mg g for each of the column run was very close to the experimentally determined column capacity of 10 15 mg g for run1 and 9 68 mg g for run 2 additionally the time required to reach 50 ammonia breakthrough predicted by the yoon nelson model was also in close agreement with the experimental data for instance 50 ammonia breakthrough time for synthetic permeate run 1 fig 3a was achieved close to 18 h and the model predicted it to be at 17 49 h table 5 overall thomas model and yoon nelson models fit well with the experimental data and can be used to predict ammonia capture from synthetic swine permeate in fixed bed clinoptilolite columns 3 3 2 ammonia capture from real swine wastewater column studies additional column experiments to study ammonia capture from real swine wastewater were performed in duplicate according to the results of the breakthrough curve shown in fig 4a breakpoint c c0 0 1 of ammonia occurred at around 18 h for both replicate runs the column exhaustion c c0 0 9 happened faster for the first run of real swine waste c0 104 mg l after 35 h while taking 44 h for the second run of real swine waste c0 81 mg l this difference of bed exhaustion time between the two swine wastewater runs could be attributed to the slightly higher ammonium concentration in run 1 than run 2 leading to a faster saturation of column 63 the breakthrough curves are also represented with respect to the bed volumes treated in si fig s5 comparing the breakthrough curves of the simulated swine wastewater with those from the real swine runs fig 4a it was seen that there is not much difference in the breakpoint times of the two samples which bodes well for extending the mechanistic understanding from the synthetic swine permeate to the real swine wastewater fig 4a also demonstrated that ammonia recovery on clinoptilolite was not adversely impacted by the real wastewater matrix the ion release profile of the two different samples shown in fig 4b and 4c showed similar trends of ion capture and release as the synthetic permeate runs which is one of the first side by side comparisons for ammonia sorption from synthetic and real swine wastewater on clinoptilolite the impact of temperature needs to be investigated for future works based on published literature ammonia adsorption using bentonite is not really affected by low temperatures at the same ph and is impacted by the presence of competing ions such as na and ca2 at lower temperatures 64 according to wasielewski et al 65 temperature did not really impact the clinoptilolite based ammonia rate kinetics when comparing the ammonia removal efficiencies at 10 22 and 30 c although removal efficiency at equilibrium was found to be slightly higher as temperature increased 3 3 3 simultaneous phosphorus removal from swine waste in all the column studies there was a decline in phosphate po4 3 concentration while treating both the synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater for both the simulated swine permeate column runs fig 3 c and 3d the concentration of phosphate gradually declined from 8 meq l in the feed to 2 7 meq l a similar pattern of phosphate removal was observed in the real swine wastewater run 2 fig 4b during which the po4 3 concentration declined from 4 7 meq l in the feed to as low as 1 8 meq l this was further confirmed by using synthetic swine wastewater with similar composition to the real swine wastewater fig 4c as the po4 3 concentration decreased from 2 9 meq l in the feed to 1 5 meq l in the column effluent after 18 h these results further confirm the detection of phosphorus in the eds results for clinoptilolite particles treated with the synthetic swine permeate which could be due to the formation of phosphate based precipitates previous studies 5 38 66 68 have reported removal of phosphorus on zeolites although natural clinoptilolite does not have any anion exchange capacity the removal mechanism postulated is that cations ca2 and mg2 released from the surface of the zeolite during nh4 capture bind to phosphate to form calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite and struvite precipitates 32 38 67 in the present study the localized precipitation on the clinoptilolite surface did not decrease the overall ammonia capture efficiency indicating that precipitation neither caused pore clogging nor consequently decrease the ion exchange capacity apart from binding with the cations released from the zeolite phosphate could also possibly participate in precipitation reactions with the cations present in the wastewater overall clinoptilolite can effectively remove ammonia from swine wastewater with simultaneous recovery of phosphorus additionally the sorbed clinoptilolite can be directly applied as a soil amendment enabling slow release of nutrients in the soil 3 4 effect of competing ions on ammonia sorption the ammonium selectivity with respect to each of the tested competing ions was assessed by comparing the adsorption capacity of ammonium in the different solutions and is shown in fig 5 it was observed that ammonium adsorption was lowest at 7 22 mg n g in the presence of potassium followed by calcium 14 4 mg n g sodium 15 4 mg n g and magnesium 16 mg n g in the solution containing the same equivalent concentration of all the ions the ammonia adsorption was lowest at 4 7 mg n g which is likely due to the high equivalent concentration of all ions exerting a greater competition for the adsorption sites on the clinoptilolite than in any of the binary solution mixtures based on the observed results the order of selectivity of different cations with respect to ammonia recovery was found to be k ca2 na mg2 this is in agreement with previous studies which have also reported a similar selectivity of k ca2 na 34 69 however there is variability in the selectivity preference of calcium sodium and potassium ions in the literature some studies have reported greater affinity for sodium over potassium and calcium 33 35 while others have reported an order of preference of ca2 mg2 k na 38 this variability in preference could be attributed to the properties and composition of the zeolite used and the conditions that they are used in in summary the present study investigated the effect of different cations that are most commonly encountered in wastewater and are anticipated to have the greatest impact on ammonia recovery it is recommended to study the effects of various other cations and anions including fe3 cl co3 2 and so4 2 to develop a deeper understanding and further optimize real world applicability of clinoptilolite for swine wastewater ammonia capture 3 5 clinoptilolite regeneration using brine solution the results of the regeneration efficiency of the spent clinoptilolite are shown in fig 6 the amount of ammonia desorbed and desorption efficiency are calculated by eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 10 q d c d v m 11 desorption efficiency q d q e 100 where qd mg g and qe mg g are the amount of ammonia desorbed and amount of ammonia adsorbed respectively cd mg l is the concentration of ammonia released from the clinoptilolite in the regenerant solution v is the volume of regenerant used l and m is the mass of clinoptilolite g the adsorption capacity at 400 mg l nh4 n in synthetic swine permeate gradually declined from 11 6 mg g cycle 1 7 5 mg g cycle 4 in the desorption experiments ammonia desorption capacity was 8 3 mg g cycle 1 7 57 mg g cycle 2 7 8 mg g cycle 3 6 64 mg cycle 4 indicating that although the 0 5 m nacl brine solution could not completely desorb all the ammonium ions from the clinoptilolite it was consistently able to maintain a desorption efficiency greater than 69 from clinoptilolite treated with 400 mg l nh4 n the variability in the adsorption and desorption capacities is attributed to accumulation of ammonium along with other cations k mg2 or ca2 present in the synthetic swine permeate on the clinoptilolite 39 the ammonia adsorption capacity in 100 mg l nh4 n simulated swine permeate solution was in the range of 2 97 to 4 6 mg g and desorption efficiency was consistently above 78 for the 4 cycles overall the regeneration results indicate that nacl as a regenerant can be applied in an anmbr treatment system to maximize nh4 recovery while minimizing volatilization losses furthermore the brine solution needed for this purpose can be sustainably recovered from the swine wastewater itself with microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrec 70 4 conclusion the results of this study represent a comprehensive and reliable demonstration of the potential of clinoptilolite as an effective adsorbent for sustainably capturing and recovering ammonia from both synthetic swine permeate and real swine wastewater the kinetic experimental data fitted better with pseudo second order model and intraparticle pore diffusion was determined to be the rate limiting process for ammonia adsorption by clinoptilolite eds results revealed changes in surface elemental composition on the synthetic swine treated clinoptilolite particles with increases in phosphorus and magnesium and reduction in sodium weight percentages replicate column studies showed successful capture of ammonia from the swine wastewater with simultaneous phosphate based mineral precipitation ion release profiles revealed that na and ca2 were the main counterions for ammonia capture which further support the earlier observations from sem eds analyses of the swine permeate treated clinoptilolite particles ammonia capture is affected by the presence of competing ions especially k and the selectivity of different cations with respect to ammonia exchange was found to be k ca2 na mg2 regeneration of spent clinoptilolite with nacl consistently achieved desorption efficiency greater than 69 over 4 cycles which showed that brine solution can be an effective way to recover ammonia in the liquid form while reusing the clinoptilolite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13353,carboxymethyl cellulose sodium cmc is widely used in paper making and textile industries and the treatment of cmc wastewater containing salt and alkali has become one of the hot spots in the field of wastewater treatment in this study poly vinyl alcohol pva polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes were prepared through non solvent induced phase inversion nips and cross linking for the separation of cmc and salt alkali scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to characterize the morphology and surface properties of the membranes the results showed that both heat cross linking and chemical cross linking with glutaraldehyde ga improved the structural stability of the pva ptfe membranes the salt alkali optional transmitting rate otr the cmc rejection rate and the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane are 93 0 99 3 220 00 l m2h and 93 4 99 4 89 20 l m2h at 0 2 mpa respectively besides the ga cross linked pva ptfe membrane showed stable and efficient separation performance in the test of separating cmc therefore the resultant membrane can be used for the separation of cmc salt and alkali providing a new idea for the treatment of high salt alkali cellulose wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords poly vinyl alcohol ultrafiltration membrane cross linking carboxymethyl cellulose sodium polytetrafluoroethylene 1 introduction carboxymethyl cellulose sodium cmc is an anionic polymer compound and is commonly used in the paper making and textile industries 1 2 it plays a major role in improving adhesion and moisturizing however it is accompanied by a large amount of salt and alkali in wastewater 3 4 membrane separation technology such as electrodialysis ed 5 6 and diffusive dialysis dd 7 9 is used as an environmentally friendly treatment process without secondary pollution and applied to the removal of macromolecules or the recovery of salt and alkali although the above methods are applicable they are accompanied by a large amount of energy consumption and high processing costs moreover for the recovery of alkali and salt the stability of the membrane material in the lye will become a key factor restricting the recovery of alkali 10 therefore it is great significance to developing an anti fouling ultrafiltration membrane with low energy consumption high flux and stability in a strongly alkaline environment polyvinyl alcohol pva is a water soluble biocompatible and biodegradable synthetic polymer 11 12 pva has good hydrophilicity and extremely easy swelling characteristics 13 14 due to a large number of hydroxyl groups in its molecular chain and these hydroxyl groups also become the reaction sites for pva to form hydrogen bonds and cross linked structures with other molecules 15 16 however when the concentration of pva aqueous solution exceeds 10 it is easy to gel at room temperature which is not conducive to the preparation of the pva membrane therefore the preparation of the pva membrane is generally made by solvent evaporation with low concentration pva solution or by blending pva with polysilicon copolymers through the sol gel method pva has been widely involved in the preparation of pervaporation pv 17 18 membranes wang et al 19 used solvent evaporation to prepare a pva pv membrane containing schiff base network snw 1 nanoparticles the study found that the separation factor is 1501 and the permeation flux reaches 187 g m 2h of the membrane with 10 wt loadings of snw 1 at 75 c sakarkar et al 20 used solvent evaporation to prepare a pva tio2 solution coated pvdf membrane for dye removal the experimental results showed that as the pva content increases the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the membrane is better and the dye removal rate is also increased hao et al 7 prepared cationic exchange membranes using pva and polysilicon as copolymers by the sol gel method the diffusion dialysis dd process for the alkali mixture indicates that the dialysis coefficients of naoh uoh are around 0 0065 0 0086 m h and the separation factors s are in the range of 24 4 51 6 for the naoh na2wo4 system wu et al 21 prepared a quaternized poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide qppo and pva anion exchange membranes by sol gel method the diffusion dialysis dd process for the acid mixture suggests that the dialysis coefficient of hcl uh increases from 0 021 m h to 0 049 m h but the separation factor s decreases from 39 to 26 for the hcl fecl2 system the pervaporation pv membrane generally adopts the pva surface coating method to form a dense selective layer on the surface of the support to increase the efficiency 22 or use pva to blend with other fillers to prepare pv membranes by the thermally induced phase inversion tips method 23 it is worth noting that the use of these pva membrane is mainly dd membrane and pv membrane uf membranes with pva as the subject material have a high swelling degree and difficult pore size control there were few reports about the pva uf membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe has good chemical resistance heat resistance chemical inertness and hydrophobicity 24 26 due to its excellent performance and good dispersion characteristics ptfe emulsion is widely used in nanofiber membranes 27 28 and microporous membranes 29 zhang et al 30 used ptfe as the support membrane ptfe emulsion and carbon black cb were coated on the surface of the support membrane to prepare a ptfe cb microporous membrane the prepared ptfe cb microporous membrane has high tensile strength and high hydrophobicity yu et al 31 electrospun the ptfe pva spinning solution into a precursor nanofiber membrane to introduce a dispersion of ptfe hexafluoropropylene fep by electrostatic spraying the original fiber mesh structure of electrospinning is optimized for membrane emulsification generally speaking ptfe has no pore forming effect we innovatively use the hydrophobicity of ptfe and the hydrophilicity of pva and use the difference in compatibility between the two phases to achieve the pore forming effect of the uf membrane in this study we proposed a novel method for preparing pva ptfe uf membranes which has not been reported in the previous literature this work shows for the first time the use of ptfe emulsion as a porogen followed by cross linking treatment to further improve membrane performance so it s still green reducing the use of a lot of organic solvents water being used as the solvent the preparation process is simple cheap and is suitable for large scale production of low cost uf membranes for the treatment of high salinity cellulose wastewater the gel properties of pva solution were overcome by controlling the temperature of the aqueous solution of pva ptfe the pva ptfe membrane was prepared by nips and cross linking it is worth noting that the newly developed pva ptfe membrane is in situ chemically cross linked simplifying the process procedure at the same time it can be heat treated to further improve various properties of the membrane providing new ideas for the synergistic modification of pva membrane in the separation process of cmc and saline alkali it has good cmc retention and saline alkali separation rate which provides a new strategy for the desalination and de alkalization of solutions containing cellulose and its derivatives 2 experimental section 2 1 materials polyvinyl alcohol pva 1799 polytetrafluoethylene concentrated dispersion 60

complete dissolution 17 5 wt pva was added and stirred at 95 c and 200 r min for 2 h to fully dissolve the pva and then varied amount ptfe emulsion 5 10 15 and 20 to the mass of pva was added with further heating and stirring for 6 h casting solution was obtained with the ptfe particles evenly dispersed the casting solution cooled naturally to room temperature 25 c then 0 2 ml hydrochloric acid and 2 wt ga was added drop by drop slowly with gradually increasing the temperature from 25 c to 60 c this solution was kept warm for 50 min and defrosted in a vacuum oven for 30 min the casting solution was uniformly coated on the glass plate followed by immersing in an ethanol coagulation bath the membrane was formed by the nips process and then it was heated at 120 c for 1 h chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was successfully prepared the membrane without ga in the casting solution was named heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane 2 3 membrane characterization the morphology of the pva ptfe membrane was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem phenom xl holland and true color confocal microscopy csm csm700 germany the chemical structure of the membrane

scale cross flow filtration system fig s1 at 0 2 mpa and 25 c the membrane module was stabilized at 0 2 mpa for 30 min before data collection the membrane flux is calculated using eq 1 1 j w v a t where jw is the flux l m2h v is the volume of membrane permeation l a is the effective surface area of membrane m2 and t is the testing time h the rejection of salt and alkali is calculated using eq 2 2 r s c f s c p s c f s where cf s and c p s are the concentrations of the feed solution and permeation solution respectively in the process of testing the salt permeate performance the conductivity meter is used to test the salt concentration of the feed liquid and the permeate liquid respectively acridine orange dye was utilized to characterize the cellulose removal performance of the membrane fig s2 the cmc concentration in the test process was 1 g l the pressure at 0 2 mpa and 25 c in the process of determining cmc concentration the standard curve of cmc was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer and the cmc concentration corresponding to absorbance was calculated according to the standard curve fig s3 before the swelling test the membranes were initially dried to a constant weight in the oven then several groups of membranes with a mass of m1 about 0 05 g were weighed in an analytical balance and immersed in deionized water at room temperature for 2 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium finally the membranes were carefully taken out and quickly dried the liquid on the membrane surface with filter paper and weighed as m2 in mass the swelling degree of the membranes was calculated by eq 3 3 η m 2 m 1 m 1 where m1 and m2 are dry membrane weight g and the swelling after reaching adsorption equilibrium membrane weight g the anti fouling property of the membrane was tested by using cmc 2 g l solution as the pollution model the operating pressure was 0 2 mpa and the temperature was 25 c flux recovery rate frr total pollution rt irreversible pollution

rir jw1 and jw2 are water flux before and after pollution jp is the flux in the cmc solution reversible membrane pollution is caused by concentration polarization but irreversible pollution can be attributed to the adsorption and deposition of cmc on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pva ptfe membranes the intermolecular interaction between the pva molecule and the cross linking agent was investigated by ftir as shown in fig 2 the peaks at 2925 cm 1 and 3400 3200 cm 1 can be assigned to ch2 stretching vibration and oh stretching vibration respectively because there are a large number of hydroxyl groups on the pva molecular chain and it is a multi associative body the absorption band shifted to low frequency at the same time it represented the existence of a host number of hydrogen bonds between pva molecules leading to its easy swelling characteristics 32 the peaks at 1094 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 can be associated with alcohol hydroxyl and 1417 cm 1 and 1645 cm 1 can be indicated the ch2 bending vibration and variable angle vibration and absorbed water bending vibration the peaks at 1176 cm 1 can be linked to the cf2 group symmetrical stretching 33 the peak at 1220 cm 1 should belong to the c o c bond stretching vibration which can be caused by the pva self cross linking and the cross linking of ga and pva it indicated that both physical cross linking and chemical cross linking make the pva membrane have a spatial cross linking structure the surface chemical composition of the pva ptfe membrane was measured with xps as showed in fig 3 a the full spectrum results showed that they are composed of c1s o1s and f1s peaks and their electron binding energies are 285 0 ev 532 2 ev and 689 4 ev respectively fitting and splitting the peaks of c1s as showed in fig 3 bd it is found that there are two peaks of co 286 6 ev and c c c h 285 0 ev 34 compared to the three kinds of membranes it is found that the uncross linked pva ptfe membrane has a low co peak intensity indicated that pva molecules are not dehydrated and the cross linking has not proceeded after heat cross linking the increasing intensity of the co peak suggested that the hydroxyl groups on the pva segment were dehydrated and the ether bond began to form after ga cross linking the co peak intensity was the highest indicated that cross linking degree is more thorough by ga than that by heating the c o ratio and degree of crosslinking of the three membranes also showed that ga cross linking is beneficial to the formation of the pva cross linking network table 1 tg and dtg curves of pva ptfe membranes showed after the cross linking treatment the thermodynamic properties of the membrane are stable and unchanged at the actual operating ambient temperature fig s4 it can be seen from fig s4 b that the three stage weight loss of pva is 50 150 c 275 400 c and 425 500 c 35 the membrane added with ptfe exhibited a fourth stage weight loss at 500 600 c the membranes begin to degrade at 50 c which was mainly due to the evaporation of water in the material the second part was the rupture of the pva molecular chain and the weight loss of hydroxyl groups the third stage was the cyclization reaction and the weight loss of the remaining hydroxyl groups 36 the fourth stage of weight loss was ptfe particles via chemical crosslinking the weight loss temperature of the membrane shifted to high temperature this showed that the cross linked structure improved the thermal stability of the membrane the crystallinity of the membranes was characterized by xrd in fig s5 there were two different peaks in the xrd pattern 18 15 and 19 80 2θ 18 15 was the 100 crystal plane of ptfe 37 2θ 19 80 represented the 101 crystal plane of pva with increasing the degree of cross linking the peaks became lower and wider because the cross linking diminished the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in pva 38 39 the intensity of the peaks at 18 15 and 19 80 decreased with the degree of the cross linking which indicated that the cross linking hindered the crystallization of pva molecular chains during the heat treatment of pva at 100 200 c the bound water was first removed and then the molecules moved to form a crystal structure finally the crystal structure was destroyed and intermolecular dehydration and other transformations occurred 40 during the heat treatment of pva and peg 120 c 1 h part of the peg molecules are oxidized to form a new chemical bond c o c the peg molecules are bonded together at the same time peg and pva can form hydrogen bonds to improve the performance of the membrane as shown in fig 2 there was a c o c bond absorption peak at 1220 cm 1 fig 5 showed a slight decrease in the peak strength of xrd which also indicated that the crystalline structure was destroyed in the heat treatment stage so a partial cross linking structure can be formed fig 4 a showed that the surface of the pure pva membrane is flat without protrusions and no visible holes on the surface resulting in no flux of the pva membrane 41 as showed in fig 4 bd ptfe particles can be seen on the surface of the membrane leading to the formation of large interfacial pores on the surface of the membrane this is mainly because ptfe particles are hydrophobic material and pva is a hydrophilic polymer in the casting solution with water as the solvent the incompatibility between the two phases makes the surface and interior of the membrane showed two phase boundary interfacial pores and plays a porogenic role 42 due to the addition of ptfe particles during the phase inversion process of the membrane there are gaps between the hydrophilic pva and the hydrophobic ptfe particles when immersed in an ethanol solution water molecules are replaced and the pores between the pva and ptfe particles are filled with ethanol after the membrane dries a large number of pores are formed which achieves the effect of pore formation with the development of cross linking the surface of the membrane has a dense cross linking structure and uniform distribution of the membrane surface pores the bottom surface of the pure pva membrane fig 4 a showed large pores while the pores shrunk significantly in the cross linked membrane fig 4 b d folded structure was formed due to the dehydration and cross linking of pva molecules of the pva ptfe membranes this folded structure would benefit to enhance the membrane performance and to improve the membrane strength the addition of ptfe particles increased the pores inside the membrane and the cross section appeared consistent with the distribution of pores on the surface fig 4 b d indicating that the prepared membranes have the same identity and are symmetrical membranes this is mainly because the ptfe particles are uniformly dispersed in the membrane and the pores between the two phases are evenly distributed resulting in the same structure on the surface and inside of the membrane the thickness of the membrane increased from 14 18 μm to 37 88 μm fig s6 indicating that the addition of ptfe increased the porosity of the membrane and caused volume expansion heat cross linking treatment and chemical cross linking treatment did not change the membrane thickness much indicating the cross linking treatment only increased the cross linking network of the membrane but did not affect the basic structure of the membrane the surface roughness of the pva ptfe membranes with different ptfe contents was obtained by true color confocal microscopy in fig 5 a d with the increase of ptfe content the surface roughness of the membrane rose from 0 128 μm of pure pva membrane to 0 767 μm of 15 pva ptfe membrane the low roughness of the pva ptfe membrane with low ptfe content was contributed to the uniformly distribution of the ptfe particles in the membrane however roughness reached high to 0 767 μm with 15 ptfe content due to the agglomeration of pfte particles table s2 in order to verify the influence of the concentration of ptfe nanoparticles on the structure of the pva ptfe membrane we conducted edx experiments as shown in fig 7 a d of the edx of the surface of the pva ptfe membrane obvious agglomeration is noticed when the concentration of ptfe is more than 10 it can be seen that the distribution of ptfe particles in the membrane is related to the surface roughness of the membrane the main reason is that the content of ptfe in the membrane increases and the dispersing effect of ptfe particles in the casting liquid is not good which leads to local agglomeration during the membrane making process which not only increases the internal defects of the membrane but also improves the surface roughness of the membrane 3 2 influence of cross linking mode on membrane performance the data of pure pva ptfe membrane were shown in fig s7 under the condition of 0 1 mpa the flux decreased rapidly with time while the rejection increased both tend to be stable after 30 min therefore the stabilization of the membrane required a minimum of 60 min pre load 30 min the initially rejected solution contained cellulose molecules visible to the naked eye but cellulose molecules disappeared in the rejected solution after 30 min indicating that under the initial conditions of pure pva ptfe membrane the membrane pores were too large to effectively reject cmc since pva is a water soluble polymer its properties are still unstable after membrane formation only by nips and it needs to be passed through cross linking treatment to improve the stability of the membrane fig s10 in fig 6 a as the temperature rose from 110 c to 140 c the flux dropped from 387 26 l m2h to 110 46 l m2h and the rejection to cmc rose from 99 46 to 99 68 in fig 8 b the time of heat treatment at 120 c extended from 20 min to 120 min the flux dropped from 759 76 l m2h to 40 76 l m2h and the rejection rose from 98 9 to 99 63 with the increase of time and temperature of the heat treatment more pva molecules formed cross linking network via dehydration of hydroxyl groups resulting in a decrease in flux and an increase in rejection as shown in fig 6 c d the flux dropped from 359 76 l m2h to 153 36 l m2h and the rejection increased from 99 49 to 99 78 with increasing the ga concentration from 0 to 4 at the same time the elongation at break and tensile strength of the membrane increased from 28 96 to 463 80 and from 25 18 mpa to 29 75 mpa respectively this was explained by the fact that increased energy is required for a fracture of the ga cross linked pva chains resulting in the increases of both the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the membrane it was found that when the ga amount was greater than 2 flux and rejection of the membrane were stable and mechanical strength was good 3 3 the separation performance of pva ptfe membranes the performance of pure pva ptfe membrane under 0 1 mpa was shown in fig s9 with the increase of cmc concentration the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane slowly dropped to equilibrium and the rejection rate also slowly rose to around 99 20 this is because solution viscosity and osmotic pressure increased with the increase of cmc concentration accelerating the flux attenuation of the membrane as shown in fig 9 a b when the cmc concentration increased from 0 5 g l to 3 g l the fluxes of both heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased drastically the main reasons were 1 as the cmc concentration increased concentration polarization caused more cmc molecules to aggregate which increased the mass transfer resistance 2 as the concentration of cmc solution increased its viscosity became larger and its binding force to water molecules increased 3 as the concentration of cmc solution increased the osmotic pressure increased and the operating pressure was partially used to offset the osmotic pressure resulting in a decrease in the actual driving pressure fig 7 c showed that the flux and rejection of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane for cmc solution increased with increasing the temperature of the feed solution from 25 c to 50 c it indicated that the movement of water molecules was intensified at high temperature contributing to the increased flux and the entanglement and shrinking of the pva molecules at high temperature leading to enhancement of cmc rejection 11 therefore it was benefit to improve the separation performance of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane by enhancing the processing temperature the swelling degree of the membranes was shown in fig 7 d the swelling degree of the pva ptfe membrane is larger than that of the pva membrane due to the steric hindrance of the added ptfe particles to pva the swelling rate of the membranes decreased by heat cross linking and chemical cross linking because less water binding to the cross linked pva 43 the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane under 0 1 mpa was shown in fig s12 in naoh nacl different concentrations 0 5 5 g l the trends of pure pva ptfe membranes were similar to those of pva ptfe membranes prepared by the two cross linking strategies however in nacl solution compared with heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane the flux decay of pure pva ptfe membrane was as high as 42 21 and the nacl transmittance was unchanged compared with the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the flux attenuation was larger and the transmission rate of nacl was lower this was mainly due to the poor structural stability of pure pva ptfe and heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes in naoh solution the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane only increased by 35 71 compared with that of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane the main reason was that the operating pressure was lower at 0 1 mpa and the rate of oh immersed into the membrane matrix decreases which slowed down the destruction of membrane structure compared with the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the transmittance of naoh decreased this indicated that a large amount of oh was still consumed in the process of structural destruction in the membrane the pva ptfe membrane flux and salt alkali optional transmitting rate otr in different concentrations of nacl and naoh aqueous solutions were tested in fig 8 a b with the increase of nacl concentration the flux of heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased by 16 48 and 25 09 respectively however the salt transmitting rate of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane is lower than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane because the low degree of cross linking of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and the electronegativity of the hydroxyl groups in the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was also more than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane as shown in fig 8 c d with the increase of naoh concentration the flux of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 104 63 and 73 05 respectively when the naoh concentration surpassed 2 g l the flux of the two membranes rose sharply due to the interaction between oh and uncross linked oh groups which aggravated the swelling of the membrane and even caused defects in the membranes the molecular weight cut off of the two membranes may not be able to explain this problem fig s13 but mass attenuation of the two cross linked membranes in lye also explains this phenomenon fig s14 however at low concentrations the alkali otr of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane were 88 62 and 97 21 respectively which were lower than those of salt otr the main reason was due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups on the pva molecular chain and oh on the other side the alkali otr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was lower than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane because a large number of hydroxyl groups in the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane inhibited the transport of oh across the membrane 44 to verify the membrane performance in the actual separation process otr and cmc rejection of the aqueous solutions with 1 g l cmc and different concentrations of nacl and naoh were tested as shown in fig 9 a b with the increase of nacl concentration the flux of heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased by 21 21 and 11 13 respectively otr and cmc rejection of the two membranes were similar the flux attenuation of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes in nacl and cmc solution 21 21 in fig 9 a was higher than that only in nacl solution 16 48 in fig 8 a because the cmc tended to penetrate into the larger pores fig s11 a 0 43 μm of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes resulting in partially blockage of the pores however the flux attenuation of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes in nacl and cmc solution 11 13 in fig 9 b was much lower than that only in nacl solution 25 09 in fig 8 b this mainly was due to the contamination of cmc on the surface of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes with smaller pore size and narrower pore size distribution fig s11 b a cmc buffer layer was produced on the membrane surface to hinder the enrichment of salt which weakened the concentration polarization of the membrane as shown in fig 9 c d with the increase of naoh concentration the flux of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 38 64 and 38 70 respectively although the flux of the cross linked membranes in nacl and cmc solutions decreased on account of cmc deposition and concentration polarization the flux of those membranes in naoh and cmc solution increased owing to the deformation of the cross linked structure of pva at high naoh concentration at the same time the alkali otr of the two membranes in naoh and cmc solution was greatly lower than that in the naoh solution without cmc fig 8 c d especially at low naoh concentrations the enrichment of cmc on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores causing more hydroxyl groups from cmc interacting with pva and naoh slowing down the transmission of oh under the condition of high nacl concentration 10 g l the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane still showed a stable processing capacity the flux attenuation was small and the cmc rejection and nacl otr increased slightly under the action of a high concentration of naoh the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 74 09 the cmc rejection rate was lower than 90 and the naoh otr remained unchanged the flux of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 46 74 the cmc rejection rate was 93 30 and the naoh otr remained stable this showed that under high alkali conditions the internal structure of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was partially destroyed and defects increased which led to a decrease in membrane performance the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane has stronger tolerance and a more stable structure which was suitable for high alkali environments 3 4 anti fouling ability comparison of commercial membrane and cross linked pva ptfe membranes cmc 2 g l solution was used to simulate the membrane fouling process to facilitate comparisons all permeate fluxes were normalized based on the initial flux as shown in fig 10 a b the flux trend of the pva ptfe membrane and commercial membranes in water and cmc cycle tests with time was given when the cmc solution replaced pure water the flux decline rates were in the order of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane 91 23 pan membrane 86 89 psf membrane 81 73 heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane 79 10 pes membrane 67 59 it was found that the flux of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane decreased the most resulting in the largest pollution mainly due to the highest porosity of the membrane surface fig s14 and the existence of a large number of small pores on the surface of the membrane fig 6d the membrane specific surface area was large cmc molecules deposition on the membrane surface aggravated the membrane pollution however the surface porosity and specific surface area of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane were smaller fig 6c the deposition sites of cmc molecules on the membrane surface reduced and the membrane fouling was less after washing the frr of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was the highest while the frr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was lower this was because the cmc molecule itself also contained a large number of hydroxyl groups which formed a hydrogen bond with the pva molecular chain 45 preventing the separation of the cmc molecule at the same time there were more hydroxyl groups on the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane which can be more stably combined with cmc molecules resulting in a decrease in the frr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane its hydrophilic membrane surface helping to remove the deposited cmc layer fig s15 as shown in fig s16 the heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes still maintained a good flux recovery rate after 5 cycles the flux recovery rate of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was stable at 79 and the flux recovery rate of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was stable at 81 table s1 this showed that the anti fouling performance of the membrane was stable the flux attenuation caused mainly by two parts rir was mainly caused by cmc irreversible pollution to the membrane surface and pores resulting in a significant decrease in membrane flux after washing with water the membrane flux recovered to a greater extent and the recovered part is rr this was mainly because cmc formed an unstable filter cake layer on the membrane surface under the effect of concentration polarization 46 which resulted in augmented mass transfer resistance and greater flux attenuation it showed that concentration polarization has the greatest impact on membrane performance 3 5 stability of the membrane fig 11 showed the stability test by separating the cmc solution of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linking pva ptfe membrane it is found that the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane decreases by 42 99 from the initial to 24 h and its rejection rate remains at 98 50 the flux of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane remained balanced after 4 h only attenuated by 16 77 and the flux remained at 89 20 l m2h the rejection rate remained at 99 40 it showed that the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane had better stability fig s17 shows the surface morphology of the two membranes after 24 h of operation indicating that the chemically crosslinked membranes have good structural stability 3 6 performance comparison of reports in literature in this study we prepared a cross linked pva bulk membrane with blending ptfe particles however most studied on pva membranes in literature were the ones with pva coating on ceramic al2o3 or organic pe or pvdf support membranes table 3 therefore the hydrophilic pva ptfe membranes with low water contact angles around 24 were suitable for separation chemicals such as cmc with high rate of reversible fouling and moderate flux at the same time the high rejection to cmc more than 99 3 and high otr to salt and alkali more than 90 made those cross linked pva ptfe membranes have great potential in separation of waste cellulose derivates and salts 4 conclusion in this study a series of pva ptfe membranes with different ptfe contents were prepared through heat cross linking and chemical cross linking the separation performance of the membranes in the mixture of cmc salt and alkali was studied the results concluded that pva ptfe uf membrane has obvious advantages in cmc rejection rate 99 3 for heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and 99 4 for chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane and salt alkali passage 93 0 for heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and 93 4 for chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane has a good separation performance in cmc nacl naoh wastewater with a high cmc rejection rate to 95 3 and otr more than 90 the cross linked pva ptfe membranes showed excellent anti fouling property and stability in alkali conditions suggesting a great potential in the treatment of cellulose derivates wastewater declaration of competing

13353,carboxymethyl cellulose sodium cmc is widely used in paper making and textile industries and the treatment of cmc wastewater containing salt and alkali has become one of the hot spots in the field of wastewater treatment in this study poly vinyl alcohol pva polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes were prepared through non solvent induced phase inversion nips and cross linking for the separation of cmc and salt alkali scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to characterize the morphology and surface properties of the membranes the results showed that both heat cross linking and chemical cross linking with glutaraldehyde ga improved the structural stability of the pva ptfe membranes the salt alkali optional transmitting rate otr the cmc rejection rate and the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane are 93 0 99 3 220 00 l m2h and 93 4 99 4 89 20 l m2h at 0 2 mpa respectively besides the ga cross linked pva ptfe membrane showed stable and efficient separation performance in the test of separating cmc therefore the resultant membrane can be used for the separation of cmc salt and alkali providing a new idea for the treatment of high salt alkali cellulose wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords poly vinyl alcohol ultrafiltration membrane cross linking carboxymethyl cellulose sodium polytetrafluoroethylene 1 introduction carboxymethyl cellulose sodium cmc is an anionic polymer compound and is commonly used in the paper making and textile industries 1 2 it plays a major role in improving adhesion and moisturizing however it is accompanied by a large amount of salt and alkali in wastewater 3 4 membrane separation technology such as electrodialysis ed 5 6 and diffusive dialysis dd 7 9 is used as an environmentally friendly treatment process without secondary pollution and applied to the removal of macromolecules or the recovery of salt and alkali although the above methods are applicable they are accompanied by a large amount of energy consumption and high processing costs moreover for the recovery of alkali and salt the stability of the membrane material in the lye will become a key factor restricting the recovery of alkali 10 therefore it is great significance to developing an anti fouling ultrafiltration membrane with low energy consumption high flux and stability in a strongly alkaline environment polyvinyl alcohol pva is a water soluble biocompatible and biodegradable synthetic polymer 11 12 pva has good hydrophilicity and extremely easy swelling characteristics 13 14 due to a large number of hydroxyl groups in its molecular chain and these hydroxyl groups also become the reaction sites for pva to form hydrogen bonds and cross linked structures with other molecules 15 16 however when the concentration of pva aqueous solution exceeds 10 it is easy to gel at room temperature which is not conducive to the preparation of the pva membrane therefore the preparation of the pva membrane is generally made by solvent evaporation with low concentration pva solution or by blending pva with polysilicon copolymers through the sol gel method pva has been widely involved in the preparation of pervaporation pv 17 18 membranes wang et al 19 used solvent evaporation to prepare a pva pv membrane containing schiff base network snw 1 nanoparticles the study found that the separation factor is 1501 and the permeation flux reaches 187 g m 2h of the membrane with 10 wt loadings of snw 1 at 75 c sakarkar et al 20 used solvent evaporation to prepare a pva tio2 solution coated pvdf membrane for dye removal the experimental results showed that as the pva content increases the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the membrane is better and the dye removal rate is also increased hao et al 7 prepared cationic exchange membranes using pva and polysilicon as copolymers by the sol gel method the diffusion dialysis dd process for the alkali mixture indicates that the dialysis coefficients of naoh uoh are around 0 0065 0 0086 m h and the separation factors s are in the range of 24 4 51 6 for the naoh na2wo4 system wu et al 21 prepared a quaternized poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide qppo and pva anion exchange membranes by sol gel method the diffusion dialysis dd process for the acid mixture suggests that the dialysis coefficient of hcl uh increases from 0 021 m h to 0 049 m h but the separation factor s decreases from 39 to 26 for the hcl fecl2 system the pervaporation pv membrane generally adopts the pva surface coating method to form a dense selective layer on the surface of the support to increase the efficiency 22 or use pva to blend with other fillers to prepare pv membranes by the thermally induced phase inversion tips method 23 it is worth noting that the use of these pva membrane is mainly dd membrane and pv membrane uf membranes with pva as the subject material have a high swelling degree and difficult pore size control there were few reports about the pva uf membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe has good chemical resistance heat resistance chemical inertness and hydrophobicity 24 26 due to its excellent performance and good dispersion characteristics ptfe emulsion is widely used in nanofiber membranes 27 28 and microporous membranes 29 zhang et al 30 used ptfe as the support membrane ptfe emulsion and carbon black cb were coated on the surface of the support membrane to prepare a ptfe cb microporous membrane the prepared ptfe cb microporous membrane has high tensile strength and high hydrophobicity yu et al 31 electrospun the ptfe pva spinning solution into a precursor nanofiber membrane to introduce a dispersion of ptfe hexafluoropropylene fep by electrostatic spraying the original fiber mesh structure of electrospinning is optimized for membrane emulsification generally speaking ptfe has no pore forming effect we innovatively use the hydrophobicity of ptfe and the hydrophilicity of pva and use the difference in compatibility between the two phases to achieve the pore forming effect of the uf membrane in this study we proposed a novel method for preparing pva ptfe uf membranes which has not been reported in the previous literature this work shows for the first time the use of ptfe emulsion as a porogen followed by cross linking treatment to further improve membrane performance so it s still green reducing the use of a lot of organic solvents water being used as the solvent the preparation process is simple cheap and is suitable for large scale production of low cost uf membranes for the treatment of high salinity cellulose wastewater the gel properties of pva solution were overcome by controlling the temperature of the aqueous solution of pva ptfe the pva ptfe membrane was prepared by nips and cross linking it is worth noting that the newly developed pva ptfe membrane is in situ chemically cross linked simplifying the process procedure at the same time it can be heat treated to further improve various properties of the membrane providing new ideas for the synergistic modification of pva membrane in the separation process of cmc and saline alkali it has good cmc retention and saline alkali separation rate which provides a new strategy for the desalination and de alkalization of solutions containing cellulose and its derivatives 2 experimental section 2 1 materials polyvinyl alcohol pva 1799 polytetrafluoethylene concentrated dispersion 60

complete dissolution 17 5 wt pva was added and stirred at 95 c and 200 r min for 2 h to fully dissolve the pva and then varied amount ptfe emulsion 5 10 15 and 20 to the mass of pva was added with further heating and stirring for 6 h casting solution was obtained with the ptfe particles evenly dispersed the casting solution cooled naturally to room temperature 25 c then 0 2 ml hydrochloric acid and 2 wt ga was added drop by drop slowly with gradually increasing the temperature from 25 c to 60 c this solution was kept warm for 50 min and defrosted in a vacuum oven for 30 min the casting solution was uniformly coated on the glass plate followed by immersing in an ethanol coagulation bath the membrane was formed by the nips process and then it was heated at 120 c for 1 h chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was successfully prepared the membrane without ga in the casting solution was named heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane 2 3 membrane characterization the morphology of the pva ptfe membrane was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem phenom xl holland and true color confocal microscopy csm csm700 germany the chemical structure of the membrane

were studied using simultaneous thermal analysis and mass spectrometry sta449f3 germany 2 4 membrane separation performance the separation performance of the pva ptfe membrane was tested in a lab scale cross flow filtration system fig s1 at 0 2 mpa and 25 c the membrane module was stabilized at 0 2 mpa for 30 min before data collection the membrane flux is calculated using eq 1 1 j w v a t where jw is the flux l m2h v is the volume of membrane permeation l a is the effective surface area of membrane m2 and t is the testing time h the rejection of salt and alkali is calculated using eq 2 2 r s c f s c p s c f s where cf s and c p s are the concentrations of the feed solution and permeation solution respectively in the process of testing the salt permeate performance the conductivity meter is used to test the salt concentration of the feed liquid and the permeate liquid respectively acridine orange dye was utilized to characterize the cellulose removal performance of the membrane fig s2 the cmc concentration in the test process was 1 g l the pressure at 0 2 mpa and 25 c in the process of determining cmc concentration the standard curve of cmc was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer and the cmc concentration corresponding to absorbance was calculated according to the standard curve fig s3 before the swelling test the membranes were initially dried to a constant weight in the oven then several groups of membranes with a mass of m1 about 0 05 g were weighed in an analytical balance and immersed in deionized water at room temperature for 2 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium finally the membranes were carefully taken out and quickly dried the liquid on the membrane surface with filter paper and weighed as m2 in mass the swelling degree of the membranes was calculated by eq 3 3 η m 2 m 1 m 1 where m1 and m2 are dry membrane weight g and the swelling after reaching adsorption equilibrium membrane weight g the anti fouling property of the membrane was tested by using cmc 2 g l solution as the pollution model the operating pressure was 0 2 mpa and the temperature was 25 c flux recovery rate frr total pollution rt irreversible pollution

rir jw1 and jw2 are water flux before and after pollution jp is the flux in the cmc solution reversible membrane pollution is caused by concentration polarization but irreversible pollution can be

and the cross linking agent was investigated by ftir as shown in fig 2 the peaks at 2925 cm 1 and 3400 3200 cm 1 can be assigned to ch2 stretching vibration and oh stretching vibration respectively because there are a large number of hydroxyl groups on the pva molecular chain and it is a multi associative body the absorption band shifted to low frequency at the same time it represented the existence of a host number of hydrogen bonds between pva molecules leading to its easy swelling characteristics 32 the peaks at 1094 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 can be associated with alcohol hydroxyl and 1417 cm 1 and 1645 cm 1 can be indicated the ch2 bending vibration and variable angle vibration and absorbed water bending vibration the peaks at 1176 cm 1 can be linked to the cf2 group symmetrical stretching 33 the peak at 1220 cm 1 should belong to the c o c bond stretching vibration which can be caused by the pva self cross linking and the cross linking of ga and pva it indicated that both physical cross linking and chemical cross linking make the pva membrane have a spatial cross linking structure the surface chemical composition of the pva ptfe membrane was measured with xps as showed in fig 3 a the full spectrum results showed that they are composed of c1s o1s and f1s peaks and their electron binding energies are 285 0 ev 532 2 ev and 689 4 ev respectively fitting and splitting the peaks of c1s as showed in fig 3 bd it is found that there are two peaks of co 286 6 ev and c c c h 285 0 ev 34 compared to the three kinds of membranes it is found that the uncross linked pva ptfe membrane has a low co peak intensity indicated that pva molecules are not dehydrated and the cross linking has not proceeded after heat cross linking the increasing intensity of the co peak suggested that the hydroxyl groups on the pva segment were dehydrated and the ether bond began to form after ga cross linking the co peak intensity was the highest indicated that cross linking degree is more thorough by ga than that by heating the c o ratio and degree of crosslinking of the three membranes also showed that ga cross linking is beneficial to the formation of the pva cross linking network table 1 tg and dtg curves of pva ptfe membranes showed after the cross linking treatment the thermodynamic properties of the membrane are stable and unchanged at the actual operating ambient temperature fig s4 it can be seen from fig s4 b that the three stage weight loss of pva is 50 150 c 275 400 c and 425 500 c 35 the membrane added with ptfe exhibited a fourth stage weight loss at 500 600 c the membranes begin to degrade at 50 c which was mainly due to the evaporation of water in the material the second part was the rupture of the pva molecular chain and the weight loss of hydroxyl groups the third stage was the cyclization reaction and the weight loss of the remaining hydroxyl groups 36 the fourth stage of weight loss was ptfe particles via chemical crosslinking the weight loss temperature of the membrane shifted to high temperature this showed that the cross linked structure improved the thermal stability of the membrane the crystallinity of the membranes was characterized by xrd in fig s5 there were two different peaks in the xrd pattern 18 15 and 19 80 2θ 18 15 was the 100 crystal plane of ptfe 37 2θ 19 80 represented the 101 crystal plane of pva with increasing the degree of cross linking the peaks became lower and wider because the cross linking diminished the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in pva 38 39 the intensity of the peaks at 18 15 and 19 80 decreased with the degree of the cross linking which indicated that the cross linking hindered the crystallization of pva molecular chains during the heat treatment of pva at 100 200 c the bound water was first removed and then the molecules moved to form a crystal structure finally the crystal structure was destroyed and intermolecular dehydration and other transformations occurred 40 during the heat treatment of pva and peg 120 c 1 h part of the peg molecules are oxidized to form a new chemical bond c o c the peg molecules are bonded together at the same time peg and pva can form hydrogen bonds to improve the performance of the membrane as shown in fig 2 there was a c o c bond absorption peak at 1220 cm 1 fig 5 showed a slight decrease in the peak strength of xrd which also indicated that the crystalline structure was destroyed in the heat treatment stage so a partial cross linking structure can be formed fig 4 a showed that the surface of the pure pva membrane is flat without protrusions and no visible holes on the surface resulting in no flux of the pva membrane 41 as showed in fig 4 bd ptfe particles can be seen on the surface of the membrane leading to the formation of large interfacial pores on the surface of the membrane this is mainly because ptfe particles are hydrophobic material and pva is a hydrophilic polymer in the casting solution with water as the solvent the incompatibility between the two phases makes the surface and interior of the membrane showed two phase boundary interfacial pores and plays a porogenic role 42 due to the addition of ptfe particles during the phase inversion process of the membrane there are gaps between the hydrophilic pva and the hydrophobic ptfe particles when immersed in an ethanol solution water molecules are replaced and the pores between the pva and ptfe particles are filled with ethanol after the membrane dries a large number of pores are formed which achieves the effect of pore formation with the development of cross linking the surface of the membrane has a dense cross linking structure and uniform distribution of the membrane surface pores the bottom surface of the pure pva membrane fig 4 a showed large pores while the pores shrunk significantly in the cross linked membrane fig 4 b d folded structure was formed due to the dehydration and cross linking of pva molecules of the pva ptfe membranes this folded structure would benefit to enhance the membrane performance and to improve the membrane strength the addition of ptfe particles increased the pores inside the membrane and the cross section appeared consistent with the distribution of pores on the surface fig 4 b d indicating that the prepared membranes have the same identity and are symmetrical membranes this is mainly because the ptfe particles are uniformly dispersed in the membrane and the pores between the two phases are evenly distributed resulting in the same structure on the surface and inside of the membrane the thickness of the membrane increased from 14 18 μm to 37 88 μm fig s6 indicating that the addition of ptfe increased the porosity of the membrane and caused volume expansion heat cross linking treatment and chemical cross linking treatment did not change the membrane thickness much indicating the cross linking treatment only increased the cross linking network of the membrane but did not affect the basic structure of the membrane the surface roughness of the pva ptfe membranes with different ptfe contents was obtained by true color confocal microscopy in fig 5 a d with the increase of ptfe content the surface roughness of the membrane rose from 0 128 μm of pure pva membrane to 0 767 μm of 15 pva ptfe membrane the low roughness of the pva ptfe membrane with low ptfe content was contributed to the uniformly distribution of the ptfe particles in the membrane however roughness reached high to 0 767 μm with 15 ptfe content due to the agglomeration of pfte particles table s2 in order to verify the influence of the concentration of ptfe nanoparticles on the structure of the pva ptfe membrane we conducted edx experiments as shown in fig 7 a d of the edx of the surface of the pva ptfe membrane obvious agglomeration is noticed when the concentration of ptfe is more than 10 it can be seen that the distribution of ptfe particles in the membrane is related to the surface roughness of the membrane the main reason is that the content of ptfe in the membrane increases and the dispersing effect of ptfe particles in the casting liquid is not good which leads to local agglomeration during the membrane making process which not only increases the internal defects of the membrane but also improves the surface roughness of the membrane 3 2 influence of cross linking mode on membrane performance the data of pure pva ptfe membrane were shown in fig s7 under the condition of 0 1 mpa the flux decreased rapidly with time while the rejection increased both tend to be stable after 30 min therefore the stabilization of the membrane required a minimum of 60 min pre load 30 min the initially rejected solution contained cellulose molecules visible to the naked eye but cellulose molecules disappeared in the rejected solution after 30 min indicating that under the initial conditions of pure pva ptfe membrane the membrane pores were too large to effectively reject cmc since pva is a water soluble polymer its properties are still unstable after membrane formation only by nips and it needs to be passed through cross linking treatment to improve the stability of the membrane fig s10 in fig 6 a as the temperature rose from 110 c to 140 c the flux dropped from 387 26 l m2h to 110 46 l m2h and the rejection to cmc rose from 99 46 to 99 68 in fig 8 b the time of heat treatment at 120 c extended from 20 min to 120 min the flux dropped from 759 76 l m2h to 40 76 l m2h and the rejection rose from 98 9 to 99 63 with the increase of time and temperature of the heat treatment more pva molecules formed cross linking network via dehydration of hydroxyl groups resulting in a decrease in flux and an increase in rejection as shown in fig 6 c d the flux dropped from 359 76 l m2h to 153 36 l m2h and the rejection increased from 99 49 to 99 78 with increasing the ga concentration from 0 to 4 at the same time the elongation at break and tensile strength of the membrane increased from 28 96 to 463 80 and from 25 18 mpa to 29 75 mpa respectively this was explained by the fact that increased energy is required for a fracture of the ga cross linked pva chains resulting in the increases of both the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the membrane it was found that when the ga amount was greater than 2 flux and rejection of the membrane were stable and mechanical strength was good 3 3 the separation performance of pva ptfe membranes the performance of pure pva ptfe membrane under 0 1 mpa was shown in fig s9 with the increase of cmc concentration the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane slowly dropped to equilibrium and the rejection rate also slowly rose to around 99 20 this is because solution viscosity and osmotic pressure increased with the increase of cmc concentration accelerating the flux attenuation of the membrane as shown in fig 9 a b when the cmc concentration increased from 0 5 g l to 3 g l the fluxes of both heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased drastically the main reasons were 1 as the cmc concentration increased concentration polarization caused more cmc molecules to aggregate which increased the mass transfer resistance 2 as the concentration of cmc solution increased its viscosity became larger and its binding force to water molecules increased 3 as the concentration of cmc solution increased the osmotic pressure increased and the operating pressure was partially used to offset the osmotic pressure resulting in a decrease in the actual driving pressure fig 7 c showed that the flux and rejection of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane for cmc solution increased with increasing the temperature of the feed solution from 25 c to 50 c it indicated that the movement of water molecules was intensified at high temperature contributing to the increased flux and the entanglement and shrinking of the pva molecules at high temperature leading to enhancement of cmc rejection 11 therefore it was benefit to improve the separation performance of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane by enhancing the processing temperature the swelling degree of the membranes was shown in fig 7 d the swelling degree of the pva ptfe membrane is larger than that of the pva membrane due to the steric hindrance of the added ptfe particles to pva the swelling rate of the membranes decreased by heat cross linking and chemical cross linking because less water binding to the cross linked pva 43 the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane under 0 1 mpa was shown in fig s12 in naoh nacl different concentrations 0 5 5 g l the trends of pure pva ptfe membranes were similar to those of pva ptfe membranes prepared by the two cross linking strategies however in nacl solution compared with heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane the flux decay of pure pva ptfe membrane was as high as 42 21 and the nacl transmittance was unchanged compared with the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the flux attenuation was larger and the transmission rate of nacl was lower this was mainly due to the poor structural stability of pure pva ptfe and heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes in naoh solution the flux of pure pva ptfe membrane only increased by 35 71 compared with that of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane the main reason was that the operating pressure was lower at 0 1 mpa and the rate of oh immersed into the membrane matrix decreases which slowed down the destruction of membrane structure compared with the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the transmittance of naoh decreased this indicated that a large amount of oh was still consumed in the process of structural destruction in the membrane the pva ptfe membrane flux and salt alkali optional transmitting rate otr in different concentrations of nacl and naoh aqueous solutions were tested in fig 8 a b with the increase of nacl concentration the flux of heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased by 16 48 and 25 09 respectively however the salt transmitting rate of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane is lower than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane because the low degree of cross linking of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and the electronegativity of the hydroxyl groups in the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was also more than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane as shown in fig 8 c d with the increase of naoh concentration the flux of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 104 63 and 73 05 respectively when the naoh concentration surpassed 2 g l the flux of the two membranes rose sharply due to the interaction between oh and uncross linked oh groups which aggravated the swelling of the membrane and even caused defects in the membranes the molecular weight cut off of the two membranes may not be able to explain this problem fig s13 but mass attenuation of the two cross linked membranes in lye also explains this phenomenon fig s14 however at low concentrations the alkali otr of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane were 88 62 and 97 21 respectively which were lower than those of salt otr the main reason was due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups on the pva molecular chain and oh on the other side the alkali otr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was lower than that of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane because a large number of hydroxyl groups in the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane inhibited the transport of oh across the membrane 44 to verify the membrane performance in the actual separation process otr and cmc rejection of the aqueous solutions with 1 g l cmc and different concentrations of nacl and naoh were tested as shown in fig 9 a b with the increase of nacl concentration the flux of heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes decreased by 21 21 and 11 13 respectively otr and cmc rejection of the two membranes were similar the flux attenuation of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes in nacl and cmc solution 21 21 in fig 9 a was higher than that only in nacl solution 16 48 in fig 8 a because the cmc tended to penetrate into the larger pores fig s11 a 0 43 μm of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membranes resulting in partially blockage of the pores however the flux attenuation of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes in nacl and cmc solution 11 13 in fig 9 b was much lower than that only in nacl solution 25 09 in fig 8 b this mainly was due to the contamination of cmc on the surface of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes with smaller pore size and narrower pore size distribution fig s11 b a cmc buffer layer was produced on the membrane surface to hinder the enrichment of salt which weakened the concentration polarization of the membrane as shown in fig 9 c d with the increase of naoh concentration the flux of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 38 64 and 38 70 respectively although the flux of the cross linked membranes in nacl and cmc solutions decreased on account of cmc deposition and concentration polarization the flux of those membranes in naoh and cmc solution increased owing to the deformation of the cross linked structure of pva at high naoh concentration at the same time the alkali otr of the two membranes in naoh and cmc solution was greatly lower than that in the naoh solution without cmc fig 8 c d especially at low naoh concentrations the enrichment of cmc on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores causing more hydroxyl groups from cmc interacting with pva and naoh slowing down the transmission of oh under the condition of high nacl concentration 10 g l the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane still showed a stable processing capacity the flux attenuation was small and the cmc rejection and nacl otr increased slightly under the action of a high concentration of naoh the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 74 09 the cmc rejection rate was lower than 90 and the naoh otr remained unchanged the flux of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane increased by 46 74 the cmc rejection rate was 93 30 and the naoh otr remained stable this showed that under high alkali conditions the internal structure of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was partially destroyed and defects increased which led to a decrease in membrane performance the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane has stronger tolerance and a more stable structure which was suitable for high alkali environments 3 4 anti fouling ability comparison of commercial membrane and cross linked pva ptfe membranes cmc 2 g l solution was used to simulate the membrane fouling process to facilitate comparisons all permeate fluxes were normalized based on the initial flux as shown in fig 10 a b the flux trend of the pva ptfe membrane and commercial membranes in water and cmc cycle tests with time was given when the cmc solution replaced pure water the flux decline rates were in the order of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane 91 23 pan membrane 86 89 psf membrane 81 73 heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane 79 10 pes membrane 67 59 it was found that the flux of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane decreased the most resulting in the largest pollution mainly due to the highest porosity of the membrane surface fig s14 and the existence of a large number of small pores on the surface of the membrane fig 6d the membrane specific surface area was large cmc molecules deposition on the membrane surface aggravated the membrane pollution however the surface porosity and specific surface area of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane were smaller fig 6c the deposition sites of cmc molecules on the membrane surface reduced and the membrane fouling was less after washing the frr of the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was the highest while the frr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was lower this was because the cmc molecule itself also contained a large number of hydroxyl groups which formed a hydrogen bond with the pva molecular chain 45 preventing the separation of the cmc molecule at the same time there were more hydroxyl groups on the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane which can be more stably combined with cmc molecules resulting in a decrease in the frr of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane its hydrophilic membrane surface helping to remove the deposited cmc layer fig s15 as shown in fig s16 the heat cross linked and chemical cross linked pva ptfe membranes still maintained a good flux recovery rate after 5 cycles the flux recovery rate of heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane was stable at 79 and the flux recovery rate of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane was stable at 81 table s1 this showed that the anti fouling performance of the membrane was stable the flux attenuation caused mainly by two parts rir was mainly caused by cmc irreversible pollution to the membrane surface and pores resulting in a significant decrease in membrane flux after washing with water the membrane flux recovered to a greater extent and the recovered part is rr this was mainly because cmc formed an unstable filter cake layer on the membrane surface under the effect of concentration polarization 46 which resulted in augmented mass transfer resistance and greater flux attenuation it showed that concentration polarization has the greatest impact on membrane performance 3 5 stability of the membrane fig 11 showed the stability test by separating the cmc solution of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and chemical cross linking pva ptfe membrane it is found that the flux of the heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane decreases by 42 99 from the initial to 24 h and its rejection rate remains at 98 50 the flux of chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane remained balanced after 4 h only attenuated by 16 77 and the flux remained at 89 20 l m2h the rejection rate remained at 99 40 it showed that the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane had better stability fig s17 shows the surface morphology of the two membranes after 24 h of operation indicating that the chemically crosslinked membranes have good structural stability 3 6 performance comparison of reports in literature in this study we prepared a cross linked pva bulk membrane with blending ptfe particles however most studied on pva membranes in literature were the ones with pva coating on ceramic al2o3 or organic pe or pvdf support membranes table 3 therefore the hydrophilic pva ptfe membranes with low water contact angles around 24 were suitable for separation chemicals such as cmc with high rate of reversible fouling and moderate flux at the same time the high rejection to cmc more than 99 3 and high otr to salt and alkali more than 90 made those cross linked pva ptfe membranes have great potential in separation of waste cellulose derivates and salts 4 conclusion in this study a series of pva ptfe membranes with different ptfe contents were prepared through heat cross linking and chemical cross linking the separation performance of the membranes in the mixture of cmc salt and alkali was studied the results concluded that pva ptfe uf membrane has obvious advantages in cmc rejection rate 99 3 for heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and 99 4 for chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane and salt alkali passage 93 0 for heat cross linked pva ptfe membrane and 93 4 for chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane the chemical cross linked pva ptfe membrane has a good separation performance in cmc nacl naoh wastewater with a high cmc rejection rate to 95 3 and otr more than 90 the cross linked pva ptfe membranes showed excellent anti fouling property and stability in alkali conditions suggesting a great potential in the treatment of cellulose derivates wastewater declaration of competing

13354,microalgae have the ability to grow rapidly in wastewater to remove pollutants and produce pigments this study was carried out to identify candidate microalgae with high pigment content and powerful purification capacity for potato wastewater eight species five scenedesmus and three desmodesmus were tested in a laboratory experiment the results showed that scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew best in potato wastewater within 7 days yielding the highest biomass 2 64 g l 1 scenedesmus sp hxy5 also exhibited excellent wastewater purification ability achieving removal efficiencies of 59 32 and 93 for total dissolved nitrogen total dissolved phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand respectively additionally scenedesmus sp hxy5 achieved the highest total pigment yield 18 45 mg l 1 with a lutein yield of 11 46 mg l 1 our results indicated that scenedesmus sp hxy5 showed great potential for purifying potato wastewater and producing pigments keywords microalgae scenedesmus potato wastewater pigment production wastewater purification 1 introduction microalgae can actively absorb nutrients using solar energy which has natural advantages compared to water treatment using activated sludge 1 furthermore useful microalgae byproducts can effectively reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 2 3 microalgae can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fixing carbon dioxide 1 therefore water treatment technology based on microalgae is expanding in many fields previous studies demonstrated the potential of using microalgae to treat wastewater and produce biodiesel ye et al 4 cultured eight microalgae in simulated wastewater among which scenedesmus sp hxy2 achieved high removal efficiencies for total organic carbon toc 96 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 99 total dissolved nitrogen tdn 97 and total dissolved phosphorus tdp 95 in addition to a lipid content of 16 however simulated wastewater was used in this work and the performance of microalgae species in actual wastewater needed to be further analyzed current research combining wastewater treatment with microalgal biodiesel production is focusing on industrial and domestic wastewater treatment sydney et al 5 screened optimal species from 20 microalgae strains using secondary domestic wastewater over 14 days and found that botryococcus braunii performed best the removal efficiency of b braunii for tdn and tdp was 80 and 100 respectively and its lipid content was more than 35 according to jayyab and al zuhair 6 chlorella sp and tetraselmis sp could degrade phenol in industrial wastewater and generate biomass for biodiesel production achieving a lipid content of 30 in addition wu et al 7 used chlamydomonas sp tai 2 to treat industrial wastewater achieving 100 and 33 removal of nh4 n and po4 3 p respectively and a lipid content of 18 heavy metals phenolic compounds and other harmful substances may be present in industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater 8 by contrast the composition of food wastewater is much safer some studies have harvested byproducts through the cultivation of microalgae using organic food wastewater han et al 9 cultured spirulina maxima in soy sauce wastewater which achieved chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents of 5 52 and 1 98 mg g 1 respectively wang et al 10 cultured chlorella pyrenoidosa in tofu whey wastewater and obtained the maximum protein yield 321 2 mg l 1 day 1 using mixotrophic cultivation microalgae pigments such as lutein and chlorophyll are bioactive compounds widely used in feed food and medical applications 11 12 polysaccharides such as sodium alginate and carrageenan are excellent thickening and gelling agents 3 and they also have medicinal effects including anti cancer and anti hyperlipidemia properties 13 furthermore clinical and animal trials have found that chlorella proteins are safe for consumption and beneficial to humans by preventing high blood pressure 14 despite the relatively low yield of byproducts from microalgae the byproducts have a much higher economic value than biodiesel 15 therefore it is possible to further reduce the cost of wastewater treatment by combining microalgae treatment of wastewater with the harvesting of useful byproducts in the present study eight previously isolated and purified microalgae species were cultured in potato wastewater species were compared for adaptability to potato wastewater and byproduct yield by measuring biomass nutrient removal efficiency and the contents of pigments proteins and polysaccharides potato wastewater was selected because it contained considerable carbon nitrogen and phosphorus elements for the growth of microalgae more than 20 million cubic metres of potato wastewater was generated in china 16 additionally the concentration of

the dom fluor v 1 7 toolbox 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth characteristics of microalgae in potato wastewater the growth of the eight species in potato wastewater varied considerably during the experimental period the cell density of the five species scenedesmus spp hxy4 and hxy5 desmodesmus spp hxy3 hxy7 and hxy8 increased significantly with the increase of culture time anova p 0 05 these species adapted quickly to potato wastewater and entered the logarithmic growth phase after 1 2 days fig 1 in particular scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew significantly better in potato wastewater than the other seven species duncan test p 0 05 with a maximum cell density of 1 26 107 cells ml 1 and a dry weight of 2 64 g l 1 on day 7 however the rapid growth of microalgae was only maintained for 3 4 days due to nutrient limits in potato wastewater after which the growth curves leveled off the growth rates of three species scenedesmus spp hxy1 hxy2 and hxy6 were relatively slow scenedesmus sp hxy1 and scenedesmus sp hxy6 remained in an adaptation period during the first 3 days and reached low algal dry weights 0 13 and 0 24 g l 1 respectively in summary scenedesmus sp hxy5 was the most adaptable to potato wastewater the growth and cellular synthesis of microalgae can be influenced by the trophic mode photoautotrophic microalgae accumulate biomass through co2 and light energy and grow slowly heterotrophic microalgae can grow rapidly if sufficient additional carbon sources are available 20 both inorganic and organic carbon sources can be used by mixotrophic microalgae for rapid growth 21 22 in present study organic carbon sources co2 and light energy were provided and under these conditions scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew rapidly within the first 3 days then entered a stable phase on day 7 scenedesmus sp hxy5 reached the highest cell density 1 26 107 cells ml 1 and dry weight 2 64 g l 1 among the eight species previously zhao et al 23 found that when provided with glucose and co2 scenedesmus quadricauda grew rapidly and reached a stable stage on day 5 yielding 2 8 g l 1 of biomass which was markedly higher than that under photoautotrophic conditions wang et al 10 cultured chlorella pyrenoidosa in glucose supplemented tofu whey wastewater and found that this species grew rapidly in the first 4 days and reached a stable phase on day 5 it produced 1 06 g l 1 day 1 of biomass all selected microalgae in this study were mixotrophic species due to their high removal rates to cod additionally the biomass of harvested scenedesmus sp hxy5 in the current study was higher than that reported by wang et al 10 but slightly lower than the value obtained by zhao et al 23 thus significant biomass can be harvested through mixotrophic culture of microalgae in potato wastewater 3 2 nutrient removal from potato wastewater by microalgae the initial contents of tdn tdp and cod in potato wastewater were 127 98 11 11 and 1504 mg l 1 respectively the remaining contents after 7 days of continuous treatment with the eight microalgae species showed in fig 2 the removal efficiency of cod was above 88 for all eight species and scenedesmus sp hxy1 achieved the highest cod removal efficiency 93 scenedesmus sp hxy4 was the most effective for removing tdp 63 from potato wastewater however no significant differences in removal efficiency of tdn were observed between the eight microalgae species all ranged from 52 to 59 organic carbon source addition can effectively promote the growth of microalgae and thus improve the removal efficiency of nutrient 24 several recent studies used different microalgae to treat various organic wastewaters and achieved high removal efficiency han et al 9 treated soy sauce wastewater with spirulina ncu sm the removal efficiencies for nh4 n tdn and cod were 94 82 and 84 respectively zheng et al 25 cultured chlorella in pyropia processing wastewater and after 7 days chlorella recorded the highest removal efficiencies of 99 98 and 53 for tdn tdp and cod respectively compared with previous studies the microalgae tested in our study were more effective at removing cod but less efficient in removing tdn and tdp from potato wastewater these results might be due to the lysis of some microalgal cells over prolonged incubation leading to an increase in the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the wastewater the low residual cod content in the solution might be due to the large amount of organic carbon consumed by microalgal growth in conclusion the efficient removal of cod in this study demonstrated that large scale bioremediation of potato wastewater by microalgae is feasible 3 3 production of byproducts by microalgae the composition and production of pigments in the eight microalgae are summarized in table 2 scenedesmus sp hxy5 had the highest pigment concentration 18 45 mg l 1 which was 3 6 times higher than scenedesmus sp hxy4 5 11 mg l 1 furthermore lutein concentration in the culture of scenedesmus sp hxy5 was obviously significantly higher than other pigments fuco neo viola chl b and chl a duncan test p 0 05 in addition higher lutein production of scenedesmus sp hxy5 was obtained in potato wastewater than in bg 11 culture medium data was not shown thus mixotrophic culture was more conducive to harvesting lutein than photoautotrophic culture which was consistent with the findings of cordero et al 26 the lutein productivity of scenedesmus sp hxy5 in the current study 1 64 mg l 1 day 1 was also higher than the value 1 20 mg l 1 day 1 reported by bhowmick et al 27 therefore it is advantageous to produce lutein by culturing scenedesmus sp hxy5 in potato wastewater lutein is often used as a nutritional additive in food processing industry due to its cancer prevention and liver protection properties 28 currently industrial extraction of lutein is mainly from marigold but cultivation of marigold plants requires a large area and is highly dependent on seasonal variations 3 which limits the yield in space and time in the present study we achieved high productivity of lutein using microalgae which could effectively reduce the culture time and cost therefore large scale cultivation of microalgae in potato wastewater has great potential for industrial production of lutein among the different microalgae species tested in this study scenedesmus sp hxy6 had the highest protein contents 18 26 pg cell 1 and was dramatically higher than other 7 species duncan test p 0 05 fig 3 also the highest value of polysaccharide occurred in hxy6 with 42 34 pg cell 1 even though no significant difference with hxy1 and hxy2 duncan test p 0 05 the biochemical composition of microalgae is influenced by the composition and content of nutrients in the culture medium nitrogen is essential for biomolecules such as pigments and proteins 29 inorganic nitrogen is mainly used by microalgae for the biosynthesis of amino acids and proteins but amino acids can also be used when inorganic nitrogen is insufficient 30 dixit et al 31 cultured scenedesmus rotundus mg910488 at a range of nitrogen concentrations and found that under nitrogen deficiency the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and proteins was reduced while the accumulation of lipids and polysaccharides was increased indeed in the absence of available nitrogen sources microalgae triggered specific metabolism by synthesizing carbohydrates or lipids 32 as verified by dixit et al 31 here the production of pigments and proteins by microalgae was limited due to the lack of available nitrogen sources in the latter growth stage the polysaccharide content would be expected to increase however the polysaccharide content of scenedesmus sp hxy5 in this study was low this inconsistency might be caused by insufficient organic carbon during the long incubation time leading to polysaccharide depletion 3 4 characterization of dom in potato wastewater six fractions were subjected to parallel factor analysis and their spectral characteristics were shown in table 3 potato wastewater contained four types of dom c2 c3 c4 and c6 of which the fluorescence intensity of c6 was much higher than the other three types of humic substances fig 4 indicating that only a small amount of humic substances and a large amount of protein were present in potato wastewater the fmax value of protein like substance c6 was significantly reduced in solutions treated with each of the eight microalgae species among these the treatment of potato wastewater by scenedesmus sp hxy1 resulted in the largest percentage decrease in the fmax of c6 98 indicating that this protein like substance is easily degraded in general protein like substances are easily degraded by microalgae into small molecules such as amino acids providing an available organic nitrogen source for microalgal growth 30 33 in contrast humic substances are more chemically stable and difficult to decompose and utilize by microorganisms 34 the fmax of the c2 humus like material underwent the greatest change after scenedesmus sp hxy5 treatment indicating that scenedesmus sp hxy5 was the most capable of degrading humus like material among the eight species in addition new dom fractions c1 and c5 were detected in solutions treated with each of the eight species which may be associated with photosynthetic products generated by the microalgae and or algal cell lysis 33 4 conclusions in this study potato wastewater was treated using eight microalgae species among them scenedesmus sp hxy5 was best adapted to potato wastewater after 7 days additionally scenedesmus sp hxy5 efficiently removed tdn tdp and cod from wastewater and this species also achieved the highest pigment production including a large proportion of lutein however the contents of polysaccharides and proteins in scenedesmus sp hxy5 were lower than in the other seven microalgae furthermore dom in potato wastewater was dominated by humus like substances after treatment by microalgae our results indicate that scenedesmus sp hxy5 could accumulate large amounts of biomass to produce potentially valuable pigments especially lutein and simultaneously purified potato wastewater thereby saving the cost of wastewater treatment however further investigation is needed on technical issues such as reducing the cost and energy requirements of pigment extraction declaration of competing interest the authors

13354,microalgae have the ability to grow rapidly in wastewater to remove pollutants and produce pigments this study was carried out to identify candidate microalgae with high pigment content and powerful purification capacity for potato wastewater eight species five scenedesmus and three desmodesmus were tested in a laboratory experiment the results showed that scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew best in potato wastewater within 7 days yielding the highest biomass 2 64 g l 1 scenedesmus sp hxy5 also exhibited excellent wastewater purification ability achieving removal efficiencies of 59 32 and 93 for total dissolved nitrogen total dissolved phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand respectively additionally scenedesmus sp hxy5 achieved the highest total pigment yield 18 45 mg l 1 with a lutein yield of 11 46 mg l 1 our results indicated that scenedesmus sp hxy5 showed great potential for purifying potato wastewater and producing pigments keywords microalgae scenedesmus potato wastewater pigment production wastewater purification 1 introduction microalgae can actively absorb nutrients using solar energy which has natural advantages compared to water treatment using activated sludge 1 furthermore useful microalgae byproducts can effectively reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 2 3 microalgae can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fixing carbon dioxide 1 therefore water treatment technology based on microalgae is expanding in many fields previous studies demonstrated the potential of using microalgae to treat wastewater and produce biodiesel ye et al 4 cultured eight microalgae in simulated wastewater among which scenedesmus sp hxy2 achieved high removal efficiencies for total organic carbon toc 96 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 99 total dissolved nitrogen tdn 97 and total dissolved phosphorus tdp 95 in addition to a lipid content of 16 however simulated wastewater was used in this work and the performance of microalgae species in actual wastewater needed to be further analyzed current research combining wastewater treatment with microalgal biodiesel production is focusing on industrial and domestic wastewater treatment sydney et al 5 screened optimal species from 20 microalgae strains using secondary domestic wastewater over 14 days and found that botryococcus braunii performed best the removal efficiency of b braunii for tdn and tdp was 80 and 100 respectively and its lipid content was more than 35 according to jayyab and al zuhair 6 chlorella sp and tetraselmis sp could degrade phenol in industrial wastewater and generate biomass for biodiesel production achieving a lipid content of 30 in addition wu et al 7 used chlamydomonas sp tai 2 to treat industrial wastewater achieving 100 and 33 removal of nh4 n and po4 3 p respectively and a lipid content of 18 heavy metals phenolic compounds and other harmful substances may be present in industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater 8 by contrast the composition of food wastewater is much safer some studies have harvested byproducts through the cultivation of microalgae using organic food wastewater han et al 9 cultured spirulina maxima in soy sauce wastewater which achieved chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents of 5 52 and 1 98 mg g 1 respectively wang et al 10 cultured chlorella pyrenoidosa in tofu whey wastewater and obtained the maximum protein yield 321 2 mg l 1 day 1 using mixotrophic cultivation microalgae pigments such as lutein and chlorophyll are bioactive compounds widely used in feed food and medical applications 11 12 polysaccharides such as sodium alginate and carrageenan are excellent thickening and gelling agents 3 and they also have medicinal effects including anti cancer and anti hyperlipidemia properties 13 furthermore clinical and animal trials have found that chlorella proteins are safe for consumption and beneficial to humans by preventing high blood pressure 14 despite the relatively low yield of byproducts from microalgae the byproducts have a much higher economic value than biodiesel 15 therefore it is possible to further reduce the cost of wastewater treatment by combining microalgae treatment of wastewater with the harvesting of useful byproducts in the present study eight previously isolated and purified microalgae species were cultured in potato wastewater species were compared for adaptability to potato wastewater and byproduct yield by measuring biomass nutrient removal efficiency and the contents of pigments proteins and polysaccharides potato wastewater was selected because it contained considerable carbon nitrogen and phosphorus elements for the growth of microalgae more than 20 million cubic metres of potato wastewater was generated in china 16 additionally the concentration of heavy metals and other harmful components in potato wastewater was very low thus it was very suitable for the production of food grade pigment and other byproducts 2 materials and methods 2 1 potato

the dom fluor v 1 7 toolbox 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth characteristics of microalgae in potato wastewater the growth of the eight species in potato wastewater varied considerably during the experimental period the cell density of the five species scenedesmus spp hxy4 and hxy5 desmodesmus spp hxy3 hxy7 and hxy8 increased significantly with the increase of culture time anova p 0 05 these species adapted quickly to potato wastewater and entered the logarithmic growth phase after 1 2 days fig 1 in particular scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew significantly better in potato wastewater than the other seven species duncan test p 0 05 with a maximum cell density of 1 26 107 cells ml 1 and a dry weight of 2 64 g l 1 on day 7 however the rapid growth of microalgae was only maintained for 3 4 days due to nutrient limits in potato wastewater after which the growth curves leveled off the growth rates of three species scenedesmus spp hxy1 hxy2 and hxy6 were relatively slow scenedesmus sp hxy1 and scenedesmus sp hxy6 remained in an adaptation period during the first 3 days and reached low algal dry weights 0 13 and 0 24 g l 1 respectively in summary scenedesmus sp hxy5 was the most adaptable to potato wastewater the growth and cellular synthesis of microalgae can be influenced by the trophic mode photoautotrophic microalgae accumulate biomass through co2 and light energy and grow slowly heterotrophic microalgae can grow rapidly if sufficient additional carbon sources are available 20 both inorganic and organic carbon sources can be used by mixotrophic microalgae for rapid growth 21 22 in present study organic carbon sources co2 and light energy were provided and under these conditions scenedesmus sp hxy5 grew rapidly within the first 3 days then entered a stable phase on day 7 scenedesmus sp hxy5 reached the highest cell density 1 26 107 cells ml 1 and dry weight 2 64 g l 1 among the eight species previously zhao et al 23 found that when provided with glucose and co2 scenedesmus quadricauda grew rapidly and reached a stable stage on day 5 yielding 2 8 g l 1 of biomass which was markedly higher than that under photoautotrophic conditions wang et al 10 cultured chlorella pyrenoidosa in glucose supplemented tofu whey wastewater and found that this species grew rapidly in the first 4 days and reached a stable phase on day 5 it produced 1 06 g l 1 day 1 of biomass all selected microalgae in this study were mixotrophic species due to their high removal rates to cod additionally the biomass of harvested scenedesmus sp hxy5 in the current study was higher than that reported by wang et al 10 but slightly lower than the value obtained by zhao et al 23 thus significant biomass can be harvested through mixotrophic culture of microalgae in potato wastewater 3 2 nutrient removal from potato wastewater by microalgae the initial contents of tdn tdp and cod in potato wastewater were 127 98 11 11 and 1504 mg l 1 respectively the remaining contents after 7 days of continuous treatment with the eight microalgae species showed in fig 2 the removal efficiency of cod was above 88 for all eight species and scenedesmus sp hxy1 achieved the highest cod removal efficiency 93 scenedesmus sp hxy4 was the most effective for removing tdp 63 from potato wastewater however no significant differences in removal efficiency of tdn were observed between the eight microalgae species all ranged from 52 to 59 organic carbon source addition can effectively promote the growth of microalgae and thus improve the removal efficiency of nutrient 24 several recent studies used different microalgae to treat various organic wastewaters and achieved high removal efficiency han et al 9 treated soy sauce wastewater with spirulina ncu sm the removal efficiencies for nh4 n tdn and cod were 94 82 and 84 respectively zheng et al 25 cultured chlorella in pyropia processing wastewater and after 7 days chlorella recorded the highest removal efficiencies of 99 98 and 53 for tdn tdp and cod respectively compared with previous studies the microalgae tested in our study were more effective at removing cod but less efficient in removing tdn and tdp from potato wastewater these results might be due to the lysis of some microalgal cells over prolonged incubation leading to an increase in the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the wastewater the low residual cod content in the solution might be due to the large amount of organic carbon consumed by microalgal growth in conclusion the efficient removal of cod in this study demonstrated that large scale bioremediation of potato wastewater by microalgae is feasible 3 3 production of byproducts by microalgae the composition and production of pigments in the eight microalgae are summarized in table 2 scenedesmus sp hxy5 had the highest pigment concentration 18 45 mg l 1 which was 3 6 times higher than scenedesmus sp hxy4 5 11 mg l 1 furthermore lutein concentration in the culture of scenedesmus sp hxy5 was obviously significantly higher than other pigments fuco neo viola chl b and chl a duncan test p 0 05 in addition higher lutein production of scenedesmus sp hxy5 was obtained in potato wastewater than in bg 11 culture medium data was not shown thus mixotrophic culture was more conducive to harvesting lutein than photoautotrophic culture which was consistent with the findings of cordero et al 26 the lutein productivity of scenedesmus sp hxy5 in the current study 1 64 mg l 1 day 1 was also higher than the value 1 20 mg l 1 day 1 reported by bhowmick et al 27 therefore it is advantageous to produce
