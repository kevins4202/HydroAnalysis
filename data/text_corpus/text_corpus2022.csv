10110,the present study proposed a smart operating system consists of two primary components of i unsupervised pattern recognition and ii automated control system the main goal is shifting the technical orientation of the single objective automated operating system to a practical one included the sustainable development viewpoints where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district a complementary component consists of the principal component analysis pca and a crisp clustering method is developed to fulfill this objective the proposed method was implemented in a real test case roodasht irrigation district in iran according to the pca analysis six features encompassing socio economic environmental and technical objectives were selected as the clustering s dominant features the district was regionalized to 6 regions based on the initial results of the clustering the integration of a couple of the clusters occurred in the post processing stage and finally the test case was grouped into 4 regions with different priorities for receiving the surface water the priorities were served as penalty values orders in the objective function of the developed automated controller a comparison of the developed smart system s obtained results by status quo reveals that moderately water distribution happened in normal and water shortage scenarios where the equity index obtained 8 5 and 11 5 respectively also reliable and adequate water delivered to regions belongs to the forth and first clusters where 37 and 38 of the region supplied more than 80 of their demands under the two scenarios respectively it is worth noting that the mentioned achievement created in the forth and first clusters with the minimum groundwater overexploitation the maximum dependency of farmers on agricultural activities incomes and the seasonal worker s highest rate of unemployment the developed smart system is capable of implementing the practical action of fairly water distribution based on the sustainable development concept rather than the technical one the proposed method is simply possible to change add or remove the features based on different objectives or concerns in different study areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords fairly water distribution operational modernization aquifer storage and recovery hard clustering automated system 1 introduction despite substantial investments made by governments local authorities and private sectors for modernization renovation and rehabilitation of the distribution networks the unsustainable operation of these networks has led to the simultaneous exploitation of groundwater resources in addition to using surface water as a reliable supply of water in farming areas babaei et al 2018 the primary reason for this over exploitation of groundwater is because of the poor performance of agricultural water distribution systems caused by factors such as defects in design lack of regular inspection and unfortunate maintenance activities and top down operational strategies that leads to inequitable water distribution among farmers of upstream and downstream villages burt 2013 performance improvement of these systems becomes the priority since the local authorities and water planning managers are aware of the potential social conflicts between the farmers and contentions economic consideration due to dependency of the farmers incomes to the agricultural activities and the environmental damages i e groundwater overexploitation within the irrigation district the present study develops a framework for smart operational management by replacing the single objective automated operating system s conventional technical orientation to a practical one it includes the sustainable development viewpoints where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district it is worth noting that the developed system is restricted to water distribution systems as the crucial component of off farm agricultural water management the smart operating system can be employed as a decision support model to prioritize the surface water distribution within an irrigation district with the conjunctive surface groundwater operation a study conducted on an irrigation district in spain showed that not only fairly distribution is not possible but also more than 50 of the supplied water was lost due to poor management of operating systems of the agricultural water distribution network serra et al 2016 besides a study was conducted in four farming areas in ethiopia showed that improper operation damaged hydraulic structures and development of irrigation infrastructure without upgrading proper management programs were the causes of the low level of agricultural water productivity which was followed by extreme inequity in water distribution agide et al 2016 also similar studies reveal that the unreliable performance of the surface water distribution systems in irrigation districts lead to the excessive exploitation of aquifers located beneath the agricultural regions has faced many areas of the world such as the middle east north africa china india japan and spain with serious issues related to sustainability of groundwater resources and with socio environmental problems aw hassan et al 2014 burns et al 2017 izady et al 2015 llamas and custodio 2002 srinivasan and nuthalapati 2019 hence smart management of agricultural water distribution through automation of the hydraulic structures including water level regulators and off takes is among the serious actions that need to be taken in order to provide an equitable and reliable distribution between the downstream and upstream water holders different methods have been proposed as automation alternatives in the surface water distribution systems the most widely used automation alternative is the centralized control systems which have been discussed in many studies in terms of design regulation methods and implementation results in laboratory settings and in prototype scales these controllers can thoroughly simulate the hydraulic conditions of the water distribution system for the entire system and not just for a canal segment and the regulation values of all water level regulators are applied to all the structures at the same time the literature review on these control systems revealed their suitable water distribution in multipurpose industrial agricultural systems multipurpose exploitation of reservoir canal distribution system pumping system agricultural systems with the purpose of fair water distribution in water scarcity conditions and in implementation of multipurpose economic technical goals fele et al 2014 hashemy shahdany et al 2017 shahdany et al 2016 tian et al 2017 van overloop et al 2014 wahlin and zimbelman 2018 the centralized control system was selected as the automation method in this study due to its capabilities different operating systems thanks to the diversity of the control system have been employed in the field scale to set up equitable and reliable water distribution moreover different measures including off line regulating reservoirs clemmens 2012 and in line reservoir within the canal networks hashemy et al 2013 as a buffer for the variations in the flow rate have been integrated with the automated control systems these reservoirs are filled mostly at night times when the water demand drops and then the stored water will be served during the daily operation by increasing the demands clemmens 2012 proposed a smart system with the objective of fair distribution of excess shortage water in canal networks where an automated control system was coupled with an operational strategy called difference error d e strategy the primary goal was to have an automated operating system that makes the water levels within the canal reaches fall and raise commonly when mismatches among the water demands and canal inflow occurred within the operational time the proposed approach was implemented by the linear quadratic regulator operating system in central arizona project usa by guan et al 2011 another similar study was conducted in an arid region in khuzestan province in iran where the d e operational strategy was coupled with a series of decentralized proportional integral controllers as a fall back operating system for the main centralized one hashemy and van overloop 2013 since the decentralized configuration reacts slowly in sharing excess shortage water within the canal reaches the d e operational strategy was integrated with the centralized model predictive mpc controller for this test case in another study conducted by hashemy et al 2015 comparing the results of the latter one with the previous study reveals the fast response of the automated system in sharing the excess shortage of water among the reaches although considerable technical measures have been taken to establish reliable fairly and sustainable water distribution in the irrigation districts regarding the abovementioned studies it should be noted that this improvement restricted to a single technical orientation prioritizing the technical criteria rather than the social economic and environmental ones led to the unnoticeable improvement in water conservation or water productivity in general despite significant investment in the automation project in agricultural water distribution off farm water management scale no change in the water productivity lecina et al 2010 playán and mateos 2006 conflict resolution in farms societies especially between the upstream and the downstream ones nor groundwater overexploitation hosseini jolfan et al 2020 have been achieved within irrigation districts the objective of water conservation no matter of the surface or groundwater resources not only fulfilled due to the modernization but also replacing the high water demand crops with the low water demand crops and increasing the cropping area is reported hassani and hashemy shahdany 2019 hassani et al 2019 playán and mateos 2006 the independent preliminary assessment took place in the present study show that in most of the iranian modern irrigation districts the number of tube wells has been increased and also in many cases the farmers have tried to deepen the tube wells by drilling them accordingly despite the incredible potential of the automated operating systems in the implementation of various operational objectives it is necessary to upgrade these modern automated systems to be responsible for the social economic and environmental concerns the present study introduces a modified configuration of the automated operating system capable of considering the social economic and environmental concerns in taking actions in the present study a component included i feature selection and ii unsupervised pattern recognition methods is integrated with the automatic control system to decrease the subjectivity and single objective orientation of these operating systems the principal component analysis pca was employed as the feature selection method to prioritize the criteria and the crisp clustering method of k means used for the regionalization of the irrigation district considering the selected criteria the output of this component is a few clusters i e regions with different priorities for receiving the surface water by the automatic control system the new methodology enables the district managers to take different socio economic criteria and environmental preferences into account in fairly irrigation water distribution in the modified operating system the equity concept turned to systematic definitions based on the social economic and environmental status of each test case 2 conceptual model of the proposed smart distribution system fig 1 shows the conceptual model of the present research included the relationships between the components of the developed operating system this study was conducted in the following six steps data collection two different types of data were collected included i socio economic and environmental features and ii hydraulic data the recent data gathered in the field surveys activities and also during interviews by the stakeholders in an irrigation district such as farmers union correspondents individually selected farmers and local authorities responsible for supplying the agricultural inputs and extension services regarding the latter set of data i e hydraulic and operational data the required information for modeling calibration and verifications of the hydraulic models were collected from the ditch riders operating personals and the local experts data preprocessing one of the first actions before employing the data mining approach clustering method in the present study is the pre processing data stage firstly the gathered data were thoroughly checked for omitting the bias data and replacing them with the correct ones after that the pca analysis was employed as a feature selection method the main objective is enabling the researcher to take a wide range of features including social environmental agricultural and economic features into account for the clustering in other words not only some specific criteria can be defined as the clustering input but also the dominant features and attributes causing different patterns of using agricultural water supplied from the surface or groundwater are allowed to be included in the data matrix for the clustering thus pca is integrated with the clustering to consider all parameters and select the effective ones it is worth noting that pca the linear technique for dimensionality reduction is known as one of the most common unsupervised feature extraction methods dash et al 2019 clustering the data matrix the data matrix includes individual vectors of the finalized features from the previous step pre processing in this study the most applicable algorithm of the crisp clustering known as the k means method is employed for grouping the objects of the data matrix each of the objects includes the dominant features identified by the pca this crisp clustering method produced a few clusters where the entire farm in an irrigation district group to a couple of clusters post processing the post processing consists of an iterative process included i spatial assessment of the clustering results by producing geo reference maps of the clusters in gis ii expert oriented analysis of the results by comparing the spatial analysis results output of the previous step with the status quo of the test case it is worth noting that since the optimum number of clusters is not a single number and a range of possible numbers are introduced by the relevant indices it is needed to have the expert opinions iii clustering integration the experience of the authors show that in many cases the variation range of the features belongs to the farms located in a cluster in some final clusters are common so in these cases theses clusters need to be integrated to facilitate further steps in the study hydraulic simulation of the distribution network this simulation model simulates two hydraulic variables of water level and delivers discharge at each off take structure where the supplied surface water is delivered to an irrigated unit performance appraisal of the operating system based on the equity and adequacy of water delivery becomes possible based on the variation of these two variables during the operational period automatic operating system mpc controller computes the required adjustments for opening closing the water level regulation structures at each time step the computed controlled variables i e adjustments of the entire structures located alongside the distribution network convey to the hydraulic simulation model mentioned in the previous step to simulates the state variables i e water level and delivered discharge at the location of the off takes in the modified configuration of the mpc developed in this study the cluster s priorities served by the controller to deliver the irrigation water based on this priority order 3 material and methods 3 1 clustering pre processing principal component analysis pca there are always a few dominant actors within the entire social economic and environmental criteria depending on the study objectives in this regard it would be beneficial to employ a technique to make a ranking within the probable features and selects the most effective ones to this end the pca technique as a pre processing step of the clustering was integrated with the proposed modified configuration of mpc to select a subset of features with the most significant impact on supplying the irrigation water the principle component analysis as a multivariate statistical analysis technique is a robust measure for analyzing high dimensional datasets based on the pca method principle combinations of p initial variables of y1 y2 yp are created to develop a maximum of p independent components as pc1 pc2 pcp where the components can be specified by the extension presented in eq 1 han et al 2012a 1 p c 1 w 11 y 1 w 12 y 2 w 1 p y p p c 2 w 21 y 1 w 22 y 2 w 2 p y p p c p w p 1 y 1 w p 2 y 2 w p p y p here p c 1 and w 1 p are represents the component of interest and the coefficient related to the primary variables respectively it should be mentioned that the w 1 p coefficients are estimated so that the first component explains the maximum variance of the data pca is carried out by the following steps 1 input variables standardization to make an average of zero and a standard deviation equal one 2 computing the covariance correlation matrix for the initial variables 3 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculation based on the correlation matrix from the previous step one of the standard approaches in assigning each individual s weight or contribution is employing the eigenvector coefficient from step 2 for that feature caliendo and parisi 2005 the coefficient for each feature determines how important that feature is for the particular component the weight of each individual is in essence a new feature that combines all of the original features each of the principal component axes represents an independent pattern of variation as the original data the scores are axes that can be graphed 4 a criterion determination mostly using the eigenvalue percent variance and cut off criteria for extracting the number of factors 5 active variables selection based on principal factor analysis by proper rotation on the component coefficient matrix 3 2 cluster analysis the purpose of cluster analysis is classifying a dataset into some groups according to similar characteristics of the data clustering analysis also called unsupervised pattern recognition has become popular because of its ability to classify unlabeled data according to similarities among them resemblances between objects defined by distances between them are calculated by distance norms e g euclidean distance norm han et al 2012b hashemy and monem 2012 javadi et al 2017 javadi et al 2020 lei et al 2017 monem and hashemy 2011 nourzadeh et al 2013 van der heijden et al 2005 in this research one of the most applicable clustering methods namely k means is applied this algorithm follows a simple way for grouping a set of objects into a certain number of clusters based on the defined attributes as described in the following three steps han et al 2012b 1 define k cluster centers randomly as the first location of cluster centers 2 assign each object to its closest cluster center and compute the new cluster repeat this step until convergence is achieved i e until the cluster membership is stable 3 merge and split clusters based on some heuristic information optionally repeating step 2 convergence criterion is satisfied when reassignment of any data point from one cluster to another can be stopped after some number of iterations k means algorithm aims to minimize an objective function over the m n dimensional data matrix x into c clusters as follows han et al 2012c 2 j x v i 1 c k i m x k i v i 2 where v v i i 1 c is the cluster centers and x k i is the k t h object belonging to the i t h cluster x k i v i 2 is distance measure norm which is an indicator of the distance of the m data points from their respective cluster centers besides cluster centers are calculated as follows han et al 2012c 3 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where a i is the set of objects that belong to the cluster i and n i is the number of the objects the difficulty in using partition clustering like the k means algorithm is choosing the optimal number of clusters in this research a cluster separation index is used which is based on both the within scatter of the clusters in a given clustering and the separation between the clusters davies and bouldin were proposed the d b index dbi which assumes that clusters are spherical and a desirable clustering consists of compact well separated clusters theodoridis et al 2010 the optimal number of clusters is determined in an iterative procedure where the k means clustering method needs to be performed from 2 no of clusters to a reasonable one as the maximum number of clusters c max in this regard a proposed rule of thumb used by many investigators is c max n to specify the upper bound of the clustering for each iteration the values of dbi are determined and the obtained value should be plotted versus the number of clusters based on theodoridis et al 2010 suggestion the plot s elbow point mentioned above is the optimal number of clusters 3 3 developing a hydraulic simulation of water distribution network the mathematical model of flow hydraulics in the main canal of the water distribution system was programmed in matlab to facilitate information exchange with the controller various researchers have compared the capabilities of different mathematical models in different studies horváth et al 2010 to use them in designing controllers and have analyzed their weaknesses and strengths among the available models only the linearized saint venant model and the integrator delay i d model are widely used in system automation projects in this model every main canal reach of the water distribution system consists of two parts i the uniform flow part and ii the backwater flow part fig 2a each part has one main characteristic and the integration of these two forms in the i d model the two characteristics of each canal reach are the delay time τ and the storage area a s in the first part the uniform flow it is assumed that the inflow moves only downstream of the canal every change in the upstream water level regulator generates a wave this section of the canal acts only as a transition stage for the flow of this wave furthermore the wave speed in a canal reach of the normal depth is close to the kinematic wave speed hashemy and roozbahani 2016 van overloop 2006b the delay time resulting from the motion of the mentioned wave reaches the backwater curve and changes the stage of the stream the delay time is the only parameter considered in the uniform flow parts to explain the flow in the continuous time space the integrator delay model is proposed as eq 4 for both temporal analysis and frequency analysis shahdany et al 2019 van overloop 2006b 4 d h t d t 1 a s q i n t τ q o u t t h s e τ s a s s q i n s q o u t s here q i n represents the inflow discharge in the uniform flow part m3 s q canal the inflow discharge of the storage area m3 s 1 and t sec and τ s the time and delay time respectively a s shows the reservoir area m2 h the water depth m and q o u t the outflow discharge rate of the backwater flow part m3 s 1 the calibration and verification of the canal operation model studied in this research that was developed using the simplified mathematical i d model were carried out based on the data collected at the research site during the march august utilization period in 2018 model calibration was based on the degree of agreement between the data on inflow discharge rates at all the off takes located in the main canal of the water distribution system to be used as the calibration coefficient the following statistical parameters were employed to compare the simulated values with the observed values hashemy et al 2018 kaghazchi et al 2021 khiabani et al 2020 5 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n crm i 1 n x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i here x i and y i are the simulated and observed values respectively the root means square error rmse indicates the percentage of total differences between observed and simulated values compared to the mean of observed values the optimal value of this parameter is zero which shows that the observed and simulated values match the crm is an index demonstrating the constant distributed errors in all simulated values if the value of this index is zero it indicates that there is no distributed error on the simulated values concerning the observed values another popular measure for the comparison of simulated and observed values is the mae the optimal value of which is zero equity indicator is employed to investigate fairly water distribution and defined as eq 6 shahdany and firoozfar 2017 6 p e 1 r r c v s q d q r here p e shows the equity of surface water distribution r indicates the total number of off takes located in the main canal q d the discharge delivered to the off takes m3 s 1 and q r the agricultural water demand discharge m3 s 1 the closer the values to 0 the more desirable their values will be nevertheless based on the classification proposed by molden and gates 1990 there are three acceptable classes indicating the desirable acceptable and poor operational performance of the water distribution system 3 4 modified configuration of model predictive control this method is a control system the design technique of which benefits from a feedback and feedforward control method an optimization method for calculating the output controller variable and water levels in the water distribution system the controller is responsible for making the water level reach the target level at the off take by regulating the degree of openness of the regulator located upstream of every canal reach the model predictive controller mpc uses the mathematical model of the controlled system the internal model to predict hydraulic variables water levels adjacent to each off take within a specific time interval this interval which is named horizon in this controller is defined following the design goal of the automated control system in this study the interval was considered 24 h based on the recommendation of van overloop et al 2010 the control commands were determined in each time step based on the simulated hydraulic conditions in the internal controller model along the temporal horizon and real time measurements in the canal after the control commands are determined separately for each regulator by the controller they are sent to actuators located at the site of each regulator to be executed in controlling a hydraulic system through the mpc method the state space model is employed to express the internal model because this model makes it possible to compress the multivariate formulation of linear models the state space model used in the primary canal of a water distribution system can generally be expressed in the form of a pair of eq 7 barkhordari et al 2020 kamrani et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 7 x k 1 a k x k b u u k b d d k y k c x k the objective function can be defined as eq 8 hashemy et al 2015 maestre and negenborn 2014 maestre et al 2014 2013 8 min j x t q x u t r u here j is the objective function that must be minimized x the state variables including water level adjacent to each off take u control commands including the extent to which the degrees of openness of the regulators change q the weight matrix for state variables and r the weight matrix for control operations to make an equitable water distribution no matter of the excess water or water shortage conditions the hashemy et al 2015 proposed a unique configuration of the mpc called it mpc de by inserting a new state variable d eq 9 which demonstrates the water level error e j differences within the distribution network this variable speed up the process of sharing an error e j occurred due to excess shortage water in the network among the canal reaches the sate variable is determined by eq 9 9 d j e j 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 e i therefore the state space model for the controller with the primary objective of fairly water distribution becomes as eq 10 10 q h g k 1 q h g k q h g k 1 q h g k 2 e 1 k 1

first canal reach considering delay time due to water traveling in the canal d is a state variable in each canal reach demonstrate the water level difference error in comparison with the other reaches in the modified configuration of mpc employed in the present study the clustering results affect the penalty matrices on the state variables q hashemy et al 2017 optimization constraints in a water distribution system include operational and physical restrictions the optimization algorithm used in the mpc can narrow down the problem solving area by applying these constraints in some cases these constraints must never be violated in solving the problem for instance when they show constant values such as the regulator s maximum openness the violation of these constraints can damage the equipment and structures such constraints are called hard constraints the second group of constraints contains those that are called soft constraints because they can be violated in some cases hard constraints are used as severe constraints in optimization against the system status x or the controllable variables u however soft constraints are used as additional costs weights for the input values or situations when these constraints are violated soft constraints are applied in computations by adding an auxiliary variable of the system status e k and a controllable auxiliary variable u k in the water distribution system for instance the auxiliary variable of the system status is of the calculated error type in every canal reach e k shown by e i k in the conventional mpc primary weighting factors on state variables of water level error e soft constraint e and different error states d are selected based on the maximum allowed value estimate factor shahdany et al 2016 van overloop 2006b however to fulfill the objective of this study the weighting procedure is followed by the clustering results where the clusters included farms with overexploitation from the aquifer get the lowest penalty otherwise clusters with the farms dependent on the surface water with lowest groundwater exploitation receive the highest penalty therefore the penalty on the state variables is defined as follows 11 q e j e j d j k 1 g o e j k j 1 n g o e j k g o e j k l 1 m q p u m p l k l 1 m i w r l k q o f f t a k e k where j demonstrate the cluster number q e j e j d j is the matrix cells of the penalty matrix multiply by the state variables e e and d of those canal reaches supply water for the cluster j g o e j is the groundwater overexploitation in each cluster m is a number of tube wells encompasses by each the cluster j boundaries q p u m p l is extracted water from individual pump stations l in cluster j m3 s 1 and i w r l represent the irrigation water requirement of the farm l in the cluster j m3 s 1 3 5 the water distribution system test case the study area located in the arid region of central iran suffers water scarcity the study area gets the latest priority for taking water from the zayandeh rud river since other sections included the isfahan metropolis and other five irrigation districts at the upstream of the basin are fulfilled before the roodasht district briefly the study area selection was conducted based on reasons that created the roodasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the logic behind this selection is as follows i unreliable supply of the required surface water by the river resulted in inflow fluctuations and water shortages in the main and lateral canals according to the field measurement conducted during this study the inflow to the main canal has an average deficit of 5 40 in daily operation ii the region s social tensions due to limited water supply and inequity in water distribution alongside the main canal hashemy et al 2016 iii the improper design and the multiplicity of water level regulating structures that have led to a significant water level drop along the main canal and eventually lead to considerable water losses during the operational activities shahdany and firoozfar 2017 iv the multitude of groundwater wells and a substantial reduction in the region s aquifer khiabani et al 2020 the unstable surface water distribution in this irrigation district enforces the farmers to drilled tube wells and eventually the water exploitation from the aquifer beneath the district has intensified fig 3 demonstrates how the farmer s tendency has been shifted to the groundwater resource for supplying their irrigation water demand and the increase in the number of tube wells the roodasht north branch rnb main canal depicted in fig 4 and given in table 1 is selected as a test case study the rnb canal has 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches reach is the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static head long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes responsible for supplying water for 26 secondary canals laterals in the test canal taking water for the laterals the test case supplies the irrigation water for 27 208 ha of the cultivated area where the supplied water is distributed through the hierarchical canal networks i e main secondary tertiary and farm canals 4 results 4 1 data cleaning and feature selection according to the objective of this study the entire social environmental economic and technical criteria information inputs and consideration that influenced the process of groundwater overexploitation were included in the questionnaire the fieldwork of this study lasted 7 months included i interviews by the random farmers ditch riders operating personnel and the local authorities ii field data collection from the pump stations with missing data and random inspection for those with data to verify the available information iii interviews by retailers of agricultural inputs and extension services the agricultural data was gathered from the database of the agriculture ministry center in isfahan division of agronomy included cultivated area cropping pattern land use and cadaster maps to extract property s metes and bounds of the rural regions and cultivated land parcels in the district also socio economic information such as the revenues number of family members level of education level of agricultural knowledge agricultural input costs especially the energy and water costs was gathered from the field visits and interview sessions during this study the environmental information included groundwater exploitation from the aquifer and energy consumption the former data and information were provided based on the farmers random questionaris and verified by the esfahan regional water company s recorded data the energy consumption information was obtained from three resources i farmers claim and statements ii the ministry of energy and local electricity distribution company database and iii the energy consumption was calculated in individual pump stations based on the amount of water extracted by the tube wells using the eq 12 proposed for measuring water pumping energy in deep and semi deep wells daccache et al 2014 12 energy kwh volume m 3 th m 367 μ pump μ motor where µpump 80 and µmotor 40 and µmotor 90 for diesel motors moreover volume shows the water volume m3 and th the well depth m the data cleaning procedure of this study included 1 removing the unconfirmed collected data any of the authorities has not confirmed some parts of the collected data and the accuracy of the information could not verify 2 comparing the dependent features to merge or remove extra features the results of this procedure were given in table 2 according to the table the dependent features data were removed within the second phase of data cleaning for instance among the working hours energy consumption energy cost electromotor consumption voltage measured pump discharge by the flowmeters the extracted water claimed by the farmers the daily working hours claimed by the farmers and the discharge of the tube wells claimed by the farmers in each pump station only the measured pump discharge by the flowmeters feature was selected for the further analysis it is worth noting that the entries selected features in table 2 have quantitative inherent except the level of university education and specialization of each farmer esf where it quantizes into integer values of 0 4 demonstrate illiterate primary education secondary education bachelor of science and master of science respectively in the next step pca was used as the clustering pre processing measure to reduce the number of features to determine the most dominant ones as mentioned earlier pca is the most commonly used feature selection extraction measures performed in prtools toolbox in matlab the results of employing pca on the data set are given in table 3 according to the results the six features of goe esf ssw u w ca and dai showed more than 90 of the variance a significant variance shows the significance of the chosen features were selected as the essential features affecting the objective of the study according to table 3 in the descending order of the effectiveness features goe 21 2 uw 18 5 ssw 16 3 ca 15 2 dai 14 3 and esf 13 3 the features in each component i e pc1 pc6 were selected based on the highest coefficient given in table 4 for instance in the first component the percentage of groundwater overexploitation obtained the highest value of the weight coefficient and was selected as the most compelling feature in the first component similarly the rest of the features included spw e g and d f were not selected due to their low impact on the objective of this study however it is worth noting that the different combination of features included the rest of the features or even other features that have not been selected in this study maybe chosen for other common studies for instance the economic value of water per each crop may be more influential in a study with economic objectives rather than the satisfaction from surface water delivery 4 2 clustering results grouping the data was lunched by performing the clustering k means algorithm from the lowest possible of the clusters i e 2 no of clusters to the maximum allowable one i e square number of data samples to find the optimum number of clusters thus the clustering was iteratively performed from 2 to 83 no of clusters and the clustering validity index of d b is calculated in the individual clustering iteration according to duin et al 2007 recommendation the optimal number of clusters with the highest possibility occurred in the elbow point of the plotted curve where the trend of d b index curve alters to the milder slope although the expectation from a crisp clustering method like the k means algorithm in the present study is to have deterministic results the experiences of the authors and other data miners reveal the clustering and data mining methods in general would lead to reasonable results if an upper and lower limit was taken in assessing the results accordingly the optimum cluster candidates belong to the range of 4 6 with d b index values of 1 12 0 91 where the 6 clusters were selected as the optimum number after finding out the optimum number of clusters for the dataset the clustering results are depicted in fig 5 the mentioned figure tries to visualize the partition matrix including the cluster labels reveals spatial dispersion of the clusters within the irrigation district the obtained six clusters are distinguished by the different patterns in fig 5 where a regionalization of the district is made based on the dominant features since the six dominant features i

needs further investigation therefore the post processing of the clustering results was conducted based on an expert oriented assessment by comparing the spatial analysis of the clustering with the status quo of the test case the main objective was to verify the clustering results based on the facts in the test case to this end mostly the clustering integration or even in some cases the clustering separation has occurred the experience of the authors shows that in many cases the variation range of the features belongs to the farms located in a cluster in some final clusters are common so in these cases these clusters need to be integrated to facilitate further steps in the study table 5 including maximum and minimum variation and mean mode values of the dominant features within the clusters can justify any integration separation clustering action according to fig 5 following finding achieved feature goe uncommon values c 1 c 6 shared values c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 feature

to a single cluster as well as clusters c 4 c 5 and the final clusters after the integration are mapped in fig 6 finally the clusters ranking was conducted based on the objective of the study that is providing fairly surface water distribution with the priority of the regions based on the social economic and environmental criteria accordingly the integrated clusters 1 to 4 has the following

new instruction to prioritize the regions for surface water distribution 4 3 hydraulic simulation model the results of calibration and validation of the hydraulic simulation model i d model through statistical indicators including rmse mae and crm are given in table 6 a comparison of these results with the results gained from similar studies showed that the desirability of calibration and validation processes for instance the rmse and mae are respectively within the ranges of 0 0349 0 0369 and 0 020 0 022 cubic meters per second in shahrokhnia and javan 2005 and in dejen 2015 rmse and crm indicators were reported acceptable within the ranges of 0 06 0 09 and 0 07 0 02 cubic meters per second respectively according to table 6 it can be concluded that the present study s results are closer to zero in comparison to the acceptable ranges of studies mentioned above therefore the accuracy of the developed hydrodynamic model is confirmed 4 4 surface water distribution operating system the main objective was to analyze the operational status i e surface water distribution satisfactory of the distribution system for comparing the equity of water distribution in the status quo and after implementing the developed smart system two operational scenarios which most likely occurs in all irrigation districts in the global scale are considered included i when the main canal inflow is equal to the total agricultural water demands and ii when demands for water at the off takes i e stakeholder s water demands were kept constant the inflow discharge into the system faced a 20 reduction the agricultural water distribution operating system status quo mpc de and the developed smart system was simulated separately for each of the three operation methods under the mentioned scenarios the degree of desirability of the fairly surface water distribution was computed based on the performance evaluation indicator depicted in fig 7 a f spatial distribution of adequacy of water delivery named iso adequate in fig 7 was conducted in gis to have a clear vision of the operations systems performances in fair distribution fig 7 a b shows how the objective of fairly water distribution by the existing operating system is far from the truth not only in water shortage operational scenarios but also under the normal condition these figures show that the operating system is capable of supplying more or less enough water for the upstream regions while the downstream farms can supply 70 of their water demands from the surface water in the best of circumstances significant improvement inequitable distribution of water was achieved by upgrading the existing system with the mpc de operating one as shown in fig 7 c d comparing these two figures clearly reveal that the operating system enforces thanks to the d e operational strategy to spread the shortage water within the district since lines follow the prevailing trend in both of the normal and shortage scenarios the developed smart operating system according to fig 7 e f taken the priorities obtained from the clustering results in distribution so that more than 90 of clusters c 1 and c 4 received more than 80 of their demands according to clemmens et al 1998 molden and gates 1990 the performance of an operating system is assessed well when more than 80 of the demands are fulfilled comparing the iso adequate line of 80 in fig 7 d and f reveals the effect of upgrading the automatic control systems with complementary components e g clustering model in the present study to lead the operational statue in practical manners 5 discussion different challenges appear in conducting this research included i the necessity of employing pca as the pre processing of the clustering in other words how does the performance of the proposed clustering method change with and without considering the pre processing stage ii assuring the optimum number of clusters which affects the performance of the developed controller and iii reliability of employing the developed smart operating system to fulfill the practical objectives and iv how does the smart system fulfill the sustainable development objectives in distributing the agricultural water distribution according to these controversial issues more investigation was conducted to find out proposer responses to these challenges first challenge the necessity of employing prepossessing for clustering regarding the first concern the proposed clustering method was employed under the two scenarios of with without employing the pca the clustering iteratively performed from two to the maximum number of features the results show that the d b index has not reached a specified pattern to specify the elbow point area to determine the optimum number of clusters since the pca provides a set of linear combinations of the features for the clustering accordingly we can state that the clustering method needs to be accompanied by a feature selection or feature reduction algorithm pca in this study to specify the most important features for the clustering application of the clustering without the algorithm would be helpful if the entire features are thoroughly analyzed and investigated by an expert it is worth noting that even by employing the feature selection algorithm the expert perspective is essential because the application of any data mining approach led to consistent results when the process was supervised via experts in the field of the study accordingly the proposed simple easy to use practical expert oriented method for replacing the pca is the analytic hierarchy process ahp however it is worth noting that the application of ahp and other similar weighting methods would be useful when i the objective is just prioritizing the features criteria and ii clustering is performed and led to the reasonable optimum number of clusters candidates if the latter one is not reached it needs to apply the pca method second challenge assuring the optimum number of clusters in the present study the optimum number of clusters is selected based on an iterative procedure among the extracted candidates it would be considered as a drawback for this process where the number of iterative actions can be increased and personalization prevails over being systematic accordingly the second challenge caused the authors to find out the optimum number of clusters based on the method proposed by ünlü and xanthopoulos 2019 and the optimum number of clusters was selected according to the maximum silhouette value this index is a measure of how similar an object farms in this study is to its own cluster compared to other clusters c 1 to c 6 in the present study the silhouette ranges from 1 to 1 where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters for the dataset of this study the maximum silhouette value ünlü and xanthopoulos 2019 obtained 0 63 for the six number of clusters therefore the results of the d b index show the complete match by the silhouette value measure third challenge reliability of the developed smart operating system for fairly water distribution since the objective of this study i e surface water operational management based on social economic and environmental priorities is considered as the novelty of the manuscript no similar studies with the common objective were found accordingly to provide a reasonable response to this challenge the operating system proposed by clemmens 2012 was redesigned and customized for the study area in this regard the developed lqr controller designed for this test case of this study and reported in hashemy shahdany and firoozfar 2017 was modified by including the d e variables to state variable matrix the modified lqr controller was performed under the two operational scenarios of the present study the results are summarized and given in table 7 where verifies the reliable performance of the developed smart operating system in fairly water distribution fourth challenge how does the smart system fulfill the sustainable development objectives in distributing the agricultural water distribution it is worth noting that thanks to the development of the control engineering method different controllers included decentralized and centralized configurations that can be employed for any water system to minimize water losses in the agriculture sector however the missing link would be developing pragmatic strategies capable of integrating with the controllers to provide practical orientations for fulfilling the environmental social and economic objectives redesigning the controllers proposed by clemmens 2012 guan et al 2011 hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop 2006a for the test case of this study verified the technical abilities of this robust operating systems but there is an essential need to upgrade these systems to deal with the real non technical concerns and considerations in the complex agricultural water systems accordingly the obtained results of the present study were evaluated based on environmental social and economic perspectives different environmental oriented criteria were selected where the percentage of groundwater overexploitation goe and drainage failures during a season d f was selected as the environmental features due to critical of these issues during the pre processing stage the pca analysis selected the former one as the most dominant feature for the clustering but the following criteria were not selected although the importance of the drainage problems in many farms the pca selection was verified by the operating system experts since the problem mostly originated from i poor water management in on farm scale which irrelevant to the domain of this study and ii delivering extra water to farms where this phenomena rarely occurred due to water shortage conditions happened in the recent decade investigating the goe variations within the clusters reveals that the high priority clusters i e c 1 and c 4 have the minimum range of goe and the maximum rate of groundwater overexploitation took place in the farms located in the third clusters with the range of 40 63 it means that priority of surface water distribution needs to be allocated to those regions i without tube wells and supplied by the surface water or ii where the tube wells extract water from the aquifer based on the water right license the obtained results for the first group are reasonable however the second group does not make sense at first glance therefore variation of other features was assessed it shows that the social uw ssw and economic dai ca features have a viable footprint in this result the highest value of i the unemployed seasonal workers in c 1 ii satisfaction of surface water distribution in c 4 and a lower rate in c 1 iii dependency of the farmers to the agricultural incomes in c 4 and a lower rate in c 1 caused that these two clusters get that highest priority in receiving the surface water rather than the other two clusters c 2 and c 3 in other words the common features reveal that the farmers located in the clusters c 2 and c 3 have come to the fact that the operating system does not have the necessary capabilities to ensure reliable surface water distribution the economic features of c a verify the mentioned statement where the only increase of the cultivated area occurred in farms located in c 3 with the maximum distance to the main canal moreover the lowest rate of unemployment happened for this cluster which has the minimum satisfaction of surface water delivery these results mentioned above show that the farmers of c 3 and c 4 in a lower level have reached a stable agricultural activity mostly supplied by the groundwater resource the discussion sessions and brainstorming meetings with the operator personals district managers and operational water management experts verified that the obtained result is pragmatic and efficient since convincing the farmers of c 3 and c 4 to shift their dependency from groundwater resources to a conjunctive operation of groundwater surface water resources in the meantime or during a short horizon is impossible the main advantage of following the clustering results is to supply a reliable surface water distribution in c 1 and c 4 to control the increasing trend of drilling new tube wells including legal and the illegal ones and deepening the shallow tube wells 6 conclusions a new perspective is introduced in the present study for upgrading the performance of the automated operating system where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district to fulfill this objective a complementary component integrated with the automated operating system in order to shift the technical orientation of these systems to a practical one included the sustainable development viewpoints the component using the clustering method due to the high potential of the clustering methods for extracting useful information and patterns out of the large dataset to priorities the district s regions for receiving the limited surface water principle component analysis was integrated with the k means clustering algorithm to provide a ranking of the features and find out which features would be appropriate for starting the clustering the proposed component was employed on a data matrix consists of 1369 data samples each object represent a farm or an association of the farmers and based on the pca results and six features included environmental economic and social criteria consideration are selected as the dominant features making the data matrix for the clustering the d b index determines the optimum number of clusters shows the compactness of the created clusters and their level of separation from each other as well and then verified by the maximum silhouette value indicator post processing of the clustering results led to the integration of a couple of clusters and finally the test case of the study was grouped into 4 clusters with different priorities for receiving the surface water the priorities were served by the developed automated control system for distributing the surface water comparison of the obtained results of the developed system by status quo and common controllers developed for fairly water distribution reveals that the concept of the equity in water distribution is implemented by taking into account a wide range of considerations rather than the technical one the proposed method is simply possible to change add or remove the features based on different objectives or concerns in different study areas however the limitation of employing the proposed method is the lack of a mechanism for weighting the dominant features resulting in the pca since the primary motivation of conducting this study was upgrading capabilities of the automated operating system to handle the managers and authorities concern by dealing with the socio economic and environmental priorities the combination of pca and clustering components performs independently and any interference by the managers are not allowed except in i at the first stage when the features are selected and ii at the post processing stage when the clustering merging splitting is performed therefore the proposed complementary component in the present study can lead to undesirable results in the following conditions i when the dominant features are thoroughly recognized by the local managers or based on a group of experts opinion where it is proposed to omit the pca stage and clustering could be performed based on the specified features ii when the objectives from grouping the district based on a couple of specified features is apparent for the authorities in this condition the application of the supervised pattern recognition approaches like the classification algorithms is recommended instead of the clustering which is an unsupervised method iii when the process of data gathering interviews and brainstorm meetings confronted different obstacles included time and budget limitation and a lack of constructive cooperation from the farmer s societies in these circumstances it is highly recommended to replace the k means clustering component with the fuzzy clustering algorithms such as the fuzzy c means algorithm to include the uncertainties in the

10110,the present study proposed a smart operating system consists of two primary components of i unsupervised pattern recognition and ii automated control system the main goal is shifting the technical orientation of the single objective automated operating system to a practical one included the sustainable development viewpoints where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district a complementary component consists of the principal component analysis pca and a crisp clustering method is developed to fulfill this objective the proposed method was implemented in a real test case roodasht irrigation district in iran according to the pca analysis six features encompassing socio economic environmental and technical objectives were selected as the clustering s dominant features the district was regionalized to 6 regions based on the initial results of the clustering the integration of a couple of the clusters occurred in the post processing stage and finally the test case was grouped into 4 regions with different priorities for receiving the surface water the priorities were served as penalty values orders in the objective function of the developed automated controller a comparison of the developed smart system s obtained results by status quo reveals that moderately water distribution happened in normal and water shortage scenarios where the equity index obtained 8 5 and 11 5 respectively also reliable and adequate water delivered to regions belongs to the forth and first clusters where 37 and 38 of the region supplied more than 80 of their demands under the two scenarios respectively it is worth noting that the mentioned achievement created in the forth and first clusters with the minimum groundwater overexploitation the maximum dependency of farmers on agricultural activities incomes and the seasonal worker s highest rate of unemployment the developed smart system is capable of implementing the practical action of fairly water distribution based on the sustainable development concept rather than the technical one the proposed method is simply possible to change add or remove the features based on different objectives or concerns in different study areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords fairly water distribution operational modernization aquifer storage and recovery hard clustering automated system 1 introduction despite substantial investments made by governments local authorities and private sectors for modernization renovation and rehabilitation of the distribution networks the unsustainable operation of these networks has led to the simultaneous exploitation of groundwater resources in addition to using surface water as a reliable supply of water in farming areas babaei et al 2018 the primary reason for this over exploitation of groundwater is because of the poor performance of agricultural water distribution systems caused by factors such as defects in design lack of regular inspection and unfortunate maintenance activities and top down operational strategies that leads to inequitable water distribution among farmers of upstream and downstream villages burt 2013 performance improvement of these systems becomes the priority since the local authorities and water planning managers are aware of the potential social conflicts between the farmers and contentions economic consideration due to dependency of the farmers incomes to the agricultural activities and the environmental damages i e groundwater overexploitation within the irrigation district the present study develops a framework for smart operational management by replacing the single objective automated operating system s conventional technical orientation to a practical one it includes the sustainable development viewpoints where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district it is worth noting that the developed system is restricted to water distribution systems as the crucial component of off farm agricultural water management the smart operating system can be employed as a decision support model to prioritize the surface water distribution within an irrigation district with the conjunctive surface groundwater operation a study conducted on an irrigation district in spain showed that not only fairly distribution is not possible but also more than 50 of the supplied water was lost due to poor management of operating systems of the agricultural water distribution network serra et al 2016 besides a study was conducted in four farming areas in ethiopia showed that improper operation damaged hydraulic structures and development of irrigation infrastructure without upgrading proper management programs were the causes of the low level of agricultural water productivity which was followed by extreme inequity in water distribution agide et al 2016 also similar studies reveal that the unreliable performance of the surface water distribution systems in irrigation districts lead to the excessive exploitation of aquifers located beneath the agricultural regions has faced many areas of the world such as the middle east north africa china india japan and spain with serious issues related to sustainability of groundwater resources and with socio environmental problems aw hassan et al 2014 burns et al 2017 izady et al 2015 llamas and custodio 2002 srinivasan and nuthalapati 2019 hence smart management of agricultural water distribution through automation of the hydraulic structures including water level regulators and off takes is among the serious actions that need to be taken in order to provide an equitable and reliable distribution between the downstream and upstream water holders different methods have been proposed as automation alternatives in the surface water distribution systems the most widely used automation alternative is the centralized control systems which have been discussed in many studies in terms of design regulation methods and implementation results in laboratory settings and in prototype scales these controllers can thoroughly simulate the hydraulic conditions of the water distribution system for the entire system and not just for a canal segment and the regulation values of all water level regulators are applied to all the structures at the same time the literature review on these control systems revealed their suitable water distribution in multipurpose industrial agricultural systems multipurpose exploitation of reservoir canal distribution system pumping system agricultural systems with the purpose of fair water distribution in water scarcity conditions and in implementation of multipurpose economic technical goals fele et al 2014 hashemy shahdany et al 2017 shahdany et al 2016 tian et al 2017 van overloop et al 2014 wahlin and zimbelman 2018 the centralized control system was selected as the automation method in this study due to its capabilities different operating systems thanks to the diversity of the control system have been employed in the field scale to set up equitable and reliable water distribution moreover different measures including off line regulating reservoirs clemmens 2012 and in line reservoir within the canal networks hashemy et al 2013 as a buffer for the variations in the flow rate have been integrated with the automated control systems these reservoirs are filled mostly at night times when the water demand drops and then the stored water will be served during the daily operation by increasing the demands clemmens 2012 proposed a smart system with the objective of fair distribution of excess shortage water in canal networks where an automated control system was coupled with an operational strategy called difference error d e strategy the primary goal was to have an automated operating system that makes the water levels within the canal reaches fall and raise commonly when mismatches among the water demands and canal inflow occurred within the operational time the proposed approach was implemented by the linear quadratic regulator operating system in central arizona project usa by guan et al 2011 another similar study was conducted in an arid region in khuzestan province in iran where the d e operational strategy was coupled with a series of decentralized proportional integral controllers as a fall back operating system for the main centralized one hashemy and van overloop 2013 since the decentralized configuration reacts slowly in sharing excess shortage water within the canal reaches the d e operational strategy was integrated with the centralized model predictive mpc controller for this test case in another study conducted by hashemy et al 2015 comparing the results of the latter one with the previous study reveals the fast response of the automated system in sharing the excess shortage of water among the reaches although considerable technical measures have been taken to establish reliable fairly and sustainable water distribution in the irrigation districts regarding the abovementioned studies it should be noted that this improvement restricted to a single technical orientation prioritizing the technical criteria rather than the social economic and environmental ones led to the unnoticeable improvement in water conservation or water productivity in general despite significant investment in the automation project in agricultural water distribution off farm water management scale no change in the water productivity lecina et al 2010 playán and mateos 2006 conflict resolution in farms societies especially between the upstream and the downstream ones nor groundwater overexploitation hosseini jolfan et al 2020 have been achieved within irrigation districts the objective of water conservation no matter of the surface or groundwater resources not only fulfilled due to the modernization but also replacing the high water demand crops with the low water demand crops and increasing the cropping area is reported hassani and hashemy shahdany 2019 hassani et al 2019 playán and mateos 2006 the independent preliminary assessment took place in the present study show that in most of the iranian modern irrigation districts the number of tube wells has been increased and also in many cases the farmers have tried to deepen the tube wells by drilling them accordingly despite the incredible potential of the automated operating systems in the implementation of various operational objectives it is necessary to upgrade these modern automated systems to be responsible for the social economic and environmental concerns the present study introduces a modified configuration of the automated operating system capable of considering the social economic and environmental concerns in taking actions in the present study a component included i feature selection and ii unsupervised pattern recognition methods is integrated with the automatic control system to decrease the subjectivity and single objective orientation of these operating systems the principal component analysis pca was employed as the feature selection method to prioritize the criteria and the crisp clustering method of k means used for the regionalization of the irrigation district considering the selected criteria the output of this component is a few clusters i e regions with different priorities for receiving the surface water by the automatic control system the new methodology enables the district managers to take different socio economic criteria and environmental preferences into account in fairly irrigation water distribution in the modified operating system the equity concept turned to systematic definitions based on the social economic and environmental status of each test case 2 conceptual model of the proposed smart distribution system fig 1 shows the conceptual model of the present research included the relationships between the components of the developed operating system this study was conducted in the following six steps data collection two different types of data were collected included i socio economic and environmental features and ii hydraulic data the recent data gathered in the field surveys activities and also during interviews by the stakeholders in an irrigation district such as farmers union correspondents individually selected farmers and local authorities responsible for supplying the agricultural inputs and extension services regarding the latter set of data i e hydraulic and operational data the required information for modeling calibration and verifications of the hydraulic models were collected from the ditch riders operating personals and the local experts data preprocessing one of the first actions before employing the data mining approach clustering method in the present study is the pre processing data stage firstly the gathered data were thoroughly checked for omitting the bias data and replacing them with the correct ones after that the pca analysis was employed as a feature selection method the main objective is enabling the researcher to take a wide range of features including social environmental agricultural and economic features into account for the clustering in other words not only some specific criteria can be defined as the clustering input but also the dominant features and attributes causing different patterns of using agricultural water supplied from the surface or groundwater are allowed to be included in the data matrix for the clustering thus pca is integrated with the clustering to consider all parameters and select the effective ones it is worth noting that pca the linear technique for dimensionality reduction is known as one of the most common unsupervised feature extraction methods dash et al 2019 clustering the data matrix the data matrix includes individual vectors of the finalized features from the previous step pre processing in this study the most applicable algorithm of the crisp clustering known as the k means method is employed for grouping the objects of the data matrix each of the objects includes the dominant features identified by the pca this crisp clustering method produced a few clusters where the entire farm in an irrigation district group to a couple of clusters post processing the post processing consists of an iterative process included i spatial assessment of the clustering results by producing geo reference maps of the clusters in gis ii expert oriented analysis of the results by comparing the spatial analysis results output of the previous step with the status quo of the test case it is worth noting that since the optimum number of clusters is not a single number and a range of possible numbers are introduced by the relevant indices it is needed to have the expert opinions iii clustering integration the experience of the authors show that in many cases the variation range of the features belongs to the farms located in a cluster in some final clusters are common so in these cases theses clusters need to be integrated to facilitate further steps in the study hydraulic simulation of the distribution network this simulation model simulates two hydraulic variables of water level and delivers discharge at each off take structure where the supplied surface water is delivered to an irrigated unit performance appraisal of the operating system based on the equity and adequacy of water delivery becomes possible based on the variation of these two variables during the operational period automatic operating system mpc controller computes the required adjustments for opening closing the water level regulation structures at each time step the computed controlled variables i e adjustments of the entire structures located alongside the distribution network convey to the hydraulic simulation model mentioned in the previous step to simulates the state variables i e water level and delivered discharge at the location of the off takes in the modified configuration of the mpc developed in this study the cluster s priorities served by the controller to deliver the irrigation water based on this priority order 3 material and methods 3 1 clustering pre processing principal component analysis pca there are always a few dominant actors within the entire social economic and environmental criteria depending on the study objectives in this regard it would be beneficial to employ a technique to make a ranking within the probable features and selects the most effective ones to this end the pca technique as a pre processing step of the clustering was integrated with the proposed modified configuration of mpc to select a subset of features with the most significant impact on supplying the irrigation water the principle component analysis as a multivariate statistical analysis technique is a robust measure for analyzing high dimensional datasets based on the pca method principle combinations of p initial variables of y1 y2 yp are created to develop a maximum of p independent components as pc1 pc2 pcp where the components can be specified by the extension presented in eq 1 han et al 2012a 1 p c 1 w 11 y 1 w 12 y 2 w 1 p y p p c 2 w 21 y 1 w 22 y 2 w 2 p y p p c p w p 1 y 1 w p 2 y 2 w p p y p here p c 1 and w 1 p are represents the component of interest and the coefficient related to the primary variables respectively it should be mentioned that the w 1 p coefficients are estimated so that the first component explains the maximum variance of the data pca is carried out by the following steps 1 input variables standardization to make an average of zero and a standard deviation equal one 2 computing the covariance correlation matrix for the initial variables 3 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculation based on the correlation matrix from the previous step one of the standard approaches in assigning each individual s weight or contribution is employing the eigenvector coefficient from step 2 for that feature caliendo and parisi 2005 the coefficient for each feature determines how important that feature is for the particular component the weight of each individual is in essence a new feature that combines all of the original features each of the principal component axes represents an independent pattern of variation as the original data the scores are axes that can be graphed 4 a criterion determination mostly using the eigenvalue percent variance and cut off criteria for extracting the number of factors 5 active variables selection based on principal factor analysis by proper rotation on the component coefficient matrix 3 2 cluster analysis the purpose of cluster analysis is classifying a dataset into some groups according to similar characteristics of the data clustering analysis also called unsupervised pattern recognition has become popular because of its ability to classify unlabeled data according to similarities among them resemblances between objects defined by distances between them are calculated by distance norms e g euclidean distance norm han et al 2012b hashemy and monem 2012 javadi et al 2017 javadi et al 2020 lei et al 2017 monem and hashemy 2011 nourzadeh et al 2013 van der heijden et al 2005 in this research one of the most applicable clustering methods namely k means is applied this algorithm follows a simple way for grouping a set of objects into a certain number of clusters based on the defined attributes as described in the following three steps han et al 2012b 1 define k cluster centers randomly as the first location of cluster centers 2 assign each object to its closest cluster center and compute the new cluster repeat this step until convergence is achieved i e until the cluster membership is stable 3 merge and split clusters based on some heuristic information optionally repeating step 2 convergence criterion is satisfied when reassignment of any data point from one cluster to another can be stopped after some number of iterations k means algorithm aims to minimize an objective function over the m n dimensional data matrix x into c clusters as follows han et al 2012c 2 j x v i 1 c k i m x k i v i 2 where v v i i 1 c is the cluster centers and x k i is the k t h object belonging to the i t h cluster x k i v i 2 is distance measure norm which is an indicator of the distance of the m data points from their respective cluster centers besides cluster centers are calculated as follows han et al 2012c 3 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where a i is the set of objects that belong to the cluster i and n i is the number of the objects the difficulty in using partition clustering like the k means algorithm is choosing the optimal number of clusters in this research a cluster separation index is used which is based on both the within scatter of the clusters in a given clustering and the separation between the clusters davies and bouldin were proposed the d b index dbi which assumes that clusters are spherical and a desirable clustering consists of compact well separated clusters theodoridis et al 2010 the optimal number of clusters is determined in an iterative procedure where the k means clustering method needs to be performed from 2 no of clusters to a reasonable one as the maximum number of clusters c max in this regard a proposed rule of thumb used by many investigators is c max n to specify the upper bound of the clustering for each iteration the values of dbi are determined and the obtained value should be plotted versus the number of clusters based on theodoridis et al 2010 suggestion the plot s elbow point mentioned above is the optimal number of clusters 3 3 developing a hydraulic simulation of water distribution network the mathematical model of flow hydraulics in the main canal of the water distribution system was programmed in matlab to facilitate information exchange with the controller various researchers have compared the capabilities of different mathematical models in different studies horváth et al 2010 to use them in designing controllers and have analyzed their weaknesses and strengths among the available models only the linearized saint venant model and the integrator delay i d model are widely used in system automation projects in this model every main canal reach of the water distribution system consists of two parts i the uniform flow part and ii the backwater flow part fig 2a each part has one main characteristic and the integration of these two forms in the i d model the two characteristics of each canal reach are the delay time τ and the storage area a s in the first part the uniform flow it is assumed that the inflow moves only downstream of the canal every change in the upstream water level regulator generates a wave this section of the canal acts only as a transition stage for the flow of this wave furthermore the wave speed in a canal reach of the normal depth is close to the kinematic wave speed hashemy and roozbahani 2016 van overloop 2006b the delay time resulting from the motion of the mentioned wave reaches the backwater curve and changes the stage of the stream the delay time is the only parameter considered in the uniform flow parts to explain the flow in the continuous time space the integrator delay model is proposed as eq 4 for both temporal analysis and frequency analysis shahdany et al 2019 van overloop

calibration and verification of the canal operation model studied in this research that was developed using the simplified mathematical i d model were carried out based on the data collected at the research site during the march august utilization period in 2018 model calibration was based on the degree of agreement between the data on inflow discharge rates at all the off takes located in the main canal of the water distribution system to be used as the calibration coefficient the following statistical parameters were employed to compare the simulated values with the observed values hashemy et al 2018 kaghazchi et al 2021 khiabani et al 2020 5 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n crm i 1 n x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i here x i and y i are the simulated and observed values

it indicates that there is no distributed error on the simulated values concerning the observed values another popular measure for the comparison of simulated and observed values is the mae the optimal value of which is zero equity indicator is employed to investigate fairly water distribution and defined as eq 6 shahdany and firoozfar 2017 6 p e 1 r r c v s q d q r here p e shows the equity

desirable acceptable and poor operational performance of the water distribution system 3 4 modified configuration of model predictive control this method is a control system the design technique of which benefits from a feedback and feedforward control method an optimization method for calculating the output controller variable and water levels in the water distribution system the controller is responsible for making the water level reach the target level at the off take by regulating the degree of openness of the regulator located upstream of every canal reach the model predictive controller mpc uses the mathematical model of the controlled system the internal model to predict hydraulic variables water levels adjacent to each off take within a specific time interval this interval which is named horizon in this controller is defined following the design goal of the automated control system in this study the interval was considered 24 h based on the recommendation of van overloop et al 2010 the control commands were determined in each time step based on the simulated hydraulic conditions in the internal controller model along the temporal horizon and real time measurements in the canal after the control commands are determined separately for each regulator by the controller they are sent to actuators located at the site of each regulator to be executed in controlling a hydraulic system through the mpc method the state space model is employed to express the internal model because this model makes it possible to compress the multivariate formulation of linear models the state space model used in the primary canal of a water distribution system can generally be expressed in the form of a pair of eq 7 barkhordari et al 2020 kamrani et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 7 x k 1 a k x k b u u k b d d k y k c x k the objective function can be defined as eq 8 hashemy et al 2015 maestre and negenborn 2014 maestre et al 2014 2013 8 min j x t q x u t r u here j is the objective function that must be minimized x the state variables including water level adjacent to each off take u control commands including the extent to which the degrees of openness of the regulators change q the weight matrix for state variables and r the weight matrix for control operations to make an equitable water distribution no matter of the excess water or water shortage conditions the hashemy et al 2015 proposed a unique configuration of the mpc called it mpc de by inserting a new state variable d eq 9 which demonstrates the water level error e j differences within the distribution network this variable speed up the process of sharing an error e j occurred due to excess shortage water in the network among the canal reaches the sate variable is determined by eq 9 9 d j e j 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 e i therefore the state space model for the controller with the primary objective of fairly water distribution becomes as eq 10 10 q h g k 1 q h g k q h g k 1 q h g k 2 e 1 k 1

first canal reach considering delay time due to water traveling in the canal d is a state variable in each canal reach demonstrate the water level difference error in comparison with the other reaches in the modified configuration of mpc employed in the present study the clustering results affect the penalty matrices on the state variables q hashemy et al 2017 optimization constraints in a water distribution system include operational and physical restrictions the optimization algorithm used in the mpc can narrow down the problem solving area by applying these constraints in some cases these constraints must never be violated in solving the problem for instance when they show constant values such as the regulator s maximum openness the violation of these constraints can damage the equipment and structures such constraints are called hard constraints the second group of constraints contains those that are called soft constraints because they can be violated in some cases hard constraints are used as severe constraints in optimization against the system status x or the controllable variables u however soft constraints are used as additional costs weights for the input values or situations when these constraints are violated soft constraints are applied in computations by adding an auxiliary variable of the system status e k and a controllable auxiliary variable u k in the water distribution system for instance the auxiliary variable of the system status is of the calculated error type in every canal reach e k shown by e i k in the conventional mpc primary weighting factors on state variables of water level error e soft constraint e and different error states d are selected based on the maximum allowed value estimate factor shahdany et al 2016 van overloop 2006b however to fulfill the objective of this study the weighting procedure is followed by the clustering results where the clusters included farms with overexploitation from the aquifer get the lowest penalty otherwise clusters with the farms dependent on the surface water with lowest groundwater exploitation receive the highest penalty therefore the penalty on the state variables is defined as follows 11 q e j e j d j k 1 g o e j k j 1 n g o e j k g o e j k l 1 m q p u m p l k l 1 m i w r l k q o f f t a k e k where j demonstrate the cluster number q e j e j d j is the matrix

farm l in the cluster j m3 s 1 3 5 the water distribution system test case the study area located in the arid region of central iran suffers water scarcity the study area gets the latest priority for taking water from the zayandeh rud river since other sections included the isfahan metropolis and other five irrigation districts at the upstream of the basin are fulfilled before the roodasht district briefly the study area selection was conducted based on reasons that created the roodasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the logic behind this selection is as follows i unreliable supply of the required surface water by the river resulted in inflow fluctuations and water shortages in the main and lateral canals according to the field measurement conducted during this study the inflow to the main canal has an average deficit of 5 40 in daily operation ii the region s social tensions due to limited water supply and inequity in water distribution alongside the main canal hashemy et al 2016 iii the improper design and the multiplicity of water level regulating structures that have led to a significant water level drop along the main canal and eventually lead to considerable water losses during the operational activities shahdany and firoozfar 2017 iv the multitude of groundwater wells and a substantial reduction in the region s aquifer khiabani et al 2020 the unstable surface water distribution in this irrigation district enforces the farmers to drilled tube wells and eventually the water exploitation from the aquifer beneath the district has intensified fig 3 demonstrates how the farmer s tendency has been shifted to the groundwater resource for supplying their irrigation water demand and the increase in the number of tube wells the roodasht north branch rnb main canal depicted in fig 4 and given in table 1 is selected as a test case study the rnb canal has 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches reach is the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static head long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes responsible for supplying water for 26 secondary canals laterals in the test canal taking water for the laterals the test case supplies the irrigation water for 27 208 ha of the cultivated area where the supplied water is distributed through the hierarchical canal networks i e main secondary tertiary and farm canals 4 results 4 1 data cleaning and feature selection according to the objective of this study the entire social environmental economic and technical criteria information inputs and consideration that influenced the process of groundwater overexploitation were included in the questionnaire the fieldwork of this study lasted 7 months included i interviews by the random farmers ditch riders operating personnel and the local authorities ii field data collection from the pump stations with missing data and random inspection for those with data to verify the available information iii interviews by retailers of agricultural inputs and extension services the agricultural data was gathered from the database of the agriculture ministry center in isfahan division of agronomy included cultivated area cropping pattern land use and cadaster maps to extract property s metes and bounds of the rural regions and cultivated land parcels in the district also socio economic information such as the revenues number of family members level of education level of agricultural knowledge agricultural input costs especially the energy and water costs was gathered from the field visits and interview sessions during this study the environmental information included groundwater exploitation from the aquifer and energy consumption the former data and information were provided based on the farmers random questionaris and verified by the esfahan regional water company s recorded data the energy consumption information was obtained from three resources i farmers claim and statements ii the ministry of energy and local electricity distribution company database and iii the energy consumption was calculated in individual pump stations based on the amount of water extracted by the tube wells using the eq 12 proposed for measuring water pumping energy in deep and semi deep wells daccache et al 2014 12 energy kwh volume m 3 th m 367 μ pump μ motor where µpump 80 and µmotor 40 and µmotor 90 for diesel motors moreover volume shows the water volume m3 and th the well depth m the data cleaning procedure of this study included 1 removing the unconfirmed collected data any of the authorities has not confirmed some parts of the collected data and the accuracy of the information could not verify 2 comparing the dependent features to merge or remove extra features the results of this procedure were given in table 2 according to the table the dependent features data were removed within the second phase of data cleaning for instance among the working hours energy consumption energy cost electromotor consumption voltage measured pump discharge by the flowmeters the extracted water claimed by the farmers the daily working hours claimed by the farmers and the discharge of the tube wells claimed by the farmers in each pump station only the measured pump discharge by the flowmeters feature was selected for the further analysis it is worth noting that the entries selected features in table 2 have quantitative inherent except the level of university education and specialization of each farmer esf where it quantizes into integer values of 0 4 demonstrate illiterate primary education secondary education bachelor of science and master of science respectively in the next step pca was used as the clustering pre processing measure to reduce the number of features to determine the most dominant ones as mentioned earlier pca is the most commonly used feature selection extraction measures performed in prtools toolbox in matlab the results of employing pca on the data set are given in table 3 according to the results the six features of goe esf ssw u w ca and dai showed more than 90 of the variance a significant variance shows the significance of the chosen features were selected as the essential features affecting the objective of the study according to table 3 in the descending order of the effectiveness features goe 21 2 uw 18 5 ssw 16 3 ca 15 2 dai 14 3 and esf 13 3 the features in each component i e pc1 pc6 were selected based on the highest coefficient given in table 4 for instance in the first component the percentage of groundwater overexploitation obtained the highest value of the weight coefficient and was selected as the most compelling feature in the first component similarly the rest of the features included spw e g and d f were not selected due to their low impact on the objective of this study however it is worth noting that the different combination of features included the rest of the features or even other features that have not been selected in this study maybe chosen for other common studies for instance the economic value of water per each crop may be more influential in a study with economic objectives rather than the satisfaction from surface water delivery 4 2 clustering results grouping the data was lunched by performing the clustering k means algorithm from the lowest possible of the clusters i e 2 no of clusters to the maximum allowable one i e square number of data samples to find the optimum number of clusters thus the clustering was iteratively performed from 2 to 83 no of clusters and the clustering validity index of d b is calculated in the individual clustering iteration according to duin et al 2007 recommendation the optimal number of clusters with the highest possibility occurred in the elbow point of the plotted curve where the trend of d b index curve alters to the milder slope although the expectation from a crisp clustering method like the k means algorithm in the present study is to have deterministic results the experiences of the authors and other data miners reveal the clustering and data mining methods in general would lead to reasonable results if an upper and lower limit was taken in assessing the results accordingly the optimum cluster candidates belong to the range of 4 6 with d b index values of 1 12 0 91 where the 6 clusters were selected as the optimum number after finding out the optimum number of clusters for the dataset the clustering results are depicted in fig 5 the mentioned figure tries to visualize the partition matrix including the cluster labels reveals spatial dispersion of the clusters within the irrigation district the obtained six clusters are distinguished by the different patterns in fig 5 where a regionalization of the district is made based on the dominant features since the six dominant features i e goe esf ssw u w ca and dai belongs to different aspects of the sustainable development criteria included social esf ssw u w economic c a dai and environmental goe the interpretation of the clusters needs further investigation therefore the post processing of the clustering results was conducted based on an expert oriented assessment by comparing the spatial analysis of the clustering with the status quo of the test case the main objective was to verify the clustering results based on the facts in the test case to this end mostly the clustering integration or even in some cases the clustering separation has occurred the experience of the authors shows that in many cases the variation range of the features belongs to the farms located in a cluster in some final clusters are common so in these cases these clusters need to be integrated to facilitate further steps in the study table 5 including maximum and minimum variation and mean mode values of the dominant features within the clusters can justify any integration separation clustering action according to fig 5 following finding achieved feature goe uncommon values c 1 c 6 shared values c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 feature esf uncommon values none shared values the entire clusters 1 to 6 feature ssw uncommon values none shared values c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 and to some extent c 1 c 6 feature uw uncommon values c 1 c 6 shared values c 4 c 5 and to some extent c 2 c 3 feature ca uncommon values none shared values c 4 c 5 and c 2 c 3 note c 1 shows the highest and c 6 shows the lowest variation of the feature feature dai uncommon values none shared values almost all the clusters c 1 shows the lowest variation of the feature the finding mentioned above repeat the results of table 3 where the descending order of the dominant features in the clustering of this study are goe u w ssw c a dai esf also the variation of the features within the clusters reveals that two sets of clusters c 2 c 3 and c 4 c 5 have almost the typical values for the dominant features this means that the farms belong to each set has more or less common similarities based on the dominant features therefore the clusters c 2 c 3 are merged to a single cluster as well as clusters c 4 c 5 and the final clusters after the integration are mapped in fig 6 finally the clusters ranking was conducted based on the objective of the study that is providing fairly surface water distribution with the priority of the regions based on the social economic and environmental criteria accordingly the integrated clusters 1 to 4 has the following characteristics cluster 1 exclusive feature goe environment u w social the highest range in feature values ssw social c a economic u w social cluster 2 exclusive feature goe environment u w social cluster 3 exclusive feature goe environment u w social the highest range in feature values c a economic lowest range in feature values u w social ssw social cluster 4 exclusive feature goe environment u w social the highest range in feature values ssw social dai economic lowest range in feature values goe a limited change in the obtained values of features c a economic finally the descending order of the prioritization employed by the smart operating system is c 4 c 1 c 2 c 3 this order makes the penalty matrices on the state variables q of the mpc de controller in which the controller gets a new instruction to prioritize the regions for surface water distribution 4 3 hydraulic simulation model the results of calibration and validation of the hydraulic simulation model i d model through statistical indicators including rmse mae and crm are given in table 6 a comparison of these results with the results gained from similar studies showed that the desirability of calibration and validation processes for instance the rmse and mae are respectively within the ranges of 0 0349 0 0369 and 0 020 0 022 cubic meters per second in shahrokhnia and javan 2005 and in dejen 2015 rmse and crm indicators were reported acceptable within the ranges of 0 06 0 09 and 0 07 0 02 cubic meters per second respectively according to table 6 it can be concluded that the present study s results are closer to zero in comparison to the acceptable ranges of studies mentioned above therefore the accuracy of the developed hydrodynamic model is confirmed 4 4 surface water distribution operating system the main objective was to analyze the operational status i e surface water distribution satisfactory of the distribution system for comparing the equity of water distribution in the status quo and after implementing the developed smart system two operational scenarios which most likely occurs in all irrigation districts in the global scale are considered included i when the main canal inflow is equal to the total agricultural water demands and ii when demands for water at the off takes i e stakeholder s water demands were kept constant the inflow discharge into the system faced a 20 reduction the agricultural water distribution operating system status quo mpc de and the developed smart system was simulated separately for each of the three operation methods under the mentioned scenarios the degree of desirability of the fairly surface water distribution was computed based on the performance evaluation indicator depicted in fig 7 a f spatial distribution of adequacy of water delivery named iso adequate in fig 7 was conducted in gis to have a clear vision of the operations systems performances in fair distribution fig 7 a b shows how the objective of fairly water distribution by the existing operating system is far from the truth not only in water shortage operational scenarios but also under the normal condition these figures show that the operating system is capable of supplying more or less enough water for the upstream regions while the downstream farms can supply 70 of their water demands from the surface water in the best of circumstances significant improvement inequitable distribution of water was achieved by upgrading the existing system with the mpc de operating one as shown in fig 7 c d comparing these two figures clearly reveal that the operating system enforces thanks to the d e operational strategy to spread the shortage water within the district since lines follow the prevailing trend in both of the normal and shortage scenarios the developed smart operating system according to fig 7 e f taken the priorities obtained from the clustering results in distribution so that more than 90 of clusters c 1 and c 4 received more than 80 of their demands according to clemmens et al 1998 molden and gates 1990 the performance of an operating system is assessed well when more than 80 of the demands are fulfilled comparing the iso adequate line of 80 in fig 7 d and f reveals the effect of upgrading the automatic control systems with complementary components e g clustering model in the present study to lead the operational statue in practical manners 5 discussion different challenges appear in conducting this research included i the necessity of employing pca as the pre processing of the clustering in other words how does the performance of the proposed clustering method change with and without considering the pre processing stage ii assuring the optimum number of clusters which affects the performance of the developed controller and iii reliability of employing the developed smart operating system to fulfill the practical objectives and iv how does the smart system fulfill the sustainable development objectives in distributing the agricultural water distribution according to these controversial issues more investigation was conducted to find out proposer responses to these challenges first challenge the necessity of employing prepossessing for clustering regarding the first concern the proposed clustering method was employed under the two scenarios of with without employing the pca the clustering iteratively performed from two to the maximum number of features the results show that the d b index has not reached a specified pattern to specify the elbow point area to determine the optimum number of clusters since the pca provides a set of linear combinations of the features for the clustering accordingly we can state that the clustering method needs to be accompanied by a feature selection or feature reduction algorithm pca in this study to specify the most important features for the clustering application of the clustering without the algorithm would be helpful if the entire features are thoroughly analyzed and investigated by an expert it is worth noting that even by employing the feature selection algorithm the expert perspective is essential because the application of any data mining approach led to consistent results when the process was supervised via experts in the field of the study accordingly the proposed simple easy to use practical expert oriented method for replacing the pca is the analytic hierarchy process ahp however it is worth noting that the application of ahp and other similar weighting methods would be useful when i the objective is just prioritizing the features criteria and ii clustering is performed and led to the reasonable optimum number of clusters candidates if the latter one is not reached it needs to apply the pca method second challenge assuring the optimum number of clusters in the present study the optimum number of clusters is selected based on an iterative procedure among the extracted candidates it would be considered as a drawback for this process where the number of iterative actions can be increased and personalization prevails over being systematic accordingly the second challenge caused the authors to find out the optimum number of clusters based on the method proposed by ünlü and xanthopoulos 2019 and the optimum number of clusters was selected according to the maximum silhouette value this index is a measure of how similar an object farms in this study is to its own cluster compared to other clusters c 1 to c 6 in the present study the silhouette ranges from 1 to 1 where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters for the dataset of this study the maximum silhouette value ünlü and xanthopoulos 2019 obtained 0 63 for the six number of clusters therefore the results of the d b index show the complete match by the silhouette value measure third challenge reliability of the developed smart operating system for fairly water distribution since the objective of this study i e surface water operational management based on social economic and environmental priorities is considered as the novelty of the manuscript no similar studies with the common objective were found accordingly to provide a reasonable response to this challenge the operating system proposed by clemmens 2012 was redesigned and customized for the study area in this regard the developed lqr controller designed for this test case of this study and reported in hashemy shahdany and firoozfar 2017 was modified by including the d e variables to state variable matrix the modified lqr controller was performed under the two operational scenarios of the present study the results are summarized and given in table 7 where verifies the reliable performance of the developed smart operating system in fairly water distribution fourth challenge how does the smart system fulfill the sustainable development objectives in distributing the agricultural water distribution it is worth noting that thanks to the development of the control engineering method different controllers included decentralized and centralized configurations that can be employed for any water system to minimize water losses in the agriculture sector however the missing link would be developing pragmatic strategies capable of integrating with the controllers to provide practical orientations for fulfilling the environmental social and economic objectives redesigning the controllers proposed by clemmens 2012 guan et al 2011 hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop 2006a for the test case of this study verified the technical abilities of this robust operating systems but there is an essential need to upgrade these systems to deal with the real non technical concerns and considerations in the complex agricultural water systems accordingly the obtained results of the present study were evaluated based on environmental social and economic perspectives different environmental oriented criteria were selected where the percentage of groundwater overexploitation goe and drainage failures during a season d f was selected as the environmental features due to critical of these issues during the pre processing stage the pca analysis selected the former one as the most dominant feature for the clustering but the following criteria were not selected although the importance of the drainage problems in many farms the pca selection was verified by the operating system experts since the problem mostly originated from i poor water management in on farm scale which irrelevant to the domain of this study and ii delivering extra water to farms where this phenomena rarely occurred due to water shortage conditions happened in the recent decade investigating the goe variations within the clusters reveals that the high priority clusters i e c 1 and c 4 have the minimum range of goe and the maximum rate of groundwater overexploitation took place in the farms located in the third clusters with the range of 40 63 it means that priority of surface water distribution needs to be allocated to those regions i without tube wells and supplied by the surface water or ii where the tube wells extract water from the aquifer based on the water right license the obtained results for the first group are reasonable however the second group does not make sense at first glance therefore variation of other features was assessed it shows that the social uw ssw and economic dai ca features have a viable footprint in this result the highest value of i the unemployed seasonal workers in c 1 ii satisfaction of surface water distribution in c 4 and a lower rate in c 1 iii dependency of the farmers to the agricultural incomes in c 4 and a lower rate in c 1 caused that these two clusters get that highest priority in receiving the surface water rather than the other two clusters c 2 and c 3 in other words the common features reveal that the farmers located in the clusters c 2 and c 3 have come to the fact that the operating system does not have the necessary capabilities to ensure reliable surface water distribution the economic features of c a verify the mentioned statement where the only increase of the cultivated area occurred in farms located in c 3 with the maximum distance to the main canal moreover the lowest rate of unemployment happened for this cluster which has the minimum satisfaction of surface water delivery these results mentioned above show that the farmers of c 3 and c 4 in a lower level have reached a stable agricultural activity mostly supplied by the groundwater resource the discussion sessions and brainstorming meetings with the operator personals district managers and operational water management experts verified that the obtained result is pragmatic and efficient since convincing the farmers of c 3 and c 4 to shift their dependency from groundwater resources to a conjunctive operation of groundwater surface water resources in the meantime or during a short horizon is impossible the main advantage of following the clustering results is to supply a reliable surface water distribution in c 1 and c 4 to control the increasing trend of drilling new tube wells including legal and the illegal ones and deepening the shallow tube wells 6 conclusions a new perspective is introduced in the present study for upgrading the performance of the automated operating system where the environmental social and economic considerations determine the priorities of surface water distribution within an irrigation district to fulfill this objective a complementary component integrated with the automated operating system in order to shift the technical orientation of these systems to a practical one included the sustainable development viewpoints the component using the clustering method due to the high potential of the clustering methods for extracting useful information and patterns out of the large dataset to priorities the district s regions for receiving the limited surface water principle component analysis was integrated with the k means clustering algorithm to provide a ranking of the features and find out which features would be appropriate for starting the clustering the proposed component was employed on a data matrix consists of 1369 data samples each object represent a farm or an association of the farmers and based on the pca results and six features included environmental economic and social criteria consideration are selected as the dominant features making the data matrix for the clustering the d b index determines the optimum number of clusters shows the compactness of the created clusters and their level of separation from each other as well and then verified by the maximum silhouette value indicator post processing of the clustering results led to the integration of a couple of clusters and finally the test case of the study was grouped into 4 clusters with different priorities for receiving the surface water the priorities were served by the developed automated control system for distributing the surface water comparison of the obtained results of the developed system by status quo and common controllers developed for fairly water distribution reveals that the concept of the equity in water distribution is implemented by taking into account a wide range of considerations rather than the technical one the proposed method is simply possible to change add or remove the features based on different objectives or concerns in different study areas however the limitation of employing the proposed method is the lack of a mechanism for weighting the dominant features resulting in the pca since the primary motivation of conducting this study was upgrading capabilities of the automated operating system to handle the managers and authorities concern by dealing with the socio economic and environmental priorities the combination of pca and clustering components performs independently and any interference by the managers are not allowed except in i at the first stage when the features are selected and ii at the post processing stage when the clustering merging splitting is performed therefore the proposed complementary component in the present study can lead to undesirable results in the following conditions i when the dominant features are thoroughly recognized by the local managers or based on a group of experts opinion where it is proposed to omit the pca stage and clustering could be performed based on the specified features ii when the objectives from grouping the district based on a couple of specified features is apparent for the authorities in this condition the application of the supervised pattern recognition approaches like the classification algorithms is recommended instead of the clustering which is an unsupervised method iii when the process of data gathering interviews and brainstorm meetings confronted different obstacles included time and budget limitation and a lack of constructive cooperation from the farmer s societies in these circumstances it is highly recommended to replace the k means clustering component with the fuzzy clustering algorithms such as the fuzzy c means algorithm to include the uncertainties in the

water resources increased demands for food to nourish an ever growing population reduced water supply reliability climate change and climate uncertainty and droughts decline in critical ecosystems services competition for land use and less participatory water resources governance hence agriculture faces increased difficulties and challenges aiming at providing for worldwide sustainable food security while preserving natural and man made ecosystems and landscapes as reviewed by pereira 2017 high water use performance and productivity as well as water conservation and saving in irrigation are among the required solutions institutional interventions policies and new technologies are essential and there is an increasing focus on irrigation management performance to achieve the sustainable use of water for food production however the lack of basic information on crop water needs is one of the causes of inadequate water use and poor irrigation management abuzar et al 2013 therefore research should contribute to improving the knowledge of crop water requirements and their use in irrigation management recent advances in sensors communications and information technologies progressively allow the implementation of tools to support irrigation and water management decisions namely supported by the internet of things as recently reviewed by garcía et al 2020 and focusing on irrigation by jovanovic et al 2020 and pereira et al 2020a 2021c despite new tools to support irrigation management the knowledge of crop water requirements is paramount evapotranspiration et is commonly measured with a variety of instruments and field procedures which have well defined requirements for accuracy as discussed in other papers for the current special issue pereira et al 2021a b crop et is typically computed or modeled by using weather data and a panoply of computational procedures more often adopting the fao56 method allen et al 1998 this method uses the simple k c et o approach which considers the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o the latter represents the actual evaporative demand of the atmosphere while k c represents an integration of the effects of the main characteristics that distinguish the grass reference from the crop in terms of the energy balance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 adopting the k c et o approach is simple but requires the application of accurate measurements and computations particularly when deriving k c values for a crop using field observations allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a b or their prediction from the field observed fraction of ground cover and height allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b the method is particularly challenging for woody and incomplete cover crops as it is the case of fruit trees and vines to be considered standard crop coefficients must be obtained from accurate et field measurements as well as with et o computed with the fao pm allen et al 1998 or the asce pm asce 2005 equations from its development adopting fixed grass parameters for aerodynamic and surface resistance it resulted that crop coefficients despite computed empirically should be interpreted in terms of relating the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the considered crop with those of the grass reference crop pereira et al 1999 this is particularly challenging for vines and fruit trees due to the enormous difference of the canopy architecture and the incomplete ground cover other methods may be used to calculate et c pereira et al 2020a namely by remote sensing courault et al 2005 in many cases not making use of standard crop coefficients the definition of standard crop coefficient implies its determination under non water or other stress conditions otherwise it refers to actual evapotranspiration et c act namely under water stress conditions however research on tree and vine crops is demonstrating that the best crop management does not correspond to the full satisfaction of crop water demand but to the adoption of controlled water stress at given phases of the crop cycle ferreira et al 2012 cammalleri et al 2013a lobos et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 herein called eustress conditions paço et al 2019 accurate standard transferable and updated k c values obtained from the literature review require that related et data collection et models and related model calibrations as well as experimental set ups were exempt of biases caused by experimental flaws allen et al 2011 following the methodology adopted in studies focused on vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2021a b the selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of et measurement practices crop management and related production environment were provided they were also checked to detect possible computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling as well as in model calibration and validation in addition the possible influence of advection was considered e g wang et al 2019 since related k c k cb values are then of local value only thus not transferable nonetheless for several crops the collected information was scarce tree and vine fruit crops are heterogeneous sparse vegetated surfaces with complex canopies requiring different methodological approaches to determine and update crop coefficients when compared with homogeneous vegetation fully covering the soil like vegetables and field crops the objective of this paper addressing particularly this group of crops consists of reviewing standard updated single and basal k c values for tree and vine fruit crops obtained under near pristine eustress conditions using the available k c and k cb information for tabulating indicative standard k c and k cb values thus the current review intends to identify the main results of recent research on standard k c and k cb values to assess their range and the way they were obtained these standard values are further summarized and tabulated section 2 is focused on the basic concepts underlying the derivation of k c values including a brief discussion on k c concepts and on the k c curve as well as on the factors influencing k c values and limiting their transferability section 3 describes the methodologies used to select crop coefficient data section 4 consists of a literature review on the derivation of k c and k cb from field research including the related ancillary data whereas section 5 provides updated indicative values of standard k c and k cb for tree and vine fruit crops conclusions and recommendations are reported in section 6 2 requirements for accuracy on deriving k c from field studies 2 1 limitations and requirements for the transferability of crop coefficients crop evapotranspiration et c mm d 1 adopting the fao56 method is estimated by multiplying the grass reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 by a crop coefficient k c dimensionless 1 e t c e t o k c et o is defined as the evapotranspiration of a grass reference crop which is a hypothetical crop with height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered and well covering the ground allen et al 1998 the daily et o is computed with the pm et o equation eq 2 obtained by parameterizing the penman monteith combination equation for that grass crop allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 fixating the corresponding aerodynamic and surface resistance terms daily grass reference evapotranspiration is then obtained with the following equation 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve at mean air temperature kpa c 1 r n g is the available energy at the vegetated surface mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is mean daily air temperature c u 2 is mean daily wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height and e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd of the atmosphere kpa because the pm et o equation considers only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o thus et o incorporates most of the weather and related energy effects and then represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere since k c is the ratio between et c and et o eq 1 its variations should mainly be attributed to the specific crop characteristics and for a limited extent to the climate which enables the transfer of standard k c values between locations and climates when local and or regional advection is excluded apart from the pm et o equation other alternative processes have been tested to calculate reference evapotranspiration either with full weather data sets or limited data sets processes with full data sets are an attempt to simplify the calculation procedure which is advantageous but have the tendency to overlook the conceptual framework pereira et al 2015 for limited data sets the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and the fao pm temperature method have been widely used consolidated methodologies are discussed and described by paredes et al 2020 as well as the use of reanalysis weather data and of geostationary satellite products paredes et al 2021 however the use of alternative approaches requires the scrutiny of input data and et o results since processes are not linear for scientific research studies intending to derive time and space transferable crop coefficients the pm et equation 2 should be used the crop coefficient k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish any crop from the reference one crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance r a bulk crop soil surface resistance r s which relates to leaf area the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness and albedo of the crop soil surface influencing the net radiation that is determined by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and soil surface wetness allen et al 1998 two k c approaches are considered allen et al 1998 one consists of a time averaged single k c which includes multi day effects of evaporation from the soil in addition to plant transpiration whereas the second refers to the dual k c i e the sum of the basal crop coefficient k cb and the soil evaporation coefficient k e these coefficients represent respectively the ratios between crop transpiration t c or soil evaporation e s and et o in the latter approach therefore k c k cb k e with k cb t c et o and k e e s et o various authors have developed models or procedures for partitioning et into t c and e s however the fao56 approach has been successfully used mainly after the paper of allen et al 2005 even implemented in models such as simdualk c rosa et al 2012 whose applications to peach paço et al 2012 vineyards fandiño et al 2012 papaya chaterlán et al 2012b and olives paço et al 2014 2019 are reported herein for transferability purposes fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard k c and potential et c which refer to pristine cropping and well watered conditions and are distinct of actual field conditions often not optimal due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation crop density salinity agronomic practices and soil management the tabulated k c refer therefore and exclusively to the standard k c however for tree and vine crops as referred in section 1 k c refer to adopting crop specific eustress practices under water stress conditions et c gives place to the actual crop et et c act with k c replaced by the actual k c act or using the dual approach by k s k cb k e 3 et c act k s et c k s k c et o k s k cb k e et o where k s 0 1 0 is the stress coefficient which depends upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate adopting this concept eases a consistent estimation and transferability of measured standardized k c therefore it avoids the need to define multiple k c values for the same crop depending upon related water management because factors influencing crop management are numerous and cause values for k c act to vary widely contrary to standard k c plot level use of crop coefficient based simulations can be backed up by soil and plant water status measurements to detect water stress conditions e g leaf or stem water potential evapotranspiration relies on the amount of energy available at a surface resulting from the energy balance of that surface net radiation flux r n minus soil heat flux g minus sensible heat flux h will result in the term of latent heat flux λ e or the energy available to the evaporation process thus there are physical limits imposed for such process since available energy is dependent on this energy balance process upper limits to crop coefficient values are observed 1 2 in sub humid regions and 1 2 1 4 in arid regions both relative to grass reference higher values might result from errors in et measurement weather data for et o calculation or data processing procedure allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a awareness of such upper limits of k c is important since their transfer to different conditions in time and space are only possible when recurring to indicative standard values of k c that are bounded by such limits furthermore the conditions where measurements were acquired or those from where k c s are meant to be applied must be considered for application in small and isolated areas of vegetation k c can exceed the limits for grass reference 1 2 1 4 while for large areas or small areas surrounded by vegetation with similar roughness and soil water status k c s must stick to values equal or smaller than those limits allen et al 2011 the concepts of standard k c and potential crop et and related terminology are progressively being accepted by the users communities pereira et al 2015 however the standard k c and k cb values for tree and vine crops vary with the fraction of ground cover and height allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 due to crop age and crop management particularly crop training pereira et al 2021b c however these values can be considered standard if they are obtained under optimal pristine cropping conditions pereira et al 2021b c according to these authors another aspect to consider is that orchard and vine crops do not achieve full canopy cover resulting in an upper limit of k c close to 1 2 unless in the presence of advection the present review has shown that satisfactorily accurate reported k c and k cb values for the same crop show significant dissimilarity among locations due to differences in cultivar soil properties irrigation method and strategy soil crop management practices and orchard management and training minacapilli et al 2009 cammalleri et al 2013a marsal et al 2014a pereira et al 2020b thus while it is difficult and challenging to develop standard k c and k cb and while site specific k c and or k cb values are needed when it is required for research objectives to produce more robust and accurate crop coefficients it is possible to orient the development of standard k c and k cb on the basis of crop density as estimated by the fraction of ground cover or the fraction of ground shaded or the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation a most common value of the fraction of ground cover can be attributed to each crop relative to the growing stage initial mid or end season pereira et al 2021b c likewise for the same crop it is possible to link different values of ground cover to the respective k c or k cb for most crops it is possible to derive crop coefficients from f c and h as demonstrated in pereira et al 2020b although for orchards larger errors are expected due to varied training practices and differences of crop varieties therefore bearing in mind specificities of woody crops and departing from the most common value for f c of a given crop it is possible to infer correspondent standard k c or k cb research reporting field derived crop coefficients and showing diverse objectives used quite different methodologies with variable accuracy often with the aim to obtain k c values only for local use and therefore not transferable results are frequently published without sufficient information relative to the methods and instruments used or about the crop itself the cropping practices or training when the published material had serious limitations to transferability it was not used in this review main limitations are referred to 1 not adopting the standard pm et o equation as defined in fao56 because k c is defined as the ratio et c et o if the et o equation changes the k c also changes as a function of the ratio between the selected et o equation and pm et o the transferability of the research results is then not possible unless that ratio is well known 2 using a k c curve such as a function of time or a function of lai thus different from the standard segmented fao k c curve which defines k c and k cb values for the initial mid season and end season respectively k c ini k c mid and k c end then only approximate estimations of k c mid and k c end can be made from the reported graphical data or often more difficult from tabulated information 3 using non standard cultivation conditions namely aimed at controlling soil evaporation e s using mulch which produces specific k c values reported changes in k c are very often insufficient to properly recognize standard k c values 4 adopting deficit irrigation practices that deviate from eustress conditions then k c results refer to local k c act and cannot be directly transferred 2 2 field data measurement and accuracy requirements as evapotranspiration is dependent on the available energy at a crop surface limits apply to the process yielding crop coefficient values for grass reference for tree crops more likely to be below 1 2 as reported above section 2 1 higher values might result from errors in et measurement data processing and or the effects of advection pereira et al 2021a b hence field data acquisition processes must respect well defined requirements field data sets used to derive k c or k cb are usually obtained using techniques based on soil water balance the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the eddy covariance method ec scintillometry sap flow methods remote sensing energy balance or vegetation indices derived from satellite information the requirements for data quality acquired by these methods are extensively described in allen et al 2011 and reviewed by pereira et al 2021a b and herein summarized techniques that recur to soil water balance methods calculate et as the remaining term when water stored in the soil is added to rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and subtracted of drainage or deep percolation and surface runoff the main sources of error in this calculation normally arise from the quantification of drainage deep percolation and or capillary rise other difficulties may arise from the different patterns of soil water extraction by the roots namely for heterogeneous stands as sampling processes may not represent adequately the stand these techniques must take into account i a comprehensive characterization of soil hydraulic properties ii representativeness of data in spatial and temporal terms iii appropriate sensor calibration iv differential spatial wetting by irrigation v deep percolation and capillary rise vi root water extraction patterns relevant in the case of trees and vii inappropriate sampling or readings the breb method relies on the surface energy balance equation and requires measurements of air temperature and vapor pressure gradients at a certain level above the evaporating surface having the advantages of being able to be used in water stressed stands as long as some conditions are respected of almost eliminating turbulent transfer coefficients and of not requiring wind speed and surface measurements nevertheless it requires some caution in its application since the accuracy of the method relies strongly on r n and g measurements and on an adequate fetch for the establishment of the equilibrium boundary layer also the adoption of breb in tree stands implies that gradients measurement are performed at a height above the canopies sufficient to avoid individual tree effects main requirements for breb data quality must then include i large enough fetch to allow for the establishment of a suitable equilibrium boundary layer ii adequate positioning of sensors above the canopy avoiding the roughness sublayer iii representative measurement of r n and g iv multiple r n and g measurement points for heterogeneous or sparse crops the ec method presents a relatively simple theoretical framework although its implementation requires complex and expensive sensors capable of high frequency measurement and extended data processing and treatment it entails the knowledge of vertical wind speed and fluctuations around the mean of air temperature and humidity in vertical fluxes of sensible and latent heat sampling statistically turbulent eddies the main advantage of the ec method is to provide a direct measurement of et in actual conditions either potential or not recurring to the ec method implies respecting the following data quality requirements i large enough fetch and adequate elevation of sensors as with breb ii application of the required corrections including coordinate rotation if the sensor measuring vertical wind speed is not set parallel to surface iii recognition of advection situations and taking of corrective actions iv correct data for lack of closure of energy balance equation when needed scintillometry is another method that although not able to measure et directly allows its estimation as a residual term by measuring sensible heat flux the sensor scintillometer detects small oscillations in air density caused by temperature humidity and pressure in the form of slight fluctuations in the refractive index of air it has the advantage of integrating large areas information along a certain direction but still relies on r n and g measurements for calculating et requiring accurate representative measurements of r n and g allen et al 2011 the transpiration component in et can be obtained independently by sap flow methods these methods use heat as a tracer to measure the flow of water in the xylem of plants they are more frequently oriented to applications in woody plants although there are also solutions applicable to herbaceous plants although most methods require calibration to produce accurate quantitative results these methods generally follow well the transpiration dynamics several factors can influence the data quality of sap flow measurements and must be observed i a calibration is required for each new application ii being a plant based process implies scaling from plant to stand level dealing with measurement representativeness iii an accurate estimate of conductive xylem area is needed allen et al 2011 remote sensing data can be used to calculate et but these processes produce estimates and not measurements as with remote sensing energy balance data and should be considered accordingly pôças et al 2020 pereira et al 2021a b they are however becoming largely used for k c and et calculation satellite based energy balance methods have the disadvantage of being time consuming and requiring specialized skills but they can be a way of calibrating less complex methods which recur to vegetation indices vegetation indices derived from satellite information require ground data for validation and they are related to crop coefficients in et actual conditions therefore often not standard pereira et al 2021a b inaccuracies in measuring crop et and in computing et o often results in high k c values commonly indicating that the corresponding energy use would largely exceed the energy available at the surface for evaporation allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a b although values of k c above 1 3 may be observed for a few occasional days following a rainfall event or over quite short periods such high values cannot be accepted as averages for large periods such as a month or the entire mid season problems for transferability also result from conditions where k c experiments are developed managed and data are handled e g small size experimental plots inadequate setting and management of lysimeters the reduced fetch of breb and ec systems and poor estimation of soil water fluxes and inadequate calibration of soil water balance swb models when using remote sensing adopting non calibrated vegetation indices or energy balance models are causes for inaccuracies these subjects were reviewed by allen et al 2011 evett et al 2012a b and pereira et al 2021a b when the accuracy of crop et measurements cannot be accepted then it is not possible to use transfer the reported k c values this is summarized as follows 1 inaccuracies in performing the soil water balance e g evett et al 2012c such as insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties non consideration of the full root zone depth inadequate spacing and or frequency of measurements inaccuracies in measuring the soil water content and or the irrigation water and rainfall poor estimation of deep percolation and or capillary rise rough computational approaches and or using an inadequately calibrated and validated model 2 using lysimeters with poor setting and management allen et al 1991a b grebet and cuenca 1991 lópez urrea et al 2006 evett et al 2016 namely having differences in cropping conditions inside and outside of the lysimeter that relates to vigor and growth of vegetation the poor setting of the lysimeter without similar surrounding vegetation causing local advection or clothesline effects insufficient fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer of air lack of consideration of the area effectively used by the crop for et 3 measuring et with the breb method or the ec systems with insufficient fetch less representative measurement of net radiation insufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy lack of adjustments for the effects of advection and or poor correction of data for the energy balance closure error payero et al 2003 allen et al 2011 alfieri et al 2012 evett et al 2012b kutikoff et al 2019 4 the use of remote sensing vegetation indices vis to estimate crop coefficients is now well established mainly with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi hunsaker et al 2005a b pôças et al 2020 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi glenn et al 2011 however inaccuracies in deriving k c or k cb from a vi result from improper calibration of the index and from insufficient identification of the pixels that correspond to the crop growing under an approximately pristine condition hunsaker et al 2005a b and 2007 remote sensing energy balance is less used to derive k c values and similar difficulties to those using vi approaches also occur however good results on k c values estimated with energy balance have been reported paço et al 2014 pôças et al 2014 the fao56 method allen et al 1998 proposes that when local climate conditions deviate from the standard reference wind velocity 2 m s 1 and minimum relative humidity 45 the k c and k cb values for mid and end seasons are adjusted to the reference climate however the equations proposed in fao56 were developed for field and vegetable crops which are full or near full cover crops and were not intended for tree and vine crops because these are incomplete cover crops and have large to very large heights thus having a different aerodynamic behavior from that of the former pereira personal communication thus adjustments for climate were not applied in the current study 2 3 crop coefficients derived from field measurements in the presence of advection if the et term of the surface energy balance equation results in a value higher than r n g the surface is receiving sensible heat downwards instead of just losing it by convection to the atmosphere therefore a larger amount of energy will be available for the process of evapotranspiration however there is an upper boundary to et imposed by limitations in aerodynamic transfer and equilibrium forces over a vegetated surface allen et al 2011 then similarly as referred in section 2 1 limits apply and k c must be less than or equal to 1 2 grass reference allen et al 2011 except in the presence of advection in the past two decades numerous studies have been published in this research area without considering advection impacts pereira et al 2021b and care must be taken when there is insufficient information relative to the methods employed or measurement conditions advection conditions can though limit transferability of crop coefficients either because they were determined under advection conditions or they are to be applied in such conditions advection conditions can result from the small dimension of the stand under analysis not providing adequate conditions for the development of a boundary layer in equilibrium with the surface or by favoring a clothesline effect where vegetation in the stand is somehow more exposed to atmosphere drive than the surrounding vegetation allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a advection can also result from measurement errors in the field for example when lysimeters are not correctly set causing local and micro scale advection or a clothesline effect pereira et al 2021a or when in ec systems fetch conditions are not observed or data quality selection criteria against wind direction fetch not applied under advection h decreases to very small values given the downward advective h flux and λ e becomes larger than the term r n g therefore it is expected that under advection conditions and over small stands of vegetation et would reach a much larger value allen et al 2011 which is not the case for large stands where limits apply for k c 1 2 grass reference allen et al 2011 advection effects on et of woody crops are rarely reported in literature however since trees and vines do not attain full crop development due to pruning and training in the absence of advection k c values should not surpass 1 2 pereira et al 2021a b however under advective conditions much larger transpiration and larger evaporation values are observed kool et al 2018 wang et al 2019 nevertheless too much large k c values were also reported without signaling the occurrence of advection 3 information on selection methodologies 3 1 methods adopted to select the papers insufficiencies and inaccuracies referred in the previous section limit the transferability of reported k c values thus to update the tabulated k c it was necessary to operate a careful literature selection in fact reported k c curves often do not follow the fao segmented curves or k c results are presented as time dependent polynomial equations or are just referred to weekly 10 day or often monthly values crop growth stages are sometimes defined differently than in fao56 these limitations impede to adequately identify the k c k cb values for the mid and the end season information provided in some papers despite sufficient to achieve the objectives of the research could be inadequate for the transferability of the reported k c to environments different from that where the investigation was carried out these limitations obliged a careful review of published material to check when the proposed k c or k cb were limited to local interest and or represented non standard experimental conditions thus contrasting to k c resulting from near pristine or eustress cropping practices the studies were therefore selected when adopted the pm et o equation allen et al 1998 or the asce et o equation asce 2005 therefore studies reporting reference et values obtained with grass lysimeters empirical equations pan evaporation or similar were excluded presented data referred to two or more seasons only exceptionally studies were considered with one year of data but with different treatments so that it was possible to understand if the results were or not occasional as for a few studies presenting one year data for tropical fruit trees which represented the only available data source adopted the fao k c curve or a k c time curve that allowed to identify k c or k cb for the mid season and sometimes for the end season when that identification was not possible or when the k c curve was provided as a function of lai or similar the studies were excluded relative to the field methods using breb or ec systems the papers reporting upon the upwind fetch conditions and the energy balance closure were considered otherwise they were excluded studies using swb methods describing the terms of the balance and or providing for the accuracy associated with the model calibration and validation were selected otherwise papers not properly reporting deep percolation or referring to swb interesting only for the upper soil layers were not considered studies using lysimeters were accepted when there were adequate setting and management of the lysimeters namely avoiding oasis and cloth line effects and the evaporative surface was corrected if the tree vine canopy exceeded the lysimeter surface studies using remote sensing were considered when a calibration validation was performed studies reporting k c values greater than 1 25 were excluded since such high values are frequently induced by advection situations or sensor malfunctioning also studies reporting k cb end k cb mid and k cb k c were excluded finally papers where crops were evidently stressed were excluded such when k c values were low relative to studies referring to the same or a similar crop or heavy deficit irrigation was practiced as a consequence of the criteria assumed it was possible to select some papers that were used as reference to other studies or at least to approach reasonable quality conditions 3 2 methods adopted to select updated ranges of k c k cb values standard values were established considering i ranges of new k c k cb values collected in literature from the past twenty years ii prior information on tabulated k c k cb values from allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 iii crop density based upon ground cover fraction which varies with the crop and with training thus the term crop density is not exclusively related to plant spacing but in a broader sense encompasses plant density sparsity dimensions including height and at last the fraction of ground cover and plant spacing but not exclusively 4 review on single and dual k c for tree and vine crops information relative to crop coefficient k c mid and k c end and basal crop coefficient k cb mid and k cb end and related ancillary data collected from the selected studies were tabulated after grouping the crops into 1 vine fruit crops berries and hops 2 temperate climate evergreen fruit trees 3 temperate climate deciduous trees and 4 tropical and sub tropical fruit crops values for the initial period k c ini often characterized by a short duration and dependent mainly from the rainfall regime were not considered users are advised to follow the recommendations in fao56 and guiding values provided by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the collected data included in this review consider information regarding the age of the orchard the planting density number of trees vines or shrubs per hectare and various crop biophysical characteristics such as the training system crop height h and ground cover fraction f c alternatively to f c some studies adopted other indices that may serve as indicators of the ground surface covered by the canopies such as the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation f ipar intrigliolo et al 2009 girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 and the shaded fraction of soil f shad stevens et al 2012 the crop coefficient presented in the tables from 1 to 4 correspond to the average of the different experimental years however whenever it was possible to relate k c or k cb with f c results are presented for every single experimental year 4 1 vine fruit crops berries and hops a total of nineteen studies suitable to update the fao56 crop coefficients were retained for vineyards one for kiwi actinidia deliciosa a chev two for passion fruit passiflora edulis sims three for highbush blueberries vaccinium corymbosum l and one for hop humulus lupulus l table 1 presents the list of these selected studies and reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as related ancillary data vineyards were divided into table and wine grapes with nine and ten suitable studies respectively for each group table 1 the works referring to vineyards used different approaches to measure et c act from field observations two studies used weighing lysimeter williams et al 2003 lópez urrea et al 2012 while only one used a drainage lysimeter netzer et al 2009 four works applied ec systems to measure actual et c act villagra et al 2011 carrasco benavides et al 2012 er raki et al 2013 marras et al 2016 villagra et al 2014 combined the use of ec with the swb the ec technique was associated with sap flow measurements for the determination of crop transpiration in the studies by poblete echeverría et al 2012 and poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 ferreira et al 2012 measured et with ec and its components plant transpiration and soil evaporation using respectively the sap flow technique and micro lysimeters other studies moratiel and martínez cob 2012 used the surface renewal sr and the breb to estimate crop et teixeira et al 2007 parry et al 2019 combined the use of sr with weighing lysimeter measurements to estimate vineyards et fandiño et al 2012 and cancela et al 2015 used the swb for estimating vineyards et phogat et al 2020 adjusted the standard k cb values from fao56 taking into account local meteorological variables and crop biophysical characteristics one work used sap flow measurements exclusively suvočarev et al 2013 and another sap flow in combination with a whole canopy gas exchange system to measure the transpiration and to derive the k cb of table and wine grape intrigliolo et al 2009 the most common irrigation method in both table and wine grapes is surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation however one study used micro sprinkler irrigation in addition to drip irrigation teixeira et al 2007 rainfed is also common in wine grapes ferreira et al 2012 other studies used both drip irrigation and rainfed conditions fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 the studies on vineyards were conducted in different countries i e australia chile usa spain italy brazil méxico portugal and israel which include the primary producing vine areas and new emerging producing regions generally the k c and k cb values resulted higher in table grapes compared to wine grapes which are related to the different training system employed the k c and k cb values reported for table and wine grapes are generally related to f c at the same time the different k c and k cb values reported by various studies are coherent with the varieties age training and irrigation systems soil cover and crop management teixeira et al 2007 determined the k c values for micro sprinkler irrigated table and drip irrigated wine grapes in the semiarid region of the são francisco river basin brazil the study reported higher crop coefficients for table than wine grapes which may relate with both the irrigation method and training phogat et al 2020 reported similar k cb values for three different locations in south australia moratiel and martínez cob 2012 measured the evapotranspiration of a table grape located in zaragoza spain which grew under netting with black plastic mulch therefore crop coefficients were adjusted to take into account the reduction of et c caused by the netting and the black plastic mulching in the same experimental location suvočarev et al 2013 adjusted the k cb for the netting effects using a reduction coefficient similar to the one used by moratiel and martínez cob 2012 two articles presented the fao56 basal crop coefficient curve and the crop growth stages data fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 both studies performed in galicia spain calibrated and validated the soil water balance model simdualk c rosa et al 2012 and obtained both the single and the basal crop coefficients for vineyards with active ground cover in the inter row spacing silva et al 2008 studied the water requirements of kiwi in a mature orchard located in guimarães portugal irrigated with micro sprinklers in the study crop evapotranspiration was measured with the ec method the crop transpiration using sap flow sensors and the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration with micro lysimeters the selected studies on passionfruit were set in brazil in young drip irrigated orchards in both studies the swb was used to determine et c souza et al 2009 nogueira et al 2014 dourte et al 2010 studied the water requirements of southern mature highbush blueberries interspecific hybrids of vaccinium corymbosium l v virgatum aiton and v darrowi camp in florida usa based on the swb approach combining data from drainage lysimeter and soil moisture measurements overhead impact sprinklers were used for irrigation bryla 2011 estimated the k c of highbush blueberries v corymbosum using et c data provided by the pacific northwest cooperative agricultural weather network agrimet and weather based estimates of et o from the cimis california irrigation management information system website lobos et al 2016 validated the k c values reported in fao56 using midday stem water potential measurements the studies were developed in drip irrigated orchards from two experimental areas in maule region chile and michigan usa the difference observed among the k c values reported in these studies could be due to the different approaches employed to carry out the experiments as well as with the diverse irrigation and crop management conditions regarding hops humulus lupulus l only one study was available fandiño et al 2015 which was performed in galicia spain using the soil water balance approach to calibrate and validate the simdualk c model and thus to estimate crop et under diverse irrigation management conditions rainfed and drip irrigation 4 2 temperate climate evergreen fruit trees this group of orchards includes citrus citrus spp and olives olea europaea l a total of eleven articles were selected for citrus and six articles were retained for olives with diverse tree densities table 2 presents the list of these selected studies and reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as the related ancillary data the articles selected for citrus included studies on clementine citrus clementina castel 2000 rana et al 2005 lime citrus aurantiifolia marin and angelocci 2011 mandarine citrus reticulate blanco maestre valero et al 2017 and orange citrus sinensis l osbeck snyder and o connell 2007 er raki et al 2009 villalobos et al 2013 consoli and vanella 2014 rallo et al 2017 taylor et al 2017a peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 in general the k c and k cb values reported in the studies were comparable and related to the ancillary data table 2 different methodologies were used to estimate et for the citrus spp group the ec technique was used by consoli and vanella 2014 and maestre valero et al 2017 and it was associated with soil water balance fao56 by rana et al 2005 and er raki et al 2009 castel 2000 used the swb approach combining data from drainage and weighing lysimeters moreover sap flow sf measurements were used by marin and angelocci 2011 villalobos et al 2013 and taylor et al 2017a to provide accurate evaluations of tree transpiration snyder and o connell 2007 applied the surface renewal method to measure et c act the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach was applied through soil water balance models in two studies rallo et al 2017 who derived k cb values for orange using the soil water balance fdr soil water content measurements and ecophysiological indicators peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 used the simdualk c water balance model which was calibrated and validated with soil water content data determined with electrical resistivity tomography ert drip irrigation was the most common method however two works were carried out under surface irrigation er raki et al 2009 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and thus presented higher k c values most of the experimental studies were carried out in mediterranean countries e g italy spain morocco which are among the most important production regions for citrus while three studies were performed outside this region one in brazil marin and angelocci 2011 one in india peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and the other in south africa taylor et al 2017a rana et al 2005 reported the highest k c mid for citrus which might be due to a high stomatal conductance or to the favorable observed climatic conditions high wind speed and vapor pressure deficit er raki et al 2009 and peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 reported k c end values higher than the k c mid values which may be associated with the rainfall conditions during late autumn and winter typical to the climate of the investigated areas the highest k cb mid value was reported in the study with the highest f c taylor et al 2017a but the same study presented the lowest k cb end which relates with the stomatal control performed by the citrus trees under high climatic demand conditions in the last decades the research activity on olive water requirement has been concentrated on irrigation management strategies as well as on the crop response to water saving in terms of agronomic and or eco physiological features the ec technique was applied in two studies testi et al 2004 martínez cob and faci 2010 and was associated with sf measurements in cammalleri et al 2013b and lópez olivari et al 2016 puppo et al 2019 used drainage lysimeters combined with soil water content measurements for estimating et c act the soil water balance model simdualk c was calibrated and validated using sap flow based sensors in the study by paço et al 2019 which was the only study considering the direct calculation of the crop coefficient and derived the k c curve following the fao56 approach the irrigation method used in all the olive studies was drip irrigation the majority of the studies were carried out in the mediterranean basin which is the leading producing region for olives two of the selected studies were performed in south america countries one in southern uruguay characterized by a sub humid climate puppo et al 2019 while the other was performed in a location in chile characterized by a mediterranean climate lópez olivari et al 2016 the k c and k cb values observed in the different studies are coherent with the range of densities of the olive orchard from traditional to super intensive and the f c values thus the smallest k c mid was observed by testi et al 2004 which may be due to the young age of the trees low f c and the traditional olive orchard features located in córdoba spain the highest k c mid values were those of paço et al 2019 which corresponded to a super intensive orchard located in south portugal with the highest f c value and managed with a high irrigation frequency to note that the k c end was higher than k c mid in the studies by martínez cob and faci 2010 and paço et al 2019 which relates with the high autumn precipitation events typical of the mediterranean countries that coincide with the olive end season the highest k cb mid among the examined studies was the one indicated in a traditional olive orchard by cammalleri et al 2013b although the value resulted similar to that suggested by allen et al 1998 this high k cb mid value may be due to the combined effect of the age of the orchard twenty five years old with large size trees and highly developed canopy 4 3 temperate climate deciduous fruit trees table 3 presents the list of the studies on deciduous fruit trees that were selected and the reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as the related ancillary data only two studies were available for apricot prunus armeniaca l which used different methods for measuring et and t one adopted swb kaya et al 2013 and the other a sf technique villalobos et al 2013 the study by kaya et al 2013 was conducted in turkey and presented the k c values for the three development stages of drip irrigated apricot orchards these values are coherent with the f c and density of mature apricot orchards the study by villalobos et al 2013 took place in the region of murcia spain and presented the value of k cb for the mid season one work was selected for cherries prunus avium l table 3 performed in a micro sprinkler irrigated young orchard in hungary which used sap flow measurements to estimate cherry k cb juhász et al 2013 regarding peach trees prunus persica l batsch five studies were retained with the experiments conducted in a variety of climates and regions table 3 ayars et al 2003 and marsal et al 2014a implemented their experiments in california usa while du sautoy et al 2013 in pretoria south africa villalobos et al 2013 in cordoba spain and paço et al 2012 in southern portugal several approaches were used to estimate et c act with the studies by ayars et al 2003 du sautoy et al 2013 and marsal et al 2014a used weighing lysimeters and paço et al 2012 used ec villalobos et al 2013 used sap flow to measure crop t in the study by paço et al 2012 the et components crop t and e s were also measured using sf and micro lysimeters respectively ayars et al 2003 reported the highest k c values in a dense orchard f c 0 70 irrigated with micro sprinklers marsal et al 2014a presented the highest k cb mid values in a mature orchard with tall trees and high f c whereas the lowest k cb values were indicated by paço et al 2012 due to the smallest f c and the young age of trees only one work was available for plum prunus domestica l table 3 which used swb samperio et al 2014 the study was conducted in badajoz spain in drip irrigated orchards and considered two different plum varieties namely an early maturing cv red beaut and a late maturing cv angeleno the reported k c values are consistent with the crop varieties and their biophysical characteristics for the apple crop malus domestica l eight studies were retained which generally derived the single crop coefficient k c exceptions were the studies by marsal et al 2014a and gush et al 2019 that reported the basal crop coefficient k cb weighing lysimeters were used by girona et al 2011 and marsal et al 2013 2014a gong et al 2007 combined the use of swb and sf for estimating k c and k cb values respectively volschenk 2017 used the swb approach to derive k c for the three crop development stages the studies by gush et al 2019 and zanotelli et al 2019 used the ec method for measuring et the latter study also measured trees transpiration with sap flow sensors dragoni et al 2005 measured tree transpiration with sap flow measurements the most common irrigation system in the apple orchards was drip irrigation whereas micro sprinkler irrigation was used in two studies volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 and one used overhead sprinkler irrigation zanotelli et al 2019 the examined studies were carried out in different climates and regions four of them were implemented in the mediterranean countries while the others in south africa volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 usa dragoni et al 2005 and china gong et al 2007 the research by girona et al 2011 and marsal et al 2013 2014a were based on the same experimental field in lleida spain but used different methods to determine the fraction cover the k c values indicated in these studies correspond to different experimental years and thus to different f c the studies included for apple crop reported a wide variability of k c mid which could be due to the diverse training systems resulting in diverse f c and tree height two works were selected for the pear pyrus l tree girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2014b both studies were developed in spain and used weighing lysimeters to determine et c act the study by girona et al 2011 indicated the relationship between f c values and the correspondent k c mid there is a need to update nut trees crop coefficients especially considering the modern cultivars and production systems there is a lack of studies for hazelnut corylus avellana l pecan carya illinoinensis l pistachio pistacia vera l and walnuts juglans regia l while more studies were conducted for almonds prunus dulcis mill d a webb five experimental studies stevens et al 2012 espadafor et al 2015 garcía tejero et al 2015 bellvert et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2018 on k c and k cb have been included for almond field weighing lysimeter containing one almond tree instrumented with sap flow sensors was the methodology used by lópez lópez et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2015 used drainage lysimeters combined with soil moisture probes micrometeorology technique ec and swb modeling were associated to assess the crop coefficients in two studies stevens et al 2012 bellvert et al 2018 the modeling approach assumed that the fraction of crop intercepted radiation f ipar is the major determinant of k cb espadafor et al 2015 used the sap flow method to measure crop transpiration the studies were done under drip irrigation with the exception of the study presented by stevens et al 2012 in which the orchard was irrigated with micro sprinklers the study by bellvert et al 2018 was performed in a mature orchard located in madera ca usa reporting the highest k cb mid and k c mid values which relates with the orchard presenting the highest ground cover f ipar 0 85 a slightly smaller k c mid value was reported by garcía tejero et al 2015 in a non mature orchard located in sevilla spain similar k c mid values were reported by stevens et al 2012 in a mature and high yielding almond orchard located in loxton australia but these authors reported an effect of advection due to the surrounding area characterized by different physical properties from those of the studied orchard which may have increased the k c value the experimental k cb indicated by espadafor et al 2015 was the lowest for almond orchards which was related to the young age of the orchard and the lowest f c two studies were retained for hazelnut trees mačkić et al 2016 ortega farias et al 2020 the study by mačkić et al 2016 was conducted in a micro sprinkler hazelnut orchard in the pannonia plain serbia and used the swb to measure et ortega farias et al 2020 used ec to determine the k c of a drip irrigated hazelnut orchard from the maule region chile higher k c values were reported by mačkić et al 2016 probably due to the higher planting density and the irrigation method employed three works studied the et of pecans carya illinoinensis l using micrometeorological techniques simmons et al 2007 samani et al 2011 taylor et al 2017b the studies of simmons et al 2007 and samani et al 2011 were carried out in new méxico usa both under flood irrigation the study by taylor et al 2017b was performed in an orchard located in cullinan south africa which was irrigated with micro sprinklers the work by samani et al 2011 allowed to assess a strong relation between k c and f c the studies performed in pistachio pistacia vera l orchards measured et using swb associated with plant based measurements memmi et al 2016 and micrometeorological measurements bellvert et al 2018 the study by bellvert et al 2018 used in addition a modeling approach with vegetation indices ndvi to determine k cb the orchards were drip irrigated bellvert et al 2018 memmi et al 2016 the study of bellvert et al 2018 was based in california usa while the other was developed in ciudad real spain memmi et al 2016 k c mid values in the two examined studies presented comparable ranges in relation to the orchard age and density regarding walnuts the studies by villalobos et al 2013 brickner 2016 and fulton et al 2017 are proposed for updating the crop coefficients the study by villalobos et al 2013 recurs to a sap flow technique compensation heat pulse to measure tree transpiration along the mid season thus allowing to estimate the k cb mid value in the study by fulton et al 2017 multiple years of data were collected that allowed to capture the temporal dynamic of k c and have encompassed a wide range of soils cultivation practices and stages of canopy development ec and sr techniques were used to study a temporal series from 2011 to 2016 of et from two mature and one young walnut orchards orchards were irrigated with micro sprinklers and set in sacramento valley ca usa the mature orchards presented similar k c mid values in both studies the water requirements of fig trees ficus carica l were studied in brazil by andrade et al 2014 and souza et al 2014 using the swb approach in drip irrigated orchards the experiment presented by andrade et al 2014 consisted of two irrigation treatments with different watering frequencies scheduled to avoid water stress the k c mid resulted higher for the high irrigation frequency kanety et al 2014 reported the only work available for persimmon diospyros kaki l the study was performed in drip irrigated orchards located in israel the study employed sap flow measurements to measure crop transpiration and thus to estimate k cb the k c value was derived from modeled k e three works focused on the evaluation of pomegranate punica granatum l water requirements intrigliolo et al 2011 ayars et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the study by intrigliolo et al 2011 used a combined methodology of leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange to estimate crop et while the other two studies used weighing lysimeters to determine crop et the studies were performed in drip irrigated orchards located in alicante spain intrigliolo et al 2011 and in california usa ayars et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the article by zhang et al 2017 refers to a three years study in two orchards the studies on pomegranate reported k c values that were strongly related with f c 4 4 tropical and subtropical fruit crops a small number of papers reporting k c k cb values for tropical fruit trees were found in the literature see table 4 two studies were considered on avocado persea americana mill the first developed in florida kiggundu et al 2012 and the second in south africa mazhawu et al 2018 two different approaches were used to measure crop et one study used the swb kiggundu et al 2012 while the other used ec mazhawu et al 2018 in both studies the orchards were irrigated with micro sprinkler system k c mid values are very distinct which may relate with the age of the orchard plant density and tree height all the studies on banana musa were carried out in brazil the methodology used to determine et c was the soil water balance for all studies which was associated with drainage lysimeters in the study by conceição et al 2018 drip irrigation was used in three studies figueiredo et al 2006 montenegro et al 2008 conceição et al 2018 and micro sprinkler irrigation in two bassoi et al 2004 montenegro et al 2008 all the studies reported very similar k c mid values only a study was available for cactus pear opuntia ficus indica l mill consoli et al 2013 which was performed in an orchard in sicily italy crop et c act was measured using the sr method rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 and durán zuazo et al 2019b studied cherimoya annona cherimola mill water requirements in the same experimental farm granada spain and with the same methodology both studies used the swb approach combining drainage lysimeters with soil moisture measurements the trees were mature planted in terraces and irrigated with a drip system the estimated k c confirmed that for cherimoya trees the values are well replicated under similar field conditions and biophysical characteristics the two studies on coconut cocus nucifera l were carried out in brazil using swb miranda et al 2007 and weighing lysimeters sousa et al 2011 both studies reported the same k c values even if referred to different irrigation method micro sprinkler and drip irrigation respectively in miranda et al 2007 and sousa et al 2011 the studies on coffee coffea spp were carried out in brazil the breb and sf methods were used by marin et al 2005 to calculate et c while the remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal was employed by costa et al 2019 drip marin et al 2005 and central pivot irrigation costa et al 2019 were used differences in the reported k c values were coherent with the crop age planting density and irrigation system used only k cb mid values were reported in marin et al 2005 which evidenced two behaviors depending on et o rates with lower k cb values associated with high et o rates 4 mm d 1 while higher k cb values were obtained when et o is low 2 mm d 1 these results may be attributed to differences in the stomatal adjustment of the coffee plant the studies on date palm phoenix dactylifera l were conducted in israel sperling et al 2014 and california usa montazar et al 2020 sperling et al 2014 used weighing lysimeters to calculate the k c of drip irrigated date palms with water of different salinity levels however only the k c value corresponding to the treatment without salinity stress was selected montazar et al 2020 used a combination of sr and ec techniques to measure et c in commercial mature date palms the orchard was irrigated by drip system and occasionally with surface irrigation there are two studies teixeira et al 2003 singh et al 2007a focused on measuring et c act and deriving k c values for guava psidium guajava l the study of teixeira et al 2003 was carried out in petrolina brazil in a micro sprinkler irrigated guava orchard where crop et was measured using the breb method singh et al 2007a conducted their study in west bengal india in guava orchards under drip irrigation and plastic mulch conditions the k c values were based on unpublished reports and local studies conducted in india singh et al 2007a reported lower k c than teixeira et al 2003 which may be due to the reduction of soil evaporation derived from the plastic mulch two studies determined the jujube ziziphus jujuba mill water requirements hu et al 2012 determined the k c of jujube using swb in a drip irrigated orchard located in the loess plateau of china sun et al 2012 study was performed in north china plain in a furrow irrigated jujube mature orchard where crop et was obtained from the sum of the sf and micro lysimeters measurements the different k c values between studies are coherent with the crop age and planting density the studies performed for mango mangifera indica l used diverse methods to estimate crop et teixeira et al 2008 used breb azevedo et al 2003 and levin et al 2018 used swb while rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 and durán zuazo et al 2019a used drainage lysimeters localized irrigation methods were used in all studies two studies were developed in petrolina brazil azevedo et al 2003 teixeira et al 2008 two in granada spain rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 durán zuazo et al 2019a and one in israel levin et al 2018 the highest k c mid value of the set of studies was reported by teixeira et al 2008 in a low density orchard with the tallest more vigorous trees the studies on papaya carica papaya l et reported in the literature were performed along one season in la habana cuba and used the swb approach in an orchard irrigated with drip irrigation chaterlán et al 2012a b the same experimental data were used in both studies to calibrate and validate swb models allowing to derive the papaya crop coefficients one model adopts the single crop coefficient approach winisareg and the other uses the dual crop coefficient approach simdualk c thus allowing to determine both k c and k cb values 5 indicative standard k c and k cb values ranges of values for experimental data of standard crop coefficients k c and k cb based on the literature reported in the previous section are presented in tables 5 to 8 for vine fruit crops berries and hops temperate climate evergreen fruit trees temperate climate deciduous fruit tree crops and tropical and subtropical fruit crops respectively these tables also present previously published k c and k cb information for the same crops from fao56 allen et al 1998 computed from the fraction of ground cover and height with the approach proposed by allen and pereira 2009 as well as the more recent update provided by jensen and allen 2016 indicative updated values of the crop coefficients k c mid k c end k cb mid and k cb end were obtained from the observed values and those proposed in the referred studies and are tabulated in the same tables 5 to 8 following the simplified procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 the computation of the indicative updated values of k c mid for all trees and vines resulted from adding 0 05 to k cb mid this approach is due to the fact that for all orchards it was considered that drip irrigation systems are generally used thus with a small fraction of soil wetted by irrigation and mostly under the shadow of the canopies then only a limited amount of energy reaches the soil surface thus limiting soil water evaporation a diverse approach was used for k c end values because the added value to k cb end varied in the range 0 05 0 40 according to the f c value and the probability of occurrence of precipitation events by the end season when k cb mid and or k cb end were not available they were computed from k c mid and or k c end by subtracting the same amounts further explanation is provided for each type of orchard due to the wide range of variability of observed k c and k cb values the indicative standard values were considered within a range of 10 when information was available k c and k cb values refer to the crop density estimated from the fraction of ground cover f c including young crops in the cases where f c was not available in the cited papers an f c indicative value for commercial orchards was retrieved from literature and the respective references are provided as table footnotes a similar procedure was followed for tree height and references used to find an indicative value are also listed in the tables footnotes for vine fruit crops and hops the management and training system was considered instead of density given the larger variability in the crop geometry and the information available k c and k cb for vine fruit crops in table 5 include table grapes wine grapes kiwi highbush blueberries and hop for table grapes five different management and training classes were considered young overhead trellis horizontal trellis t trellis and y shape gable y trellis the collected k c mid and k c end information for young plantations indicated higher values than those previously reported but the standard values do not reflect that increase since the information available was not enough to support an alteration for overhead trellis system reported data for k c confirmed previous tabulated data and were therefore kept within those ranges k cb mid reported data were lower than previously tabulated data and the indicative standard value chosen is below the range higher limit data on previous standard values was inexistent for the horizontal trellis and y gable system y trellis systems therefore new indicative values were set based on reported data and bearing in mind the new indicative values for other training classes maintaining a 5 10 difference the t trellis system had only a reported value for k c mid and this was used to adjust a lower standard value and the remnant coefficients for this class were set accordingly table grape crops tend to have higher density and vigor than wine grape crops which reflects on higher standard k c and k cb values for table grapes for wine grapes trained with vertical shoot positioned trellis vsp systems the reported data confirmed the previously tabulated values with a slight increase in k cb end hence indicative values were set accordingly scarce information was found for the pergola system and only for k cb mid and k cb end indicating lower values than the ones previously tabulated this was accounted for in the new indicative values for guyot there was no previous information and only a reported value in literature thus indicative values were set according to those of the other systems and crop geometry as previously pointed out the indicative standard values of k c mid and k cb mid for both wine and grape wine table 5 differ by 0 05 while k c end and k cb end differed by 0 10 when f c 0 30 otherwise by 0 05 information from literature was available for kiwi relative to k cb mid while k c mid and k cb mid values were available in allen et al 1998 allowing to set indicative standard values for the mid season standard values for the end season were based on common values found for vines and on the crop characteristics for example k c end for kiwi pergola system is close to k c mid considering that harvesting occurs during the rainy season hence the soil surface is often wetted by rainfall thus allowing to maintain a high k c value regarding k cb end there is a slight difference relative to k cb mid since leaves are starting to senesce table 5 presents k c data for berries and hop based on the collected data and on the information from allen et al 1998 and jensen and allen 2016 standard k c mid for berries was set at 0 95 high density resulting from the experimental values k c end k cb mid and k cb end were retrieved from previous tabulated information since no newly reported data existed for other densities no previous information was available and crop coefficients were set based on density differences collected values of k c mid and k c end for hop were identical to those found in allen et al 1998 therefore these values were kept collected value of k cb mid for hop was slightly lower than those found in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 therefore indicative value was also slightly decreased the value for k cb end was similar to previous tabulated value and therefore was kept standard k c and k cb values for temperate climate evergreen fruit tree crops table 6 include citrus and olive crops for young citrus plantations no information was found in literature and therefore previously tabulated values were considered to establish new indicative values although following a water conservation perspective since irrigation systems for this crop as well as for other crops have often evolved to localized irrigation systems mirrored by a decrease in indicated crop coefficients low density citrus orchards presented reported values somehow higher than standard ones and this was taken in account in indicative values for medium density short h 3 5 m citrus orchards the collected k c mid was lower than the ones reported in allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 thus the new indicative standard value was defined adopting the lower value in this range no information existed on previous tabulated values k c for medium density tall h 3 5 m citrus orchards a new indicative standard value was set considering a reported value and differences of 5 10 among the various classes this last procedure was adopted for k cb mid k c end and k cb end whenever previous tabulated information was not available for high density standard k c mid was set to 0 70 short trees orchards and to 0 90 tall trees orchards according to observed or observed tabulated information respectively a similar approach was followed for k cb mid k c end and k cb end citrus species are evergreen presenting a similar foliage and ground cover in the mid and the end of the cycle which originates close values of k c mid and k c end and also k cb mid and k cb end for every density for citrus differences between k c end and k cb end are different from the previously tabulated values because it is expected that wetting events by precipitation occur by the end season k c end value was obtained by adding a specific value to k cb end which ranged 0 10 0 25 the specific value added decreased with f c thus a value of 0 25 was used for the young orchards and it decreased to 0 10 in case of the high density orchards for olive the four crop systems considered were young traditional intensive and super intensive young and traditional systems have the smallest tree density and lower f c originating lower k c and k cb when compared with the other systems the collected data for traditional olive orchards showed values of k c mid reaching a maximum of 0 65 which is larger than the k c mid indicated in allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the value of k c mid for olive orchards with traditional systems medium density was then updated to 0 45 no observed data for k c end and k cb end was available in the literature for this kind of systems and new values were set considering differences of 5 10 to adjacent classes the newly reported value of k cb mid for these traditional systems 0 59 medium density is higher than those previously reported 0 35 by allen and pereira 2009 and by jensen and allen 2016 so standard k cb mid was set to 0 40 intensive olive orchards have higher tree density than traditional orchards and it was expected that they would have higher k c values this was not confirmed for k c mid as a lower collected value was retrieved also non concordant with prior information given the special characteristics of hedgerow olive orchards in what concerns canopy shape height and spacing k c and k cb values were supposed to be larger in comparison with the other two systems this was confirmed with collected data for k c mid and k cb mid for most of the olive systems standard values for k c end are higher than k c mid as retrieved by the collected information since the end season occurs during the rainy season in the mediterranean climate types thus when soil evaporation contribution to et is high and consequently k c increases thus differences between the indicative standard values of k c end and k cb end range 0 35 0 40 depending on the f c of the orchard table 7 presents information on temperate climate deciduous fruit tree crops including stone fruit trees apricot cherry plum and peach pome fruit trees apple and pear nut trees almond hazelnut pecan pistachio and walnut and other fruit trees such as fig tree persimmon and pomegranate collected information for this group is abundant mainly for k c mid although not covering all the densities as for low density orchards new information on the k c mid and k cb mid values for a first group of stone fruit trees apricot cherry and plum was only available for very high density orchards and only one value of k cb mid for high density and provided a range of values slightly lower 0 95 1 20 than those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the standard k c mid was then set to 1 05 for other density classes information was only available from the referred studies and in allen et al 1998 thus the standard values were established considering these previous studies a similar procedure was followed to set standard k cb mid k c end and k cb end a similar approach was followed for peach although more information was available for young apple orchards values for crop coefficients were set with small differences to low density plantations for low density observed values of k c mid were smaller than the ones found in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 but an indicative standard value was derived from those tabulated bearing in mind orchard characteristics and differences to other density classes since reported information was scarce k c end was derived from previously tabulated values except for high and very high density orchards where literature data were used to establish the indicative values for medium density orchards the standard k cb mid value decreased compared to the previously indicated by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 given the literature collected k cb values the same occurred for high and very high density apple orchards where a standard value for k c mid is smaller based on the values retrieved from experimental studies the differences between k c end and k cb end values were 0 10 or 0 05 according to the f c values with higher values for the lower f c which corresponded to the young and low density orchards data collected in literature relative to k c mid of low density pears orchards was higher than previously tabulated values but the new indicative values do not reflect this change since related information is scarce in case of the medium density orchards k c mid values collected in literature and previously tabulated allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 were close therefore standard values were similar to the existing information for high density orchards the k c mid values reported in literature were lower than those in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 thus the standard k c mid values were lowered to accommodate this difference there was no collected information available for k c end and k cb end thus the standard value was derived from previous tabulated data allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 for nut trees no information was found for young orchards from collected information in literature relative to low medium and high densities of almond orchards only information on k cb was available to update the previously tabulated values allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 which were taken into account to set the updated indicative values standard values were retained for k c mid considering the values for other classes very high density orchards presented higher k c mid and similar k cb mid and k c end as compared to previously tabulated values differences between k c mid and k cb mid values for all the nut tree orchards were assumed equal to 0 05 while for k c end and k cb end differences range 0 10 to 0 05 with the highest value for young and low density orchards as well as in a few cases of medium density orchards when the expected wetting events by precipitation are high during the end season collected k c values in literature for hazelnut were available for low and high densities and a reported k c mid was found for a low density orchard since no prior information from tabulated values existed the experimentally derived k c and k cb values were used to support setting the new indicative values for pecan orchards there was no prior tabulated information on k c and k cb thus the indicative standard values were derived from ranges given in literature for low to high densities considering the growth habits and the crop cycle as a deciduous tree k c end and k cb end present an evident decrease since the plants senesce during the late season stage no information was found for young plantations of pistachio as well as relative to low and medium densities hence standard values were set from the values previously tabulated allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 bearing in mind the new values reported in literature for high density orchards for high density pistachio plantations the collected values for k c mid were close to those previously tabulated leading to similar indicative values for walnut orchards with young trees or low to medium densities there was little or no information reported in literature therefore the indicative crop coefficient values were established mostly based on previous information crop characteristics and maintaining reasonable differences to high and very high density orchard k c k cb values for high density walnut orchards collected k c mid values were slightly lower than the ones previously tabulated and the k c mid indicative values reflect this trend the indicative standard k c end value results from the combination between the previously tabulated value with the lower value collected from the literature for very high density orchards there was no prior tabulated information and new indicative values were set based on literature reported values one of the least documented crops is the fig tree with literature data available only for k c mid and without previously tabulated information new values for k c mid k c end k cb mid and k cb end are suggested based on observations and for k cb bearing in mind that fig are deciduous trees and that tree spacing tends to be large similar situation in terms of available data was found for persimmon where only k c mid and k cb mid values for medium density orchards are reported in literature indicative values were provided based on these values and on the crop characteristics for pomegranate there was no previous tabulated information but it was possible to collect k c mid for all densities and k c end for the high density orchards the standard k c mid value for all densities resulted from the corresponding adjustment there was no new literature information on k cb and in this case standard values adopted were set bearing in mind expected differences relative to k c taking into consideration the diverse crop density classes table 8 presents updated indicative values of crop coefficients for tropical and sub tropical fruit crops avocado banana cherimoya coconut coffee date palm guava mango and papaya for mango and avocado collected data refer only to k c for high and medium density because there was no information available for low densities therefore standard k c values for low densities were set based on what was suggested by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 for k cb no reported values were available in literature for both crops for the first cycle of the banana crop k c mid values collected in literature were slightly lower than the ones reported in allen et al 1998 and in jensen and allen 2016 thus the standard value was slightly decreased the standard k cb end value was set to a lower value than in allen et al 1998 in fact a decrease in k cb by the end season is in agreement with the status of the crop in that stage when leaf senescence occurs and harvest is performed from the first cycle to the second cycle plant canopy shadow decreases due to a higher spacing between plants thus soil evaporation increases inducing larger values for k c and k cb in the second cycle collected k c mid values were somewhat smaller than those presented in allen et al 1998 and therefore the respective consolidate values were set to reflect this fact no observed values were found for k cb thus standard values were determined to bear in mind the information in allen et al 1998 and the occurrence of leaf senescence by the end of the cycle information collected from literature on k cb mid was more limited and only available for coffee and papaya high density plantations k cb value for coffee collected from literature was lower than the tabulated by allen et al 1998 but the standard k c mid was set equal to that previous one as reported information is scarce for k c mid reported values helped fixing indicative values considering the different density classes and crop ground cover and height only a small difference for k c or k cb values between the mid and end seasons is expected because at the end of the cycle the plant does not have a significantly different foliar coverage compared with the mid season standard k c and k cb for papaya were set based on newly collected information since no prior data existed the same occurred for cactus pear but existing information was not considered sufficient to derive indicative standard values the cherimoya crop had no prior tabulated information but new collected values could be considered to set the standard ones the same procedure was used with guava to set standard values for k c for k cb as no information at all existed standard values were set considering those for k c and the crop characteristics cherimoya is a briefly deciduous plant but most evergreen and guava is evergreen therefore lower k c end and k cb end for cherimoya were considered the k c values collected in literature relative to coconut orchards were similar to those previously reported in allen et al 1998 no other information was available in literature thus the new standard values were kept within the range previously established information on k cb was available in allen et al 1998 and this was used as the standard value the collected k c values for date palm are somewhat lower than those presented in previously tabulated information accordingly new indicative standard values were set to lower values no k cb data could be retrieved from literature and new standard values were set considering previous information data collection evidenced that field derived crop coefficients k c and k cb as reported in the literature are fairly variable among species and for the same tree or vine crop thus making it difficult to define standard k c and k cb for each crop likely the large range of data observed in the literature is linked to several factors such as crop variety climate effects the method used to determine crop et crop spacing soil type and soil management irrigation method and scheduling crop age and agronomic practices moreover crop density represented by the fraction of ground cover and crop training plays a major role as indicated by the former studies where k cb and k c were computed from the fraction of ground cover nevertheless literature is often scarce in providing related information despite crop density and training are changing in recent times due to the mechanization of orchard operations which includes pruning and harvesting all the factors referred above led to setting k c and k cb values considering an interval of 10 relative to the indicative values provided 6 conclusions and future perspectives the present study gathered information from field research performed using the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 for deriving the crop coefficients of fruit trees and vines over the past twenty years this information was used to update the values of single k c and basal k cb crop coefficients previously tabulated in fao56 the k c and k cb values retained in this review were obtained in field studies that used the fao56 grass reference et o equation the accuracy of et c estimates was assured by selecting only studies that employed well designed and performed field studies such as eddy covariance sap flow soil water balance approaches and lysimetry conditions for transferability of reported data were therefore assumed nevertheless because studies for the same crop are quite different in terms of crop varieties crop and irrigation management rainfall amounts and timings and field methods there is a great variability of reported k c and k cb for the same crop and similar training systems and fractions of ground cover it was therefore necessary to assume that tabulated values are indicative and vary in a range of approximately 10 which is referred in the tables users may therefore select a larger or small value than the tabulated ones single values for k c and k cb were provided in fao56 for most crops corresponding to the most common crop system management in the current review considering the wide range of plants density f c and h as well as the tabulation of values according to f c as adopted in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the indicative standard tabulated k c and k cb values are assigned to various categories related with crop density young orchard and low density and medium high and very high densities ranges of f c and h characterize those densities that categorization for vine fruit crops was mainly related with the training systems the presently tabulated indicative values for k c and k cb agree with those tabulated in fao56 but have the advantage of being tied to the crop density and training system particularly with the fraction of ground cover this allows users to select the indicative values according to the conditions prevailing in the considered orchards and vines the current review allowed to propose indicative k c and k cb values for several fruit crops that were not considered in fao56 nor in other previous publications e g hazelnut pecan fig persimmon pomegranate as well as a few tropical fruit crops such as cherimoya guava mango and papaya therefore favorable conditions are created to better using the k c et o method to compute crop water requirements of trees and vines as proposed in fao56 the use of tabulated k c and k cb values is appropriate for a variety of applications such as irrigation scheduling in planning irrigation namely using water balance or water yield models the current review revealed that many k c research studies not retained but published did not report about the quality of input and output data or reported very high k c values which were not justified by the local climate but could result from advection and or inaccuracies in field measurements and data handling it is therefore recommended that appropriate scrutiny of results be commonly adopted from planning to end of experiments and data handling the quality of research results is very important to base new approaches that may lead to improved production and resource conservation the review has shown that only few studies used appropriately calibrated and validated swb simulation models despite their use eases to derive standard k c and k cb values including when water stress is greater than the reasonable eustress it is recommended that more research is performed using swb models in searching k c and k cb as well as for irrigation management purposes the incorporation of remote sensing and big data in such modeling is a recommended area of research moreover the use of forecasted weather data is also recommended aiming at real time irrigation scheduling the impacts of active ground cover cover crops and mulches on k c and k cb values of fruit trees and vines consist of another area where further research is required it is recommended to develop research on these domains in a broader perspective of better production and resource conservation namely water saving it is important to recognize that current water scarcity and climate change call for water saving which may be achieved when adopting precision irrigation protocols namely when supported by modeling with that perspective the k c and k cb indicative values were set in a conservative way not increasing relative to the past but whenever possible decreasing since the use of drip irrigation improved soil management and an appropriate adoption of eustress management allows higher yields in a

10111,the present study reviews the research on the fao56 crop coefficients of fruit trees and vines performed over the past twenty years the main objective was to update information and extend tabulated single k c and basal k cb standard crop coefficients the selection and analysis of the literature for this review have been done to consider only studies that adhere to fao56 method computing the reference et with the fao penman monteith et o equation and field measuring crop et with proved accuracy the crops considered refer to vine fruit crops berries and hops temperate climate evergreen fruit trees temperate climate deciduous fruit trees and tropical and subtropical fruit crops papers satisfying the conditions expressed above and that studied the crops under pristine or appropriate eustress conditions were selected to provide for standard k c and k cb data preference was given to studies reporting on the fraction of ground cover f c crop height h planting density crop age and adopted training systems the k c and k cb values obtained from the selected literature generally show coherence relative to the crop biophysical characteristics and reflect those characteristics mainly f c h and training systems the ranges of reported k c and k cb values were grouped according to crop density particularly f c and h and were compared with fao56 allen et al 1998 previously tabulated k c and k cb values as well as by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 which lead to define update indicative standard k c and k cb values these values are aimed for use in crop water requirement computations and modeling for irrigation planning and scheduling thus also aimed at supporting improved water use and saving in orchards and vines keywords kc and kcb values vineyards evergreen fruit trees deciduous fruit trees nut trees tropical fruit crops berries and hop 1 introduction irrigation is the main user and consumer of water exceeding by far the demand for other uses de fraiture 2007 pereira et al 2009 nonetheless there is growing water scarcity and a decline of water quality that pose diverse key challenges such as increased competition for limited water resources increased demands for food to nourish an ever growing population reduced water supply reliability climate change and climate uncertainty and droughts decline in critical ecosystems services competition for land use and less participatory water resources governance hence agriculture faces increased difficulties and challenges aiming at providing for worldwide sustainable food security while preserving natural and man made ecosystems and landscapes as reviewed by pereira 2017 high water use performance and productivity as well as water conservation and saving in irrigation are among the required solutions institutional interventions policies and new technologies are essential and there is an increasing focus on irrigation management performance to achieve the sustainable use of water for food production however the lack of basic information on crop water needs is one of the causes of inadequate water use and poor irrigation management abuzar et al 2013 therefore research should contribute to improving the knowledge of crop water requirements and their use in irrigation management recent advances in sensors communications and information technologies progressively allow the implementation of tools to support irrigation and water management decisions namely supported by the internet of things as recently reviewed by garcía et al 2020 and focusing on irrigation by jovanovic et al 2020 and pereira et al 2020a 2021c despite new tools to support irrigation management the knowledge of crop water requirements is paramount evapotranspiration et is commonly measured with a variety of instruments and field procedures which have well defined requirements for accuracy as discussed in other papers for the current special issue pereira et al 2021a b crop et is typically computed or modeled by using weather data and a panoply of computational procedures more often adopting the fao56 method allen et al 1998 this method uses the simple k c et o approach which considers the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o the latter represents the actual evaporative demand of the atmosphere while k c represents an integration of the effects of the main characteristics that distinguish the grass reference from the crop in terms of the energy balance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 adopting the k c et o approach is simple but requires the application of accurate measurements and computations particularly when deriving k c values for a crop using field observations allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a b or their prediction from the field observed fraction of ground cover and height allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b the method is particularly challenging for woody and incomplete cover crops as it is the case of fruit trees and vines to be considered standard crop coefficients must be obtained from accurate et field measurements as well as with et o computed with the fao pm allen et al 1998 or the asce pm asce 2005 equations from its development adopting fixed grass parameters for aerodynamic and surface resistance it resulted that crop coefficients despite computed empirically should be interpreted in terms of relating the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the considered crop with those of the grass reference crop pereira et al 1999 this is particularly challenging for vines and fruit trees due to the enormous difference of the canopy architecture and the incomplete ground cover other methods may be used to calculate et c pereira et al 2020a namely by remote sensing courault et al 2005 in many cases not making use of standard crop coefficients the definition of standard crop coefficient implies its determination under non water or other stress conditions otherwise it refers to actual evapotranspiration et c act namely under water stress conditions however research on tree and vine crops is demonstrating that the best crop management does not correspond to the full satisfaction of crop water demand but to the adoption of controlled water stress at given phases of the crop cycle ferreira et al 2012 cammalleri et al 2013a lobos et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 herein called eustress conditions paço et al 2019 accurate standard transferable and updated k c values obtained from the literature review require that related et data collection et models and related model calibrations as well as experimental set ups were exempt of biases caused by experimental flaws allen et al 2011 following the methodology adopted in studies focused on vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2021a b the selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of et measurement practices crop management and related production environment were provided they were also checked to detect possible computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling as well as in model calibration and validation in addition the possible influence of advection was considered e g wang et al 2019 since related k c k cb values are then of local value only thus not transferable nonetheless for several crops the collected information was scarce tree and vine fruit crops are heterogeneous sparse vegetated surfaces with complex canopies requiring different methodological approaches to determine and update crop coefficients when compared with homogeneous vegetation fully covering the soil like vegetables and field crops the objective of this paper addressing particularly this group of crops consists of reviewing standard updated single and basal k c values for tree and vine fruit crops obtained under near pristine eustress conditions using the available k c and k cb information for tabulating indicative standard k c and k cb values thus the current review intends to identify the main results of recent research on standard k c and k cb values to assess their range and the way they were obtained these standard values are further summarized and tabulated section 2 is focused on the basic concepts underlying the derivation of k c values including a brief discussion on k c concepts and on the k c curve as well as on the factors influencing k c values and limiting their transferability section 3 describes the methodologies used to select crop coefficient data section 4 consists of a literature review on the derivation of k c and k cb from field research including the related ancillary data whereas section 5 provides updated indicative values of standard k c and k cb for tree and vine fruit crops conclusions and recommendations are reported in section 6 2 requirements for accuracy on deriving k c from field studies 2 1 limitations and requirements for the transferability of crop coefficients crop evapotranspiration et c mm d 1 adopting the fao56 method is estimated by multiplying the grass reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 by a crop coefficient k c dimensionless 1 e t c e t o k c et o is defined as the evapotranspiration of a grass reference crop which is a hypothetical crop with height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered and well covering the ground allen et al 1998 the daily et o is computed with the pm et o equation eq 2 obtained by parameterizing the penman monteith combination equation for that grass crop allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 fixating the corresponding aerodynamic and surface resistance terms daily grass reference evapotranspiration is then obtained with the following equation 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve at mean air temperature kpa c 1 r n g is the available energy at the vegetated surface mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is mean daily air temperature c u 2 is mean daily wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height and e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd of the atmosphere kpa because the pm et o equation considers only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o thus et o incorporates most of the weather and related energy effects and then represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere since k c is the ratio between et c and et o eq 1 its variations should mainly be attributed to the specific crop characteristics and for a limited extent to the climate which enables the transfer of standard k c values between locations and climates when local and or regional advection is excluded apart from the pm et o equation other alternative processes have been tested to calculate reference evapotranspiration either with full weather data sets or limited data sets processes with full data sets are an attempt to simplify the calculation procedure which is advantageous but have the tendency to overlook the conceptual framework pereira et al 2015 for limited data sets the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and the fao pm temperature method have been widely used consolidated methodologies are discussed and described by paredes et al 2020 as well as the use of reanalysis weather data and of geostationary satellite products paredes et al 2021 however the use of alternative approaches requires the scrutiny of input data and et o results since processes are not linear for scientific research studies intending to derive time and space transferable crop coefficients the pm et equation 2 should be used the crop coefficient k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish any crop from the reference one crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance r a bulk crop soil surface resistance r s which relates to leaf area the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness and albedo of the crop soil surface influencing the net radiation that is determined by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and soil surface wetness allen et al 1998 two k c approaches are considered allen et al 1998 one consists of a time averaged single k c which includes multi day effects of evaporation from the soil in addition to plant transpiration whereas the second refers to the dual k c i e the sum of the basal crop coefficient k cb and the soil evaporation coefficient k e these coefficients represent respectively the ratios between crop transpiration t c or soil evaporation e s and et o in the latter approach therefore k c k cb k e with k cb t c et o and k e e s et o various authors have developed models or procedures for partitioning et into t c and e s however the fao56 approach has been successfully used mainly after the paper of allen et al 2005 even implemented in models such as simdualk c rosa et al 2012 whose applications to peach paço et al 2012 vineyards fandiño et al 2012 papaya chaterlán et al 2012b and olives paço et al 2014 2019 are reported herein for transferability purposes fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard k c and potential et c which refer to pristine cropping and well watered conditions and are distinct of actual field conditions often not optimal due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation crop density salinity agronomic practices and soil management the tabulated k c refer therefore and exclusively to the standard k c however for tree and vine crops as referred in section 1 k c refer to adopting crop specific eustress practices under water stress conditions et c gives place to the actual crop et et c act with k c replaced by the actual k c act or using the dual approach by k s k cb k e 3 et c act k s et c k s k c et o k s k cb k e et o where k s 0 1 0 is the stress coefficient which depends upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate adopting this concept eases a consistent estimation and transferability of measured standardized k c therefore it avoids the need to define multiple k c values for the same crop depending upon related water management because factors influencing crop management are numerous and cause values for k c act to vary widely contrary to standard k c plot level use of crop coefficient based simulations can be backed up by soil and plant water status measurements to detect water stress conditions e g leaf or stem water potential evapotranspiration relies on the amount of energy available at a surface resulting from the energy balance of that surface net radiation flux r n minus soil heat flux g minus sensible heat flux h will result in the term of latent heat flux λ e or the energy available to the evaporation process thus there are physical limits imposed for such process since available energy is dependent on this energy balance process upper limits to crop coefficient values are observed 1 2 in sub humid regions and 1 2 1 4 in arid regions both relative to grass reference higher values might result from errors in et measurement weather data for et o calculation or data processing procedure allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a awareness of such upper limits of k c is important since their transfer to different conditions in time and space are only possible when recurring to indicative standard values of k c that are bounded by such limits furthermore the conditions where measurements were acquired or those from where k c s are meant to be applied must be considered for application in small and isolated areas of vegetation k c can exceed the limits for grass reference 1 2 1 4 while for large areas or small areas surrounded by vegetation with similar roughness and soil water status k c s must stick to values equal or smaller than those limits allen et al 2011 the concepts of standard k c and potential crop et and related terminology are progressively being accepted by the users communities pereira et al 2015 however the standard k c and k cb values for tree and vine crops vary with the fraction of ground cover and height allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 due to crop age and crop management particularly crop training pereira et al 2021b c however these values can be considered standard if they are obtained under optimal pristine cropping conditions pereira et al 2021b c according to these authors another aspect to consider is that orchard and vine crops do not achieve full canopy cover resulting in an upper limit of k c close to 1 2 unless in the presence of advection the present review has shown that satisfactorily accurate reported k c and k cb values for the same crop show significant dissimilarity among locations due to differences in cultivar soil properties irrigation method and strategy soil crop management practices and orchard management and training minacapilli et al 2009 cammalleri et al 2013a marsal et al 2014a pereira et al 2020b thus while it is difficult and challenging to develop standard k c and k cb and while site specific k c and or k cb values are needed when it is required for research objectives to produce more robust and accurate crop coefficients it is possible to orient the development of standard k c and k cb on the basis of crop density as estimated by the fraction of ground cover or the fraction of ground shaded or the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation a most common value of the fraction of ground cover can be attributed to each crop relative to the growing stage initial mid or end season pereira et al 2021b c likewise for the same crop it is possible to link different values of ground cover to the respective k c or k cb for most crops it is possible to derive crop coefficients from f c and h as demonstrated in pereira et al 2020b although for orchards larger errors are expected due to varied training practices and differences of crop varieties therefore bearing in mind specificities of woody crops and departing from the most common value for f c of a given crop it is possible to infer correspondent standard k c or k cb research reporting field derived crop coefficients and showing diverse objectives used quite different methodologies with variable accuracy often with the aim to obtain k c values only for local use and therefore not transferable results are frequently published without sufficient information relative to the methods and instruments used or about the crop itself the cropping practices or training when the published material had serious limitations to transferability it was not used in this review main limitations are referred to 1 not adopting the standard pm et o equation as defined in fao56 because k c is defined as the ratio et c et o if the et o equation changes the k c also changes as a function of the ratio between the selected et o equation and pm et o the transferability of the research results is then not possible unless that ratio is well known 2 using a k c curve such as a function of time or a function of lai thus different from the standard segmented fao k c curve which defines k c and k cb values for the initial mid season and end season respectively k c ini k c mid and k c end then only approximate estimations of k c mid and k c end can be made from the reported graphical data or often more difficult from tabulated information 3 using non standard cultivation conditions namely aimed at controlling soil evaporation e s using mulch which produces specific k c values reported changes in k c are very often insufficient to properly recognize standard k c values 4 adopting deficit irrigation practices that deviate from eustress conditions then k c results refer to local k c act and cannot be directly transferred 2 2 field data measurement and accuracy requirements as evapotranspiration is dependent on the available energy at a crop surface limits apply to the process yielding crop coefficient values for grass reference for tree crops more likely to be below 1 2 as reported above section 2 1 higher values might result from errors in et measurement data processing and or the effects of advection pereira et al 2021a b hence field data acquisition processes must respect well defined requirements field data sets used to derive k c or k cb are usually obtained using techniques based on soil water balance the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the eddy covariance method ec scintillometry sap flow methods remote sensing energy balance or vegetation indices derived from satellite information the requirements for data quality acquired by these methods are extensively described in allen et al 2011 and reviewed by pereira et al 2021a b and herein summarized techniques that recur to soil water balance methods calculate et as the remaining term when water stored in the soil is added to rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and subtracted of drainage or deep percolation and surface runoff the main sources of error in this calculation normally arise from the quantification of drainage deep percolation and or capillary rise other difficulties may arise from the different patterns of soil water extraction by the roots namely for heterogeneous stands as sampling processes may not represent adequately the stand these techniques must take into account i a comprehensive characterization of soil hydraulic properties ii representativeness of data in spatial and temporal terms iii appropriate sensor calibration iv differential spatial wetting by irrigation v deep percolation and capillary rise vi root water extraction patterns relevant in the case of trees and vii inappropriate sampling or readings the breb method relies on the surface energy balance equation and requires measurements of air temperature and vapor pressure gradients at a certain level above the evaporating surface having the advantages of being able to be used in water stressed stands as long as some conditions are respected of almost eliminating turbulent transfer coefficients and of not requiring wind speed and surface measurements nevertheless it requires some caution in its application since the accuracy of the method relies strongly on r n and g measurements and on an adequate fetch for the establishment of the equilibrium boundary layer also the adoption of breb in tree stands implies that gradients measurement are performed at a height above the canopies sufficient to avoid individual tree effects main requirements for breb data quality must then include i large enough fetch to allow for the establishment of a suitable equilibrium boundary layer ii adequate positioning of sensors above the canopy avoiding the roughness sublayer iii representative measurement of r n and g iv multiple r n and g measurement points for heterogeneous or sparse crops the ec method presents a relatively simple theoretical framework although its implementation requires complex and expensive sensors capable of high frequency measurement and extended data processing and treatment it entails the knowledge of vertical wind speed and fluctuations around the mean of air temperature and humidity in vertical fluxes of sensible and latent heat sampling statistically turbulent eddies the main advantage of the ec method is to provide a direct measurement of et in actual conditions either potential or not recurring to the ec method implies respecting the following data quality requirements i large enough fetch and adequate elevation of sensors as with breb ii application of the required corrections including coordinate rotation if the sensor measuring vertical wind speed is not set parallel to surface iii recognition of advection situations and taking of corrective actions iv correct data for lack of closure of energy balance equation when needed scintillometry is another method that although not able to measure et directly allows its estimation as a residual term by measuring sensible heat flux the sensor scintillometer detects small oscillations in air density caused by temperature humidity and pressure in the form of slight fluctuations in the refractive index of air it has the advantage of integrating large areas information along a certain direction but still relies on r n and g measurements for calculating et requiring accurate representative measurements of r n and g allen et al 2011 the transpiration component in et can be obtained independently by sap flow methods these methods use heat as a tracer to measure the flow of water in the xylem of plants they are more frequently oriented to applications in woody plants although there are also solutions applicable to herbaceous plants although most methods require calibration to produce accurate quantitative results these methods generally follow well the transpiration dynamics several factors can influence the data quality of sap flow measurements and must be observed i a calibration is required for each new application ii being a plant based process implies scaling from plant to stand level dealing with measurement representativeness iii an accurate estimate of conductive xylem area is needed allen et al 2011 remote sensing data can be used to calculate et but these processes produce estimates and not measurements as with remote sensing energy balance data and should be considered accordingly pôças et al 2020 pereira et al 2021a b they are however becoming largely used for k c and et calculation satellite based energy balance methods have the disadvantage of being time consuming and requiring specialized skills but they can be a way of calibrating less complex methods which recur to vegetation indices vegetation indices derived from satellite information require ground data for validation and they are related to crop coefficients in et actual conditions therefore often not standard pereira et al 2021a b inaccuracies in measuring crop et and in computing et o often results in high k c values commonly indicating that the corresponding energy use would largely exceed the energy available at the surface for evaporation allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a b although values of k c above 1 3 may be observed for a few occasional days following a rainfall event or over quite short periods such high values cannot be accepted as averages for large periods such as a month or the entire mid season problems for transferability also result from conditions where k c experiments are developed managed and data are handled e g small size experimental plots inadequate setting and management of lysimeters the reduced fetch of breb and ec systems and poor estimation of soil water fluxes and inadequate calibration of soil water balance swb models when using remote sensing adopting non calibrated vegetation indices or energy balance models are causes for inaccuracies these subjects were reviewed by allen et al 2011 evett et al 2012a b and pereira et al 2021a b when the accuracy of crop et measurements cannot be accepted then it is not possible to use transfer the reported k c values this is summarized as follows 1 inaccuracies in performing the soil water balance e g evett et al 2012c such as insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties non consideration of the full root zone depth inadequate spacing and or frequency of measurements inaccuracies in measuring the soil water content and or the irrigation water and rainfall poor estimation of deep percolation and or capillary rise rough computational approaches and or using an inadequately calibrated and validated model 2 using lysimeters with poor setting and management allen et al 1991a b grebet and cuenca 1991 lópez urrea et al 2006 evett et al 2016 namely having differences in cropping conditions inside and outside of the lysimeter that relates to vigor and growth of vegetation the poor setting of the lysimeter without similar surrounding vegetation causing local advection or clothesline effects insufficient fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer of air lack of consideration of the area effectively used by the crop for et 3 measuring et with the breb method or the ec systems with insufficient fetch less representative measurement of net radiation insufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy lack of adjustments for the effects of advection and or poor correction of data for the energy balance closure error payero et al 2003 allen et al 2011 alfieri et al 2012 evett et al 2012b kutikoff et al 2019 4 the use of remote sensing vegetation indices vis to estimate crop coefficients is now well established mainly with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi hunsaker et al 2005a b pôças et al 2020 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi glenn et al 2011 however inaccuracies in deriving k c or k cb from a vi result from improper calibration of the index and from insufficient identification of the pixels that correspond to the crop growing under an approximately pristine condition hunsaker et al 2005a b and 2007 remote sensing energy balance is less used to derive k c values and similar difficulties to those using vi approaches also occur however good results on k c values estimated with energy balance have been reported paço et al 2014 pôças et al 2014 the fao56 method allen et al 1998 proposes that when local climate conditions deviate from the standard reference wind velocity 2 m s 1 and minimum relative humidity 45 the k c and k cb values for mid and end seasons are adjusted to the reference climate however the equations proposed in fao56 were developed for field and vegetable crops which are full or near full cover crops and were not intended for tree and vine crops because these are incomplete cover crops and have large to very large heights thus having a different aerodynamic behavior from that of the former pereira personal communication thus adjustments for climate were not applied in the current study 2 3 crop coefficients derived from field measurements in the presence of advection if the et term of the surface energy balance equation results in a value higher than r n g the surface is receiving sensible heat downwards instead of just losing it by convection to the atmosphere therefore a larger amount of energy will be available for the process of evapotranspiration however there is an upper boundary to et imposed by limitations in aerodynamic transfer and equilibrium forces over a vegetated surface allen et al 2011 then similarly as referred in section 2 1 limits apply and k c must be less than or equal to 1 2 grass reference allen et al 2011 except in the presence of advection in the past two decades numerous studies have been published in this research area without considering advection impacts pereira et al 2021b and care must be taken when there is insufficient information relative to the methods employed or measurement conditions advection conditions can though limit transferability of crop coefficients either because they were determined under advection conditions or they are to be applied in such conditions advection conditions can result from the small dimension of the stand under analysis not providing adequate conditions for the development of a boundary layer in equilibrium with the surface or by favoring a clothesline effect where vegetation in the stand is somehow more exposed to atmosphere drive than the surrounding vegetation allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021a advection can also result from measurement errors in the field for example when lysimeters are not correctly set causing local and micro scale advection or a clothesline effect pereira et al 2021a or when in ec systems fetch conditions are not observed or data quality selection criteria against wind direction fetch not applied under advection h decreases to very small values given the downward advective h flux and λ e becomes larger than the term r n g therefore it is expected that under advection conditions and over small stands of vegetation et would reach a much larger value allen et al 2011 which is not the case for large stands where limits apply for k c 1 2 grass reference allen et al 2011 advection effects on et of woody crops are rarely reported in literature however since trees and vines do not attain full crop development due to pruning and training in the absence of advection k c values should not surpass 1 2 pereira et al 2021a b however under advective conditions much larger transpiration and larger evaporation values are observed kool et al 2018 wang et al 2019 nevertheless too much large k c values were also reported without signaling the occurrence of advection 3 information on selection methodologies 3 1 methods adopted to select the papers insufficiencies and inaccuracies referred in the previous section limit the transferability of reported k c values thus to update the tabulated k c it was necessary to operate a careful literature selection in fact reported k c curves often do not follow the fao segmented curves or k c results are presented as time dependent polynomial equations or are just referred to weekly 10 day or often monthly values crop growth stages are sometimes defined differently than in fao56 these limitations impede to adequately identify the k c k cb values for the mid and the end season information provided in some papers despite sufficient to achieve the objectives of the research could be inadequate for the transferability of the reported k c to environments different from that where the investigation was carried out these limitations obliged a careful review of published material to check when the proposed k c or k cb were limited to local interest and or represented non standard experimental conditions thus contrasting to k c resulting from near pristine or eustress cropping practices the studies were therefore selected when adopted the pm et o equation allen et al 1998 or the asce et o equation asce 2005 therefore studies reporting reference et values obtained with grass lysimeters empirical equations pan evaporation or similar were excluded presented data referred to two or more seasons only exceptionally studies were considered with one year of data but with different treatments so that it was possible to understand if the results were or not occasional as for a few studies presenting one year data for tropical fruit trees which represented the only available data source adopted the fao k c curve or a k c time curve that allowed to identify k c or k cb for the mid season and sometimes for the end season when that identification was not possible or when the k c curve was provided as a function of lai or similar the studies were excluded relative to the field methods using breb or ec systems the papers reporting upon the upwind fetch conditions and the energy balance closure were considered otherwise they were excluded studies using swb methods describing the terms of the balance and or providing for the accuracy associated with the model calibration and validation were selected otherwise papers not properly reporting deep percolation or referring to swb interesting only for the upper soil layers were not considered studies using lysimeters were accepted when there were adequate setting and management of the lysimeters namely avoiding oasis and cloth line effects and the evaporative surface was corrected if the tree vine canopy exceeded the lysimeter surface studies using remote sensing were considered when a calibration validation was performed studies reporting k c values greater than 1 25 were excluded since such high values are frequently induced by advection situations or sensor malfunctioning also studies reporting k cb end k cb mid and k cb k c were excluded finally papers where crops were evidently stressed were excluded such when k c values were low relative to studies referring to the same or a similar crop or heavy deficit irrigation was practiced as a consequence of the criteria assumed it was possible to select some papers that were used as reference to other studies or at least to approach reasonable quality conditions 3 2 methods adopted to select updated ranges of k c k cb values standard values were established considering i ranges of new k c k cb values collected in literature from the past twenty years ii prior information on tabulated k c k cb values from allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 iii crop density based upon ground cover fraction which varies with the crop and with training thus the term crop density is not exclusively related to plant spacing but in a broader sense encompasses plant density sparsity dimensions including height and at last the fraction of ground cover and plant spacing but not exclusively 4 review on single and dual k c for tree and vine crops information relative to crop coefficient k c mid and k c end and basal crop coefficient k cb mid and k cb end and related ancillary data collected from the selected studies were tabulated after grouping the crops into 1 vine fruit crops berries and hops 2 temperate climate evergreen fruit trees 3 temperate climate deciduous trees and 4 tropical and sub tropical fruit crops values for the initial period k c ini often characterized by a short duration and dependent mainly from the rainfall regime were not considered users are advised to follow the recommendations in fao56 and guiding values provided by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the collected data included in this review consider information regarding the age of the orchard the planting density number of trees vines or shrubs per hectare and various crop biophysical characteristics such as the training system crop height h and ground cover fraction f c alternatively to f c some studies adopted other indices that may serve as indicators of the ground surface covered by the canopies such as the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation f ipar intrigliolo et al 2009 girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 and the shaded fraction of soil f shad stevens et al 2012 the crop coefficient presented in the tables from 1 to 4 correspond to the average of the different experimental years however whenever it was possible to relate k c or k cb with f c results are presented for every single experimental year 4 1 vine fruit crops berries and hops a total of nineteen studies suitable to update the fao56 crop coefficients were retained for vineyards one for kiwi actinidia deliciosa a chev two for passion fruit passiflora edulis sims three for highbush blueberries vaccinium corymbosum l and one for hop humulus lupulus l table 1 presents the list of these selected studies and reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as related ancillary data vineyards were divided into table and wine grapes with nine and ten suitable studies respectively for each group table 1 the works referring to vineyards used different approaches to measure et c act from field observations two studies used weighing lysimeter williams et al 2003 lópez urrea et al 2012 while only one used a drainage lysimeter netzer et al 2009 four works applied ec systems to measure actual et c act villagra et al 2011 carrasco benavides et al 2012 er raki et al 2013 marras et al 2016 villagra et al 2014 combined the use of ec with the swb the ec technique was associated with sap flow measurements for the determination of crop transpiration in the studies by poblete echeverría et al 2012 and poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 ferreira et al 2012 measured et with ec and its components plant transpiration and soil evaporation using respectively the sap flow technique and micro lysimeters other studies moratiel and martínez cob 2012 used the surface renewal sr and the breb to estimate crop et teixeira et al 2007 parry et al 2019 combined the use of sr with weighing lysimeter measurements to estimate vineyards et fandiño et al 2012 and cancela et al 2015 used the swb for estimating vineyards et phogat et al 2020 adjusted the standard k cb values from fao56 taking into account local meteorological variables and crop biophysical characteristics one work used sap flow measurements exclusively suvočarev et al 2013 and another sap flow in combination with a whole canopy gas exchange system to measure the transpiration and to derive the k cb of table and wine grape intrigliolo et al 2009 the most common irrigation method in both table and wine grapes is surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation however one study used micro sprinkler irrigation in addition to drip irrigation teixeira et al 2007 rainfed is also common in wine grapes ferreira et al 2012 other studies used both drip irrigation and rainfed conditions fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 the studies on vineyards were conducted in different countries i e australia chile usa spain italy brazil méxico portugal and israel which include the primary producing vine areas and new emerging producing regions generally the k c and k cb values resulted higher in table grapes compared to wine grapes which are related to the different training system employed the k c and k cb values reported for table and wine grapes are generally related to f c at the same time the different k c and k cb values reported by various studies are coherent with the varieties age training and irrigation systems soil cover and crop management teixeira et al 2007 determined the k c values for micro sprinkler irrigated table and drip irrigated wine grapes in the semiarid region of the são francisco river basin brazil the study reported higher crop coefficients for table than wine grapes which may relate with both the irrigation method and training phogat et al 2020 reported similar k cb values for three different locations in south australia moratiel and martínez cob 2012 measured the evapotranspiration of a table grape located in zaragoza spain which grew under netting with black plastic mulch therefore crop coefficients were adjusted to take into account the reduction of et c caused by the netting and the black plastic mulching in the same experimental location suvočarev et al 2013 adjusted the k cb for the netting effects using a reduction coefficient similar to the one used by moratiel and martínez cob 2012 two articles presented the fao56 basal crop coefficient curve and the crop growth stages data fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 both studies performed in galicia spain calibrated and validated the soil water balance model simdualk c rosa et al 2012 and obtained both the single and the basal crop coefficients for vineyards with active ground cover in the inter row spacing silva et al 2008 studied the water requirements of kiwi in a mature orchard located in guimarães portugal irrigated with micro sprinklers in the study crop evapotranspiration was measured with the ec method the crop transpiration using sap flow sensors and the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration with micro lysimeters the selected studies on passionfruit were set in brazil in young drip irrigated orchards in both studies the swb was used to determine et c souza et al 2009 nogueira et al 2014 dourte et al 2010 studied the water requirements of southern mature highbush blueberries interspecific hybrids of vaccinium corymbosium l v virgatum aiton and v darrowi camp in florida usa based on the swb approach combining data from drainage lysimeter and soil moisture measurements overhead impact sprinklers were used for irrigation bryla 2011 estimated the k c of highbush blueberries v corymbosum using et c data provided by the pacific northwest cooperative agricultural weather network agrimet and weather based estimates of et o from the cimis california irrigation management information system website lobos et al 2016 validated the k c values reported in fao56 using midday stem water potential measurements the studies were developed in drip irrigated orchards from two experimental areas in maule region chile and michigan usa the difference observed among the k c values reported in these studies could be due to the different approaches employed to carry out the experiments as well as with the diverse irrigation and crop management conditions regarding hops humulus lupulus l only one study was available fandiño et al 2015 which was performed in galicia spain using the soil water balance approach to calibrate and validate the simdualk c model and thus to estimate crop et under diverse irrigation management conditions rainfed and drip irrigation 4 2 temperate climate evergreen fruit trees this group of orchards includes citrus citrus spp and olives olea europaea l a total of eleven articles were selected for citrus and six articles were retained for olives with diverse tree densities table 2 presents the list of these selected studies and reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as the related ancillary data the articles selected for citrus included studies on clementine citrus clementina castel 2000 rana et al 2005 lime citrus aurantiifolia marin and angelocci 2011 mandarine citrus reticulate blanco maestre valero et al 2017 and orange citrus sinensis l osbeck snyder and o connell 2007 er raki et al 2009 villalobos et al 2013 consoli and vanella 2014 rallo et al 2017 taylor et al 2017a peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 in general the k c and k cb values reported in the studies were comparable and related to the ancillary data table 2 different methodologies were used to estimate et for the citrus spp group the ec technique was used by consoli and vanella 2014 and maestre valero et al 2017 and it was associated with soil water balance fao56 by rana et al 2005 and er raki et al 2009 castel 2000 used the swb approach combining data from drainage and weighing lysimeters moreover sap flow sf measurements were used by marin and angelocci 2011 villalobos et al 2013 and taylor et al 2017a to provide accurate evaluations of tree transpiration snyder and o connell 2007 applied the surface renewal method to measure et c act the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach was applied through soil water balance models in two studies rallo et al 2017 who derived k cb values for orange using the soil water balance fdr soil water content measurements and ecophysiological indicators peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 used the simdualk c water balance model which was calibrated and validated with soil water content data determined with electrical resistivity tomography ert drip irrigation was the most common method however two works were carried out under surface irrigation er raki et al 2009 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and thus presented higher k c values most of the experimental studies were carried out in mediterranean countries e g italy spain morocco which are among the most important production regions for citrus while three studies were performed outside this region one in brazil marin and angelocci 2011 one in india peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and the other in south africa taylor et al 2017a rana et al 2005 reported the highest k c mid for citrus which might be due to a high stomatal conductance or to the favorable observed climatic conditions high wind speed and vapor pressure deficit er raki et al 2009 and peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 reported k c end values higher than the k c mid values which may be associated with the rainfall conditions during late autumn and winter typical to the climate of the investigated areas the highest k cb mid value was reported in the study with the highest f c taylor et al 2017a but the same study presented the lowest k cb end which relates with the stomatal control performed by the citrus trees under high climatic demand conditions in the last decades the research activity on olive water requirement has been concentrated on irrigation management strategies as well as on the crop response to water saving in terms of agronomic and or eco physiological features the ec technique was applied in two studies testi et al 2004 martínez cob and faci 2010 and was associated with sf measurements in cammalleri et al 2013b and lópez olivari et al 2016 puppo et al 2019 used drainage lysimeters combined with soil water content measurements for estimating et c act the soil water balance model simdualk c was calibrated and validated using sap flow based sensors in the study by paço et al 2019 which was the only study considering the direct calculation of the crop coefficient and derived the k c curve following the fao56 approach the irrigation method used in all the olive studies was drip irrigation the majority of the studies were carried out in the mediterranean basin which is the leading producing region for olives two of the selected studies were performed in south america countries one in southern uruguay characterized by a sub humid climate puppo et al 2019 while the other was performed in a location in chile characterized by a mediterranean climate lópez olivari et al 2016 the k c and k cb values observed in the different studies are coherent with the range of densities of the olive orchard from traditional to super intensive and the f c values thus the smallest k c mid was observed by testi et al 2004 which may be due to the young age of the trees low f c and the traditional olive orchard features located in córdoba spain the highest k c mid values were those of paço et al 2019 which corresponded to a super intensive orchard located in south portugal with the highest f c value and managed with a high irrigation frequency to note that the k c end was higher than k c mid in the studies by martínez cob and faci 2010 and paço et al 2019 which relates with the high autumn precipitation events typical of the mediterranean countries that coincide with the olive end season the highest k cb mid among the examined studies was the one indicated in a traditional olive orchard by cammalleri et al 2013b although the value resulted similar to that suggested by allen et al 1998 this high k cb mid value may be due to the combined effect of the age of the orchard twenty five years old with large size trees and highly developed canopy 4 3 temperate climate deciduous fruit trees table 3 presents the list of the studies on deciduous fruit trees that were selected and the reported single and basal crop coefficients as well as the related ancillary data only two studies were available for apricot prunus armeniaca l which used different methods for measuring et and t one adopted swb kaya et al 2013 and the other a sf technique villalobos et al 2013 the study by kaya et al 2013 was conducted in turkey and presented the k c values for the three development stages of drip irrigated apricot orchards these values are coherent with the f c and density of mature apricot orchards the study by villalobos et al 2013 took place in the region of murcia spain and presented the value of k cb for the mid season one work was selected for cherries prunus avium l table 3 performed in a micro sprinkler irrigated young orchard in hungary which used sap flow measurements to estimate cherry k cb juhász et al 2013 regarding peach trees prunus persica l batsch five studies were retained with the experiments conducted in a variety of climates and regions table 3 ayars et al 2003 and marsal et al 2014a implemented their experiments in california usa while du sautoy et al 2013 in pretoria south africa villalobos et al 2013 in cordoba spain and paço et al 2012 in southern portugal several approaches were used to estimate et c act with the studies by ayars et al 2003 du sautoy et al 2013 and marsal et al 2014a used weighing lysimeters and paço et al 2012 used ec villalobos et al 2013 used sap flow to measure crop t in the study by paço et al 2012 the et components crop t and e s were also measured using sf and micro lysimeters respectively ayars et al 2003 reported the highest k c values in a dense orchard f c 0 70 irrigated with micro sprinklers marsal et al 2014a presented the highest k cb mid values in a mature orchard with tall trees and high f c whereas the lowest k cb values were indicated by paço et al 2012 due to the smallest f c and the young age of trees only one work was available for plum prunus domestica l table 3 which used swb samperio et al 2014 the study was conducted in badajoz spain in drip irrigated orchards and considered two different plum varieties namely an early maturing cv red beaut and a late maturing cv angeleno the reported k c values are consistent with the crop varieties and their biophysical characteristics for the apple crop malus domestica l eight studies were retained which generally derived the single crop coefficient k c exceptions were the studies by marsal et al 2014a and gush et al 2019 that reported the basal crop coefficient k cb weighing lysimeters were used by girona et al 2011 and marsal et al 2013 2014a gong et al 2007 combined the use of swb and sf for estimating k c and k cb values respectively volschenk 2017 used the swb approach to derive k c for the three crop development stages the studies by gush et al 2019 and zanotelli et al 2019 used the ec method for measuring et the latter study also measured trees transpiration with sap flow sensors dragoni et al 2005 measured tree transpiration with sap flow measurements the most common irrigation system in the apple orchards was drip irrigation whereas micro sprinkler irrigation was used in two studies volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 and one used overhead sprinkler irrigation zanotelli et al 2019 the examined studies were carried out in different climates and regions four of them were implemented in the mediterranean countries while the others in south africa volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 usa dragoni et al 2005 and china gong et al 2007 the research by girona et al 2011 and marsal et al 2013 2014a were based on the same experimental field in lleida spain but used different methods to determine the fraction cover the k c values indicated in these studies correspond to different experimental years and thus to different f c the studies included for apple crop reported a wide variability of k c mid which could be due to the diverse training systems resulting in diverse f c and tree height two works were selected for the pear pyrus l tree girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2014b both studies were developed in spain and used weighing lysimeters to determine et c act the study by girona et al 2011 indicated the relationship between f c values and the correspondent k c mid there is a need to update nut trees crop coefficients especially considering the modern cultivars and production systems there is a lack of studies for hazelnut corylus avellana l pecan carya illinoinensis l pistachio pistacia vera l and walnuts juglans regia l while more studies were conducted for almonds prunus dulcis mill d a webb five experimental studies stevens et al 2012 espadafor et al 2015 garcía tejero et al 2015 bellvert et al 2018 lópez lópez et al 2018 on k c and k cb have been included for almond field weighing lysimeter containing one almond tree instrumented with sap flow sensors was the methodology used by lópez lópez et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2015 used drainage lysimeters combined with soil moisture probes micrometeorology technique ec and swb modeling were associated to assess the crop coefficients in two studies stevens et al 2012 bellvert et al 2018 the modeling approach assumed that the fraction of crop intercepted radiation f ipar is the major determinant of k cb espadafor et al 2015 used the sap flow method to measure crop transpiration the studies were done under drip irrigation with the exception of the study presented by stevens et al 2012 in which the orchard was irrigated with micro sprinklers the study by bellvert et al 2018 was performed in a mature orchard located in madera ca usa reporting the highest k cb mid and k c mid values which relates with the orchard presenting the highest ground cover f ipar 0 85 a slightly smaller k c mid value was reported by garcía tejero et al 2015 in a non mature orchard located in sevilla spain similar k c mid values were reported by stevens et al 2012 in a mature and high yielding almond orchard located in loxton australia but these authors reported an effect of advection due to the surrounding area characterized by different physical properties from those of the studied orchard which may have increased the k c value the experimental k cb indicated by espadafor et al 2015 was the lowest for almond orchards which was related to the young age of the orchard and the lowest f c two studies were retained for hazelnut trees mačkić et al 2016 ortega farias et al 2020 the study by mačkić et al 2016 was conducted in a micro sprinkler hazelnut orchard in the pannonia plain serbia and used the swb to measure et ortega farias et al 2020 used ec to determine the k c of a drip irrigated hazelnut orchard from the maule region chile higher k c values were reported by mačkić et al 2016 probably due to the higher planting density and the irrigation method employed three works studied the et of pecans carya illinoinensis l using micrometeorological techniques simmons et al 2007 samani et al 2011 taylor et al 2017b the studies of simmons et al 2007 and samani et al 2011 were carried out in new méxico usa both under flood irrigation the study by taylor et al 2017b was performed in an orchard located in cullinan south africa which was irrigated with micro sprinklers the work by samani et al 2011 allowed to assess a strong relation between k c and f c the studies performed in pistachio pistacia vera l orchards measured et using swb associated with plant based measurements memmi et al 2016 and micrometeorological measurements bellvert et al 2018 the study by bellvert et al 2018 used in addition a modeling approach with vegetation indices ndvi to determine k cb the orchards were drip irrigated bellvert et al 2018 memmi et al 2016 the study of bellvert et al 2018 was based in california usa while the other was developed in ciudad real spain memmi et al 2016 k c mid values in the two examined studies presented comparable ranges in relation to the orchard age and density regarding walnuts the studies by villalobos et al 2013 brickner 2016 and fulton et al 2017 are proposed for updating the crop coefficients the study by villalobos et al 2013 recurs to a sap flow technique compensation heat pulse to measure tree transpiration along the mid season thus allowing to estimate the k cb mid value in the study by fulton et al 2017 multiple years of data were collected that allowed to capture the temporal dynamic of k c and have encompassed a wide range of soils cultivation practices and stages of canopy development ec and sr techniques were used to study a temporal series from 2011 to 2016 of et from two mature and one young walnut orchards orchards were irrigated with micro sprinklers and set in sacramento valley ca usa the mature orchards presented similar k c mid values in both studies the water requirements of fig trees ficus carica l were studied in brazil by andrade et al 2014 and souza et al 2014 using the swb approach in drip irrigated orchards the experiment presented by andrade et al 2014 consisted of two irrigation treatments with different watering frequencies scheduled to avoid water stress the k c mid resulted higher for the high irrigation frequency kanety et al 2014 reported the only work available for persimmon diospyros kaki l the study was performed in drip irrigated orchards located in israel the study employed sap flow measurements to measure crop transpiration and thus to estimate k cb the k c value was derived from modeled k e three works focused on the evaluation of pomegranate punica granatum l water requirements intrigliolo et al 2011 ayars et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the study by intrigliolo et al 2011 used a combined methodology of leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange to estimate crop et while the other two studies used weighing lysimeters to determine crop et the studies were performed in drip irrigated orchards located in alicante spain intrigliolo et al 2011 and in california usa ayars et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the article by zhang et al 2017 refers to a three years study in two orchards the studies on pomegranate reported k c values that were strongly related with f c 4 4 tropical and subtropical fruit crops a small number of papers reporting k c k cb values for tropical fruit trees were found in the literature see table 4 two studies were considered on avocado persea americana mill the first developed in florida kiggundu et al 2012 and the second in south africa mazhawu et al 2018 two different approaches were used to measure crop et one study used the swb kiggundu et al 2012 while the other used ec mazhawu et al 2018 in both studies the orchards were irrigated with micro sprinkler system k c mid values are very distinct which may relate with the age of the orchard plant density and tree height all the studies on banana musa were carried out in brazil the methodology used to determine et c was the soil water balance for all studies which was associated with drainage lysimeters in the study by conceição et al 2018 drip irrigation was used in three studies figueiredo et al 2006 montenegro et al 2008 conceição et al 2018 and micro sprinkler irrigation in two bassoi et al 2004 montenegro et al 2008 all the studies reported very similar k c mid values only a study was available for cactus pear opuntia ficus indica l mill consoli et al 2013 which was performed in an orchard in sicily italy crop et c act was measured using the sr method rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 and durán zuazo et al 2019b studied cherimoya annona cherimola mill water requirements in the same experimental farm granada spain and with the same methodology both studies used the swb approach combining drainage lysimeters with soil moisture measurements the trees were mature planted in terraces and irrigated with a drip system the estimated k c confirmed that for cherimoya trees the values are well replicated under similar field conditions and biophysical characteristics the two studies on coconut cocus nucifera l were carried out in brazil using swb miranda et al 2007 and weighing lysimeters sousa et al 2011 both studies reported the same k c values even if referred to different irrigation method micro sprinkler and drip irrigation respectively in miranda et al 2007 and sousa et al 2011 the studies on coffee coffea spp were carried out in brazil the breb and sf methods were used by marin et al 2005 to calculate et c while the remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal was employed by costa et al 2019 drip marin et al 2005 and central pivot irrigation costa et al 2019 were used differences in the reported k c values were coherent with the crop age planting density and irrigation system used only k cb mid values were reported in marin et al 2005 which evidenced two behaviors depending on et o rates with lower k cb values associated with high et o rates 4 mm d 1 while higher k cb values were obtained when et o is low 2 mm d 1 these results may be attributed to differences in the stomatal adjustment of the coffee plant the studies on date palm phoenix dactylifera l were conducted in israel sperling et al 2014 and california usa montazar et al 2020 sperling et al 2014 used weighing lysimeters to calculate the k c of drip irrigated date palms with water of different salinity levels however only the k c value corresponding to the treatment without salinity stress was selected montazar et al 2020 used a combination of sr and ec techniques to measure et c in commercial mature date palms the orchard was irrigated by drip system and occasionally with surface irrigation there are two studies teixeira et al 2003 singh et al 2007a focused on measuring et c act and deriving k c values for guava psidium guajava l the study of teixeira et al 2003 was carried out in petrolina brazil in a micro sprinkler irrigated guava orchard where crop et was measured using the breb method singh et al 2007a conducted their study in west bengal india in guava orchards under drip irrigation and plastic mulch conditions the k c values were based on unpublished reports and local studies conducted in india singh et al 2007a reported lower k c than teixeira et al 2003 which may be due to the reduction of soil evaporation derived from the plastic mulch two studies determined the jujube ziziphus jujuba mill water requirements hu et al 2012 determined the k c of jujube using swb in a drip irrigated orchard located in the loess plateau of china sun et al 2012 study was performed in north china plain in a furrow irrigated jujube mature orchard where crop et was obtained from the sum of the sf and micro lysimeters measurements the different k c values between studies are coherent with the crop age and planting density the studies performed for mango mangifera indica l used diverse methods to estimate crop et teixeira et al 2008 used breb azevedo et al 2003 and levin et al 2018 used swb while rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 and durán zuazo et al 2019a used drainage lysimeters localized irrigation methods were used in all studies two studies were developed in petrolina brazil azevedo et al 2003 teixeira et al 2008 two in granada spain rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2011 durán zuazo et al 2019a and one in israel levin et al 2018 the highest k c mid value of the set of studies was reported by teixeira et al 2008 in a low density orchard with the tallest more vigorous trees the studies on papaya carica papaya l et reported in the literature were performed along one season in la habana cuba and used the swb approach in an orchard irrigated with drip irrigation chaterlán et al 2012a b the same experimental data were used in both studies to calibrate and validate swb models allowing to derive the papaya crop coefficients one model adopts the single crop coefficient approach winisareg and the other uses the dual crop coefficient approach simdualk c thus allowing to determine both k c and k cb values 5 indicative standard k c and k cb values ranges of values for experimental data of standard crop coefficients k c and k cb based on the literature reported in the previous section are presented in tables 5 to 8 for vine fruit crops berries and hops temperate climate evergreen fruit trees temperate climate deciduous fruit tree crops and tropical and subtropical fruit crops respectively these tables also present previously published k c and k cb information for the same crops from fao56 allen et al 1998 computed from the fraction of ground cover and height with the approach proposed by allen and pereira 2009 as well as the more recent update provided by jensen and allen 2016 indicative updated values of the crop coefficients k c mid k c end k cb mid and k cb end were obtained from the observed values and those proposed in the referred studies and are tabulated in the same tables 5 to 8 following the simplified procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 the computation of the indicative updated values of k c mid for all trees and vines resulted from adding 0 05 to k cb mid this approach is due to the fact that for all orchards it was considered that drip irrigation systems are generally used thus with a small fraction of soil wetted by irrigation and mostly under the shadow of the canopies then only a limited amount of energy reaches the soil surface thus limiting soil water evaporation a diverse approach was used for k c end values because the added value to k cb end varied in the range 0 05 0 40 according to the f c value and the probability of occurrence of precipitation events by the end season when k cb mid and or k cb end were not available they were computed from k c mid and or k c end by subtracting the same amounts further explanation is provided for each type of orchard due to the wide range of variability of observed k c and k cb values the indicative standard values were considered within a range of 10 when information was available k c and k cb values refer to the crop density estimated from the fraction of ground cover f c including young crops in the cases where f c was not available in the cited papers an f c indicative value for commercial orchards was retrieved from literature and the respective references are provided as table footnotes a similar procedure was followed for tree height and references used to find an indicative value are also listed in the tables footnotes for vine fruit crops and hops the management and training system was considered instead of density given the larger variability in the crop geometry and the information available k c and k cb for vine fruit crops in table 5 include table grapes wine grapes kiwi highbush blueberries and hop for table grapes five different management and training classes were considered young overhead trellis horizontal trellis t trellis and y shape gable y trellis the collected k c mid and k c end information for young plantations indicated higher values than those previously reported but the standard values do not reflect that increase since the information available was not enough to support an alteration for overhead trellis system reported data for k c confirmed previous tabulated data and were therefore kept within those ranges k cb mid reported data were lower than previously tabulated data and the indicative standard value chosen is below the range higher limit data on previous standard values was inexistent for the horizontal trellis and y gable system y trellis systems therefore new indicative values were set based on reported data and bearing in mind the new indicative values for other training classes maintaining a 5 10 difference the t trellis system had only a reported value for k c mid and this was used to adjust a lower standard value and the remnant coefficients for this class were set accordingly table grape crops tend to have higher density and vigor than wine grape crops which reflects on higher standard k c and k cb values for table grapes for wine grapes trained with vertical shoot positioned trellis vsp systems the reported data confirmed the previously tabulated values with a slight increase in k cb end hence indicative values were set accordingly scarce information was found for the pergola system and only for k cb mid and k cb end indicating lower values than the ones previously tabulated this was accounted for in the new indicative values for guyot there was no previous information and only a reported value in literature thus indicative values were set according to those of the other systems and crop geometry as previously pointed out the indicative standard values of k c mid and k cb mid for both wine and grape wine table 5 differ by 0 05 while k c end and k cb end differed by 0 10 when f c 0 30 otherwise by 0 05 information from literature was available for kiwi relative to k cb mid while k c mid and k cb mid values were available in allen et al 1998 allowing to set indicative standard values for the mid season standard values for the end season were based on common values found for vines and on the crop characteristics for example k c end for kiwi pergola system is close to k c mid considering that harvesting occurs during the rainy season hence the soil surface is often wetted by rainfall thus allowing to maintain a high k c value regarding k cb end there is a slight difference relative to k cb mid since leaves are starting to senesce table 5 presents k c data for berries and hop based on the collected data and on the information from allen et al 1998 and jensen and allen 2016 standard k c mid for berries was set at 0 95 high density resulting from the experimental values k c end k cb mid and k cb end were retrieved from previous tabulated information since no newly reported data existed for other densities no previous information was available and crop coefficients were set based on density differences collected values of k c mid and k c end for hop were identical to those found in allen et al 1998 therefore these values were kept collected value of k cb mid for hop was slightly lower than those found in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 therefore indicative value was also slightly decreased the value for k cb end was similar to previous tabulated value and therefore was kept standard k c and k cb values for temperate climate evergreen fruit tree crops table 6 include citrus and olive crops for young citrus plantations no information was found in literature and therefore previously tabulated values were considered to establish new indicative values although following a water conservation perspective since irrigation systems for this crop as well as for other crops have often evolved to localized irrigation systems mirrored by a decrease in indicated crop coefficients low density citrus orchards presented reported values somehow higher than standard ones and this was taken in account in indicative values for medium density short h 3 5 m citrus orchards the collected k c mid was lower than the ones reported in allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 thus the new indicative standard value was defined adopting the lower value in this range no information existed on previous tabulated values k c for medium density tall h 3 5 m citrus orchards a new indicative standard value was set considering a reported value and differences of 5 10 among the various classes this last procedure was adopted for k cb mid k c end and k cb end whenever previous tabulated information was not available for high density standard k c mid was set to 0 70 short trees orchards and to 0 90 tall trees orchards according to observed or observed tabulated information respectively a similar approach was followed for k cb mid k c end and k cb end citrus species are evergreen presenting a similar foliage and ground cover in the mid and the end of the cycle which originates close values of k c mid and k c end and also k cb mid and k cb end for every density for citrus differences between k c end and k cb end are different from the previously tabulated values because it is expected that wetting events by precipitation occur by the end season k c end value was obtained by adding a specific value to k cb end which ranged 0 10 0 25 the specific value added decreased with f c thus a value of 0 25 was used for the young orchards and it decreased to 0 10 in case of the high density orchards for olive the four crop systems considered were young traditional intensive and super intensive young and traditional systems have the smallest tree density and lower f c originating lower k c and k cb when compared with the other systems the collected data for traditional olive orchards showed values of k c mid reaching a maximum of 0 65 which is larger than the k c mid indicated in allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the value of k c mid for olive orchards with traditional systems medium density was then updated to 0 45 no observed data for k c end and k cb end was available in the literature for this kind of systems and new values were set considering differences of 5 10 to adjacent classes the newly reported value of k cb mid for these traditional systems 0 59 medium density is higher than those previously reported 0 35 by allen and pereira 2009 and by jensen and allen 2016 so standard k cb mid was set to 0 40 intensive olive orchards have higher tree density than traditional orchards and it was expected that they would have higher k c values this was not confirmed for k c mid as a lower collected value was retrieved also non concordant with prior information given the special characteristics of hedgerow olive orchards in what concerns canopy shape height and spacing k c and k cb values were supposed to be larger in comparison with the other two systems this was confirmed with collected data for k c mid and k cb mid for most of the olive systems standard values for k c end are higher than k c mid as retrieved by the collected information since the end season occurs during the rainy season in the mediterranean climate types thus when soil evaporation contribution to et is high and consequently k c increases thus differences between the indicative standard values of k c end and k cb end range 0 35 0 40 depending on the f c of the orchard table 7 presents information on temperate climate deciduous fruit tree crops including stone fruit trees apricot cherry plum and peach pome fruit trees apple and pear nut trees almond hazelnut pecan pistachio and walnut and other fruit trees such as fig tree persimmon and pomegranate collected information for this group is abundant mainly for k c mid although not covering all the densities as for low density orchards new information on the k c mid and k cb mid values for a first group of stone fruit trees apricot cherry and plum was only available for very high density orchards and only one value of k cb mid for high density and provided a range of values slightly lower 0 95 1 20 than those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the standard k c mid was then set to 1 05 for other density classes information was only available from the referred studies and in allen et al 1998 thus the standard values were established considering these previous studies a similar procedure was followed to set standard k cb mid k c end and k cb end a similar approach was followed for peach although more information was available for young apple orchards values for crop coefficients were set with small differences to low density plantations for low density observed values of k c mid were smaller than the ones found in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 but an indicative standard value was derived from those tabulated bearing in mind orchard characteristics and differences to other density classes since reported information was scarce k c end was derived from previously tabulated values except for high and very high density orchards where literature data were used to establish the indicative values for medium density orchards the standard k cb mid value decreased compared to the previously indicated by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 given the literature collected k cb values the same occurred for high and very high density apple orchards where a standard value for k c mid is smaller based on the values retrieved from experimental studies the differences between k c end and k cb end values were 0 10 or 0 05 according to the f c values with higher values for the lower f c which corresponded to the young and low density orchards data collected in literature relative to k c mid of low density pears orchards was higher than previously tabulated values but the new indicative values do not reflect this change since related information is scarce in case of the medium density orchards k c mid values collected in literature and previously tabulated allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 were close therefore standard values were similar to the existing information for high density orchards the k c mid values reported in literature were lower than those in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 thus the standard k c mid values were lowered to accommodate this difference there was no collected information available for k c end and k cb end thus the standard value was derived from previous tabulated data allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 for nut trees no information was found for young orchards from collected information in literature relative to low medium and high densities of almond orchards only information on k cb was available to update the previously tabulated values allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 which were taken into account to set the updated indicative values standard values were retained for k c mid considering the values for other classes very high density orchards presented higher k c mid and similar k cb mid and k c end as compared to previously tabulated values differences between k c mid and k cb mid values for all the nut tree orchards were assumed equal to 0 05 while for k c end and k cb end differences range 0 10 to 0 05 with the highest value for young and low density orchards as well as in a few cases of medium density orchards when the expected wetting events by precipitation are high during the end season collected k c values in literature for hazelnut were available for low and high densities and a reported k c mid was found for a low density orchard since no prior information from tabulated values existed the experimentally derived k c and k cb values were used to support setting the new indicative values for pecan orchards there was no prior tabulated information on k c and k cb thus the indicative standard values were derived from ranges given in literature for low to high densities considering the growth habits and the crop cycle as a deciduous tree k c end and k cb end present an evident decrease since the plants senesce during the late season stage no information was found for young plantations of pistachio as well as relative to low and medium densities hence standard values were set from the values previously tabulated allen and pereira 2009 jensen and allen 2016 bearing in mind the new values reported in literature for high density orchards for high density pistachio plantations the collected values for k c mid were close to those previously tabulated leading to similar indicative values for walnut orchards with young trees or low to medium densities there was little or no information reported in literature therefore the indicative crop coefficient values were established mostly based on previous information crop characteristics and maintaining reasonable differences to high and very high density orchard k c k cb values for high density walnut orchards collected k c mid values were slightly lower than the ones previously tabulated and the k c mid indicative values reflect this trend the indicative standard k c end value results from the combination between the previously tabulated value with the lower value collected from the literature for very high density orchards there was no prior tabulated information and new indicative values were set based on literature reported values one of the least documented crops is the fig tree with literature data available only for k c mid and without previously tabulated information new values for k c mid k c end k cb mid and k cb end are suggested based on observations and for k cb bearing in mind that fig are deciduous trees and that tree spacing tends to be large similar situation in terms of available data was found for persimmon where only k c mid and k cb mid values for medium density orchards are reported in literature indicative values were provided based on these values and on the crop characteristics for pomegranate there was no previous tabulated information but it was possible to collect k c mid for all densities and k c end for the high density orchards the standard k c mid value for all densities resulted from the corresponding adjustment there was no new literature information on k cb and in this case standard values adopted were set bearing in mind expected differences relative to k c taking into consideration the diverse crop density classes table 8 presents updated indicative values of crop coefficients for tropical and sub tropical fruit crops avocado banana cherimoya coconut coffee date palm guava mango and papaya for mango and avocado collected data refer only to k c for high and medium density because there was no information available for low densities therefore standard k c values for low densities were set based on what was suggested by allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 for k cb no reported values were available in literature for both crops for the first cycle of the banana crop k c mid values collected in literature were slightly lower than the ones reported in allen et al 1998 and in jensen and allen 2016 thus the standard value was slightly decreased the standard k cb end value was set to a lower value than in allen et al 1998 in fact a decrease in k cb by the end season is in agreement with the status of the crop in that stage when leaf senescence occurs and harvest is performed from the first cycle to the second cycle plant canopy shadow decreases due to a higher spacing between plants thus soil evaporation increases inducing larger values for k c and k cb in the second cycle collected k c mid values were somewhat smaller than those presented in allen et al 1998 and therefore the respective consolidate values were set to reflect this fact no observed values were found for k cb thus standard values were determined to bear in mind the information in allen et al 1998 and the occurrence of leaf senescence by the end of the cycle information collected from literature on k cb mid was more limited and only available for coffee and papaya high density plantations k cb value for coffee collected from literature was lower than the tabulated by allen et al 1998 but the standard k c mid was set equal to that previous one as reported information is scarce for k c mid reported values helped fixing indicative values considering the different density classes and crop ground cover and height only a small difference for k c or k cb values between the mid and end seasons is expected because at the end of the cycle the plant does not have a significantly different foliar coverage compared with the mid season standard k c and k cb for papaya were set based on newly collected information since no prior data existed the same occurred for cactus pear but existing information was not considered sufficient to derive indicative standard values the cherimoya crop had no prior tabulated information but new collected values could be considered to set the standard ones the same procedure was used with guava to set standard values for k c for k cb as no information at all existed standard values were set considering those for k c and the crop characteristics cherimoya is a briefly deciduous plant but most evergreen and guava is evergreen therefore lower k c end and k cb end for cherimoya were considered the k c values collected in literature relative to coconut orchards were similar to those previously reported in allen et al 1998 no other information was available in literature thus the new standard values were kept within the range previously established information on k cb was available in allen et al 1998 and this was used as the standard value the collected k c values for date palm are somewhat lower than those presented in previously tabulated information accordingly new indicative standard values were set to lower values no k cb data could be retrieved from literature and new standard values were set considering previous information data collection evidenced that field derived crop coefficients k c and k cb as reported in the literature are fairly variable among species and for the same tree or vine crop thus making it difficult to define standard k c and k cb for each crop likely the large range of data observed in the literature is linked to several factors such as crop variety climate effects the method used to determine crop et crop spacing soil type and soil management irrigation method and scheduling crop age and agronomic practices moreover crop density represented by the fraction of ground cover and crop training plays a major role as indicated by the former studies where k cb and k c were computed from the fraction of ground cover nevertheless literature is often scarce in providing related information despite crop density and training are changing in recent times due to the mechanization of orchard operations which includes pruning and harvesting all the factors referred above led to setting k c and k cb values considering an interval of 10 relative to the indicative values provided 6 conclusions and future perspectives the present study gathered information from field research performed using the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 for deriving the crop coefficients of fruit trees and vines over the past twenty years this information was used to update the values of single k c and basal k cb crop coefficients previously tabulated in fao56 the k c and k cb values retained in this review were obtained in field studies that used the fao56 grass reference et o equation the accuracy of et c estimates was assured by selecting only studies that employed well designed and performed field studies such as eddy covariance sap flow soil water balance approaches and lysimetry conditions for transferability of reported data were therefore assumed nevertheless because studies for the same crop are quite different in terms of crop varieties crop and irrigation management rainfall amounts and timings and field methods there is a great variability of reported k c and k cb for the same crop and similar training systems and fractions of ground cover it was therefore necessary to assume that tabulated values are indicative and vary in a range of approximately 10 which is referred in the tables users may therefore select a larger or small value than the tabulated ones single values for k c and k cb were provided in fao56 for most crops corresponding to the most common crop system management in the current review considering the wide range of plants density f c and h as well as the tabulation of values according to f c as adopted in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 the indicative standard tabulated k c and k cb values are assigned to various categories related with crop density young orchard and low density and medium high and very high densities ranges of f c and h characterize those densities that categorization for vine fruit crops was mainly related with the training systems the presently tabulated indicative values for k c and k cb agree with those tabulated in fao56 but have the advantage of being tied to the crop density and training system particularly with the fraction of ground cover this allows users to select the indicative values according to the conditions prevailing in the considered orchards and vines the current review allowed to propose indicative k c and k cb values for several fruit crops that were not considered in fao56 nor in other previous publications e g hazelnut pecan fig persimmon pomegranate as well as a few tropical fruit crops such as cherimoya guava mango and papaya therefore favorable conditions are created to better using the k c et o method to compute crop water requirements of trees and vines as proposed in fao56 the use of tabulated k c and k cb values is appropriate for a variety of applications such as irrigation scheduling in planning irrigation namely using water balance or water yield models the current review revealed that many k c research studies not retained but published did not report about the quality of input and output data or reported very high k c values which were not justified by the local climate but could result from advection and or inaccuracies in field measurements and data handling it is therefore recommended that appropriate scrutiny of results be commonly adopted from planning to end of experiments and data handling the quality of research results is very important to base new approaches that may lead to improved production and resource conservation the review has shown that only few studies used appropriately calibrated and validated swb simulation models despite their use eases to derive standard k c and k cb values including when water stress is greater than the reasonable eustress it is recommended that more research is performed using swb models in searching k c and k cb as well as for irrigation management purposes the incorporation of remote sensing and big data in such modeling is a recommended area of research moreover the use of forecasted weather data is also recommended aiming at real time irrigation scheduling the impacts of active ground cover cover crops and mulches on k c and k cb values of fruit trees and vines consist of another area where further research is required it is recommended to develop research on these domains in a broader perspective of better production and resource conservation namely water saving it is important to recognize that current water scarcity and climate change call for water saving which may be achieved when adopting precision irrigation protocols namely when supported by modeling with that perspective the k c and k cb indicative values were set in a conservative way not increasing relative to the past but whenever possible decreasing since the use of drip irrigation improved soil management and an appropriate adoption of eustress management allows higher yields in a

promising one kang and zhang 2004 di is an irrigation strategy in which water is applied during drought sensitive growth stages of a crop and allows plants to tolerate or resist water stress by

were all positively correlated to k leaf table 3 titratable acid was positively correlated to tss and sugar and negatively correlated to sar vitamin c was positively correlated to sugar and acid 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deficit irrigation and k fertilization during fruit development stage on tomato quality the effects of di on tomato quality has been intensively studied and number of researchers concentrated on water management at certain critical stages chen et al 2013 nangare et al 2016 deficit irrigation di strategy promotes the carbohydrate accumulation towards to fruit and strengthens carbohydrate metabolism enzyme activities potentially increases starch degradation during fruit maturity period hence enhanced glucose and fructose accumulation in tomato fruit ruan et al 2010 ripoll et al 2014 we recorded di during fruit development had little effect on tss however it improved the concentrations of soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c in tomato fruit table 1 under di the synthesis of acid parameters including malic and citric acids could be promoted by mechanism of osmotic adjustment hou et al 2020 and related enzyme catalyzed biochemical pathways such as carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate pep decarboxylation of oxaloacetate tricarboxylic acid tca glyoxylate and carbohydrate metabolic cycle etienne et al 2013 resulting improved titratable acid content in fruit table 1 vitamin c is one of most important antioxidants of human diet and cannot be synthesized by humans thus indicating the importance of this vitamin the level of vitamin c in tomato fruit has been studied earlier and proved an important indicator for fruit quality liu et al 2016 as well as for human body jacobs et al 2002 the positive effect of di during fruit development stage on vitamin c has been observed in tomato patanè and cosentino 2010 and other plants such as pear jube cui et al 2008 vitamin c translocation from leaves to fruit in green immature tomato has been observed by badejo et al 2012 in our study di at level of 70 80 θ f w2 significantly improved fruit vitamin c content in comparison to well watered level of 80 90 θ f w1 and di level of 60 70 θ f w3 table 1 indicating the translocation of vitamin c could be strengthened under moderate deficit regime w2 additionally di strategy decreased plant leaf area which was expected to favor the accumulation of vitamin c by increasing fruit sunlight exposure massot et al 2010 however in the study di of 60 70 θ f w3 without k fertilization showed negative effect on vitamin c accumulation while vitamin c contents were improved by k fertilization table 1 the reduction of vitamin c content in tomato fruit under di i e 60 70 θ f during fruit development was previously noticed liu et al 2016 this could be related to the reduced antioxidant activity under moderate di regime peng et al 2015 meanwhile k fertilization might improve the ascorbate peroxidase apx activity in tomato fruit wu et al 2007 resulting in improved vitamin c at certain k rate k is regarded as quality element of crops as its association with superior quality which is supported by numerous researchers yang et al 2004 mehrandish et al 2012 economakis and daskalaki 2003 almeselmani et al 2010 serio et al 2007 the positive impact of k fertilization on tss and titratable acid in cocktail tomato cultivars resi primavera and yellow submarine was reported by sonntag et al 2019 and in high pigment cultivar svr and kabiria or no high pigment cultivar esperanza tomato increased k level also improved tss and titratable acid caretto 2008 in the study k fertilization at 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil k3 improved tss soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c content table 1 confirming the significance of k fertilization on fruit quality it is well accepted that sugars are basic metabolite in tomato quality predominant part of fruit tss determines flavor and other fruit quality characteristics the positive effect of k fertilization on tss observed in the study may be ascribed to its role in sucrose loading to the phloem potentiating the transport from leaves to fruit to retain the source drain coskun et al 2016 martínez andújar et al 2016 additionally our study shows that k concentration in leaf k leaf had stronger correlation to fruit quality such as soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c rather than the k concentration in fruit k fruit table 3 indicating that k leaf could be involved in the metabolic process of these metabolites 4 2 effect of deficit irrigation and k fertilization during fruit development stage on water use efficiency and k uptake in tomato plants previous study revealed that during fruit development stage tomato plants were more sensitive to water deficit than to k fertilization as during fruit development stage 80 90 θ f significantly increased tomato yield by 46 00 35 22 and 56 30 compared to di of 60 70 θ f at three k fertilization levels respectively while k fertilization had no significant effect on tomato yield liu et al 2019 fruit development stage is the period that fruit enlarge quickly and the period that plant has high demand on water in our study the water use intensity during fruit development stage and total water use during the whole growth period for di such as 60 70 θ f w3 treated plants were both significantly decreased compared to those of well watered w1 plants fig 1 di of 60 70 θ f during fruit development stage not only depressed cell multiplication and expansion but also inhibited fruit setting and development of the upper cluster of fruit resulting in reduced yield liu et al 2019 hereby harvest index hi table 2 in current study k fertilization had no effect on plant dry mass dm and water use efficiency wue which were both reduced by di table 2 indicating sufficient water supply during this stage was critical to accumulating assimilates and improving plant wue recently in cocktail tomato cultivar sonntag et al 2019 found yield was cultivar and k fertilization dependent and daoud et al 2020 further reported agronomic wue based on biomass and fruit yield ameliorated with k fertilization rage of 0 5 4 0 g plant 1 in primavera and significantly higher than that in yellow submarine in our study tomato jinpeng 10 is a hybrid cultivar and the k fertilization was 7 63 0 46 g k2o kg 1 soil to 15 26 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil g plant 1 for plants applied with k far more than the mentioned rage of 0 5 4 0 g plant 1 excessive k supply could increase rhizosphere s osmotic concentration compared to that in root cell which inhibited water uptake and its use efficiency daoud et al 2020 what s more excessive k fertilization could lead to calcium ca deficiency in tomato plants due to antagonism between k and ca jakobsen 1993 which leaded to blossom end rot and decreased yield liu et al 2011 thus we concluded that the difference in change of yield and wue to k fertilization could be cultivar specific and k fertilization rate k is an element which is needed by all kinds of plants k concentration in fruit leaf stem and root were not affected by di while significantly improved by k fertilization during fruit development stage fig 2 we noticed the interaction of k fertilization and di was significant detailly k fertilization of 0 46 g k2o kg 1 soil k2 significantly improved fruit k concentration k fruit at three soil moisture levels and 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil k3 improved k fruit only at 60 70 θ f w1 fig 2a in cocktail tomato the improved k fruit by k fertilization was also reported by sonntag et al 2019 and daoud et al 2020 and the improvement of k fruit was limited mainly due to the accumulation of k in fruit reaching the maximum threshold at the optimal k supply thus excessive k supply had no further effect daoud et al 2020 these findings are comparable to the study of hartz et al 2005 as they found k fruit was not k fertilization dependent but cultivar specific on the other hand the concentrations of k in leaf stem and root were significantly improved by the increased k fertilization rate figs 2b 2d well in accordance with the findings by daoud et al 2020 fig s5 tomato fruit possessed the highest dry mass matter and k concentration compared to other tissues thus resulting the highest k accumulation in tomato fruit fig 2 and fig 3 this was due to that the translocation of k absorbed by roots was mainly towards to fruit zhu et al 2017 conclusively our results on the response of fruit quality and k uptake to k fertilization could be transferred to other tomato cultivars while the response of wue and k fruit to k fertilization could be cultivar specific 5 conclusion fruit quality including soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c content were improved by deficit irrigation and increased k fertilization during fruit development stage and these were positively correlated to k concentration in leaf plant wue in 80 90 θ f treated plants was the highest producing the highest dry mass even with the most water use indicating sufficient irrigation regime during fruit development stage is essential for improving plant wue k fertilization enhanced k concentration and k accumulation in each tissue hereby increased total k uptake while decreased kue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10112,a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of potassium k fertilization on tomato quality plant k uptake water and k use efficiency wue and kue under deficit irrigation regime during fruit development stage of the first cluster of fruit irrigation regimes were comprised of three levels i e 80 90 field capacity θ f w1 70 80 θ f w2 and 60 70 θ f w3 and k fertilization rates were also consisted of three different rates i e 0 g k2o kg 1 soil k1 0 46 g k2o kg 1 soil k2 and 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil k3 the result showed that deficit irrigation as well as increased k fertilization significantly improved quality of fruit where soluble sugar titratable acid and content of vitamin c were positively correlated to k concentration of leaf k leaf indicating that k leaf may have a role to improve fruit quality the highest plant wue was observed in w1 plants which consumed the most water and produced the highest dry mass k fertilization had no effect on wue based on biomass but had positive effect on k concentration and k accumulation in each tissue hereby increased total k uptake while decreased kue keywords deficit irrigation potassium fertilization fruit development quality

hartz et al 2005 irrigation is essential in agriculture activity to guarantee crop yield especially in arid and semiarid areas however water resources are limited and it is predicted that around 50 of global population would live in water scarce regions by 2050 koncagül et al 2018 many irrigation strategies have been developed to cope with water scarcity where deficit irrigation di proved a promising one kang and zhang 2004 di is an irrigation strategy in which water is applied during drought sensitive growth stages of a crop and allows plants to tolerate or resist water stress by reducing irrigation during the entire crop cycle or by withdrawing irrigation at certain stages and it is an efficient approach to improve plant water use efficiency wue and quality with acceptable reduction in yield kang and zhang 2004 du and kang 2011 sun et al 2014 di during fruit development period could enhance accumulation of glucose and fructose in tomato fruit ripoll et al 2014 and di at fruit maturity period could obviously improve tss yang et al 2016 chen et al 2013 patanè and cosentino 2010 the mechanisms by which di increased the tss in tomato fruit referred to a the increase of

were all positively correlated to k leaf table 3 titratable acid was positively correlated to tss and sugar and negatively correlated to sar vitamin c was positively correlated to sugar and acid 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deficit irrigation and k fertilization during fruit development stage on tomato quality the effects of di on tomato quality has been intensively studied and number of researchers concentrated on water management at certain critical stages chen et al 2013 nangare et al 2016 deficit irrigation di strategy promotes the carbohydrate accumulation towards to fruit and strengthens carbohydrate metabolism enzyme activities potentially increases starch degradation during fruit maturity period hence enhanced glucose and fructose accumulation in tomato fruit ruan et al 2010 ripoll et al 2014 we recorded di during fruit development had little effect on tss however it improved the concentrations of soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c in tomato fruit table 1 under di the synthesis of acid parameters including malic and citric acids could be promoted by mechanism of osmotic adjustment hou et al 2020 and related enzyme catalyzed biochemical pathways such as carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate pep decarboxylation of oxaloacetate tricarboxylic acid tca glyoxylate and carbohydrate metabolic cycle etienne et al 2013 resulting improved titratable acid content in fruit table 1 vitamin c is one of most important antioxidants of human diet and cannot be synthesized by humans thus indicating the importance of this vitamin the level of vitamin c in tomato fruit has been studied earlier and proved an important indicator for fruit quality liu et al 2016 as well as for human body jacobs et al 2002 the positive effect of di during fruit development stage on vitamin c has been observed in tomato patanè and cosentino 2010 and other plants such as pear jube cui et al 2008 vitamin c translocation from leaves to fruit in green immature tomato has been observed by badejo et al 2012 in our study di at level of 70 80 θ f w2 significantly improved fruit vitamin c content in comparison to well watered level of 80 90 θ f w1 and di level of 60 70 θ f w3 table 1 indicating the translocation of vitamin c could be strengthened under moderate deficit regime w2 additionally di strategy decreased plant leaf area which was expected to favor the accumulation of vitamin c by increasing fruit sunlight exposure massot et al 2010 however in the study di of 60 70 θ f w3 without k fertilization showed negative effect on vitamin c accumulation while vitamin c contents were improved by k fertilization table 1 the reduction of vitamin c content in tomato fruit under di i e 60 70 θ f during fruit development was previously noticed liu et al 2016 this could be related to the reduced antioxidant activity under moderate di regime peng et al 2015 meanwhile k fertilization might improve the ascorbate peroxidase apx activity in tomato fruit wu et al 2007 resulting in improved vitamin c at certain k rate k is regarded as quality element of crops as its association with superior quality which is supported by numerous researchers yang et al 2004 mehrandish et al 2012 economakis and daskalaki 2003 almeselmani et al 2010 serio et al 2007 the positive impact of k fertilization on tss and titratable acid in cocktail tomato cultivars resi primavera and yellow submarine was reported by sonntag et al 2019 and in high pigment cultivar svr and kabiria or no high pigment cultivar esperanza tomato increased k level also improved tss and titratable acid caretto 2008 in the study k fertilization at 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil k3 improved tss soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c content table 1 confirming the significance of k fertilization on fruit quality it is well accepted that sugars are basic metabolite in tomato quality predominant part of fruit tss determines flavor and other fruit quality characteristics the positive effect of k fertilization on tss observed in the study may be ascribed to its role in sucrose loading to the phloem potentiating the transport from leaves to fruit to retain the source drain coskun et al 2016 martínez andújar et al 2016 additionally our study shows that k concentration in leaf k leaf had stronger correlation to fruit quality such as soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c rather than the k concentration in fruit k fruit table 3 indicating that k leaf could be involved in the metabolic process of these metabolites 4 2 effect of deficit irrigation and k fertilization during fruit development stage on water use efficiency and k uptake in tomato plants previous study revealed that during fruit development stage tomato plants were more sensitive to water deficit than to k fertilization as during fruit development stage 80 90 θ f significantly increased tomato yield by 46 00 35 22 and 56 30 compared to di of 60 70 θ f at three k fertilization levels respectively while k fertilization had no significant effect on tomato yield liu et al 2019 fruit development stage is the period that fruit enlarge quickly and the period that plant has high demand on water in our study the water use intensity during fruit development stage and total water use during the whole growth period for di such as 60 70 θ f w3 treated plants were both significantly decreased compared to those of well watered w1 plants fig 1 di of 60 70 θ f during fruit development stage not only depressed cell multiplication and expansion but also inhibited fruit setting and development of the upper cluster of fruit resulting in reduced yield liu et al 2019 hereby harvest index hi table 2 in current study k fertilization had no effect on plant dry mass dm and water use efficiency wue which were both reduced by di table 2 indicating sufficient water supply during this stage was critical to accumulating assimilates and improving plant wue recently in cocktail tomato cultivar sonntag et al 2019 found yield was cultivar and k fertilization dependent and daoud et al 2020 further reported agronomic wue based on biomass and fruit yield ameliorated with k fertilization rage of 0 5 4 0 g plant 1 in primavera and significantly higher than that in yellow submarine in our study tomato jinpeng 10 is a hybrid cultivar and the k fertilization was 7 63 0 46 g k2o kg 1 soil to 15 26 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil g plant 1 for plants applied with k far more than the mentioned rage of 0 5 4 0 g plant 1 excessive k supply could increase rhizosphere s osmotic concentration compared to that in root cell which inhibited water uptake and its use efficiency daoud et al 2020 what s more excessive k fertilization could lead to calcium ca deficiency in tomato plants due to antagonism between k and ca jakobsen 1993 which leaded to blossom end rot and decreased yield liu et al 2011 thus we concluded that the difference in change of yield and wue to k fertilization could be cultivar specific and k fertilization rate k is an element which is needed by all kinds of plants k concentration in fruit leaf stem and root were not affected by di while significantly improved by k fertilization during fruit development stage fig 2 we noticed the interaction of k fertilization and di was significant detailly k fertilization of 0 46 g k2o kg 1 soil k2 significantly improved fruit k concentration k fruit at three soil moisture levels and 0 92 g k2o kg 1 soil k3 improved k fruit only at 60 70 θ f w1 fig 2a in cocktail tomato the improved k fruit by k fertilization was also reported by sonntag et al 2019 and daoud et al 2020 and the improvement of k fruit was limited mainly due to the accumulation of k in fruit reaching the maximum threshold at the optimal k supply thus excessive k supply had no further effect daoud et al 2020 these findings are comparable to the study of hartz et al 2005 as they found k fruit was not k fertilization dependent but cultivar specific on the other hand the concentrations of k in leaf stem and root were significantly improved by the increased k fertilization rate figs 2b 2d well in accordance with the findings by daoud et al 2020 fig s5 tomato fruit possessed the highest dry mass matter and k concentration compared to other tissues thus resulting the highest k accumulation in tomato fruit fig 2 and fig 3 this was due to that the translocation of k absorbed by roots was mainly towards to fruit zhu et al 2017 conclusively our results on the response of fruit quality and k uptake to k fertilization could be transferred to other tomato cultivars while the response of wue and k fruit to k fertilization could be cultivar specific 5 conclusion fruit quality including soluble sugar titratable acid and vitamin c content were improved by deficit irrigation and increased k fertilization during fruit development stage and these were positively correlated to k concentration in leaf plant wue in 80 90 θ f treated plants was the highest producing the highest dry mass even with the most water use indicating sufficient irrigation regime during fruit development stage is essential for improving plant wue k fertilization enhanced k concentration and k accumulation in each tissue hereby increased total k uptake while decreased kue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10113,the trend of secondary soil salinization has been increasingly concerned in the arid region under drip irrigation in recent decades in china it remains unclear whether the potential increasing nonuniformity of irrigation water aroused by the increased acreage of subunit leads to salt harmfulness and yield reduction cotton field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the effects of lateral length on the distribution of water and salt in soil as well as lint yield under mulched drip irrigation to identify the dominating factors using the random forest regression three lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m were used along with a trigger point of 60 70 of field capacity fc irrigation amount was determined using three irrigation upper limits of 90 100 and 110 of fc in the 2018 and of 90 110 and 130 of fc in the 2019 the random forest analysis revealed that the nonuniform water applied by drip irrigation greatly affected the distribution of soil water content with an affecting weight exceeding 0 4 however it imposed little impact on soil salt content along the lateral with the affecting weights less than 0 1 the relative importance of spatial variation of soil properties on soil water content decreased with increasing lateral length while the nonuniformly applied water became the dominant factor affecting the distribution of soil water content for a field with lateral length of 120 m the initial soil salt content dominated the spatial and temporal variation of soil salt content for treatments with all the three lengths of lateral the long lateral did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth along the lateral the cumulative irrigation water and nitrogen applied imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than other factors a medium lateral length is a promising selection to maintain sustainable production balancing possible salt accumulation and crop production in arid lands with relatively low initial soil salt content keywords microirrigation fertigation uniformity lateral length random forest method 1 introduction water scarcity and secondary soil salinization are two main obstacles to the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions assouline et al 2015 minhas et al 2020 drip irrigation under mulch has been widely used to alleviate the water scarcity in these regions due to its high water use efficiency li et al 2019 mansour et al 2019 however the characteristics of drip irrigation with less quota and more frequent application might lead to an unguaranteed salt leaching resulting in salt accumulation in the root zone at the end of cotton growth season liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014a with the development of intensive agriculture in recent years an individual drip irrigation system controlling considerably large area e g thousands of acres is becoming more and more common in the arid region of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china large irrigation units with long laterals becomes prevailing to reduce installation and operational costs a long lateral normally created low drip irrigation uniformity due to head loss wu 1992 sadeghi et al 2015 in semi humid regions drip irrigation uniformity imposed insignificant effect on crop growth and dynamic of soil water and nitrogen li et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 wang et al 2014b however guan et al 2013a 2013b revealed a significant effect on cotton yield and insignificant influence on soil salinity imposed by drip system uniformity when 50 m lateral length was used to irrigate non salinized field with fresh water nevertheless further research was needed to confirm whether nonuniform application of irrigation water and fertilizers resulted from long laterals lead to an increasing risk of soil salinization and the reduction of crop yield in regions with lots of salt in soil parent material the variability in soil properties usually increased the unevenness of water and nutrient applied by drip irrigation system thus affecting crop yield li et al 2011 usowicz and lipiec 2017 due to the soil spatial variability the uniformity of soil water content nitrogen content and soil bulk electrical conductivity were relatively lower than the uniformity of water and fertilizers applied for a system with high uniformity li et al 2012 however the attenuation of nonuniform distribution of water and nutrients in soil and yield imposed by soil variability had also been reported when system uniformity was considerably low wang et al 2013 the dynamics of water nutrient and salt in soil and distribution of crop yield are likely to be non linearly affected by irrigation fertigation and soil spatial variability in the farmland stronger soil spatial variability may exist in a field with long laterals however few attempts have been made to analyze the coupling effect of nonuniformly applied water and fertilizers and soil spatial variability on the distribution of water and salt in soil when long laterals are used the statistical method of multiple linear regression is widely used to determine the linear relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables because of its simple structure and strong explanation thompson et al 2006 however it can hardly be used for nonlinear system involving multiple influencing factors random forest regression rfr is not affected by multicollinearity when handling complex interactions among variables with data unnecessarily to obey a specific probability distribution cutler et al 2007 breiman 2001 rfr is thus superior to multiple linear regression and appropriate for illustrating the nonlinear effect of variables aditi et al 2020 moreover rfr can quantitatively assess the relative importance of explanatory variables on dependent variable cutler et al 2011 akpa et al 2014 sreenivas et al 2014 this provides a promising approach for identifying the relative importance of various influencing factors of water and salt in soil and crop yield in a drip irrigated field the objectives of this study were to discriminate the critical influencing factors on water and salt in soil and crop yield in field with different lateral lengths using the random forest analysis and to evaluate the effects of lateral length and irrigation amount on the distribution of soil water and salt coupled with crop yield along the lateral under mulched drip irrigation in the arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the cotton field experiments were conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps 81 11 43 e 40 37 22 n altitude 1017 m above mean sea level during the cotton growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 the station is located in the plain desert oasis region near the intersection of the three major source streams of the tarim river akesu river yarkant river and hetian river dominated by a typical extreme arid climate the region has an annual mean precipitation of 45 7 mm and an annual mean evaporation of 2218 mm and an annual mean temperature of 11 3 c created by the sunshine hours of approximate 2950 h and the frost free period of 207 d abundant light and heat resources are favorable for extensive cotton cultivation the particle size distribution measured by a laser method mastersizer 3000 malevern instruments ltd malvern uk demonstrated a texture of sandy loam in the 0 60 cm profile table 1 the bulk densities at different depths measured by a 100 cm3 ring are also given in table 1 field capacity in soil at different depths was determined by the wilcox method in laboratory wilcox 1939 table 1 the soil organic matter content was 7 64 g kg 1 the main soil soluble salt ions in the root zone were ca2 1 08 g kg 1 na 2 85 g kg 1 so4 2 2 48 g kg 1 and cl 1 54 g kg 1 the groundwater table is located at 3 5 m below the surface a hobo weather station with rx3000 data logger onset bourne ma usa was installed 70 m apart from the experimental field for monitoring air temperature precipitation solar radiation humidity and wind speed every 30 min the cotton gossypium hirsutum l was seeded on april 16 in 2018 and april 15 in 2019 with the plant spacing along a row of 10 cm using a mulch seeder six rows of cotton with a spacing of 0 10 m 0 66 m 0 10 m 0 66 m 0 10 m were seeded under one 2 m wide strip of plastic film and the driplines were laid along the median of two wide rows generating a plant density of 257 640 plants per hectare fig 1 about 300 mm water was applied by surface irrigation on 22 march in 2018 and on 24 march in 2019 to guarantee the germination and emergence and leach the residual salt out of the root zone pest and weed control was conducted following the conventional practices in the experimental area 2 2 experimental treatments the two experimental factors considered were lateral length and irrigation amount three lateral lengths were set as 40 80 and 120 m for drip irrigation system new driplines were used for each season emitter discharge rates along the 40 80 and 120 m laterals referred to as short lateral l1 medium lateral l2 and long lateral l3 were measured prior to the installation of drip irrigation system under an operation pressure of 0 06 mpa a regression equation between emitter discharge rate and the distance from lateral inlet was developed to help estimate the amount of water applied at different locations along the lateral fig 2 the low r 2 for the 40 m lateral during 2018 was mainly related to the small difference in emitter discharge rate along the lateral in 2018 three irrigation upper limits of 90 i1 100 i2 and 110 i3 of fc along with a trigger point of 60 70 of fc were used to determine irrigation schedule as obvious water stress for cotton at the last third 80 120 m from the lateral inlet of 120 m lateral was observed at the peak flowering and peak boll setting stage in the 2018 season irrigation upper limits were changed as 90 i1 110 i2 and 130 i3 of fc in 2019 the experiments were arranged as a randomized complete block with three replications consequently a total of 27 experimental plots were created with each plot including 2 strips of plastic film 4 driplines and 12 plant rows to avoid the potential water exchange between the adjacent experimental plots three experimental plots with lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m while at a similar irrigation level were positioned adjacent 2 3 irrigation and fertigation schedule during both seasons cotton was irrigated using drip irrigation with brackish groundwater having a salinity of 1 27 g l 1 and chemical analysis results for the irrigation water are given in table 2 the groundwater was pumped using a pump with a capacity of 40 m3 h 1 and a lift of 32 m for irrigation the irrigation water was filtered through a disc filter 90 mm inner diameter connected to the main pipe 90 mm inner diameter at the head of the main line a valve 90 mm nominal diameter and a pressure gauge 25 mm inner diameter with an accuracy of 0 4 were installed to maintain a fixed inlet pressure of 0 06 mpa during all irrigation events a manifold 40 mm inner diameter connected to the main pipe via a ball valve 40 mm nominal diameter and a flow meter 40 mm nominal diameter was installed for each plot to record the volume of water applied during an irrigation event trime access tubes with a spacing of 8 m were installed along the lateral in one selected replicate of each treatment to monitor the depletion of soil water within the cotton root zone each access tube was positioned at a distance of 22 cm from the lateral fig 1 irrigation schedule was determined by the measurements of soil water content weekly using a trime t3 probe trime pico iph t3 imko germany to 60 cm depth irrigation was applied when the average soil water content in the root zone 0 60 cm for the low irrigation level of i1 depleted to 60 70 of the field capacity along with a wetted ratio of drip irrigation as 0 7 a target wetted depth of 40 60 and 60 cm was used for budding blooming and boll setting stages respectively all the treatments were irrigated on the same date while different amounts of water were applied for treatments with different irrigation levels during the cotton growing season no effective rainfall event 5 mm was detected in 2018 while three effective rainfall events occurred with a total of 22 6 mm in 2019 the irrigation schedules produced a total irrigation of 233 295 and 357 mm in 2018 and 242 396 and 549 mm in 2019 for the i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively fig 3 assuming no deep percolation for i1 the actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the water balance equation allen et al 1998 the eta was 287 mm in 2018 and 249 mm in 2019 for the i1 treatment prior to seeding in 2018 75 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 40 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 40 kg ha 1 of k2o were broadcast applied in the form of urea 46 n and compound fertilizer 14 n 16 p2o5 and 15 k2o in 2019 120 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 85 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 85 5 kg ha 1 of k2o were broadcast applied using the fertilizers similar to the 2018 during the irrigation seasons a readily soluble nitrogen fertilizer urea was fertigated through drip irrigation systems using a pressure differential tank a total of 165 kg ha 1 nitrogen along with 110 kg ha 1 of p2o5 in the form of monopotassium phosphate was applied in three equal splits in 2018 and 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and 65 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 was applied in three equal splits in 2019 fig 3 2 4 measurements of soil physical properties the water and salt in soil moved in the soil pores and thereby were impacted by the soil pore size distribution soil texture and bulk density were strongly associated with the soil pore size distribution and therefore considered as indicators of the spatial variation of soil physical properties in this study dec et al 2008 ding et al 2016 prior to seeding in 2018 soil samples in a selected plot of each treatment were collected at equal intervals of 8 m along the lateral using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm to acquire the spatial variability of soil particle size within the root zone this procedure resulted in 5 10 and 15 measuring locations for l1 l2 and l3 treatments respectively for each soil sample passing through a 2 mm sieve the particle size distribution was measured employing a laser method mastersizer 3000 malevern instruments ltd malvern uk besides the bulk density at each measuring location was measured by a 100 cm3 ring in 2019 to acquire its spatial variability 2 5 measurements of soil water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents for determining the initial water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents in soil soil samples at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in the same plot as soil physical properties for each treatment were collected at equal intervals of 8 m along the lateral using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter prior to the first irrigation event in 2018 and 2019 the sampling positions were located in the three rows adjacent to the central of the plot while under a similar plastic strip to avoid the potential effect of the water exchange between the adjacent plots on the soil water and salt contents meanwhile the soil samples were collected about 50 cm away from the trime access tubes and maintained a distance of about 22 cm from the dripline fig 1 that was aimed at representing the average wetted soil volume after an irrigation event without damaging cotton plants soil water content was determined gravimetrically the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for each sample 20 g of air dried soil were extracted with 25 ml kcl solution at a concentration of 1 mol l 1 the no3 n and nh4 n contents mgkg 1 were measured by using an autoanalyzer iii aa3 bran luebbe germany the sum of

90 of the bolls had opened the seed cotton was started to harvest by hand at 5 10 and 15 locations spaced at 8 m for each plot with the lateral length of 40 80 and 120 m respectively to obtain the variation of yield along the lateral the seed cotton was harvested by hand two times for measuring cotton yield the harvesting date was from 7 october to 12 october and from 21 october to 23 october in 2018 and from 17 october to 21 october and from 28 october to 30 october in 2019 for each sample location the seed cotton was picked along six 1 m long rows and the total weight of the six rows within a strip of plastic film in the plot was used to represent the yield for this location for each plot the seed cotton samples were weighed and then 50 g sub samples were ginned to determine lint percentage the lint yield for each sample location was determined by multiplying the seed cotton weight by its respective lint percentage 2 7 statistic and analysis as a nonlinear statistical ensemble

irrigation amount fertigation and soil physical properties on soil water and salt contents averaged over the root zone 0 60 cm during each growing stage the early flowering peak flowering peak boll setting and boll opening stages of cotton as well as lint yield were analyzed the irrigation amount for each irrigation event at a soil sampling location along the lateral was estimated using the regression equations between emitter discharge rate and distance from lateral inlet illustrated in fig 2 assuming that nitrogen discharged from emitters during fertigation had a distribution pattern similar to water discharged along the lateral the nitrogen applied for a fertigation event along the lateral was estimated according to the variation of emitter discharge rates the cumulative irrigation and nitrogen applied at a given date were defined as the sum of water and nitrogen applied precedent the randomforest package in the r programming language v 3 6 3 was used to fit the random forest models liaw and wiener 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physical properties and initial soil water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents the maximum minimum mean and coefficients of variation cv of the sand silt and clay contents and bulk densities of soil at the 0 60 cm depth are summarized in table 3 soil sand and silt content displayed a medium variability with the cv of 0 19 0 28 hillel 1980 relatively higher cv of soil clay content was observed ranging from 0 30 to 0 39 also indicating a medium variability the cv less than 0 10 for soil bulk density manifested a low variability additionally the average cv of soil silt and clay content increased with lateral length revealing that stronger spatial variability of soil physical properties exists in the experimental plot with an increasing lateral length for all treatments soil sand silt and clay contents and bulk density changed randomly along the lateral table 4 summarizes the maximum minimum mean and coefficients of variation cv of the initial water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents averaged over the 0 60 cm depth for each treatment in 2018 and 2019 the cv of soil water and salt contents generally showed an increasing trend with lateral length indicating stronger spatial variability of water and salt contents in the experimental plot with longer laterals the average cv of initial soil water content was 0 14 0 19 and 0 30 for l1 l2 and l3 treatments in 2018 respectively in 2019 the values were 0 22 0 49 and 0 49 no determinative increasing or decreasing trend for initial water content along the lateral was detected for all the treatments for l2 and l3 treatments soil salt contents had higher cv 0 58 for l2 and 0 78 for l3 in 2018 0 50 for l2 and 0 68 for l3 in 2019 showing a stronger spatial variability than soil water and inorganic nitrogen contents 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water contents the variations of affecting weights of relevant factors including cumulative irrigation amount initial soil water content bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on soil water content in 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 4 random forest regression models showed good performance with the r 2 ranging from 0 40 to 0 69 the weights of the cumulative irrigation amount were higher than other factors from the early flowering stage to the peak boll setting stage irrigation season in both seasons however they decreased from larger than 0 4 during the irrigation seasons to about 0 25 at the boll opening stage when no irrigation was applied this demonstrated the great importance of irrigation on the soil water content under arid environments especially during the irrigation seasons the initial soil water content was the second important factor affecting soil water content with the weights averaged over the four analyses of 0 19 in 2018 and 0 14 in 2019 bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents had little effect on soil water contents from the early flowering to the peak boll setting stage with lower relative affecting weights this might be ascribed to the relatively lower cv of bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents than the cumulative irrigation amount and initial soil water content along the lateral table 3 at the boll opening stage 22 september 2018 and 21 september 2019 however the soil physical properties imposed stronger impacts on soil water content with the total weights of soil sand content soil silt content soil clay content and bulk density occupied more than 50 of the total weights in both seasons this indicated that the soil water content was more liable to be determined by the soil basic properties at the boll opening stage after irrigation ceased august 21 2018 and august 24 2019 rather than the cumulative irrigation occurred during the irrigation seasons the variation of soil water content in the 0 60 cm profile and the cumulative irrigation amount along the lateral at the peak flowering stage and the boll opening stage are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 respectively during the irrigation season no clear trend of soil water content was observed along the 40 m lateral under all irrigation levels for the l2 and l3 treatments however soil water content showed a decreasing trend with distance from the lateral inlet this indicated that the greatest effect of cumulative irrigation amount on soil water content probably originated from the field with lateral length greater than 80 m for the l1 treatments the slightly fluctuation of soil water content could be attributed to the variation of the initial water content and soil physical properties a faster decreasing trend was observed for the l3 treatments than the l2 treatments agreeing well with the larger differences among the cumulative irrigation amounts along the laterals for the l3 treatments fig 5 c and f the nonuniform irrigation would dominate the spatial variation of soil water content along the 120 m lateral although the soil spatial variability produced great fluctuations of soil water content along the lateral fig 5 c and f at the boll opening stages slight fluctuations were also observed just like those in the irrigation seasons for the treatments with 40 m laterals slighter decreasing trend than those during the irrigation seasons were observed for treatments with 80 m and 120 m laterals fig 6 these results were consistent with the lower weights of cumulative irrigation amount on soil water contents at the boll opening stage the soil physical properties might become the dominant factors affecting the distribution of soil water contents along the laterals when no water was applied especially for treatments with long laterals high irrigation level of i3 treatments did not always produce the highest soil water content along the lateral in both seasons for the l1 and l2 treatments however the average soil water content over the field increased with the irrigation level for the l3 treatments the strong effect of irrigation level for the l3 treatments could be attributed to higher soil water contents along the last third part of laterals under higher irrigation levels especially in the 2019 season fig 5 f 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution of soil salt contents the variations of affecting weights of relevant factors including cumulative irrigation amount initial soil water and salt contents bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on soil salt content during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 7 the r 2 of the random forest regression models ranged from 0 38 to 0 72 also indicating better performance for both seasons higher weights of initial salt content than other factors were observed in all the four analyses indicating the important effect of initial soil salt content on the soil salt contents during the growing seasons the weights of cumulative irrigation amount were always less than 0 10 in both seasons these results were different from those of the soil water content and demonstrated that less impact of irrigation imposed on the soil salt content it might be the consequence of the coupling impact of nonuniform irrigation and spatial variability of soil physical and initial properties in the field additionally lower affecting weights of soil bulk density and soil particle size distribution were observed relative to soil salt content in both seasons this might be attributed to slighter spatial variation of soil bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents than the initial soil salt content along the lateral table 3 the variations of the soil salt content in the 0 60 cm profile along the lateral during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively similar fluctuation tendency in soil salt content was generally observed from the early flowering stage to the boll opening stage for most treatments in both seasons this agreed well with lower weights of the cumulative irrigation amount on soil salt content from the rfr results indicating that the irrigation imposed little effect on temporal and spatial variation of soil salt contents generally the soil salt content was highly consistent with the initial salt content along the lateral for all the treatments the cv of the soil salt content along the lateral during the growing seasons and the initial soil salt content showed a similar increasing trend with lateral length for example the average cv of soil salt content over all the three irrigation levels were 0 27 0 55 and 0 68 at the peak flowering stage in 2019 for the l1 l2 and l3 treatments respectively while the corresponding values were 0 21 0 47 and 0 66 at the initial stage this also indicated that the initial soil salt content was the key factors affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of soil salt content rather than the irrigation the nonuniformly distributed irrigation water did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the farmland even for the l3 treatment with the 120 m laterals the results could probably be attributed to the relatively low average initial salt content over the whole field in both years 4 88 g kg 1 in 2018 and 3 72 g kg 1 in 2019 besides the salt brought from irrigation water with a relatively high salinity of 1 27 g l 1 and having the same ions with the experimental soil might offset the potential leaching effect of soil salt at the first half part of the l2 and the first third part of the l3 experimental plots where over irrigation irrigation upper limit 100 fc occurred dehghanisanij et al 2006 a larger irrigation amount made the soluble salts in soil easily leached out of the root zone simultaneously as water in soil was consumed by plant transpiration and dissipated into the air by stronger evaporation flux in arid regions a larger irrigation amount caused more salt to be retained in soil this likely resulted in that the soil salt content in the root zone decreased and then increased for the last half part of the l2 and the last third part of the l3 experimental plots however the unobvious soil salt accumulation was probably related to the reduced evapotranspiration caused by insufficient irrigation and plastic films fig 8 n and o chen et al 2014 meanwhile a relatively low evapotranspiration intensity might not cause the salt in the groundwater with a depth of 3 5 m to move up to the root zone 3 4 spatial distribution of cotton lint yield the r 2 of the random forest regression models and the obtained weights of cumulative irrigation amount cumulative nitrogen applied initial soil water and inorganic nitrogen contents soil salt content averaged over the whole growth period bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on lint yield in 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 10 for both seasons the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than the other factors this agreed well with guan et al 2013a who also reported the significant impact of irrigation amount on cotton lint yield with different drip irrigation system uniformities the relatively lower influence of soil salt content could probably be attributed to the relatively low average soil salt content in the experimental field soil physical properties and initial soil conditions had little impact on the distribution of lint yield the variation of the average cotton lint yield for each treatment along the lateral is illustrated in fig 11 the distribution of lint yield was generally consistent with soil water contents along the lateral fig 5 however the highly varying soil salt content along the lateral imposed little effect on the lint yield for the l1 treatments approximately similar cotton lint yield was observed along the lateral even under different irrigation levels the slight fluctuation in yield along the lateral in l1 treatments might probably be attributed to the spatial variability of soil physical properties while the water and fertilizer were applied relatively uniformly for the l2 and l3 treatments however the yield showed a decreasing trend with distance from the lateral inlet in both seasons this agreed well with the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied along the laterals and their high affecting weights on the yield the low irrigation water and nitrogen applied along the latter part of the lateral could not meet the water and nitrogen need sufficiently for cotton growth thus leading to yield reduction the results indicated that the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied might become the dominant factor affecting the cotton lint yield when lateral length exceeded 80 m for the l1 and l2 treatments the average cotton lint yield over the whole plots did not always increase with increasing irrigation levels in both seasons for example statistically similar average cotton lint yield of 2955 2711 and 3138 kg ha 1 were observed for the l1i1 l1i2 and l1i3 in 2018 respectively while the values were 2628 2527 and 2594 kg ha 1 in 2019 this indicated that the high irrigation level would not always benefit the cotton lint yield in the field with relatively low soil salinization the results were probably correlated to the increasing nitrogen leaching with irrigation levels shareef et al 2019 besides over irrigations would delay maturity and reduced number of open bolls thus reducing the cotton lint yield kang et al 2012 wang et al 2020 for the l3 treatment however the i3 level produced higher average cotton lint yield over the plot than those for the i1 and i2 treatments in both years the compensated irrigated water along the last third parts of 120 m laterals by the high irrigation level of i3 improved the cotton lint yield obviously figs 5 and 11 this agreed well with guan et al 2013a which have concluded that increasing irrigation water might be an effective way to avoid the potential negative influence of low system uniformity on crop yield in addition the possible water exchange between adjacent plots might cause interact effect on the cotton lint yields although the sampling locations in adjacent plots had the similar irrigation level 4 conclusions field experiment was conducted in the arid region to evaluate the effects of lateral length and irrigation amount on the dynamics of water and salt in soil as well as cotton lint yield under mulched drip irrigation random forest regression was used to identify the factors of soil water and salt contents as well as cotton lint yield the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 irrigation amount critically affected soil water content continuously with the affecting weights exceeding 0 4 in the test field for the 40 m lateral treatment spatial variations of soil physical properties were the main factors leading to a slight variation of soil water content the relative importance of spatial variation of soil properties on soil water content decreased with increasing lateral length although it produced great fluctuation of soil water content occasionally the nonuniformly applied water became the dominant factor affecting the distribution of soil water contents when lateral length reached 120 m 2 the uneven distributed irrigation water imposed little effect on the soil salt content while the initial salt content dominated the spatial and temporal variation of soil salt content for treatments with the three lateral lengths the spatial variation of soil salt content increased with lateral length while the longer lateral produced higher fluctuation of soil salt content the long lateral did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth of the tested field with initial soil salt content less than 5 g kg 1 3 the cumulative amount of irrigation and nitrogen applied imposed greater influences on the cotton lint yield than other factors the cotton lint yield showed a decreasing trend along the lateral in field when lateral length exceeded 80 m a lateral length of 80 m is a promising selection to maintain sustainable production balancing possible salt accumulation and crop production in arid lands with relatively low initial soil salt content the installation and operation costs for varying lateral lengths emitter discharge rates and soil salt contents should be further assessed to design an optimum drip irrigation system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10113,the trend of secondary soil salinization has been increasingly concerned in the arid region under drip irrigation in recent decades in china it remains unclear whether the potential increasing nonuniformity of irrigation water aroused by the increased acreage of subunit leads to salt harmfulness and yield reduction cotton field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the effects of lateral length on the distribution of water and salt in soil as well as lint yield under mulched drip irrigation to identify the dominating factors using the random forest regression three lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m were used along with a trigger point of 60 70 of field capacity fc irrigation amount was determined using three irrigation upper limits of 90 100 and 110 of fc in the 2018 and of 90 110 and 130 of fc in the 2019 the random forest analysis revealed that the nonuniform water applied by drip irrigation greatly affected the distribution of soil water content with an affecting weight exceeding 0 4 however it imposed little impact on soil salt content along the lateral with the affecting weights less than 0 1 the relative importance of spatial variation of soil properties on soil water content decreased with increasing lateral length while the nonuniformly applied water became the dominant factor affecting the distribution of soil water content for a field with lateral length of 120 m the initial soil salt content dominated the spatial and temporal variation of soil salt content for treatments with all the three lengths of lateral the long lateral did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth along the lateral the cumulative irrigation water and nitrogen applied imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than other factors a medium lateral length is a promising selection to maintain sustainable production balancing possible salt accumulation and crop production in arid lands with relatively low initial soil salt content keywords microirrigation fertigation uniformity lateral length random forest method 1 introduction water scarcity and secondary soil salinization are two main obstacles to the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions assouline et al 2015 minhas et al 2020 drip irrigation under mulch has been widely used to alleviate the water scarcity in these regions due to its high water use efficiency li et al 2019 mansour et al 2019 however the characteristics of drip irrigation with less quota and more frequent application might lead to an unguaranteed salt leaching resulting in salt accumulation in the root zone at the end of cotton growth season liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014a with the development of intensive agriculture in recent years an individual drip irrigation system controlling considerably large area e g thousands of acres is becoming more and more common in the arid region of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china large irrigation units with long laterals becomes prevailing to reduce installation and operational costs a long lateral normally created low drip irrigation uniformity due to head loss wu 1992 sadeghi et al 2015 in semi humid regions drip irrigation uniformity imposed insignificant effect on crop growth and dynamic of soil water and nitrogen li et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 wang et al 2014b however guan et al 2013a 2013b revealed a significant effect on cotton yield and insignificant influence on soil salinity imposed by drip system uniformity when 50 m lateral length was used to irrigate non salinized field with fresh water nevertheless further research was needed to confirm whether nonuniform application of irrigation water and fertilizers resulted from long laterals lead to an increasing risk of soil salinization and the reduction of crop yield in regions with lots of salt in soil parent material the variability in soil properties usually increased the unevenness of water and nutrient applied by drip irrigation system thus affecting crop yield li et al 2011 usowicz and lipiec 2017 due to the soil spatial variability the uniformity of soil water content nitrogen content and soil bulk electrical conductivity were relatively lower than the uniformity of water and fertilizers applied for a system with high uniformity li et al 2012 however the attenuation of nonuniform distribution of water and nutrients in soil and yield imposed by soil variability had also been reported when system uniformity was considerably low wang et al 2013 the dynamics of water nutrient and salt in soil and distribution of crop yield are likely to be non linearly affected by irrigation fertigation and soil spatial variability in the farmland stronger soil spatial variability may exist in a field with long laterals however few attempts have been made to analyze the coupling effect of nonuniformly applied water and fertilizers and soil spatial variability on the distribution of water and salt in soil when long laterals are used the statistical method of multiple linear regression is widely used to determine the linear relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables because of its simple structure and strong explanation thompson et al 2006 however it can hardly be used for nonlinear system involving multiple influencing factors random forest regression rfr is not affected by multicollinearity when handling complex interactions among variables with data unnecessarily to obey a specific probability distribution cutler et al 2007 breiman 2001 rfr is thus superior to multiple linear regression and appropriate for illustrating the nonlinear effect of variables aditi et al 2020 moreover rfr can quantitatively assess the relative importance of explanatory variables on dependent variable cutler et al 2011 akpa et al 2014 sreenivas et al 2014 this provides a promising approach for identifying the relative importance of various influencing factors of water and salt in soil and crop yield in a drip irrigated field the objectives of this study were to discriminate the critical influencing factors on water and salt in soil and crop yield in field with different lateral lengths using the random forest analysis and to evaluate the effects of lateral length and irrigation amount on the distribution of soil water and salt coupled with crop yield along the lateral under mulched drip irrigation in the arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the cotton field experiments were conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps 81 11 43 e 40 37 22 n altitude 1017 m above mean sea level during the cotton growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 the station is located in the plain desert oasis region near the intersection of the three major source streams of the tarim river akesu river yarkant river and hetian river dominated by a typical extreme arid climate the region has an annual mean precipitation of 45 7 mm and an annual mean evaporation of 2218 mm and an annual mean temperature of 11 3 c created by the sunshine hours of approximate 2950 h and the frost free period of 207 d abundant light and heat resources are favorable for extensive cotton cultivation the

the surface a hobo weather station with rx3000 data logger onset bourne ma usa was installed 70 m apart from the experimental field for monitoring air temperature precipitation solar radiation humidity and wind speed every 30 min the cotton gossypium hirsutum l was seeded on april 16 in 2018 and april 15 in 2019 with the plant spacing along a row of 10 cm using a mulch seeder six rows of cotton with a spacing of 0 10 m 0 66 m 0 10 m 0 66 m 0 10 m were seeded under one 2 m wide strip of plastic film and the driplines were laid along the median of two wide rows generating a plant density of 257 640 plants per hectare fig 1 about 300 mm water was applied by surface irrigation on 22 march in 2018 and on 24 march in 2019 to guarantee the germination and emergence and leach the residual salt out of the root zone pest and weed control was conducted following the conventional practices in the experimental area 2 2 experimental treatments the two experimental factors considered were lateral length and irrigation amount three lateral lengths were set as 40 80 and 120 m for drip irrigation system new driplines were used for each season emitter discharge rates along the 40 80 and 120 m laterals referred to as short lateral l1 medium lateral l2 and long lateral l3 were measured prior to the installation of drip irrigation system under an operation pressure of 0 06 mpa a regression equation between emitter discharge rate and the distance from lateral inlet was developed to help estimate the amount of water applied at different locations along the lateral fig 2 the low r 2 for the 40 m lateral during 2018 was mainly related to the small difference in emitter discharge rate along the lateral in 2018 three irrigation upper limits of 90 i1 100 i2 and 110 i3 of fc along with a trigger point of 60 70 of fc were used to determine irrigation schedule as obvious water stress for cotton at the last third 80 120 m from the lateral inlet of 120 m lateral was observed at the peak flowering and peak boll setting stage in the 2018 season irrigation upper limits were changed as 90 i1 110 i2 and 130 i3 of fc in 2019 the experiments were arranged as a randomized complete block with three replications consequently a total of 27 experimental plots were created with each plot including 2 strips of plastic film 4 driplines and 12 plant rows to avoid the potential water exchange between the adjacent experimental plots three experimental plots with lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m while at a similar irrigation level were positioned adjacent 2 3 irrigation and fertigation schedule during both seasons cotton was irrigated using drip irrigation with brackish groundwater having a salinity of 1 27 g l 1 and chemical analysis results for the irrigation water are given in table 2 the groundwater was pumped using a pump with a capacity of 40 m3 h 1 and a lift of 32 m for irrigation the irrigation water was filtered through a disc filter 90 mm inner diameter connected to the main pipe 90 mm inner diameter at the head of the main line a valve 90 mm nominal diameter and a pressure gauge 25 mm inner diameter with an accuracy of 0 4 were installed to maintain a fixed inlet pressure of 0 06 mpa during all irrigation events a manifold 40 mm inner diameter connected to the main pipe via a ball valve 40 mm nominal diameter and a flow meter 40 mm nominal diameter was installed for each plot to record the volume of water applied during an irrigation event trime access tubes with a spacing of 8 m were installed along the lateral in one selected replicate of each treatment to monitor the depletion of soil water within the cotton root zone each access tube was positioned at a distance of 22 cm from the lateral fig 1 irrigation schedule was determined by the measurements of soil water content weekly using a trime t3 probe trime pico iph t3 imko germany to 60 cm depth irrigation was applied when the average soil water content in the root zone 0 60 cm for the low irrigation level of i1 depleted to 60 70 of the field capacity along with a wetted ratio of drip irrigation as 0 7 a target wetted depth of 40 60 and 60 cm was used for budding blooming and boll setting stages respectively all the treatments were irrigated on the same date while different amounts of water were applied for treatments with different irrigation levels during the cotton growing season no effective rainfall event 5 mm was detected in 2018 while three effective rainfall events occurred with a total of 22 6 mm in 2019 the irrigation schedules produced a total irrigation of 233 295 and 357 mm in 2018 and 242 396 and 549 mm in 2019 for the i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively fig 3 assuming no deep percolation for i1 the actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the water balance equation allen et al 1998 the eta was 287 mm in 2018 and 249 mm in 2019 for the i1 treatment prior to seeding in 2018 75 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 40 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 40 kg ha 1 of k2o were broadcast applied in the form of urea 46 n and compound fertilizer 14 n 16 p2o5 and 15 k2o in 2019 120 kg ha 1 of nitrogen 85 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 85 5 kg ha 1 of k2o were broadcast applied using the fertilizers similar to the 2018 during the irrigation seasons a readily soluble nitrogen fertilizer urea was fertigated through drip irrigation systems using a pressure differential tank a total of 165 kg ha 1 nitrogen along with 110 kg ha 1 of p2o5 in the form of monopotassium phosphate was applied in three equal splits in 2018 and 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and 65 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 was applied in three equal splits in 2019 fig 3 2 4 measurements of soil physical properties the water and salt in soil moved in the soil pores and thereby were impacted by the soil pore size distribution soil texture and bulk density were strongly associated with the soil pore size distribution and therefore considered as indicators of the spatial variation of soil physical properties in this study dec et al 2008 ding et al 2016 prior to seeding in 2018 soil samples in a selected plot of each treatment were collected at equal intervals of 8 m along the lateral using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm to acquire the spatial variability of soil particle size within the root zone this procedure resulted in 5 10 and 15 measuring locations for l1 l2 and l3 treatments respectively for each soil sample passing through a 2 mm sieve the particle size distribution was measured employing a laser method mastersizer 3000 malevern instruments ltd malvern uk besides the bulk density at each measuring location was measured by a 100 cm3 ring in 2019 to acquire its spatial variability 2 5 measurements of soil water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents for determining the initial water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents in soil soil samples at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm in the same plot as soil physical properties for each treatment were collected at equal intervals of 8 m along the lateral using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter prior to the first irrigation event in 2018 and 2019 the sampling positions were located in the three rows adjacent to the central of the plot while under a similar plastic strip to avoid the potential effect of the water exchange between the adjacent plots on the soil water and salt contents meanwhile the soil samples were collected about 50 cm away from the trime access tubes and maintained a distance of about 22 cm from the dripline fig 1 that was aimed at representing the average wetted soil volume after an irrigation event without damaging cotton plants soil water content was determined gravimetrically the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve for each sample 20 g of air

90 of the bolls had opened the seed cotton was started to harvest by hand at 5 10 and 15 locations spaced at 8 m for each plot with the lateral length of 40 80 and 120 m respectively to obtain the variation of yield along the lateral the seed cotton was harvested by hand two times for measuring cotton yield the harvesting date was from 7 october to 12 october and from 21 october to 23 october in 2018 and from 17 october to 21 october and from 28 october to 30 october in 2019 for each sample location the seed cotton was picked along six 1 m long rows and the total weight of the six rows within a strip of plastic film in the plot was used to represent the yield for this location for each plot the seed cotton samples were weighed and then 50 g sub samples were ginned to determine lint percentage the lint yield for each sample location was determined by multiplying the seed cotton weight by its respective lint percentage 2 7 statistic and analysis as a nonlinear statistical ensemble

irrigation amount fertigation and soil physical properties on soil water and salt contents averaged over the root zone 0 60 cm during each growing stage the early flowering peak flowering peak boll setting and boll opening stages of cotton as well as lint yield were analyzed the irrigation amount for each irrigation event at a soil sampling location along the lateral was estimated using the regression equations between emitter discharge rate and distance from lateral inlet illustrated in fig 2 assuming that nitrogen discharged from emitters during fertigation had a distribution pattern similar to water discharged along the lateral the nitrogen applied for a fertigation event along the lateral was estimated according to the variation of emitter discharge rates the cumulative irrigation and nitrogen applied at a given date were defined as the sum of water and nitrogen applied precedent the randomforest package in the r programming language v 3 6 3 was used to fit the random forest models liaw and wiener 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physical properties and initial soil water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents the maximum minimum mean and coefficients of variation cv of the sand silt and clay contents and bulk densities of soil at the 0 60 cm depth are summarized in table 3 soil sand and silt content displayed a medium variability with the cv of 0 19 0 28 hillel 1980 relatively higher cv of soil clay content was observed ranging from 0 30 to 0 39 also indicating a medium variability the cv less than 0 10 for soil bulk density manifested a low variability additionally the average cv of soil silt and clay content increased with lateral length revealing that stronger spatial variability of soil physical properties exists in the experimental plot with an increasing lateral length for all treatments soil sand silt and clay contents and bulk density changed randomly along the lateral table 4 summarizes the maximum minimum mean and coefficients of variation cv of the initial water salt and inorganic nitrogen contents averaged over the 0 60 cm depth for each treatment in 2018 and 2019 the cv of soil water and salt contents generally showed an increasing trend with lateral length indicating stronger spatial variability of water and salt contents in the experimental plot with longer laterals the average cv of initial soil water content was 0 14 0 19 and 0 30 for l1 l2 and l3 treatments in 2018 respectively in 2019 the values were 0 22 0 49 and 0 49 no determinative increasing or decreasing trend for initial water content along the lateral was detected for all the treatments for l2 and l3 treatments soil salt contents had higher cv 0 58 for l2 and 0 78 for l3 in 2018 0 50 for l2 and 0 68 for l3 in 2019 showing a stronger spatial variability than soil water and inorganic nitrogen contents 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water contents the variations of affecting weights of relevant factors including cumulative irrigation amount initial soil water content bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on soil water content in 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 4 random forest regression models showed good performance with the r 2 ranging from 0 40 to 0 69 the weights of the cumulative irrigation amount were higher than other factors from the early flowering stage to the peak boll setting stage irrigation season in both seasons however they decreased from larger than 0 4 during the irrigation seasons to about 0 25 at the boll opening stage when no irrigation was applied this demonstrated the great importance of irrigation on the soil water content under arid environments especially during the irrigation seasons the initial soil water content was the second important factor affecting soil water content with the weights averaged over the four analyses of 0 19 in 2018 and 0 14 in 2019 bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents had little effect on soil water contents from the early flowering to the peak boll setting stage with lower relative affecting weights this might be ascribed to the relatively lower cv of bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents than the cumulative irrigation amount and initial soil water content along the lateral table 3 at the boll opening stage 22 september 2018 and 21 september 2019 however the soil physical properties imposed stronger impacts on soil water content with the total weights of soil sand content soil silt content soil clay content and bulk density occupied more than 50 of the total weights in both seasons this indicated that the soil water content was more liable to be determined by the soil basic properties at the boll opening stage after irrigation ceased august 21 2018 and august 24 2019 rather than the cumulative irrigation occurred during the irrigation seasons the variation of soil water content in the 0 60 cm profile and the cumulative irrigation amount along the lateral at the peak flowering stage and the boll opening stage are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 respectively during the irrigation season no clear trend of soil water content was observed along the 40 m lateral under all irrigation levels for the l2 and l3 treatments however soil water content showed a decreasing trend with distance from the lateral inlet this indicated that the greatest effect of cumulative irrigation amount on soil water content probably originated from the field with lateral length greater than 80 m for the l1 treatments the slightly fluctuation of soil water content could be attributed to the variation of the initial water content and soil physical properties a faster decreasing trend was observed for the l3 treatments than the l2 treatments agreeing well with the larger differences among the cumulative irrigation amounts along the laterals for the l3 treatments fig 5 c and f the nonuniform irrigation would dominate the spatial variation of soil water content along the 120 m lateral although the soil spatial variability produced great fluctuations of soil water content along the lateral fig 5 c and f at the boll opening stages slight fluctuations were also observed just like those in the irrigation seasons for the treatments with 40 m laterals slighter decreasing trend than those during the irrigation seasons were observed for treatments with 80 m and 120 m laterals fig 6 these results were consistent with the lower weights of cumulative irrigation amount on soil water contents at the boll opening stage the soil physical properties might become the dominant factors affecting the distribution of soil water contents along the laterals when no water was applied especially for treatments with long laterals high irrigation level of i3 treatments did not always produce the highest soil water content along the lateral in both seasons for the l1 and l2 treatments however the average soil water content over the field increased with the irrigation level for the l3 treatments the strong effect of irrigation level for the l3 treatments could be attributed to higher soil water contents along the last third part of laterals under higher irrigation levels especially in the 2019 season fig 5 f 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution of soil salt contents the variations of affecting weights of relevant factors including cumulative irrigation amount initial soil water and salt contents bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on soil salt content during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 7 the r 2 of the random forest regression models ranged from 0 38 to 0 72 also indicating better performance for both seasons higher weights of initial salt content than other factors were observed in all the four analyses indicating the important effect of initial soil salt content on the soil salt contents during the growing seasons the weights of cumulative irrigation amount were always less than 0 10 in both seasons these results were different from those of the soil water content and demonstrated that less impact of irrigation imposed on the soil salt content it might be the consequence of the coupling impact of nonuniform irrigation and spatial variability of soil physical and initial properties in the field additionally lower affecting weights of soil bulk density and soil particle size distribution were observed relative to soil salt content in both seasons this might be attributed to slighter spatial variation of soil bulk density and soil sand silt and clay contents than the initial soil salt content along the lateral table 3 the variations of the soil salt content in the 0 60 cm profile along the lateral during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively similar fluctuation tendency in soil salt content was generally observed from the early flowering stage to the boll opening stage for most treatments in both seasons this agreed well with lower weights of the cumulative irrigation amount on soil salt content from the rfr results indicating that the irrigation imposed little effect on temporal and spatial variation of soil salt contents generally the soil salt content was highly consistent with the initial salt content along the lateral for all the treatments the cv of the soil salt content along the lateral during the growing seasons and the initial soil salt content showed a similar increasing trend with lateral length for example the average cv of soil salt content over all the three irrigation levels were 0 27 0 55 and 0 68 at the peak flowering stage in 2019 for the l1 l2 and l3 treatments respectively while the corresponding values were 0 21 0 47 and 0 66 at the initial stage this also indicated that the initial soil salt content was the key factors affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of soil salt content rather than the irrigation the nonuniformly distributed irrigation water did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the farmland even for the l3 treatment with the 120 m laterals the results could probably be attributed to the relatively low average initial salt content over the whole field in both years 4 88 g kg 1 in 2018 and 3 72 g kg 1 in 2019 besides the salt brought from irrigation water with a relatively high salinity of 1 27 g l 1 and having the same ions with the experimental soil might offset the potential leaching effect of soil salt at the first half part of the l2 and the first third part of the l3 experimental plots where over irrigation irrigation upper limit 100 fc occurred dehghanisanij et al 2006 a larger irrigation amount made the soluble salts in soil easily leached out of the root zone simultaneously as water in soil was consumed by plant transpiration and dissipated into the air by stronger evaporation flux in arid regions a larger irrigation amount caused more salt to be retained in soil this likely resulted in that the soil salt content in the root zone decreased and then increased for the last half part of the l2 and the last third part of the l3 experimental plots however the unobvious soil salt accumulation was probably related to the reduced evapotranspiration caused by insufficient irrigation and plastic films fig 8 n and o chen et al 2014 meanwhile a relatively low evapotranspiration intensity might not cause the salt in the groundwater with a depth of 3 5 m to move up to the root zone 3 4 spatial distribution of cotton lint yield the r 2 of the random forest regression models and the obtained weights of cumulative irrigation amount cumulative nitrogen applied initial soil water and inorganic nitrogen contents soil salt content averaged over the whole growth period bulk density as well as soil sand silt and clay contents on lint yield in 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 10 for both seasons the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than the other factors this agreed well with guan et al 2013a who also reported the significant impact of irrigation amount on cotton lint yield with different drip irrigation system uniformities the relatively lower influence of soil salt content could probably be attributed to the relatively low average soil salt content in the experimental field soil physical properties and initial soil conditions had little impact on the distribution of lint yield the variation of the average cotton lint yield for each treatment along the lateral is illustrated in fig 11 the distribution of lint yield was generally consistent with soil water contents along the lateral fig 5 however the highly varying soil salt content along the lateral imposed little effect on the lint yield for the l1 treatments approximately similar cotton lint yield was observed along the lateral even under different irrigation levels the slight fluctuation in yield along the lateral in l1 treatments might probably be attributed to the spatial variability of soil physical properties while the water and fertilizer were applied relatively uniformly for the l2 and l3 treatments however the yield showed a decreasing trend with distance from the lateral inlet in both seasons this agreed well with the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied along the laterals and their high affecting weights on the yield the low irrigation water and nitrogen applied along the latter part of the lateral could not meet the water and nitrogen need sufficiently for cotton growth thus leading to yield reduction the results indicated that the cumulative irrigation amount and nitrogen applied might become the dominant factor affecting the cotton lint yield when lateral length exceeded 80 m for the l1 and l2 treatments the average cotton lint yield over the whole plots did not always increase with increasing irrigation levels in both seasons for example statistically similar average cotton lint yield of 2955 2711 and 3138 kg ha 1 were observed for the l1i1 l1i2 and l1i3 in 2018 respectively while the values were 2628 2527 and 2594 kg ha 1 in 2019 this indicated that the high irrigation level would not always benefit the cotton lint yield in the field with relatively low soil salinization the results were probably correlated to the increasing nitrogen leaching with irrigation levels shareef et al 2019 besides over irrigations would delay maturity and reduced number of open bolls thus reducing the cotton lint yield kang et al 2012 wang et al 2020 for the l3 treatment however the i3 level produced higher average cotton lint yield over the plot than those for the i1 and i2 treatments in both years the compensated irrigated water along the last third parts of 120 m laterals by the high irrigation level of i3 improved the cotton lint yield obviously figs 5 and 11 this agreed well with guan et al 2013a which have concluded that increasing irrigation water might be an effective way to avoid the potential negative influence of low system uniformity on crop yield in addition the possible water exchange between adjacent plots might cause interact effect on the cotton lint yields although the sampling locations in adjacent plots had the similar irrigation level 4 conclusions field experiment was conducted in the arid region to evaluate the effects of lateral length and irrigation amount on the dynamics of water and salt in soil as well as cotton lint yield under mulched drip irrigation random forest regression was used to identify the factors of soil water and salt contents as well as cotton lint yield the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 irrigation amount critically affected soil water content continuously with the affecting weights exceeding 0 4 in the test field for the 40 m lateral treatment spatial variations of soil physical properties were the main factors leading to a slight variation of soil water content the relative importance of spatial variation of soil properties on soil water content decreased with increasing lateral length although it produced great fluctuation of soil water content occasionally the nonuniformly applied water became the dominant factor affecting the distribution of soil water contents when lateral length reached 120 m 2 the uneven distributed irrigation water imposed little effect on the soil salt content while the initial salt content dominated the spatial and temporal variation of soil salt content for treatments with the three lateral lengths the spatial variation of soil salt content increased with lateral length while the longer lateral produced higher fluctuation of soil salt content the long lateral did not produce obvious soil salt accumulation at the 0 60 cm soil depth of the tested field with initial soil salt content less than 5 g kg 1 3 the cumulative amount of irrigation and nitrogen applied imposed greater influences on the cotton lint yield than other factors the cotton lint yield showed a decreasing trend along the lateral in field when lateral length exceeded 80 m a lateral length of 80 m is a promising selection to maintain sustainable production balancing possible salt accumulation and crop production in arid lands with relatively low initial soil salt content the installation and operation costs for varying lateral lengths emitter discharge rates and soil salt contents should be further assessed to design an optimum drip irrigation system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10114,due to the expansion of agricultural borders land use and land cover changes in the southern part of the brazilian amazon have been altering water and energy balances over the last decades still brazilian agriculture for the most part depends on rainfall to supply the water needs of crops and evapotranspiration is the main mean of water transferring in the form of vapor to the process of cloud formation and consequently rains reference evapotranspiration eto is a climatic variable with great potential to indicate climate changes which can be used to detect temporal trends and calculate aridity index ai thus the general objective is to analyze the behavior of the reference evapotranspiration and the components used to estimate it in contrast to the land use in four locations in the north of mato grosso state brazil in the southern amazon basin the main factors related to possible changes in eto over a mean period of 20 years were evaluated identifying trends for the data set studied eto sunshine duration air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation and the correlation r between reference evapotranspiration and the other variables besides the behavior of the ai was analyzed to observe the degree of rainfall insufficiency to maintain the soil in humidity conditions suitable for plant development to identify how significant the trends were we used the mann kendall trend analysis and linear regression analysis we found at least two different significant trends for each location the reference evapotranspiration showed a significant trend only in the station located in the municipality of canarana with a negative trend varying 8 4 mm per year the aridity index for the driest months of the year presented values close to 1 characterizing the region as medium to high aridity the variable that most influenced the eto variability was the insolation keywords trend analysis evapotranspiration aridity index precipitation hydrological cycle 1 introduction tropical forests play an important role in climate control and water and energy exchanges between surface and atmosphere meir and grace 2005 however temporal variations of rainfall depth and duration of dry seasons can highly affect energy exchange dynamics especially the net radiation partitioning between latent and sensible heat fluxes da rocha et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2014 2013 valle júnior et al 2020 vourlitis et al 2014 2008 forests mosaics in center amazonia generally present small variations in evapotranspiration rates due to some factors such as little variability of precipitation and seasonal variations in available energy and evaporative demand da rocha et al 2009 machado et al 2004 malhi et al 2002 while tropical savannas and transitional forests typically show high variations between dry and wet seasons in evapotranspiration rates as a result of abrupt changes in rainfall depth rodrigues et al 2014 vourlitis and da rocha 2011 these sudden interseasonal changes in tropical regions have been intensified over the last decades due to climate changes davidson et al 2012 gatti et al 2014 li et al 2021 phillips et al 2009 despite the impacts caused by climate changes the amazon basin has been widely affected by land use and land cover changes lucc such as monoculture farming and natural resources extractions over the last forty decades davidson et al 2012 walker et al 2000 the conversion from native forest to monocultures and pastures decreases evapotranspiration and soil water recharge and increases fast fluxes responses in the basin bruijnzeel 1991 lathuillière et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2016b on the other hand secondary forests growing in deforested areas present large evaporative fractions giambelluca 2002 and higher evaporative rates than primary forests von randow et al 2017 the impacts on hydrological cycle due to climate changes associated to lucc affect the availability of water resources causing consequences in environmental systems such as prolonged and severe droughts aragão et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 therefore these effects must be carefully studied to improve hydrologic planning and management even though culture homogeneity and scale strongly influence the regional water cycle d almeida et al 2007 reference evapotranspiration eto plays an important role in irrigation planning and can be considered as the atmospheric evaporative demand allen et al 1998 which is affected by changes in wind speed relative humidity air temperature and sunshine duration the meteorological variable that affects eto the most differs between different regions of the world jabloun and sahli 2008 salam et al 2020 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 valle júnior et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 jhajharia et al 2012 found out that wind speed and relative humidity are more important than temperature on eto estimates in northeast india while valle júnior et al 2020 observed that those two variables were the most insignificant variables for reference evapotranspiration in the brazilian cerrado temperature based eto models are more suitable in arid and semi arid environments than in humid conditions sentelhas et al 2010 tabari 2010 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 in addition recently several machine learning models have been used to estimate eto ferreira et al 2019 jing et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 valle júnior et al 2020 and pan evaporation ali ghorbani et al 2018 qasem et al 2019 which can be used to estimate eto with optimal input combinations spatial and temporal trend analysis could lead to a better understanding about how climate changes affect eto estimates several studies presented trend analyses of eto and the meteorological variables used to estimate reference evapotranspiration and the results were diverse in different climates and land covers chu et al 2017 dinpashoh et al 2011 feng et al 2017 huo et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 mcvicar et al 2012 reviewed eto rates and its variation worldwide in addition they pointed out that 20 of 26 studies about eto trends presented decreasing rates with an average of 1 31 mm year 1 however the review did not present studies about the brazilian amazon rainforest considering the importance of the brazilian amazon and the constant replacement of native vegetation over the last decades especially in the south region of this biome it is important to be aware of the effects of climate change on southern amazonia evaluating changes in eto could lead to a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic activities in the southern amazon basin our main goals were to estimate and assess temporal trends changes in reference evapotranspiration and the main climatic variables that affect eto rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity and insolation in four different land uses in southern amazonia this study was the first to evaluate temporal trends of reference evapotranspiration in southern amazonia we detected the trends using the mann kendall non parametric test using meteorological data from 2000 to 2016 and identified the most dominant variables affecting eto 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data the study sites are located in the north of the state of mato grosso brazil fig 1 climatic data were obtained using meteorological stations from the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet located in four municipalities canarana gleba celeste sinop matupá and são josé do rio claro we collected meteorological data between 2000 and 2016 however canarana was the only location with a full data set without any errors along our study period são josé do rio claro and gleba celeste stations presented errors in 2016 and the latter had errors in 2015 as well the data set from matupá station presented many errors from 2000 to 2003 therefore the study period for this station was shorter 2004 2016 we did not consider those years with significant gaps in the meteorological measurements these areas are classified according to the köppen climate classification as tropical semi humid with dry winters and wet summers aw alvares et al 2013 the average monthly temperature is above 18 c and the dry season is between fall and winter while the wet season is between spring and summer souza et al 2013 the north of mato grosso is located within an area with occurrence of both cerrado and amazonia biomes the production of soy and corn are the main agricultural activities of this region each location presents different land use and cover in their surroundings mainly grasslands and pastures surround canarana and matupá even though the former location is close to the cerrado and agro pastoral lands while the latter is the northern region of mato grosso state where the vegetation is denser gleba celeste is located next to sinop the city with the fourth highest population of the state which is surrounded by a transitional forest area mixed with croplands the são josé do rio claro station is placed near native forest areas pastures and farmlands eto was estimated using the penman monteith equation eq 1 following food and agriculture organization fao guidelines allen et al 1998 this method was tested globally and can be used at any climate and land use without local corrections droogers and allen 2002 gong et al 2006

stations do not provide net radiation data but it is possible to collect daily sunshine hours therefore we estimated rn following the guidelines given by fao when climatic data is missing allen et al 1998 to estimate rn we computed solar radiation rg clear sky solar radiation rso net shortwave radiation rns and net longwave radiation rnl to estimate rg using photoperiod data we used eq 3 3 r g a n

aridity is mainly induced when the evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation aridity is the climate characteristic that describes the insufficiency of precipitation to maintain vegetation the degree of aridity of a region depends on the quantity of water from precipitation and water loss from evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 defined aridity index as the difference between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation over potential evapotranspiration eq 7 7 ai et o p et o where ai is the aridity index eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm and p is the precipitation mm 2 3 data processing and trending analysis we used the mann kendall test to identify trends on the meteorological data kendall 1975 mann 1945 this test is a non parametric method used to determine if the time series has a significant temporal trend salviano et al 2016 recent studies have used this method to assess temporal trends on eto cabral júnior et al 2019 dinpashoh et al 2018 li et al 2021 the mann kendall variable s for a series containing n data is calculated from eq 8 8 s i j n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where xj and xi are sequential data and 9 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 if x j x i 1 if x j

number of ties of extent m then we estimated the z values eq 12 12 z s 1 var s se s 0 0 se s 0 s 1 var s se s 0 since it is a two tailed test to reject the null hypothesis h0 the absolute value of z must be higher than p value therefore the trend is significant if z p value we used the pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the relation between eto and the input variables the pearson correlation analysis was used to express the relation between the input variables n tmax tmin ur and u2 and the variability of eto the correlation coefficient assumes a linear association between the input data and the resultant variable i e changes in one variable always cause constant variations in the mean value of the other variable the absolute value of the coefficient must never exceed 1 being 1 a perfect positive correlation and 1 a perfect negative one wright 1921 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use and cover changes fig 2 presents the changes in land cover and land use in the surroundings of each meteorological station in 2000 and 2014 respectively the land use around canarana did not present substantial changes throughout the study period only a few replacements of pastures and a small forest area in croplands gleba celeste surroundings presented decreasing in forest areas and increasing in croplands matupá region did not show many land cover changes only minor changes of forest area into pastures and small increases in urban areas similar to gleba celeste the land use around são josé do rio claro showed reduction in forest area being replaced by pastures 3 2 seasonal behavior of p eto and ai fig 3 presents the mean monthly accumulated rainfall p reference evapotranspiration eto and aridity index ai rainfall and aridity index presented seasonal patterns as expected however eto besides showing a small seasonality the fluctuations were less abrupt than p and ai the wet period for all four locations was between the last months of the year and the beginning of the next year for the stations located in canarana and matupá february was the month with higher mean rainfall 354 5 148 8 and 330 6 111 7 mm month 1 respectively for gleba celeste and são josé do rio claro the higher mean monthly p values were in january with average values sd of 327 8 94 3 and 352 5 125 3 mm month 1 the period with lower rainfall depth for all four locations was from may to september with mean monthly p below 100 mm month 1 during these months aridity index values varied close to 1 0 during the dryer months may september for all the locations while the lower values were detected usually between october and march presenting negative values the lowest values of ai in canarana gleba celeste and matupá were found in february respectively 2 14 2 10 and 2 20 in são josé do rio claro the lowest aridity index value was 2 77 found in january these negative values indicate that p was far higher than eto the peak ai value for canarana was detected in august 0 98 while in gleba celeste it was found in june 0 96 the highest airidy index values for both matupá and são josé do rio claro were found in july respectively 0 98 and 0 97 according to zhang et al 2015 when ai values are close to 1 the aridity is classified as medium to high since the study area is located in one of the brazilian agricultural borders therefore land use and land cover changes over the time are expected lopes et al 2016 detected drying trends in the southern amazon basin over the last four decades therefore future studies considering climatic projections would provide a better understanding of temporal drought patterns especially during those months with higher aridity index 3 3 interannual variation and climatic variable trends accumulated annual eto values from 2000 to 2016 for the four locations are presented in fig 4 linear regressions indicated that the accumulated annual eto in canarana and são josé do rio claro presented negative trends however only the canarana station showed a significant trend according to the mann kendall test decreasing about 8 40 mm per year with z 0 25 and p value 0 174 for gleba celeste and matupá the linear regressions showed positive slopes for annual eto values although their trends were not significant our results differ from those pointed out by mcvicar et al 2012 which mostly found decreasing trends in many different regions around the globe especially in china and india with and average trend of 1 31 mm year 1 dinpashoh et al 2011 found similar results in agricultural areas in iran in brazil cabral júnior et al 2019 detected a reduction of eto between 14 5 and 7 7 mm year 1 in irrigated agricultural areas in the semiarid region for better understanding of the seasonal variation of the climatic variables we performed monthly trend analysis for the four locations as well the tables regarding monthly trends are presented in the supplementary material supplementary table 1 even though yearly accumulated eto in canarana presented a negative trend fig 4a only the driest months june july and august presented the same behavior with significant negative trends in gleba celeste eto presented significant trends only in three months which march and july showed positive slopes while october presented a negative one we observed significant positive trends of eto for the matupá location in february april may and december and a significant negative trend in june for the são josé do rio claro station eto presented significant trends in three months showing negative slopes in may and november while in september the trend was negative the interannual fluctuations of tmax fig 5 presented significant positive trends for all locations varying between 0 05 and 0 07 c year 1 which represents an increase in maximum air temperature about 0 85 c during the study period vourlitis et al 2014 found similar results for transitional forests in southern amazonia inferring those increases in mean annual temperature to the effects of deforestation in agronomic practices maximum air temperature plays a vital role throughout the year during the germination period especially for fruit plants species the increase of maximum temperature can be extremely dangerous during the process of vernalization silva et al 2005 vernalization is a process in which the plants are exposed to low temperatures since the germination until the formation of stalks which are necessary for the production of fruits oliveira and scivittaro 2009 for plants the effects of high temperatures associated with other meteorological variables such as elevated relative air humidity make the environment favorable for pathogenic microorganisms development which can result in some damages to the vegetation santos et al 2010 tmax in canarana presented significant trends in seven months january february june july and from september to november which are all positive for gleba celeste there were significant trends in nine months with negative slopes detected in november and december and increasing trends in february march and between may and september similar to canarana all of the significant trends in matupá were positive and they were detected in march and from june to october for the são josé do rio claro location tmax presented significant positive trends in july september and october and a decrease in november salviano et al 2016 found similar results presenting positive trends of mean air temperature in the southern amazon basin in 10 months for minimum air temperature fig 6 the stations located in canarana gleba celeste and matupá showed significant positive trends the annual increasings for these locations were 0 03 for canarana 0 06 for gleba celeste and 0 07 c for matupá even though são josé do rio claro presented a negative trend it was not significant the effects of temperature can be observed in every stage of plant growth for example rice crops are responsive to changes in minimum temperature reflecting in yield losses peng et al 2004 observed that in 25 years the increase of minimum temperature in 1 c decreased the rice yield in 10 at least similar to the maximum temperature monthly trends the canarana station presented significant tmin trends in seven months all of them positive however those months were from march to june and between september and november the significant minimum air temperature trends in gleba celeste were positive presented from march to october except in july which did not present a significant trend for the matupá location the significant trends were all positive as well and they were detected between february and july september and october different from the maximum temperature data in são josé do rio claro the only significant temporal trend for tmin was detected in january with a negative slope the increase of air temperature in the transition periods can result in plant diseases such as anthracnose that usually happens in regions with high rainfall depth and temperature and financial losses noetzold et al 2014 the increase of night temperature disturbs the assimilation and accumulation processes in plants substantially decreasing the production jagadish et al 2015 shi et al 2017 the increment of tmin can be mitigated using techniques to diminish the negative impacts for example the nitrogen application in rice shi et al 2017 waraich et al 2012 however those operations could raise considerably the production costs fig 7 presented mean annual relative humidity for each location rh data presented significant negative trends in gleba celeste matupá and são josé do rio claro between 0 2 and 0 3 year 1 which accounts for about 3 4 of relative humidity from 2000 to 2016 alencar et al 2014 obtained similar results for a grassland savanna region where the increase of relative humidity was consistent with positive trends in both maximum and minimum air temperature and consequently the mean temperature temperature changes affect directly vapor pressure deficit therefore the relative humidity tends to decrease as mean temperature increases allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2002 although the canarana station showed significant trends on both maximum and minimum temperatures rh data for this region did not show a significant trend this station presented the lower values of mean annual relative humidity varying from 65 to 77 in canarana relative humidity only presented a significant trend in december with a negative slope for the gleba celeste location rh presented significant trends only for the months of march may july and august being those two last months the driest ones of this region we detected only significant negative trends in matupá as well where there were decreases in february and between june and september in são josé do rio claro the data analysis presented significant trends in april with an increase of rh and from july to september with negative slopes for insolation data fig 8 the only station with negative trend was gleba celeste however it is not significant the other stations presented positive slopes even though only matupá showed a significant trend the matupá station demonstrated an increase of n about 0 1 h per year wang et al 2017 reported that the increase of sunshine duration in some regions from china accounted for about 60 of the increase of eto despite the weight on the variability of reference evapotranspiration insolation also influences plant growth and development sunshine duration affects significantly the agricultural yield especially grain farming das et al 2015 period and duration of flowering silva et al 2018 and accumulation of biomass hicks 1978 for the canarana location only july and august showed significant trends of n with positive slopes in gleba celeste the months with significant negative trends were april august and october while march and july presented significant positive trends for sunshine duration temporal trends for sunshine duration in matupá were significant and positive in february august and september in são josé do rio claro the trends were significant and positive in january june august september and december the linear regressions of wind speed fig 9 presented negative trends for all the locations and only the são josé do rio claro station did not show a significant trend the other stations presented decreases on u2 varying from 0 018 to 0 062 m s 1 year 1 vautard et al 2010 pointed out that vegetation growth and urbanization are the main reasons for wind speed reduction also known as wind stilling however we observed the negative trends with an increase of pastures and croplands in the study area especially in gleba celeste several studies observed the wind speed as one of the most sensitive climatic variables regarding eto araújo et al 2017 irmak et al 2006 lemos filho et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2016a wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 assessed the contribution of each meteorological variable in the fluctuations of reference evapotranspiration for china and stated that u2 accounted for about 60 of the eto values in canarana wind speed was the variable significant trends for almost all month except january and march where trends of u2 were positive in february and april and negative from may to december the gleba celeste station presented even more months with significant trends of u2 than canarana showing significant trends from january to november which the only positive trends were detected in february and september for the matupá location we detected significant negative trends in five months april july and from august to october for u2 the only month with significant trend for the são josé do rio claro station was november with a negative slope fig 10 shows rainfall data for the locations between 2000 and 2016 in canarana and gleba celeste the trends were positive however the trend was significant only for the latter station with an increase of 34 3 mm year 1 for matupá and são josé do rio claro stations the linear regressions presented non significant negative trends our results were similar to those found by silva junior et al 2018 which used remote sensing and detected significant positive trends for annual rainfall in mato grosso especially in central northern and eastern parts where the study area is located however almeida et al 2017 used meteorological station data from 1973 to 2013 and the authors did not observe significant rainfall trends in gleba celeste von randow et al 2019 projected rainfall over a legal amazon region and observed that land cover and land use changes present fewer effects on precipitation than climate changes although rainfall in canarana did not present significant trends during the wet season between november and march we observed positive significant trends in may and june when there is a transition between wet and dry season for the gleba celeste station rainfall presented a significant negative trend in july and significant increase in august october and november p trends in matupá were significant in august october and november however only the last month presented an increase in são josé do rio claro we detected significant trends in february november and december being the latter the only month with a negative trend 3 4 linear correlation between reference evapotranspiration and the meteorological variables table 1 presents the correlation coefficient of the linear regressions between eto and the meteorological variables in the four locations in canarana the correlation between eto and n presented the higher correlation coefficient r 0 53 for canarana station sunshine duration is the main variable to estimate rg eq 3 and according to chang 1968 solar radiation is considered the climate element that affects the most eto estimates valle júnior et al 2020 pointed out radiation based methods are suitable alternative models to estimate eto in some brazilian cerrado regions when the penman monteith inputs are missing pearson correlations for n and tmax for gleba celeste were 0 65 and 0 61 respectively relative humidity presented good correlation when compared to other locations r 0 50 for the matupá station linear correlation results for sunshine duration and maximum temperature presented correlation coefficients of 0 67 and 0 56 respectively the increase of photoperiod contributes directly to increases in air temperature causing higher vapor pressure deficit values and consequently higher evaporative demand pereira et al 2002 according to xing et al 2016 n was the meteorological variable that affected the most of eto estimates in southern china presenting a correlation coefficient of 0 87 when compared reference evapotranspiration and photoperiod in são josé do rio claro sunshine duration maximum temperature and relative humidity presented the highest correlations n presented r 0 85 the higher correlation coefficient of the study period the same behavior was partly observed in a tropical forest region by caixeta 2009 where the highest correlation coefficients between eto and other meteorological variables were considering solar radiation and maximum air temperature even though n only presented a significant trend in matupá z 0 382 p value 0 036 photoperiod presented the highest correlation coefficients when compared to the other variables between the four locations 0 53 0 65 0 67 and 0 85 those results show that sunshine duration is the variable affecting eto the most for the different studied conditions irmak et al 2006 observed that eto was most sensitive to vapor pressure deficit and wind speed in different regions of the united states according to wang et al 2017 n was the variable with higher linear correlation compared with reference evapotranspiration in five of nine different locations in china similar to our findings generally the evapotranspiration process is determined by the energy available to evaporate water therefore solar radiation is the most important energy source in the planet to this kind of process allen et al 1998 controlling the water exchange dynamics between surface and atmosphere 4 conclusions in the present study we evaluate the changes in reference evapotranspiration and other meteorological variables that affect eto over four different land uses in northern mato grosso brazil the measurements were carried out from 2000 to 2016 and the temporal trends were detected by a non parametric mann kendall test this is the first study to assess the temporal trend changes in eto data in the southern amazon basin notably at least two of the analyzed variables presented significant trends in the four locations however only maximum air temperature tmax presented significant positive trends in all of them maximum temperature has increased about 0 05 c per year totalizing an increase of approximately 0 85 c during the study period eto showed a significant trend only in canarana with a negative slope varying 8 4 mm year 1 reducing about 134 4 mm between 2000 and 2016 the variable that affected eto the most in all the locations was the sunshine duration n which presented a moderate to strong correlation coefficient between 0 53 and 0 85 wind speed and minimum temperature presented the lower pearson coefficients implying that these two variables do not affect eto as well as the other variables in the southern amazon basin even though the four stations are located in regions with high yearly rainfall depth the driest months presented aridity index values similar to desert regions about 1 0 characterizing the aridity as medium to high this aridity negatively affects the implantation of cultures during the winter in the northern mato grosso region due to the expansion of anthropogenic activities and climate change in the study area we recommend

10114,due to the expansion of agricultural borders land use and land cover changes in the southern part of the brazilian amazon have been altering water and energy balances over the last decades still brazilian agriculture for the most part depends on rainfall to supply the water needs of crops and evapotranspiration is the main mean of water transferring in the form of vapor to the process of cloud formation and consequently rains reference evapotranspiration eto is a climatic variable with great potential to indicate climate changes which can be used to detect temporal trends and calculate aridity index ai thus the general objective is to analyze the behavior of the reference evapotranspiration and the components used to estimate it in contrast to the land use in four locations in the north of mato grosso state brazil in the southern amazon basin the main factors related to possible changes in eto over a mean period of 20 years were evaluated identifying trends for the data set studied eto sunshine duration air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation and the correlation r between reference evapotranspiration and the other variables besides the behavior of the ai was analyzed to observe the degree of rainfall insufficiency to maintain the soil in humidity conditions suitable for plant development to identify how significant the trends were we used the mann kendall trend analysis and linear regression analysis we found at least two different significant trends for each location the reference evapotranspiration showed a significant trend only in the station located in the municipality of canarana with a negative trend varying 8 4 mm per year the aridity index for the driest months of the year presented values close to 1 characterizing the region as medium to high aridity the variable that most influenced the eto variability was the insolation keywords trend analysis evapotranspiration aridity index precipitation hydrological cycle 1 introduction tropical forests play an important role in climate control and water and energy exchanges between surface and atmosphere meir and grace 2005 however temporal variations of rainfall depth and duration of dry seasons can highly affect energy exchange dynamics especially the net radiation partitioning between latent and sensible heat fluxes da rocha et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2014 2013 valle júnior et al 2020 vourlitis et al 2014 2008 forests mosaics in center amazonia generally present small variations in evapotranspiration rates due to some factors such as little variability of precipitation and seasonal variations in available energy and evaporative demand da rocha et al 2009 machado et al 2004 malhi et al 2002 while tropical savannas and transitional forests typically show high variations between dry and wet seasons in evapotranspiration rates as a result of abrupt changes in rainfall depth rodrigues et al 2014 vourlitis and da rocha 2011 these sudden interseasonal changes in tropical regions have been intensified over the last decades due to climate changes davidson et al 2012 gatti et al 2014 li et al 2021 phillips et al 2009 despite the impacts caused by climate changes the amazon basin has been widely affected by land use and land cover changes lucc such as monoculture farming and natural resources extractions over the last forty decades davidson et al 2012 walker et al 2000 the conversion from native forest to monocultures and pastures decreases evapotranspiration and soil water recharge and increases fast fluxes responses in the basin bruijnzeel 1991 lathuillière et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2016b on the other hand secondary forests growing in deforested areas present large evaporative fractions giambelluca 2002 and higher evaporative rates than primary forests von randow et al 2017 the impacts on hydrological cycle due to climate changes associated to lucc affect the availability of water resources causing consequences in environmental systems such as prolonged and severe droughts aragão et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 therefore these effects must be carefully studied to improve hydrologic planning and management even though culture homogeneity and scale strongly influence the regional water cycle d almeida et al 2007 reference evapotranspiration eto plays an important role in irrigation planning and can be considered as the atmospheric evaporative demand allen et al 1998 which is affected by changes in wind speed relative humidity air temperature and sunshine duration the meteorological variable that affects eto the most differs between different regions of the world jabloun and sahli 2008 salam et al 2020 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 valle júnior et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 jhajharia et al 2012 found out that wind speed and relative humidity are more important than temperature on eto estimates in northeast india while valle júnior et al 2020 observed that those two variables were the most insignificant variables for reference evapotranspiration in the brazilian cerrado temperature based eto models are more suitable in arid and semi arid environments than in humid conditions sentelhas et al 2010 tabari 2010 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 in addition recently several machine learning models have been used to estimate eto ferreira et al 2019 jing et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 valle júnior et al 2020 and pan evaporation ali ghorbani et al 2018 qasem et al 2019 which can be used to estimate eto with optimal input combinations spatial and temporal trend analysis could lead to a better understanding about how climate changes affect eto estimates several studies presented trend analyses of eto and the meteorological variables used to estimate reference evapotranspiration and the results were diverse in different climates and land covers chu et al 2017 dinpashoh et al 2011 feng et al 2017 huo et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 mcvicar et al 2012 reviewed eto rates and its variation worldwide in addition they pointed out that 20 of 26 studies about eto trends presented decreasing rates with an average of 1 31 mm year 1 however the review did not present studies about the brazilian amazon rainforest considering the importance of the brazilian amazon and the constant replacement of native vegetation over the last decades especially in the south region of this biome it is important to be aware of the effects of climate change on southern amazonia evaluating changes in eto could lead to a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic activities in the southern amazon basin our main goals were to estimate and assess temporal trends changes in reference evapotranspiration and the main climatic variables that affect eto rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity and insolation in four different land uses in southern amazonia this study was the first to evaluate temporal trends of reference evapotranspiration in southern amazonia we detected the trends using the mann kendall non parametric test using meteorological data from 2000 to 2016 and identified the most dominant variables affecting eto 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data the study sites are located in the north of the state of mato grosso brazil fig 1 climatic data were obtained using meteorological stations from the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet located in four municipalities canarana gleba celeste sinop matupá and são josé do rio claro we collected meteorological data between 2000 and 2016 however canarana was the only location with a full data set without any errors along our study period são josé do rio claro and gleba celeste stations presented errors in 2016 and the latter had errors in 2015 as well the data set from matupá station presented many errors from 2000 to 2003 therefore the study period for this station was shorter 2004 2016 we did not consider those years with significant gaps in the meteorological measurements these areas are classified according to the köppen climate classification as tropical semi humid with dry winters and wet summers aw alvares et al 2013 the average monthly temperature is above 18 c and the dry season is between fall and winter while the wet season is between spring and summer souza et al 2013 the north of mato grosso is located within an area with occurrence of both cerrado and amazonia biomes the production of soy and corn are the main agricultural activities of this region each location presents different land use and cover in their surroundings mainly grasslands and pastures surround canarana and matupá even though the former location is close to the cerrado and agro pastoral lands while the latter is the northern region of mato grosso state where the vegetation is denser gleba celeste is located next to sinop the city with the fourth highest population of the state which is surrounded by a transitional forest area mixed with croplands the são josé do rio claro station is placed near native forest areas pastures and farmlands eto was estimated using the penman monteith equation eq 1 following food and agriculture organization fao guidelines allen et al 1998 this method was tested globally and can be used at any climate and land use without local corrections droogers and allen 2002 gong et al 2006

vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the wind speed data were collected 10 m above ground level to adjust the wind for data at 2 m height we used eq 2 2 u 2 u z 4

stations do not provide net radiation data but it is possible to collect daily sunshine hours therefore we estimated rn following the guidelines given by fao when climatic data is missing allen et al 1998 to estimate rn we computed solar radiation rg clear sky solar radiation rso net shortwave radiation rns and net longwave radiation rnl to estimate rg using photoperiod data we used eq 3 3 r g a n

a and b are regression constants allen et al 1998 suggests the values a 0 25 and b 0 50 when no solar radiation data are available and no calibration has been carried out for improved regression constants when n n we consider rg rso we estimated rns using eq 4 4 r ns 1 a r g where rns is the net shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 α is the albedo which is 0 23 for the hypothetical grass

aridity is mainly induced when the evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation aridity is the climate characteristic that describes the insufficiency of precipitation to maintain vegetation the degree of aridity of a region depends on the quantity of water from precipitation and water loss from evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 defined aridity index as the difference between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation over potential evapotranspiration eq 7 7 ai et o p et o where ai is the aridity index eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm and p is the precipitation mm 2 3 data processing and trending analysis we used the mann kendall test to identify trends on the meteorological data kendall 1975 mann 1945 this test is a non parametric method used to determine if the time series has a significant temporal trend salviano et al 2016 recent studies have used this method to assess temporal trends on eto cabral júnior et al 2019 dinpashoh et al 2018 li et al 2021 the mann kendall variable s for a series containing n data is calculated from eq 8 8 s i j n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where xj and xi are sequential data and 9 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 if x j x i 1 if x j x i when n 8 the variable s approximates to a normal distribution with mean and variance according to eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 mean s 0 11 var s n n 1 2 n 5 m 1 n t m m 1 2 m 5 18 where tm is the number of ties of extent m then we estimated the z values eq 12 12 z s 1 var s se s 0 0 se s 0 s 1 var s se s 0 since it is a two tailed test to reject the null hypothesis h0 the absolute value of z must be higher than p value therefore the trend is significant if z p value we used the pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate the relation between eto and the input variables the pearson correlation analysis was used to express the relation between the input variables n tmax tmin ur and u2 and the variability of eto the correlation coefficient assumes a linear association between the input data and the resultant variable i e changes in one variable always cause constant variations in the mean value of the other variable the absolute value of the coefficient must never exceed 1 being 1 a perfect positive correlation and 1 a perfect negative one wright 1921 3 results and discussion 3 1 land use and cover changes fig 2 presents the changes in land cover and land use in the surroundings of each meteorological station in 2000 and 2014 respectively the land use around canarana did not present substantial changes throughout the study period only a few replacements of pastures and a small forest area in croplands gleba celeste surroundings presented decreasing in forest areas and increasing in croplands matupá region did not show many land cover changes only minor changes of forest area into pastures and small increases in urban areas similar to gleba celeste the land use around são josé do rio claro showed reduction in forest area being replaced by pastures 3 2 seasonal behavior of p eto and ai fig 3 presents the mean monthly accumulated rainfall p reference evapotranspiration eto and aridity index ai rainfall and aridity index presented seasonal patterns as expected however eto besides showing a small seasonality the fluctuations were less abrupt than p and ai the wet period for all four locations was between the last months of the year and the beginning of the next year for the stations located in canarana and matupá february was the month with higher mean rainfall 354 5 148 8 and 330 6 111 7 mm month 1 respectively for gleba celeste and são josé do rio claro the higher mean monthly p values were in january with average values sd of 327 8 94 3 and 352 5 125 3 mm month 1 the period with lower rainfall depth for all four locations was from may to september with mean monthly p below 100 mm month 1 during these months aridity index values varied close to 1 0 during the dryer months may september for all the locations while the lower values were detected usually between october and march presenting negative values the lowest values of ai in canarana gleba celeste and matupá were found in february respectively 2 14 2 10 and 2 20 in são josé do rio claro the lowest aridity index value was 2 77 found in january these negative values indicate that p was far higher than eto the peak ai value for canarana was detected in august 0 98 while in gleba celeste it was found in june 0 96 the highest airidy index values for both matupá and são josé do rio claro were found in july respectively 0 98 and 0 97 according to zhang et al 2015 when ai values are close to 1 the aridity is classified as medium to high since the study area is located in one of the brazilian agricultural borders therefore land use and land cover changes over the time are expected lopes et al 2016 detected drying trends in the southern amazon basin over the last four decades therefore future studies considering climatic projections would provide a better understanding of temporal drought patterns especially during those months with higher aridity index 3 3 interannual variation and climatic variable trends accumulated annual eto values from 2000 to 2016 for the four locations are presented in fig 4 linear regressions indicated that the accumulated annual eto in canarana and são josé do rio claro presented negative trends however only the canarana station showed a significant trend according to the mann kendall test decreasing about 8 40 mm per year with z 0 25 and p value 0 174 for gleba celeste and matupá the linear regressions showed positive slopes for annual eto values although their trends were not significant our results differ from those pointed out by mcvicar et al 2012 which mostly found decreasing trends in many different regions around the globe especially in china and india with and average trend of 1 31 mm year 1 dinpashoh et al 2011 found similar results in agricultural areas in iran in brazil cabral júnior et al 2019 detected a reduction of eto between 14 5 and 7 7 mm year 1 in irrigated agricultural areas in the semiarid region for better understanding of the seasonal variation of the climatic variables we performed monthly trend analysis for the four locations as well the tables regarding monthly trends are presented in the supplementary material supplementary table 1 even though yearly accumulated eto in canarana presented a negative trend fig 4a only the driest months june july and august presented the same behavior with significant negative trends in gleba celeste eto presented significant trends only in three months which march and july showed positive slopes while october presented a negative one we observed significant positive trends of eto for the matupá location in february april may and december and a significant negative trend in june for the são josé do rio claro station eto presented significant trends in three months showing negative slopes in may and november while in september the trend was negative the interannual fluctuations of tmax fig 5 presented significant positive trends for all locations varying between 0 05 and 0 07 c year 1 which represents an increase in maximum air temperature about 0 85 c during the study period vourlitis et al 2014 found similar results for transitional forests in southern amazonia inferring those increases in mean annual temperature to the effects of deforestation in agronomic practices maximum air temperature plays a vital role throughout the year during the germination period especially for fruit plants species the increase of maximum temperature can be extremely dangerous during the process of vernalization silva et al 2005 vernalization is a process in which the plants are exposed to low temperatures since the germination until the formation of stalks which are necessary for the production of fruits oliveira and scivittaro 2009 for plants the effects of high temperatures associated with other meteorological variables such as elevated relative air humidity make the environment favorable for pathogenic microorganisms development which can result in some damages to the vegetation santos et al 2010 tmax in canarana presented significant trends in seven months january february june july and from september to november which are all positive for gleba celeste there were significant trends in nine months with negative slopes detected in november and december and increasing trends in february march and between may and september similar to canarana all of the significant trends in matupá were positive and they were detected in march and from june to october for the são josé do rio claro location tmax presented significant positive trends in july september and october and a decrease in november salviano et al 2016 found similar results presenting positive trends of mean air temperature in the southern amazon basin in 10 months for minimum air temperature fig 6 the stations located in canarana gleba celeste and matupá showed significant positive trends the annual increasings for these locations were 0 03 for canarana 0 06 for gleba celeste and 0 07 c for matupá even though são josé do rio claro presented a negative trend it was not significant the effects of temperature can be observed in every stage of plant growth for example rice crops are responsive to changes in minimum temperature reflecting in yield losses peng et al 2004 observed that in 25 years the increase of minimum temperature in 1 c decreased the rice yield in 10 at least similar to the maximum temperature monthly trends the canarana station presented significant tmin trends in seven months all of them positive however those months were from march to june and between september and november the significant minimum air temperature trends in gleba celeste were positive presented from march to october except in july which did not present a significant trend for the matupá location the significant trends were all positive as well and they were detected between february and july september and october different from the maximum temperature data in são josé do rio claro the only significant temporal trend for tmin was detected in january with a negative slope the increase of air temperature in the transition periods can result in plant diseases such as anthracnose that usually happens in regions with high rainfall depth and temperature and financial losses noetzold et al 2014 the increase of night temperature disturbs the assimilation and accumulation processes in plants substantially decreasing the production jagadish et al 2015 shi et al 2017 the increment of tmin can be mitigated using techniques to diminish the negative impacts for example the nitrogen application in rice shi et al 2017 waraich et al 2012 however those operations could raise considerably the production costs fig 7 presented mean annual relative humidity for each location rh data presented significant negative trends in gleba celeste matupá and são josé do rio claro between 0 2 and 0 3 year 1 which accounts for about 3 4 of relative humidity from 2000 to 2016 alencar et al 2014 obtained similar results for a grassland savanna region where the increase of relative humidity was consistent with positive trends in both maximum and minimum air temperature and consequently the mean temperature temperature changes affect directly vapor pressure deficit therefore the relative humidity tends to decrease as mean temperature increases allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2002 although the canarana station showed significant trends on both maximum and minimum temperatures rh data for this region did not show a significant trend this station presented the lower values of mean annual relative humidity varying from 65 to 77 in canarana relative humidity only presented a significant trend in december with a negative slope for the gleba celeste location rh presented significant trends only for the months of march may july and august being those two last months the driest ones of this region we detected only significant negative trends in matupá as well where there were decreases in february and between june and september in são josé do rio claro the data analysis presented significant trends in april with an increase of rh and from july to september with negative slopes for insolation data fig 8 the only station with negative trend was gleba celeste however it is not significant the other stations presented positive slopes even though only matupá showed a significant trend the matupá station demonstrated an increase of n about 0 1 h per year wang et al 2017 reported that the increase of sunshine duration in some regions from china accounted for about 60 of the increase of eto despite the weight on the variability of reference evapotranspiration insolation also influences plant growth and development sunshine duration affects significantly the agricultural yield especially grain farming das et al 2015 period and duration of flowering silva et al 2018 and accumulation of biomass hicks 1978 for the canarana location only july and august showed significant trends of n with positive slopes in gleba celeste the months with significant negative trends were april august and october while march and july presented significant positive trends for sunshine duration temporal trends for sunshine duration in matupá were significant and positive in february august and september in são josé do rio claro the trends were significant and positive in january june august september and december the linear regressions of wind speed fig 9 presented negative trends for all the locations and only the são josé do rio claro station did not show a significant trend the other stations presented decreases on u2 varying from 0 018 to 0 062 m s 1 year 1 vautard et al 2010 pointed out that vegetation growth and urbanization are the main reasons for wind speed reduction also known as wind stilling however we observed the negative trends with an increase of pastures and croplands in the study area especially in gleba celeste several studies observed the wind speed as one of the most sensitive climatic variables regarding eto araújo et al 2017 irmak et al 2006 lemos filho et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2016a wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 assessed the contribution of each meteorological variable in the fluctuations of reference evapotranspiration for china and stated that u2 accounted for about 60 of the eto values in canarana wind speed was the variable significant trends for almost all month except january and march where trends of u2 were positive in february and april and negative from may to december the gleba celeste station presented even more months with significant trends of u2 than canarana showing significant trends from january to november which the only positive trends were detected in february and september for the matupá location we detected significant negative trends in five months april july and from august to october for u2 the only month with significant trend for the são josé do rio claro station was november with a negative slope fig 10 shows rainfall data for the locations between 2000 and 2016 in canarana and gleba celeste the trends were positive however the trend was significant only for the latter station with an increase of 34 3 mm year 1 for matupá and são josé do rio claro stations the linear regressions presented non significant negative trends our results were similar to those found by silva junior et al 2018 which used remote sensing and detected significant positive trends for annual rainfall in mato grosso especially in central northern and eastern parts where the study area is located however almeida et al 2017 used meteorological station data from 1973 to 2013 and the authors did not observe significant rainfall trends in gleba celeste von randow et al 2019 projected rainfall over a legal amazon region and observed that land cover and land use changes present fewer effects on precipitation than climate changes although rainfall in canarana did not present significant trends during the wet season between november and march we observed positive significant trends in may and june when there is a transition between wet and dry season for the gleba celeste station rainfall presented a significant negative trend in july and significant increase in august october and november p trends in matupá were significant in august october and november however only the last month presented an increase in são josé do rio claro we detected significant trends in february november and december being the latter the only month with a negative trend 3 4 linear correlation between reference evapotranspiration and the meteorological variables table 1 presents the correlation coefficient of the linear regressions between eto and the meteorological variables in the four locations in canarana the correlation between eto and n presented the higher correlation coefficient r 0 53 for canarana station sunshine duration is the main variable to estimate rg eq 3 and according to chang 1968 solar radiation is considered the climate element that affects the most eto estimates valle júnior et al 2020 pointed out radiation based methods are suitable alternative models to estimate eto in some brazilian cerrado regions when the penman monteith inputs are missing pearson correlations for n and tmax for gleba celeste were 0 65 and 0 61 respectively relative humidity presented good correlation when compared to other locations r 0 50 for the matupá station linear correlation results for sunshine duration and maximum temperature presented correlation coefficients of 0 67 and 0 56 respectively the increase of photoperiod contributes directly to increases in air temperature causing higher vapor pressure deficit values and consequently higher evaporative demand pereira et al 2002 according to xing et al 2016 n was the meteorological variable that affected the most of eto estimates in southern china presenting a correlation coefficient of 0 87 when compared reference evapotranspiration and photoperiod in são josé do rio claro sunshine duration maximum temperature and relative humidity presented the highest correlations n presented r 0 85 the higher correlation coefficient of the study period the same behavior was partly observed in a tropical forest region by caixeta 2009 where the highest correlation coefficients between eto and other meteorological variables were considering solar radiation and maximum air temperature even though n only presented a significant trend in matupá z 0 382 p value 0 036 photoperiod presented the highest correlation coefficients when compared to the other variables between the four locations 0 53 0 65 0 67 and 0 85 those results show that sunshine duration is the variable affecting eto the most for the different studied conditions irmak et al 2006 observed that eto was most sensitive to vapor pressure deficit and wind speed in different regions of the united states according to wang et al 2017 n was the variable with higher linear correlation compared with reference evapotranspiration in five of nine different locations in china similar to our findings generally the evapotranspiration process is determined by the energy available to evaporate water therefore solar radiation is the most important energy source in the planet to this kind of process allen et al 1998 controlling the water exchange dynamics between surface and atmosphere 4 conclusions in the present study we evaluate the changes in reference evapotranspiration and other meteorological variables that affect eto over four different land uses in northern mato grosso brazil the measurements were carried out from 2000 to 2016 and the temporal trends were detected by a non parametric mann kendall test this is the first study to assess the temporal trend changes in eto data in the southern amazon basin notably at least two of the analyzed variables presented significant trends in the four locations however only maximum air temperature tmax presented significant positive trends in all of them maximum temperature has increased about 0 05 c per year totalizing an increase of approximately 0 85 c during the study period eto showed a significant trend only in canarana with a negative slope varying 8 4 mm year 1 reducing about 134 4 mm between 2000 and 2016 the variable that affected eto the most in all the locations was the sunshine duration n which presented a moderate to strong correlation coefficient between 0 53 and 0 85 wind speed and minimum temperature presented the lower pearson coefficients implying that these two variables do not affect eto as well as the other variables in the southern amazon basin even though the four stations are located in regions with high yearly rainfall depth the driest months presented aridity index values similar to desert regions about 1 0 characterizing the aridity as medium to high this aridity negatively affects the implantation of cultures during the winter in the northern mato grosso region due to the expansion of anthropogenic activities and climate change in the study area we recommend
